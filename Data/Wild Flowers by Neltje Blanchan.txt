wild flowers
an aid to knowledge of our wild flowers and their insect visitors
by neltje blanchan
preface
surely a foreword of explanation is called for from one who has
the temerity to offer a surfeited public still another book on
wild flowers inasmuch as science has proved that almost every
blossom in the world is everything it is because of its necessity
to attract insect friends or to repel its foes  its form
mechanism color markings odor time of opening and closing
and its season of blooming being the result of natural selection
by that special insect upon which each depends more or less
absolutely for help in perpetuating its species  it seems fully
time that the vitally important and interesting relationship
existing between our common wild flowers and their winged
benefactors should be presented in a popular book
is it enough to know merely the name of the flower you meet in
the meadow the blossom has an inner meaning hopes and fears
that inspire its brief existence a scheme of salvation for its
species in the struggle for survival that it has been slowly
perfecting with some insects help through the ages it is not a
passive thing to be admired by human eyes nor does it waste its
sweetness on the desert air it is a sentient being impelled to
act intelligently through the same strong desires that animate
us and endowed with certain powers differing only in degree but
not in kind from those of the animal creation desire ever
creates form
do you doubt it then study the mechanism of one of our common
orchids or milkweeds that are adjusted with such marvelous
delicacy to the length of a bees tongue or of a butterflys leg
learn why so many flowers have sticky calices or protective
hairs why the skunk cabbage purple trillium and carrion flower
emit a fetid odor while other flowers especially the white or
pale yellow night bloomers charm with their delicious breath
see if you cannot discover why the immigrant daisy already
whitens our fields with descendants as numerous as the sands of
the seashore whereas you may tramp a whole day without finding a
single native ladies slipper what of the sundew that not only
catches insects but secretes gastric juice to digest them what
of the bladderwort in whose inflated traps tiny crustaceans are
imprisoned or the pitcher plant that makes soup of its guests
why are gnats and flies seen about certain flowers bees
butterflies moths or humming birds about others each visitor
choosing the restaurant most to his liking with what infinite
pains the wants of each guest are catered to how relentlessly
are pilferers punished the endless devices of the more ambitious
flowers to save their species from degeneracy by close inbreeding
through fertilization with their own pollen alone prove the
operation of mind through them how plants travel how they send
seeds abroad in the world to found new colonies might be studied
with profit by anglosaxon expansionists do vice and virtue
exist side by side in the vegetable world also yes and every
sinner is branded as surely as was cain the dodder indian pipe
broomrape and beechdrops wear the floral equivalent of the
striped suit and the shaved head although claiming most
respectable and exalted kinsfolk they are degenerates not far
above the fungi in short this is a universe that we live in
and all that share the one life are one in essence for natural
law is spiritual law through nature to god flowers show a way
to the scientist lacking faith
although it has been stated by evolutionists for many years that
in order to know the flowers their insect relationships must
first be understood it is believed that natures garden is the
first american work to explain them in any considerable number of
species dr asa gray william hamilton gibson clarence moores
weed and miss maud going in their delightful books or lectures
have shown the interdependence of a score or more of different
blossoms and their insect visitors hidden away in the
proceedings of scientific societies technical papers are the
invaluable observations of such men as dr william trelease of
wisconsin and professor charles robertson of illinois to the
latter especially i am glad to acknowledge my indebtedness
sprengel darwin muller delpino and lubbock among others
have given the world classical volumes on european flora only
but showing a vast array of facts which the theory of adaptation
to insects alone correlates and explains that the results of
illumining researches should be so slow in enlightening the
popular mind can be due only to the technical scientific
language used in setting them forth language as foreign to the
average reader as chinese and not to be deciphered by the
average student either without the help of a glossary these
writings as well as the vast array of popular books  too many
for individual mention  have been freely consulted after studies
made afield
to sprengel belongs the glory of first exalting flowers above the
level of botanical specimens after studying the wild geranium he
became convinced as he wrote in 1787 that the wise author of
nature has not made even a single hair without a definite design
a hundred years before one nehemias grew had said that it was
necessary for pollen to reach the stigma of a flower in order
that it might set fertile seed and linnaeus bad to come to his
rescue with conclusive evidence to convince a doubting world that
he was right sprengel made the next step forward but his
writings lay neglected over seventy years because he advanced the
then incredible and only partially true statement that a flower
is fertilized by insects which carry its pollen from its anthers
to its stigma in spite of his discoveries that the hairs within
the wild geranium protect its nectar from rain for the insect
benefactors benefit that most flowers which secrete nectar have
what he termed honey guides  spots of bright color heavy
veining or some such pathfinder for the visitor on the petals
that sometimes the male flowers the staminate ones are
separated from the seedbearing or pistillate ones on distinct
plants he left it to darwin to show that crossfertilization by
insects the transfer of pollen from one blossom to another  not
from anthers to stigma of the same flower  is the great end to
which so much marvelous floral mechanism is adapted the wind is
a wasteful uncertain pollen distributor insects transfer it
more economically especially the more highly organized and
industrious ones in a few instances hummingbirds as well
unwittingly do the flowers bidding while they feast now here
now there in spite of sprengels most patient and scientific
research that shed great light on the theory of natural
selection a half century before darwin advanced it he never knew
that flowers are nearly always sterile to pollen of another
species when carried to them on the bodies of insect visitors or
that crosspollenized blossoms defeat the selfpollinated ones in
the struggle for survival these facts darwin proved in endless
experiments
because bees depend absolutely upon flowers not only for their
own food but for that of future generations for whom they labor
because they are the most diligent of all visitors and are
rarely diverted from one species of flower to another while on
their rounds collecting as they must both nectar and pollen it
follows they are the most important fertilizing agents it is
estimated that should they perish more than half the flowers in
the world would be exterminated with them australian farmers
imported clover from europe and although they had luxuriant
fields of it no seed was set for next years planting because
they had failed to import the bumblebee after his arrival their
loss was speedily made good
ages before men cultivated gardens they had tiny helpers they
knew not of gardeners win all the glory of producing a lawson
pink or a new chrysanthemum but only for a few seasons do they
select hybridize according to their own rules of taste they
take up the work where insects left it off after countless
centuries of toil thus it is to the nightflying moth long of
tongue keen of scent that we are indebted for the deep white
fragrant easter lily for example and not to the florist albeit
the moth is in his turn indebted to the lily for the length of
his tongue and his keen nerves neither could have advanced
without the other what long vistas through the ages of creation
does not this interdependence of flowers and insects open
over five hundred flowers in this book have been classified
according to color because it is believed that the novice with
no knowledge of botany whatever can most readily identify the
specimen found afield by this method which has the added
advantage of being the simple one adopted by the higher insects
ages before books were written technicalities have been avoided
in the text wherever possible not to discourage the beginner
from entering upon one of the most enjoyable and elevating
branches of nature study the scientific names and classification
follow that method adopted by the international botanical
congress which has now superseded all others nevertheless the
titles employed by gray with which older botanists in this
country are familiar are also indicated where they differ from
the new nomenclature

let us content ourselves no longer with being mere botanists 
historians of structural facts the flowers are not mere comely
or curious vegetable creations with colors odors petals
stamens and innumerable technical attributes the wonted insight
alike of scientist philosopher theologian and dreamer is now
repudiated in the new revelation beauty is not its own excuse
for being nor was fragrance ever wasted on the desert air
the seer has at last heard and interpreted the voice in the
wilderness the flower is no longer a simple passive victim in
the busy bees sweet pillage but rather a conscious being with
hopes aspirations and companionships the insect is its
counterpart its fragrance is but a perfumed whisper of welcome
its color is as the wooing blush and rosy lip its portals are
decked for his coming and its sweet hospitalities humored to his
tarrying and as it speeds its parting affinity rests content
that its lifes consummation has been fulfilled  william
hamilton gibson
i often think when working over my plants of what linnaeus
once said of the unfolding of a blossom i saw god in his glory
passing near me and bowed my head in worship the scientific
aspect of the same thought has been put into words by tennyson
    flower in the crannied wall
     i pluck you out of the crannies
     i hold you here root and all in my hand
     little flower  but if i could understand
     what you are root and all and all in all
     i should know what god and man is
no deeper thought was ever uttered by poet for in this world of
plants which with its magician chlorophyll conjuring with
sunbeams is ceaselessly at work bringing life out of death  in
this quiet vegetable world we may find the elementary principles
of all life in almost visible operation  john fiske in
through nature to god
from blue to purple flowers
if blue is the favorite color of bees and if bees have so much
to do with the origin of flowers how is it that there are so few
blue ones i believe the explanation to be that all blue flowers
have descended from ancestors in which the flowers were green
or to speak more precisely in which the leaves surrounding the
stamens and pistil were green and that they have passed through
stages of white or yellow and generally red before becoming
blue  sir john lubbock in ants bees and wasps

britton and browne
delightful linnaeus who dearly loved his little joke himself
confesses to have named the dayflowers after three brothers
commelyn dutch botanists because two of them  commemorated in
the two showy blue petals of the blossom  published their works
the third lacking application and ambition amounted to nothing
like the inconspicuous whitish third petal happily kaspar
commelyn died in 1731 before the joke was perpetrated in
species plantarum
in the morning we find the dayflower open and alertlooking
owing to the sharp erect bracts that give it support after
noon or as soon as it has been fertilized by the female bees
that are its chief benefactors while collecting its abundant
pollen the lovely petals roll up never to open again and
quickly wilt into a wet shapeless mass which if we touch it
leaves a sticky blue fluid on our fingertips

as so very many of our blue flowers are merely naturalized
immigrants from europe it is well to know we have sent to
england at least one native that was considered fit to adorn the
grounds of hampton court john tradescant gardener to charles i
for whom the plant and its kin were named had seeds sent him by
a relative in the virginia colony and before long the deep azure
blossoms with their golden anthers were seen in gardens on both
sides of the atlantic  another one of the many instances where
the possibilities of our wild flowers under cultivation had to be
first pointed out to us by europeans
like its relative the dayflower the spiderwort opens for part of
a day only in the morning it is wide awake and pert early in
the afternoon its petals have begun to retreat within the calyx
until presently they become dissolved in tears like job or the
traditional widow what was flower only a few hours ago is now a
fluid jelly that trickles at the touch tomorrow fresh buds will
open and a continuous succession of bloom may be relied upon for
a long season since its stigma is widely separated from the
anthers and surpasses them it is probable the flower cannot
fertilize itself but is wholly dependent on the female bees and
other insects that come to it for pollen note the hairs on the
stamens provided as footholds for the bees
the plant is a cousin of the wandering jew t repens so
commonly grown either in water or earth in american
sittingrooms in a shady lane within new york city limits where
a few stems were thrown out one spring about five years ago the
entire bank is now covered with the vine that has rooted by its
hairy joints and in spite of frosts and blizzards continues to
bear its trueblue flowers throughout the summer
pickerel weed
  pontederia cordata  pickerelweed family
flowers  bright purplish blue including filaments anthers and
style crowded in a dense spike quickly fading unpleasantly
odorous perianth tubular 2lipped parted into 6 irregular
lobes free from ovary middle lobe of upper lip with 2 yellow
spots at base within stamens 6 placed at unequal distances on
tube 3 opposite each lip pistil 1 the stigma minutely toothed
stem erect stout fleshy to 4 ft tall not often over 2 ft
above water line leaves several bractlike sheathing stem at
base leaf only midway on flowerstalk thick polished
triangular or arrowshaped 4 to 8 in long 2 to 6 in across
base
preferred habitat  shallow water of ponds and streams
flowering season  juneoctober
distribution  eastern half of united states and canada
grace of habit and the bright beauty of its long blue spikes of
ragged flowers above rich glossy leaves give a charm to this
vigorous wader backwoodsmen will tell you that pickerels lay
their eggs among the leaves but so they do among the sedges
arums wild rice and various aquatic plants like many another
fish bees and flies that congregate about the blossoms to feed
may sometimes fly too low and so give a plausible reason for the
pickerels choice of haunt each blossom lasts but a single day
the upper portion withering leaves the base of the perianth to
harden about the ovary and protect the solitary seed but as the
gradually lengthened spike keeps up an uninterrupted succession
of bloom for months more than ample provision is made for the
perpetuation of the race  a necessity to any plant that refuses
to thrive unless it stands in water ponds and streams have an
unpleasant habit of drying up in summer and often the pickerel
weed looks as brown as a bulrush where it is stranded in the
baked mud in august when seed falls on such ground if indeed it
germinates at all the young plant naturally withers away
in the bulletin of the torrey botanical club mr w h leggett
who made a careful study of the flower tells that three forms
occur not on the same but on different plants being even more
distinctly trimorphic than the purple loosestrife as these
flowers set no seed without insects aid the provisions made to
secure the greatest benefit from their visits are marvelous of
the three kinds of blossoms one raises its stigma on a long
style reaching to the top of the flower a second form lifts its
stigma only halfway up and the third keeps its stigma in the
bottom of the tube now there are two sets of stamens three in
each set bearing pollen grains of different size and value
whenever the stigma is high the two sets of stamens keep out of
its way by occupying the lowest and middle positions or just
where the stigmas occur in the two other forms or let us say
whenever the stigma is in one of the three positions the
different sets of stamens occupy the other two in a long series
of experiments on flowers occurring in two and three forms 
dimorphic and trimorphic  darwin proved that perfect fertility
can be obtained only when the stigma in each form is pollenized
with grains carried from the stamens of a corresponding height
for example a bee on entering the flower must get his abdomen
dusted with pollen from the long stamens his chest covered from
the middlelength stamens and his tongue and chin from the set
in the bottom of the tube nearest the nectary when he flies off
to visit another flower these parts of his body coming in
contact with the stigmas that occupy precisely the position where
the stamens were in other individuals he necessarily brushes off
each lot of pollen just where it will do the most good pollen
brought from high stamens for example to a low stigma even
should it reach it which is scarcely likely takes little or no
effect thus crossfertilization is absolutely essential and in
threeformed flowers there are two chances to one of securing it
wild hyacinth scilla or squill quamash
  quamasia kyacinthina scilla fraseri of gray lily family
flowers  several or many pale violet blue or rarely white in
a long loose raceme perianth of 6 equal narrowly oblong
widely spreading divisions the threadlike filaments inserted at
their bases style threadlike with 3lobed stigma scape 1 to
2 ft high from eggshaped nearly black bulb 1 to 1 12 in
long leaves grasslike shorter than flowering scape from the
base fruit a 3angled oval capsule containing shining black

coming with the crocuses before the snow is off the ground and
remaining long after their regal gold and purple chalices have
withered the siberian scillas sold by seedsmen here deserve a
place in every garden for their porcelainblue color is rare as
it is charming the early date when they bloom makes them
especially welcome and once planted and left undisturbed the
bulbs increase rapidly without injury from overcrowding
evidently they need little encouragement to run wild
nevertheless they are not wild scillas however commonly they may
be miscalled so certainly ladies tresses known as wild
hyacinth in parts of new england has even less right to the
name
our true native wild hyacinth or scilla is quite a different
flower not so pure a blue as the siberian scilla and paler yet
in the middle west where it abounds there are few lovelier
sights in spring than a colony of these blossoms directed
obliquely upward from slender swaying scapes among the lush
grass their upward slant brings the stigma in immediate contact
with an incoming visitors pollenladen body as the stamens
diverge with the spreading of the divisions of the perianth to
which they are attached the stigma receives pollen brought from
another flower before the visitor dusts himself anew in
searching for refreshment thus effecting crosspollination
ants bees wasps flies butterflies and beetles may be seen
about the wild hyacinth which is obviously best adapted to the
bees the smallest insects that visit it may possibly defeat
natures plan and obtain nectar without fertilizing the flower
owing to the wide passage between stamens and stigma in about an
hour one may morning professor charles robertson captured over
six hundred insects representing thirtyeight distinct species
on a patch of wild hyacinths in illinois
the bulb of a mediterranean scilla s maritima furnishes the
sourishsweet syrup of squills used in medicine for bronchial
troubles
the grape hyacinth muscari botrycides also known as babys
breath because of its delicate faint fragrance escapes from
gardens at slight encouragement to grow wild in the roadsides and
meadows from massachusetts to virginia and westward to ohio its
tiny deepblue globular flowers stiffly set around a fleshy
scape that rises between erect bladelike channeled leaves
appear spring after spring wherever the small bulbs have been
planted on the east end of long island there are certain meadows
literally blued with the little runaways
purple trillium illscented wakerobin or birthroot
  trillium erectum  lilyofthevalley family
flowers  solitary dark dull purple or purplish red rarely
greenish white or pinkish on erect or slightly inclined
footstalk calyx of 3 spreading sepals 1 to 1 12 in long or
about length of 3 pointed oval petals stamens 6 anthers longer
than filaments pistil spreading into 3 short recurved stigmas
stem stout 8 to i6 in high from tuberlike rootstock leaves
in a whorl of 3 broadly ovate abruptly pointed nettedveined
fruit a 6angled ovate reddish berry
preferred habitat  rich moist woods
flowering season  apriljune
distribution  nova scotia westward to manitoba southward to
north carolina and missouri
some weeks after the jubilant alert robins have returned from
the south the purple trillium unfurls its unattractive
carrionscented flower in the variable colors found in different
regions one can almost trace its evolution from green white
and red to purple which we are told is the course all flowers
must follow to attain to blue the white and pink forms however
attractive to the eye are never more agreeable to the nose than
the reddishpurple ones bees and butterflies with delicate
appreciation of color and fragrance let the blossom alone since
it secretes no nectar and one would naturally infer either that
it can fertilize itself without insect aid  a theory which
closer study of its organs goes far to disprove  or that the
carrionscent so repellent to us is in itself an attraction to
certain insects needful for crosspollination which are they
beetles have been observed crawling over the flower but without
effecting any methodical result one inclines to accept mr
clarence m weeds theory of special adaptation to the common
green fleshflies lucilia carnicina which would naturally be
attracted to a flower resembling in color and odor a raw
beefsteak of uncertain age these little creatures seen in every
butcher shop throughout the summer the flower furnishes with a
free lunch of pollen in consideration of the transportation of a
few grains to another blossom absence of the usual floral
attractions gives the carrion flies a practical monopoly of the
pollen food which no doubt tastes as it smells
the sessileflowered wakerobin t sessile whose dark purple
purplishred or greenish blossom narrower of sepal and petals
than the preceding is seated in a whorl of three eggshaped
sometimes blotched leaves possesses a rather pleasant odor
nevertheless it seems to have no great attraction for insects
the stigmas which are very large almost touch the anthers
surrounding them therefore the beetles which one frequently sees
crawling over them to feed on the pollen so jar them no doubt
as to selffertilize the flower but it is scarcely probable
these slow crawlers often transfer the grains from one blossom to
another a degraded flower like this has little need of color and
perfume one would suppose yet it may be even now slowly
perfecting its way toward an ideal of which we see a part only
complete in deep rich moist woods and thickets the sessile
trillium blooms in april or may from pennsylvania ohio and
minnesota southward nearly to the gulf

the fleurdelys which is the flower of chivalry says ruskin
has a sword for its leaf and a lily for its heart when that
young and pious crusader louis vii adopted it for the emblem of
his house spelling was scarcely an exact science and the
fleurdelouis soon became corrupted into its present form
doubtless the royal flower was the white iris and as li is the
celtic for white there is room for another theory as to the
origin of the name it is our far more regal looking but truly
democratic blossom jostling its fellows in the marshes that is
indeed born in the purple
when napoleon wished to pose as the true successor of those
ancient french kings whose territory included the half of europe
 ignoring every louis who ever sat on the throne for their very
name and emblem had become odious to the people  he discarded
the fleurdelis to replace it with golden bees the symbol in
armory for industry and perseverance it is said some relics of
gold and fine stones somewhat resembling an insect in shape had
been found in the tomb of cloviss father and on the supposition
that these had been bees napoleon appropriated them for the
imperial badge henceforth napoleonic bees appeared on his
coronation robe and wherever a heraldic emblem could be employed
but even in the meadows of france napoleon need not have looked
far from the fleursdelis growing there to find bees indeed
this gorgeous flower is thought by scientists to be all that it
is for the bees benefit which of course is its own also
abundant moisture from which to manufacture nectar  a prime
necessity with most irises  certainly is for our blue flag the
large showy blossom cannot but attract the passing bee whose
favorite color according to sir john lubbock it waves the bee
alights on the convenient spreading platform and guided by the
dark veining and golden lines leading to the nectar sips the
delectable fluid shortly to be changed to honey now as he
raises his head and withdraws it from the nectary he must rub it
against the pollenladen anther above and some of the pollen
necessarily falls on the visitor as the sticky side of the plate
stigma just under the petallike division of the style faces
away from the anther which is below it in any case the flower
is marvelously guarded against fertilization from its own pollen
the bee flying off to another iris must first brush past the
projecting lip of the overarching style and leave on the
stigmatic outer surface of the plate some of the pollen brought
from the first flower before reaching the nectary thus
crossfertilization is effected and darwin has shown how
necessary this is to insure the most vigorous and beautiful
offspring without this wonderful adaptation of the flower to the
requirements of its insect friends and of the insect to the
needs of the flower both must perish the former from hunger
the latter because unable to perpetuate its race and yet man has
greedily appropriated all the beauties of the floral kingdom as
designed for his sole delight
the name iris meaning a deified rainbow which was given this
group of plants by the ancients shows a fine appreciation of
their superb coloring their ethereal texture and the evanescent
beauty of the blossom
in spite of the name given to another species the southern blue
flag i hexagona is really the larger one its leaves which
are bright green and never hoary often equaling the stem in its
height of from two to three feet the handsome solitary flower
similar to that of the larger blue flag nevertheless has its
broad outer divisions fully an inch larger and is seated in the
axils at the top of the circular stem the oblong cylindric
sixangled capsule also contains two rows of seeds in each
cavity from south carolina and florida to kentucky missouri
and texas one finds this iris blooming in the swamps during april
and may
the slender blue flag i prismatica i virginica of gray
found growing from new brunswick to north carolina but mainly
near the coast and often in the same oozy ground with the larger
blue flag may be known by its grasslike leaves two or three of
which usually branch out from the slender flexuous stem by its
solitary or two blue flowers variegated with white and veined
with yellow that rear themselves on slender footstems and by
the sharply threeangled narrow oblong capsule in which but
one row of seeds is borne in each cavity this is the most
graceful member of a rather stiffly stately family

only for a day and that must be a bright one will this little
sister of the stately blue flag open its eyes to close them in
indignation on being picked nor will any coaxing but the
sunshines induce it to open them again in water immediately
after the dainty flower growing in dense tufts makes up in
numbers what it lacks in size and lasting power flecking our
meadows with purplish ultramarine blue in a sunny june morning
later in the day apparently there are no blossoms there for all
are tightly closed never to bloom again new buds will unfold to
tinge the field on the morrow
usually three buds nod from between a pair of bracts the lower
one of which may be twice the length of the upper one but only
one flower opens at a time slight variations in this plant have
been considered sufficient to differentiate several species

because of the singular and exquisitely unerring adaptations of
orchids as a family to their insect visitors no group of plants
has greater interest for the botanist since darwin interpreted
their marvelous mechanism and gray his instant disciple
revealed the hidden purposes of our native american species no
less wonderfully constructed than the most costly exotic in a
millionaires hothouse
a glance at the spur of this orchid one of the handsomest and
most striking of its clan and the heavy perfume of the flower
would seem to indicate that only a moth with a long proboscis
could reach the nectar secreted at the base of the threadlike
passage butterflies attracted by the conspicuous color
sometimes hover about the showy spikes of bloom but it is
probable that to secure a sip all but possibly the very largest
of them must go to the smaller purplefringed orchis whose
shorter spur holds out a certain prospect of reward for in
these two cases as in so many others the flowers welcome for
an insect is in exact proportion to the length of its visitors
tongue doubtless it is one of the smaller sphinx moths such as
we see at dusk working about the evening primrose and other
flowers deep of chalice and heavily perfumed to guide visitors
to their feast that is the great purplefringed orchids
benefactor since the length of its tongue is perfectly adapted
to its needs attracted by the showy broad lower petal his
wings ever in rapid motion the moth proceeds to unroll his
proboscis and drain the cup that is frequently an inch and a
half deep thrusting in his head either one or both of his
large projecting eyes are pressed against the sticky
buttonshaped disks to which the pollen masses are attached by a
stalk and as he raises his head to depart feeling that he is
caught he gives a little jerk that detaches them and away he
flies with these still fastened to his eyes
even while he is flying to another flower that is to say in
half a minute the stalks of the pollen masses bend downward from
the perpendicular and slightly toward the center or just far
enough to require the moth in thrusting his proboscis into the
nectary to strike the glutinous sticky stigma now withdrawing
his head either or both of the golden clubs he brought in with
him will be left on the precise spot where they will fertilize
the flower sometimes but rarely we catch a butterfly or moth
from the smaller or larger purple orchids with a pollen mass
attached to his tongue instead of to his eyes this is when he
does not make his entrance from the exact center  as in these
flowers he is not obliged to do  and in order to reach the
nectary his tongue necessarily brushes against one of the sticky
anther sacs the performance may be successfully imitated by
thrusting some blunt point about the size of a moths head a
dull pencil or a knittingneedle into the flower as an insect
would enter withdraw the pencil and one or both of the pollen
masses will be found sticking to it and already automatically
changing their attitude in the case of the large roundleaved
orchis whose greenishwhite flowers are fertilized in a similar
manner by the sphinx moth the anther sacs converge like little
horns and their change of attitude while they are being carried
to fertilize another flower is quite as exquisitely exact
usually in wetter ground than we find its more beautiful big
sister growing in most frequently in swamps and bogs the
smaller purplefringed orchis h psycodes lifts its perfumed
lilac spires thither go the butterflies and longlipped bees to
feast in july and august inasmuch as without their aid the
orchid must perish from its inability to set fertile seed no
wonder it woos its benefactors with a showy mass of color
charming fringes sweet perfume and copious draughts of nectar
and makes their visits of the utmost value to itself by the
ingenious mechanism described above here is no waste of pollen
that is snugly packed in little bundles ready to be carried off
but placed where they cannot come in contact with the adjoining
stigma since every orchid almost without exception refuses to
be deteriorated through selffertilization
from new jersey and illinois southward particularly in
mountainous regions if not among the mountains themselves the
fringeless purple orchis h perarnoena may be found blooming in
moist meadows through july and august moisture from which to
manufacture the nectar that orchids rely upon so largely to
entice insects to work for them is naturally a prime necessity
yet sprengel attempted to prove that many orchids are gaudy shams
and produce no nectar but exist by an organized system of
deception scheinsaftblumen he called them from the number of
butterflies seen hovering about this fringeless orchis and its
more attractive kin it is small wonder their nectaries are soon
exhausted and they are accused of being gay deceivers sprengels
muchquoted theory would credit moths butterflies and even the
highly intelligent bees with scant sense but darwin who
thoroughly tested it forever exonerated these insects from
imputed stupidity and the flowers from gross dishonesty he found
that many european orchids secrete their nectar between the outer
and inner walls of the tube which a bumblebee can easily pierce
but where sprengel never thought to look for it the large lip of
this orchis is not fringed but has a fine picotee edge the

according to muller they are pollenized by both bees and
butterflies insects whose tongues have kept pace with the

the tall wild larkspur d urceolatum d exaltatum of gray
waves long crowded downy wands of intense purplish blue in the
rich woods of western pennsylvania southward to the carolinas
and alabama and westward to nebraska its spur is nearly
straight not to increase the difficulty a bee must have in
pressing his lips through the upper and lower petals to reach the
nectar at the end of it first the stamens successively raise
themselves in the passage back of the petals to dust his head
then when each has shed its pollen and bent down again the
pistil takes its turn in occupying the place so that a
pollenladen bee coming to visit the blossom from an earlier
flower can scarcely help fertilizing it it is said there are
but two insects in europe with lips long enough to reach the
bottom of the long horn of plenty hung by the bee larkspur d
elatum that we know only in gardens here its yellowish bearded
lower petals readily deceive one into thinking a bee has just
alighted there

tricorne which however may sometimes grow three feet high
lifts a loose raceme of blue rarely white flowers an inch or
more long at the end of a stout stem rising from a tuberous
root its slightly ascending spur its three widely spreading
seed vessels and the deeply cut leaf of from five to seven
divisions are distinguishing characteristics from western
pennsylvania and georgia to arkansas and minnesota it is found in
rather stiff soil butterflies which prefer erect flowers have
some difficulty to cling while they drain the almost upright
spurs especially the papilios which usually suck with their
wings in motion but the bees to which the delphinium are best
adapted although butterflies visit them quite as frequently
find a convenient landing place prepared for them and fertilize
the flower while they sip with ease

violets a correspondent who seems to have carefully observed
these fragrant hepaticas writes me that this gift of odor is
constant in the same plant that the plant which bears
sweetscented flowers this year will bear them next
it is not evident that insect aid is necessary to transfer the
tiny hairy spiral ejected from each cell of the antherid after
it has burst from ripeness to the canal of the flaskshaped
organ at whose base the germcell is located perfect flowers can
fertilize themselves but pollenfeeding flies and female hive
bees which collect it and the earliest butterflies trifle about
the blossoms when the first warm days come whether they are
rewarded by finding nectar or not is still a mooted question
possibly the papillae which cover the receptacle secrete nectar
for almost without exception the insect visitors thrust their
proboscides down between the spreading filaments as if certain of
a sip none merely feed on the pollen except the flies and the
hive bee
the sharplobed liverleaf hepatica acuta differs chiefly from
the preceding in having the ends of the lobes of its leaves and
the tips of the three leaflets that form its involucre quite
sharply pointed its range while perhaps not actually more
westerly appears so since it is rare in the east where its
cousin is so abundant and common in the west where the
roundlobed liverleaf is scarce it blooms in march and april
professor halsted has noted that this species bears staminate
flowers on one plant and pistillate flowers on another whereas
the hepatica hepatica usually bears flowers of both sexes above
the same root the blossoms which close at night to keep warm
and open in the morning remain on the beautiful plant for a long
time to accommodate the bees and flies that in this case are
essential to the perpetuation of the species

dull sometimes bright the flower clusters never fail to attract
many insects to their feast which is accessible even to those of

contains both stamens and pistils but to guard against

mischievous bumblebees thrusting their long tongues between the
sepals and petals of these unopened flowers steal nectar without
conferring any favor in return later when they behave properly
and put their heads inside to feast at the disk on which the
stamens are inserted they dutifully carry pollen from old
flowers to the early maturing stigmas of younger ones
selffertilization must occur however if the bees have not
removed all the pollen when a blossom closes when the purple
avens opens in europe the bees desert even the primrose to feast
upon its abundant nectar since water is the prime necessity in
the manufacture of this sweet and since insects that feed upon
it have so much to do with the multiplication of flowers it is
not surprising that the swamp which has been called natures
sanctuary should have its altars so exquisitely decked this
blossom hangs its head partly to protect its precious nectar
from rain and partly to make pilfering well nigh impossible to

farmers once thought that this plant preyed upon the fertility of
their soil as we see in the derivation of its name from lupus
a wolf whereas the lupine contents itself with sterile waste
land no one should grudge it  steep gravelly banks railroad
tracks exposed sunny hills where even it must often burn out
under fierce sunshine did not its root penetrate to surprising
depths it spreads far and wide in thrifty colonies reflecting
the vivid color of june skies until as thoreau says the earth
is blued with it
what is the advantage gained in the peashaped blossom as usual
the insect that fertilizes the flower best knows the answer the
corolla has five petals the upper one called the standard
chiefly a flaunted advertisement two side wings or platforms
to alight on and a keel like a miniature boat formed by the two
lower petals whose edges meet in this the pistil stamens and
nectar are concealed and protected the pressure of a bees
weight as he alights on the wings light as it must be is
nevertheless sufficient to depress and open the keel which is
elastically affected by their motion and so to expose the pollen
just where the longlipped bee must rub off some against his
underside as he sucks the nectar he actually seems to pump the
pollen that has fallen into the forward part of the keel upon
himself as he moves about as soon as he leaves the flower the
elastic wings resume their former position thus closing the keel
to prevent waste of pollen take a sweet pea from the garden
press down its wings with the thumb and forefinger to imitate the
action of the bee on them note how the keel opens to display its
treasures and resumes its customary shape when the pressure is
removed
the lupine is another of those interesting plants which go to
sleep at night some members of the genus erect one half of the

of the horizontal star it is by day frequently the leaflets
rotate as much as 90 degrees on their own axes some lupines fold
their leaflets not at night only but during the day also there
is more or less movement in the leaves sun dial a popular name
for the wild lupine has reference to this peculiarity the leaf
of our species shuts downward around its stem umbrella fashion
or the leaflets are erected to prevent the chilling which comes
to horizontal surfaces by radiation some scientists think that
the sleep movements of leaves are in some manner of high
importance to the plants which exhibit them says darwin few

as one travels hundreds or even thousands of miles in a

winning one that some send their offspring flying away from

just mentioned do the ticktrefoils spread abroad theirs is
indeed a by hook or by crook system the scalloped jointed pod
where the seeds lie concealed has minute crooked bristles which
catch in the clothing of man or beast so that every herd of
sheep every dog every man woman or child who passes through a
patch of trefoils gives them a lift after a walk through the
woods and lanes of late summer and autumn ones clothes reveal
scores of tramps that have stolen a ride in the hope of being

only the largest bees can easily explode the showy
ticktrefoil a bumblebee alights upon a flower thrusts his head
under the base of the standard petal and forces apart the wing
petals with his legs in order to dislodge them from the
standard this motion causes the keel also connected with the
standard to snap down violently thus releasing the column
within and sending upward an explosion of pollen on the under
surface of the bee here we see the wing petals acting as
triggers to discharge the flower depress them and up flies the
fertilizing dust  once the little gun will not go off twice
no nectar rewards the visitor which usually is a
pollencollecting bee the highly intelligent and important

of drowning from some members of the pea family as from the

flower in some other members his weight so depresses the keel
that the stamens are forced out to dust him over the flower

of energy on natures part why should the same plant bear two
kinds of blossoms and seeds among the foliage of low shrubbery
and plants in shady lanes and woodside thickets we see the
delicate drooping clusters of lilac blossoms hanging where bees
can readily discover them and in pilfering their sweets
transfer their pollen from flower to flower but in case of
failure to intercross these blossoms that are dependent upon
insect help to set fertile seed what then must the plant run
the risk of extinction selffertilization may be an evil but
failure to produce seed at all is surely the greatest one to
guard against such a calamity insignificant looking flowers that
have no petals to open for the enticing of insects but which
fertilize themselves with their own pollen produce abundant seed
close to the ground or under itthen what need of the showy
blossoms hanging in the thicket above close inbreeding in the
vegetable world as in the animal ultimately produces degenerate
offspring and although the showy lilac blossoms of the wild
peanut yield comparatively few crossfertilized seeds these are
quite sufficient to enable the vine to maintain those desired
features which are the inheritance from ancestors that struggled
in their day and generation after perfection no plant dares
depend upon its cleistogamous or blind flowers alone for
offspring and in the sixty or more genera containing these
curious growths that usually look like buds arrested in
development every plant that bears them bears also showy flowers
dependent upon crosspollination by insect aid
the boy who
    drives home the cows from the pasture
     up through the long shady lane
knows how reluctantly they leave the feast afforded by the wild
peanut hogs rooting about in the moist soil where it grows
unearth the hairy pods that should produce next years vines
hence the poor excuse for branding a charming plant with a
repellent folkname
violets
  viola  violet family
lacking perfume only to be a perfectly satisfying flower the
common purple meadow or hooded blue violet v obliqua v
cucullata of gray has nevertheless established itself in the
hearts of the people from the arctic to the gulf as no
sweetscented showy hothouse exotic has ever done royal in
color as in lavish profusion it blossoms everywhere  in woods
waysides meadows and marshes but always in finer form in cool
shady dells with longer flowering scapes in meadow bogs and
with longer leaves than wide in swampy woodlands the
heartshaped sawedged leaves folded toward the center when
newly put forth and the fivepetalled bluishpurple
goldenhearted blossom are too familiar for more detailed
description from the threecornered stars of the elastic
capsules the seeds are scattered abroad
beards on the spurred lower petal and the two side petals give
the bees a foothold when they turn head downward as some must
to suck nectar this attitude enables them to receive the pollen
dusted on their abdomens when they jar the flower at a point
nearest their pollencollecting hairs it is also an economical
advantage to the flower which can sift the pollen downward on the
bee instead of exposing it to the polleneating interlopers
among the latter may be classed the bumblebees and butterflies
whose long lips and tongues pilfer ad libitum for the proper
visitors of the bearded violets says professor robertson we
must look to the small bees among which the osmias are the most
important
when science was younger and hair splitting an uncommon
indulgence of botanists the early blue violet viola palmata
was thought to be simply a variety of the common purple violet
whose heartshaped leaves frequently show a tendency to divide
into lobes but the early blue violet however roundish or
heartshaped its early leaves may be has the later ones
variously divided into from three to thirteen lobes often almost
as much cut on the sides as the leaves of the birdsfoot violet
in dry soil chiefly in the woods this violet may be found from
southern canada westward to minnesota and south to northern
boundaries of the gulf states only its side petals are bearded
to form footrests for the insects that search for the deeply
secreted nectar many butterflies visit this flower on entering
it a bee must first touch the stigma before any fresh golden
pollen is released from the anther cone and crossfertilization
naturally results
in shale and sandy soil even in the gravel of hillsides one
finds the narrowly divided finely cut leaves and the bicolored
beardless blossom of the birdsfoot violet v pedata pale
bluish purple on the lower petals dark purple on one or two
upper ones and with a heart of gold the large velvety
pansylike blossom and the unusual foliage which rises in rather
dense tufts are sufficient to distinguish the plant from its
numerous kin this species produces no cleistogamous or blind
flowers frequently the birdsfoot violet blooms a second time
in autumn a delightful eccentricity of this family the spur of
its lower petal is long and very slender and as might be
expected the longesttongued bees and butterflies are its most
frequent visitors these receive the pollen on the base of the
proboscis
the woolly blue violet v sororia whose stems and younger
leaves at least are covered with hairs and whose purplishblue
flowers are more or less bearded within prefers a shady but dry
situation whereas its next of kin the arrowleaved violet v
sagittata delights in moist but open meadows and marshes the
latters long arrow or halberdshaped leaves usually entire
above the middle but slightly lobed below it may rear
themselves nine inches high in favorable soil or in dry uplands
perhaps only two inches the flowering scapes grow as tall as the
leaves all but the lower petal of the large deep dark
purplishblue flower are bearded this species produces an
abundance of late cleistogamous flowers on erect stems these
peculiar greenish flowers without petals that are so often
mistaken for buds or seed vessels that never open but without
insect aid ripen quantities of fertile seed are usually borne
if not actually under ground then not far above it on nearly
all violet plants it will be observed that all species which
bear blind flowers rely somewhat on showy crossfertilized
blossoms also to counteract degeneracy from close inbreeding
the ovateleaved violet v ovata formerly reckoned as a mere
variety of the former species is now accorded a distinct rank
not all the blossoms but an occasional clump has a faint
perfume like sweet clover the leaf is elongated but rather too
round to be halberdshaped the stems are hairy and the flowers
which closely resemble those of the arrowleaved violet are
earlier making these two species which are popularly mistaken
for one among the earliest and commonest of their clan the dry
soil of upland woods and thickets is the ovateleaved violets
preferred habitat
in course of time the lovely english march or sweet violet v
odorata which has escaped from gardens and which is now
rapidly increasing with the help of seed and runners on the
atlantic and the pacific coasts may be established among our
wild flowers no blossom figures so prominently in european
literature in france it has even entered the political field
since napoleons day yale university has adopted the violet for
its own especial flower although it is the cornflower or
bachelors button centaurea cyanus that is the true yale blue
sprengel who made a most elaborate study of the violet
condensed the result of his research into the following questions
and answers which are given here because much that he says
applies to our own native species which have been too little
studied in the modern scientific spirit
1 why is the flower situated on a long stalk which is upright
but curved downwards at the free end in order that it may hang
down which firstly prevents rain from obtaining access to the
nectar and secondly places the stamens in such a position that
the pollen falls into the open space between the pistil and the
free ends of the stamens if the flower were upright the pollen
would fall into the space between the base of the stamen and the
base of the pistil and would not come in contact with the bee
2 why does the pollen differ from that of most other
insectfertilized flowers in most of such flowers the insects
themselves remove the pollen from the anthers and it is
therefore important that the pollen should not easily be detached
and carried away by the wind in the present case on the
contrary it is desirable that it should be looser and dryer so
that it may easily fall into the space between the stamens and
the pistil if it remained attached to the anther it would not
be touched by the bee and the flower would remain unfertilized
3 why is the base of the style so thin in order that the bee
may be more easily able to bend the style
4 why is the base of the style bent for the same reason the
result of the curvature is that the pistil is much more easily
bent than would be the case if the style were straight
5 finally why does the membranous termination of the upper
filament overlap the corresponding portions of the two middle
stamens because this enables the bee to move the pistil and
thereby to set free the pollen more easily than would be the case
under the reverse arrangement
in high altitudes of new england colorado and northward where
the soil is wet and cold the pale lilac slightly bearded
petals streaked with darker veins of the marsh violet v
palustris with its almost round leaves may be found from may
to june all through the white mountains one finds it abundant
a peculiarity of the dog or running violet v labradorica is
that its small heartshaped leaves are set along the branching
stem and its pale purple blossoms rise from their angles pansy
fashion from march to may it blooms throughout its wide range in
wet shady places its english prototype called by the same
invidious name was given the prefix dog because the word
which is always intended to express contempt in the british mind
is applied in this case for the flowers lack of fragrance when
a bee visits this violet his head coming in contact with the
stigma jars it thus opening the little pollen box whose
contents must fall out on his head and be carried away and rubbed
off where it will fertilize the next violet visited

    then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
     look through its fringes to the sky
     blue  blue  as if that sky let fail
     a flower from its cerulean wall
when we come upon a bed of gentians on some sparkling october
day we can but repeat bryants thoughts and express them
prosaically who attempt description in dark weather this
sunshine lover remains shut to protect its nectar and pollen
from possible showers an elusive plant is this gentian which by
no means always reappears in the same places year after year for
it is an annual whose seeds alone perpetuate it seating
themselves on the winds when autumn gales shake them from out of
the home wall these little hairy scales ride afar and those
that are so fortunate as to strike into soft moist soil at the
end of the journey germinate because this flower is so rarely
beautiful that few can resist the temptation of picking it it is
becoming sadly rare near large settlements
the special importance of producing a quantity of fertile seed
has led the gentians to adopt proterandry  one of the commonest
because most successful methods of insuring it the anthers
coming to maturity early shed their pollen on the bumblebees
that have been first attracted by their favorite color and the
enticing fringes before they crawl half way down the tube where
they can reach the nectar secreted in the walls after the pollen
has been carried from the early flowers and the stamens begin to
wither up rises the pistil to be fertilized with pollen brought
from a newly opened blossom by the bee or butterfly the late
development of the pistil accounts for the error often stated
that some gentians have none no doubt the fringe which most
scientists regard simply as an additional attraction for winged
insects serves a double purpose in entangling the feet of ants
and other crawlers that would climb over the edge to pilfer
sweets clearly intended for the bumblebee alone
fifteen species of gentian have been gathered during a halfhour
walk in switzerland where the pastures are spread with sheets of
blue indeed one can little realize the beauty of these heavenly
flowers who has not seen them among the alps
the fiveflowered or stiff gentian or agueweed gentiana
quinquefolia g quinqueflora of gray has its fiveparted
small picoteeedged blue flowers arranged in clusters not
exceeding seven at the ends of the branches or seated in the
leafaxils the slender branching ridged stem may rise only two
inches in dry soil or perhaps two feet in rich moist rocky
ground where it grows to perfection especially in mountainous
regions from canada to florida and westward to missouri is its
range and beginning to bloom in august southward it may not be
found until september in the catskills and in october it is
still in its glory in ontario the colorless bitter juice of
many of the gentian tribe has long been valued as a tonic in
medicine evidently the butterflies that pilfer this agueweed
and the bees that are its legitimate feasters find something
more delectable in its blue walls
a deep intense blue is the closed blind or bottle gentian g
andrewsii more truly the color of the male bluebirds back
to which thoreau likened the paler fringed gentian rarely some
degenerate plant bears white flowers as it is a perennial we
are likely to find it in its old haunts year after year
nevertheless its winged seeds sail far abroad to seek pastures
new this gentian also shows a preference for moist soil gray
thought that it expanded slightly and for a short time only in
sunshine but added that although it is proterandrous ie it
matures and sheds its pollen before its stigma is susceptible to
any he believed it finally fertilized itself by the lobes of the
stigma curling backward until they touched the anthers but gray
was doubtless mistaken several authorities have recently proved
that the flower is adapted to bumblebees it offers them the last
feast of the season for although it comes into bloom in august
southward farther northward  and it extends from quebec to the
northwest territory  it lasts through october
now how can a bumblebee enter this inhospitablelooking flower
if he did but know it it keeps closed for his special benefit
having no fringes or hairs to entangle the feet of crawling
pilferers and no better way of protecting its nectar from rain
and marauding butterflies that are not adapted to its needs but
he is a powerful fellow watch him alight on a cluster of
blossoms select the younger nectarbearing ones that are
distinctly marked white against a lightblue background at the
mouth of the corolla for his special guidance old flowers from
which the nectar has been removed turn deep reddish purple and
the white pathfinders become indistinct with some difficulty it
is true the bumblebee b americanorum thrusts his tongue
through the valve of the chosen flower where the five plaited
lobes overlap one another then he pushes with all his might
until his head having passed the entrance most of his body
follows leaving only his hind legs and the tip of his abdomen
sticking out as he makes the circuit he has much sense as well
as muscle and does not risk imprisonment in what must prove a
tomb by a total and unnecessary disappearance within the bottle
presently he backs out brushes the pollen from his head and
thorax into his baskets and is off to fertilize an older
stigmatic flower with the few grains of quickening dust that must
remain on his velvety head

the merest novice can have no difficulty in naming the flower
whose wild and cultivated relations abound throughout north
america the almost exclusive home of the genus although it is
to european horticulturists as usual the first to see the
possibilities in our native flowers that we owe the gay hybrids
in our gardens mr drummond a collector from the botanical
society of glasgow early in the thirties sent home the seeds of
a species from texas which became the ancestor of the gorgeous
annuals the drummond phloxes of commerce today and although he
died of fever in cuba before the plants became generally known
not even his kinsman the author of natural law in the spiritual
world has done more to immortalize the family name
while the wild blue phlox is sometimes cultivated it is the
garden phlox p paniculata common in woods and thickets from
pennsylvania to illinois and southward that under a gardeners
care bears the large terminal clusters of purple magenta
crimson pink and white flowers abundant in oldfashioned hardy
borders from these it has escaped so freely in many sections of
the north and east as to be counted among the local wildflowers
unless the young offshoots are separated from the parent and
given a nook of their own the flower quickly reverts to the
original type european cultivators claim that the most brilliant
colors are obtained by crossing annual with perennial phloxes
wild sweet william p maculata another perennial much sought
by cultivators loves the moisture of low woods and the
neighborhood of streams in the middle and western states when it
is free to choose its habitat but it too has so freely escaped
from gardens farther north into dry and dusty roadsides that
anyone who has passed the ruins of hawthornes little red cottage
at lenox for example and seen the way his wifes clump of white
phlox under his study window has spread to cover an acre of
hillside would suppose it to be luxuriating in its favorite
locality this variety of the species var candida lacks the
purplish flecks on stem and lower leaves responsible for the
specific name of the type pinkish purple or pink blossoms are
borne in a rather narrow elongated panicle on the typical sweet
william
most members of the phlox family resort to the trick of coating
the upper stem and the peduncles immediately below the flowers
with a sticky secretion in which crawling insects intent on
pilfering sweets meet their death just as birds are caught on
limed twigs butterflies for whom phloxes have narrowed their
tubes to the exclusion of most other insects are their
benefactors but longtongued bees and flies often seek their
nectar indeed the number of strictly butterflyflowers is
surprisingly small

not to be outdone by its cousins the heliotrope and the

found its way into the rockwork and sheltered moist nooks of
many gardens especially in england where mr w robinson who
has appealed for its wider cultivation in that perennially
charming book the english flower garden says of the
mertensias there is something about them more beautiful in form
of foliage and stem and in the graceful way in which they rise
to panicles of blue than in almost any other family
handsomest of all is the virginia cowslip and yet robinson
never saw the alluvial meadows in the ohio valley blued with

a great variety of insects visit this blossom which being
tubular conducts them straight to the ample feast but not until
they have deposited some pollen brought from another flower on
the stigma in their way the anthers are too widely separated
from the stigma to make selffertilization likely occasionally
one finds the cowslips perforated by clever bumblebees as only
the females which are able to sip far deeper cups are flying
when they bloom they must be either too mischievous or too lazy
to drain them in the legitimate manner butterflies have only to
stand on a flower not to enter it in order to sip nectar from
the four glands that secrete it abundantly

    the sweet forgetmenots
     that grow for happy lovers
tennyson thus ignores the melancholy association of the flower in
the popular legend which tells how a lover when trying to gather
some of these blossoms for his sweetheart fell into a deep pool
and threw a bunch on the bank calling out as he sank forever
from her sight forget me not another dismal myth sends its
hero forth seeking hidden treasure caves in a mountain under the
guidance of a fairy he fills his pockets with gold but not
heeding the fairys warning to forget not the best  ie the
myosotis  he is crushed by the closing together of the mountain
happiest of all is the folktale of the persians as told by
their poet shiraz it was in the golden morning of the early
world when an angel sat weeping outside the closed gates of
paradise he had fallen from his high estate through loving a
daughter of earth nor was he permitted to enter again until she
whom he loved had planted the flowers of the forgetmenot in
every corner of the world he returned to earth and assisted her
and together they went hand in hand when their task was ended
they entered paradise together for the fair woman without
tasting the bitterness of death became immortal like the angel
whose love her beauty had won when she sat by the river twining
forgetmenots in her hair
it was the golden ring around the forgetmenots center that
first led sprengel to believe the conspicuous markings at the
entrance of many flowers served as pathfinders to insects this
golden circle also shelters the nectar from rain and indicates
to the fly or bee just where it must probe between stigma and
anthers to touch them with opposite sides of its tongue since it
may probe from any point of the circle it is quite likely that
the side of the tongue that touched a pollenladen anther in one
flower will touch the stigma in the next one visited and so
crossfertilize it but forgetmenots are not wholly dependent
on insects when these fail a fully mature flower is still able
to set fertile seed by shedding its own pollen directly on the
stigma
the smaller forgetmenot m laxa formerly accounted a mere
variety of palustris but now defined as a distinct species is a

in england from whose gardens this plant escaped long ago a war
of extermination that has been waged against the vigorous
beautiful weed by the farmers has at last driven it to the
extremity of the island where a few stragglers about penzance
testify to the vanquishing of what must once have been a mighty
army from england a few refugees reached here in i683 no one
knows how but they proved to be the vanguard of an aggressive
and victorious host that quickly overran our open hospitable
country as if to give vent to revenge for long years of
persecution at the hands of europeans it is a fact that all our
more pernicious weeds like our vermin are of oldworld origin
saysjohn burroughs perhaps the most notable thing about
them when compared with our native species is their
persistence not to say pugnacity they fight for the soil they
plant colonies here and there and will not be rooted out our
native weeds are for the most part shy and harmless and retreat
before civilization we have hardly a weed we can call our
own
years ago when simple folk believed god had marked plants with
some sign to indicate the special use for which each was
intended they regarded the spotted stem of the bugloss and its
seeds shaped like a serpents head as certain indications that
the herb would cure snake bites indeed the genus takes its name
from echis the greek for viper
because it is showy and offers accessible nectar a great variety
of insects visit the blueweed muller alone observed sixtyseven
species about it we need no longer wonder at its fertility of
the five stamens one remains in the tube while the other four
project and form a convenient alighting place for visitors which
necessarily dust their under sides with pollen as they enter for
the red anthers were already ripe when the flower opened then
however the short immature pistil was kept below after the
stamens have shed their pollen and there can be no longer danger
of selffertilization it gradually elongates itself beyond the
point occupied by them and divides into two little horns whose
stigmatic surfaces an incoming pollenladen insect cannot well
fail to strike against crosspollination is so thoroughly
secured in this case that the plant has completely lost the power
of fertilizing itself unwelcome visitors like ants which would
pilfer nectar without rendering any useful service in return are
warded off by the bristly hairy foliage several kinds of female
bees seek the bugloss exclusively for food for their larvae as
well as for themselves sweeping up the abundant pollen with
their abdominal brushes as they feast without effort

appreciative word for any weed speaks of its drooping knotted
threads that make a pretty etching upon the winter snow bees
the vervains benefactors are usually seen clinging to the
blooming spikes and apparently sleep on them borrowing the name
of simplers joy from its european sister the flower has also
appropriated much of the tradition and folklore centered about
that plant which herbgatherers or simplers truly delighted to
see since none was once more salable

slopes and is rapidly appropriating waste arid cultivated ground
until in many places it is truly troublesome in general habit
like the blue vervain its flowers are more purplish than blue
and are scattered not crowded along the spikes the leaves are
deeply but less acutely cut
ages before christians ascribed healing virtues to the vervain 
found growing on mount calvary and therefore possessing every
sort of miraculous power according to the logic of simple
peasant folk  the druids had counted it among their sacred
plants when the dogstar arose from unsunned spots the priests
gathered it did not shakespeares witches learn some of their
uncanny rites from these reverend men of old one is impressed
with the striking similarity of many customs recorded of both
two of the most frequently used ingredients in witches cauldrons
were the vervain and the rue the former probably derived its
notoriety from the fact of its being sacred to thor an honor
which marked it out like other lightning plants as peculiarly
adapted for occult uses says mr thiselton dyer in his
folklore of plants although vervain therefore as the
enchanters plant was gathered by witches to do mischief in
their incantations yet as aubrey says it hinders witches from
their will a circumstance to which drayton further refers when
he speaks of the vervain as gainst witchcraft much avayling
now we understand why the children of shakespeares time hung
vervain and dill with a horseshoe over the door
in his eighth eclogue virgil refers to vervain as a charm to
recover lost love doubtless this was the verbena the herba
sacra employed in ancient roman sacrifices according to pliny
in his day the bridal wreath was of verbena gathered by the
bride herself
narrowleaved vervain v angustifolia like the blue vervain
has a densely crowded spike of tiny purple or blue flowers that
quickly give place to seeds but usually there is only one spike
at the end of a branch the leaves are narrow lanceshaped
acute sawedged rough from massachusetts and florida westward
to minnesota and arkansas one finds the plant blooming in dry
fields from june to august after the parsimonious manner of the
vervain tribe
it is curious that the vervain or verbena employed by brides
for centuries as the emblem of chastity should be one of the
notorious botanical examples of a willful hybrid generally the
individuals of distinct species do not interbreed but verbenas
are often difficult to name correctly in every case because of
their susceptibility to each others pollen  the reason why the
garden verbena may so easily be made to blossom forth into

by the helmetlike appendage on the upper lip of the calyx which
to the imaginative mind of linnaeus suggested scutellum a little
dish which children delight to spring open for a view of the
four tiny seeds attached at the base when in fruit one knows
this to be a member of the skullcap tribe a widely scattered
genus of blue and violet twolipped flowers some small to the
point of insignificance like the present species others showy
enough for the garden but all rich in nectar and eagerly sought
by bees the wide middle lobe of the lower lip forms a convenient
platform on which to alight the stamens in the roof of a newly
opened blossom dust the back of the visitor as he explores the
nectary and as the stamens of an older flower wither when they
have shed their pollen and the style then rises to occupy their
position it follows that in flying from the top of one spike of
flowers to the bottom of another where the older ones are the
visitor for whom the whole scheme of color form and
arrangement was planned deposits on the sticky top of the style
some of the pollen he has brought with him and so
crossfertilizes the flower when the seeds begin to form and the
now useless corolla drops off the helmetlike appendage on the
top of the calyx enlarges and meets the lower lip so enclosing
and protecting the tiny nutlets after their maturity either the
mouth gapes from dryness or the appendage drops off altogether
from the same cause to release the seeds old herb doctors who
professed to cure hydrophobia with this species are responsible
for its english misnomer
perhaps the most beautiful member of the genus is the showy
skullcap s serrata whose blue corolla an inch long has its
narrow upper lip shorter than the spreading lower one the
flowers are set opposite each other at the end of the smooth
stem which rises from one to two feet high in the woods
throughout a southerly and westerly range as several other
skullcaps have distinctly sawedged leaves this plant might have
been given a more distinctive adjective thinks one who did not
have the naming of 200000 species
above dry sandy soil from new york and michigan southward the
hairy skullcap s pilosa lifts short racemes of blue flowers
that are only half an inch long and whose lower lip and lobes at
either side are shorter than the arched upper lip most parts of
the plant are covered with down the lower stem being especially
hairy and this fact determines the species when connected with
its rather distant pairs of indented veiny leaves ranging from
oblong to eggshaped and furnished with petioles which grow
gradually shorter toward the top where pairs of bracts seated
on the stem part to let the flowers spring from their axils
the larger or hyssop skullcap s integrifolia rarely has a dent
in its rounded oblong leaves which like the stem are covered
with fine down its lovely bright blue flowers an inch long
the lips of about equal length are grouped opposite each other
at the top of a stem that never lifts them higher than two feet
and so their beauty is often concealed in the tall grass of
roadsides and meadows and the undergrowth of woods and thickets
where they bloom from may to august from southern new england to
the gulf of mexico westward to texas
this tribe of plants is almost exclusively north american but
the hardy marsh skullcap or hooded willowherb s galericulata
at least roams over europe and asia also with the help of
runners as well as seeds that sinking into the soft earth of
swamps and the borders of brooks find growth easy the blue
flowers which grow singly in the axils of the upper leaves are
quite as long as those of the larger and the showy skullcaps the
oblong lanceshaped leaves which are mostly seated on the
branching stem opposite each other have low teeth why do
leaves vary as they do especially in closely allied species
the causes which have led to the different forms of leaves have
been so far as i know says sir john lubbock explained in
very few cases those of the shapes and structure of seeds are
tolerably obvious in some species but in the majority they are
still entirely unexplained and even as regards the blossoms
themselves in spite of the numerous and conscientious labors of
so many eminent naturalists there is as yet no single species

insects which having previously dusted themselves with pollen
from the stamens of the larger flowers when they first open are
in a condition to make crossfertilization certain so much for
the small flowers method of making insects serve its end the
larger flowers have another way at first they are male that is
the pistil is as yet undeveloped and the four stamens are mature
ready to shed pollen on any insect alighting on the lip later
when the stamens are past maturity the pistil elongates itself
and is ready for the reception of pollen brought from younger
flowers many blossoms are male on the first day of opening and
female later to protect themselves against selffertilization

this humble rusty green plant weakly lopping over the
surrounding grass so that often only its insignificant purple
cloverlike flower heads are visible is another of those
immigrants from the old countries which having proved fittest in
the fiercer struggle for existence there has soon after its
introduction here exceeded most of our more favored native
flowers in numbers everywhere we find the healall sometimes
dusty and stunted by the roadside sometimes truly beautiful in
its fresh purple violet and white when perfectly developed
under happy conditions in england where most flowers are deeper
hued than with us the healall is rich purple what is the
secret of this flowers successful march across three continents
as usual the chief reason is to be found in the facility it
offers insects to secure food and the quantity of fertile seed
it is therefore able to ripen as the result of their visits is
its reward also its flowering season is unusually long and it
is a tireless bloomer it is finical in no respect its sprawling
stems root easily at the joints and it is very hardy
several species of bumblebees enter the flower which being set
in dense clusters enables them to suck the nectar from each with
the minimum loss of time the smaller bee spending about two
seconds to each after allowing for the fraction of time it takes
him to sweep his eyes and the top of his head with his forelegs
to free them from the pollen which must inevitably be shaken from
the stamen in the arch of the corolla as he dives deeply after
the nectar in the bottom of the throat and to pass the pollen
just as honeybees do with the most amazing quickness from the
forelegs to the middle ones and thence to the hairy basket on
the hind ones  after making all allowances for such delays this
small worker is able to fertilize all the flowers in the fullest
cluster in half a minute when the contents of the baskets of two
different species of bumblebees caught on this blossom were
examined under the microscope the pollen in one case proved to
be healall with some from the goldenrod and a few grains of a
third kind not identified and in the other case healall pollen
and a small proportion of some unknown kind bees that are
evidently out for both nectar and pollen on the same trip have
been detected visiting white and yellow flowers on their way from
one healall cluster to another and this fact together with the
presence of more than one kind of pollen in the basket shows
that the generally accepted statement that bees confine
themselves to flowers of one kind or color during a trip is not
always according to fact
the older name of the plant brunella and the significant one

thyme is said to have been one of the three plants which made the

horace says the romans used so extensively for bee culture
dense cushions of creeping thyme usually contain two forms of
blossoms on separate plants  hermaphrodite male and female
which are much the commoner and pistillate or only female
flowers in which the stamens develop no pollen the latter are
more fertile none can fertilize itself but blossoms so rich in
nectar naturally attract quantities of insects  bees and
butterflies chiefly a newly opened hermaphrodite flower male on
the first day dusts its visitors as they pass the ripe stamens
this pollen they carry to a flower two days old which having
reached the female stage receives it on the mature twocleft
stigma now erect and tall whereas the stamens are past
maturity

is so contracted that bees cannot enter it but by inserting
their long tongues they nevertheless manage to drain it small
shorttongued bees contrive to reach only a little nectar the
palate so valuable to the other linaria has in this one lost

an insignificant little flower by itself conspicuous only
because it rears itself in clusters on a level with ones eyes
lacking beauty perfume and all that makes a blossom charming to
the human mind  why has it been elevated by the botanists to the
dignity of lending its name to a large and important family and
why is it mentioned at all in a popular flower book beside the
more showy ornaments of natures garden both questions have the
same answer because it is the typical flower of the family and
therefore serves as an illustration of the manner in which many
others are fertilized beautiful blossoms are by no means always
the most important ones
it well repays one to observe the relative times of maturing
anthers and stigmas in the flowers as thereby hangs a tale in
which some insect plays an interesting role the figwort matures
its stigma at the lip of the style before its anthers have
ripened their pollen why by having the stigma of a newly opened
flower thrust forward to the mouth of the corolla an insect
alighting on the lip which forms his only convenient landing
place must brush against it and leave upon it some pollen
brought from an older flower whose anthers are already matured
at this early stage of the flowers development its stamens lie
curved over in the tube of the corolla but presently as the
already fertilized style begins to wither and its stigma is dry
and no longer receptive to pollen then since there can be no
longer any fear of selfpollination  the horror of so many
flowers  the figwort uncurls and elevates its stamens the
insect visitor in search of nectar must get dusted with pollen
from the late maturing anthers now ready for him by this
ingenious method the flower becomes crossfertilized and wastes
the least pollen
bees and wasps evidently pursue opposite routes in going to work
the former beginning at the bottom of a spike or raceme where
the older more mature flowers are and working upward the wasps
commencing at the top among the newly opened ones in spite of
the fact that we usually see hive bees about this plant
pilfering the generous supply of nectar in each tiny cup it is
undoubtedly the wasp that is the flowers truest benefactor
since he carries pollen from the older blossoms of the last
raceme visited to the projecting stigmas of the newly opened
flowers at the top of the next cluster manifestly no flower
even though it were especially adapted to wasps as this one is
could exclude bees about onethird of all its visitors are
wasps

it is the densely bearded yellow fifth stamen pente five
stemon  a stamen which gives this flower its scientific name
and its chief interest to the structural botanist from the fact
that a blossom has a lip in the center of the lower half of its
corolla that an insect must use as its landing place comes the
necessity for the pistil to occupy a central position naturally
a fifth stamen would be only in its way an encumbrance to be
banished in time in the figwort for example we have seen the
fifth stamen reduced from long sterility to a mere scale on the
roof of the corolla tube in other lipped flowers the useless
organ has disappeared but in the beardtongue it goes through a
series of curious curves from the upper to the under side of the
flower to get out of the way of the pistil yet it serves an
admirable purpose in helping close the mouth of the flower which
the hairy lip alone could not adequately guard against pilferers

the exclusive visitors are far more abundant and important than
all the other visitors together for them are the brownish marks
on the palate provided as pathfinders at the pressure of their
strong heads the palate yields to give them entrance and at
their removal it springs back to protect the pollen against the
inroads of flies mining bees and beetles as the longer stamens
shed their pollen before the shorter ones mature theirs bees

shoots from runners produce almost circular leaves often two
inches broad a certain aid to identification
another close relation the marsh or skullcap speedwell v

an ancient tradition of the roman church relates that when jesus
was on his way to calvary he passed the home of a certain jewish
maiden who when she saw the drops of agony on his brow ran
after him along the road to wipe his face with her kerchief this
linen the monks declared ever after bore the impress of the
sacred features  vera iconica the true likeness when the
church wished to canonize the pitying maiden an abbreviated form
of the latin words was given her st veronica and her kerchief
became one of the most precious relics at st peters where it
is said to be still preserved medieval flower lovers whose
piety seems to have been eclipsed only by their imaginations

only as it grows in masses is the speedwell conspicuous  a
sufficient reason for its habit of forming colonies and of
gathering its insignificant blossoms together into dense spikes
since by these methods it issues a flaunting advertisement of its
nectar the flower that simplifies dining for insects has its
certain reward in rapidly increased and vigorous descendants to
save repetition the reader interested in the process of
fertilization is referred to the account of the maryland figwort

many charming ruellias from the tropics adorn hothouses and
window gardens in winter but so far north as the new jersey pine
barrens and westward where killing frosts occur this perennial
proves to be perfectly hardy in addition to its showy blossoms
which so successfully invite insects to transfer their pollen
thereby counteracting the bad effects of close inbreeding the
plant bears inconspicuous cleistogamous or blind ones also these
look like arrested buds that never open but being fertilized
with their own pollen ripen abundant seed nevertheless
one frequently finds holes bitten in these flowers as in so many
others long of tube or spur bumblebees among the most
intelligent and mischievous of insects are apt to be the chief
offenders but wasps are guilty too and the female carpenter
bee which ordinarily slits holes to extract nectar has been
detected in the act of removing circular pieces of the corolla
from this ruellia with which to plug up a thimbleshaped tube in
some decayed tree here she deposits an egg on top of a layer of
baby food consisting of a paste of pollen and nectar and seals
up the nursery with another bit of leaf or flower repeating the
process until the long tunnel is filled with eggs and food for
larvae then she dies leaving her entire race apparently
extinct and living only in embryo for months this is the bee

millions of these dainty wee flowers scattered through the grass

to secure crossfertilization the object toward which so much
marvelous floral organism is directed this little plant puts
forth two forms of blossoms  one with the stamens in the lower
portion of the corolla tube and the stigmas exserted the other
form with the stigmas below and the stamens elevated to the
mouth of the corolla but the two kinds do not grow in the same
patch seed from either producing after its kind many insects
visit these blossoms but chiefly small bees and butterflies
conspicuous among the latter is the common little meadow
fritillary brenthis bellona whose tawny darkspeckled wings
expand and close in apparent ecstasy as he tastes the tiny drop
of nectar in each dainty enameled cup coming to feast with his
tongue dusted from anthers nearest the nectary he pollenizes the
large stigmas of a shortstyled blossom without touching its tall
anthers but it is evident that he could not be depended on to
fertilize the longstyled form with its smaller stigma because
of this ability to insert his slender tongue from the side where
it avoids contact flies and beetles enter the blossoms but
small bees are best adapted as allround benefactors this
simplelooking blossom that measures barely half an inch across
is clever enough to multiply its lovely species a thousand fold
while many a larger and therefore one might suppose a wiser
flower dwindles toward extinction

dainty slender tempting these little flowers are one gladly
risks a watery grave or broken bones to bring down a bunch from
its aerial cranny
it was a long stride forward in the evolutionary scale when the
harebell welded its five once separate petals together first at
the base then farther and farther up the sides until a solid
bellshaped structure resulted this arrangement which makes
insect fertilization a more certain process because none of the
pollen is lost through apertures and because the visitor must
enter the flower only at the vital point where the stigmas come
in contact with his pollenladen body has given to all the
flowers that have attained to it marked ascendency
like most inverted blossoms the harebell hangs its head to
protect its nectar and pollen not only from rain but from the
intrusion of undesirable crawling insects which would simply
brush off its pollen in the grass before reaching the pistil of
another flower and so defeat crossfertilization the end and
aim of so many blossoms advertising for winged insects by its
bright color the harebell attracts bees butterflies and many
others these visitors cannot well walk on the upright petals
and sooner or later must clasp the pistil if they would secure
the nectar secreted at the base in doing so they will dust
themselves and the immature pistil with the pollen from the
surrounding anthers but a newly opened flower is incapable of
fertilization the pollen although partially discharged in the
unopened bud is prevented from falling out by a coat of hairs on
the upper part of the style by the time all the pollen has been
removed by visitors however and the stamens which matured early
have withered the pistil has grown longer until it looks like
the clapper in a bell the stigma at its top has separated into
three horizontal lobes which being sticky on the under side a
pollenladen insect on entering the bell must certainly brush
against them and render them fertile but bumblebees its chief
benefactors and others may not have done their duty by the
flower what then why the stigmas in that case finally bend
backward to reach the left over pollen and fertilize themselves
obviously the next best thing for them to do how ones reverence
increases when one begins to understand be it ever so little of
the divine plan
probably the most striking blue and purple wild flowers we

one of the few native campanulas the tall bellflower c
americana waves long slender wands studded with blue or
sometimes whitish flowers high above the ground of moist thickets

of so many flowers would brighten its rather slatey blue the
corolla which is flat round about an inch across and deeply
cleft into five pointed petals has the effect of a miniature
pinwheel in motion mature flowers have the style elongated bent
downward then curved upward that the stigmas may certainly be
in the way of the visiting insect pollenladen from an earlier
bloomer and be crossfertilized the larger bees its
benefactors which visit it for nectar touch only the upper side
of the style on which they must alight but the anthers waste
pollen by shedding it on all sides no insect can take shelter
from rain or pass the night in this flower as he frequently does
in its more hospitable relative the harebell english gardeners
more appreciative than our own of our native flora frequently

insignificant earlier flowers which although they have never

to the evolutionist ever on the lookout for connecting links
the lobelias form an interesting group because their corolla
slit down the upper side and somewhat flattened shows the
beginning of the tendency toward the strap or ray flowers that
are nearly confined to the composites of much later development
of course than tubular single blossoms next to massing their
flowers in showy heads as the composites do the lobelias have
the almost equally advantageous plan of crowding theirs along a
stem so as to make a conspicuous advertisement to attract the
passing bee and to offer him the special inducement of numerous
feeding places close together
the handsome great lobelia constantly and invidiously compared
with its gorgeous sister the cardinal flower suffers unfairly
when asked what his favorite color was eugene field replied
why i like any color at all so long as its red most men at
least agree with him and certainly hummingbirds do our
scarcity of red flowers being due we must believe to the
scarcity of hummingbirds which chiefly fertilize them but how
bees love the blue blossoms
there are many cases where the pistil of a flower necessarily
comes in contact with its own pollen yet fertilization does not
take place however improbable this may appear most orchids for
example are not susceptible to their own pollen it would seem
as if our lobelia in elevating its stigma through the ring
formed by the united anthers must come in contact with some of
the pollen they have previously discharged from their tips not
only on the bumblebee that shakes it out of them when he jars the
flower but also within the tube but when the anthers are
mature the two lobes of the still immature stigma are pressed
together and cannot be fertilized nevertheless the hairy tips
of some of the anthers brush off the pollen grains that may have
lodged on the stigma as it passes through the ring in its ascent
thus making surety doubly sure only after the stigma projects
beyond the ring of anthers does it expand its lobes which are
now ready to receive pollen brought from another later flower by
the incoming bumblebee to which it is adapted

habitat as the last species this blazing star is a later
bloomer coming into flower in august and helping the goldenrods
and asters brighten the landscape throughout the early autumn
the name of gay feather miscellaneously applied to several
blazing stars is especially deserved by this showy beauty of the
family
unlike others of its class the dense button snakeroot devils
bit rough or backache root prairie pine or throatwort l
spicata the commonest species we have chooses moist soil even
salt marshes near the coast and low meadows throughout a range
nearly corresponding with that of the scaly blazing star
resembling its relatives in general manner of growth we note
that its oblong involucre rounded at the base has blunt not
sharply pointed bracts that the flowerheads are densely set
close to the wand for from four to fifteen inches that the five
to thirteen bright rosepurple florets which compose each head
occasionally come white that its leaves are long and very
narrow and that october is not too late to find the plant in
bloom
blue and purple asters or starworts
  thistle family
evolution teaches us that thistles daisies sunflowers asters
and all the triumphant horde of composites were once very
different flowers from what we see today through ages of natural
selection of the fittest among their ancestral types having
finally arrived at the most successful adaptation of their
various parts to their surroundings in the whole floral kingdom
they are now overrunning the earth doubtless the asters remote
ancestors were simple green leaves around the vital organs and
depended upon the wind as the grasses do  a most extravagant
method  to transfer their pollen then some rudimentary flower
changed its outer row of stamens into petals which gradually
took on color to attract insects and insure a more economical
method of transfer gardeners today take advantage of a blossoms
natural tendency to change stamens into petals when they wish to
produce double flowers as flowers and insects developed side by
side and there came to be a better and better understanding
between them of each others requirements mutual adaptation
followed the flower that offered the best advertisement as the
composites do by its showy rays that secreted nectar in tubular
flowers where no useless insect could pilfer it that fastened
its stamens to the inside wall of the tube where they must dust
with pollen the underside of every insect unwittingly
crossfertilizing the blossom as he crawled over it that massed
a great number of these tubular florets together where insects
might readily discover them and feast with the least possible
loss of time  this flower became the winner in lifes race
small wonder that our june fields are white with daisies and the
autumn landscape is glorified with goldenrod and asters
since north america boasts the greater part of the two hundred
and fifty asters named by scientists and as variations in many
of our common species frequently occur the tyro need expect no
easy task in identifying every one he meets afield however the
following are possible acquaintances to everyone
in dry shady places the large or broadleaved aster a
macrophyllus so called from its three or four conspicuous
heartshaped leaves on long petioles in a clump next the ground
may be more easily identified by these than by the pale lavender
or violet flowerheads of about sixteen rays each which crown its
reddish angular stem in august and september the disk turns
reddish brown
in prairie soil especially about the edges of woods in western
new york southward and westward to texas and minnesota the
beautiful skyblue aster a azureus blooms from august till
after frost its slender stiff rough stem branches above to
display the numerous bright blue flowers whose ten to twenty
rays measure only about a quarter of an inch in length the upper
leaves are reduced to small flat bracts the next are linear and
the lower ones which approach a heart shape are rough on both
sides and may be five or six inches long
much more branched and bushy is the common blue branching wood
or heartleaved aster a cordifolius whose generous masses of
small pale lavender flowerheads look like a mist hanging from
one to five feet above the earth in and about the woods and shady
roadsides from september even to december in favored places
the wavy or variousleaved aster or small fleabane a undulatus
has a stiff rough hairy widely branching stalk whose thick
rough lowest leaves are heartshaped and set on long footstems
above these the leaves have shorter stems dilating where they
clasp the stalk the upper leaves lacking stems are seated on
it while those of the branches are shaped like tiny awls the
flowers which measure less than an inch across often grow along
one side of an axis as well as in the usual raceme eight to
fifteen pale blue to violet rays surround the disks which yellow
at first become reddish brown in maturity we find the plant in
dry soil blooming in september and october
by no means tardy the late purple aster socalled or purple
daisy a patens begins to display its purplishblue
daisylike flowerheads early in august and farther north may be
found in dry exposed places only until october rarely the
solitary flowers that are an inch across or more are a deep
rich violet the twenty to thirty rays which surround the disk
curling inward to dry expose the vaseshaped green shingled
cups that terminate each little branch the thick somewhat
rigid oblong leaves tapering at the tip broaden at the base to
clasp the rough slender stalk range similar to the next
species
certainly from massachusetts northern new york and minnesota
southward to the gulf of mexico one may expect to find the new
england aster or starwort a novaeangliae one of the most
striking and widely distributed of the tribe in spite of its
local name it is not unknown in canada the branching clusters
of violet or magentapurple flowerheads from one to two inches
across  composites containing as many as forty to fifty purple
ray florets around a multitude of perfect fivelobed tubular
yellow disk florets in a sticky cup  shine out with royal
splendor above the swamps moist fields and roadsides from
august to october the stout bristlehairy stem bears a quantity
of alternate lanceshaped leaves lobed at the base where they
clasp it
in even wetter ground we find the redstalked purplestemmed or
early purple aster cocash swanweed or meadow scabish a
puniceus blooming as early as july or as late as november its
stout rigid stem bristling with rigid hairs may reach a height
of eight feet to display the branching clusters of pale violet or
lavender flowers the long bladelike leaves usually very rough
above and hairy along the midrib beneath are seated on the stem
the lovely smooth or blue aster a laevis whose skyblue or
violet flowerheads about one inch broad are common through
september and october in dry soil and open woods has strongly
clasping oblong tapering leaves rough margined but rarely
with a sawtooth toward the top of the stem while those low
down on it gradually narrow into clasping wings
in dry sandy soil mostly near the coast from massachusetts to
delaware grows one of the loveliest of all this beautiful clan
the low showy or seaside purple aster a spectabilis the
stiff usually unbranched stem does its best in attaining a
height of two feet above the leaves are bladelike or narrowly
oblong seated on the stem whereas the tapering oval basal
leaves are furnished with long footstems as is customary with
most asters the handsome bright violetpurple flowerheads
measuring about an inch and a half across have from fifteen to
thirty rays or only about half as many as the familiar new
england aster season august to november
the lowgrowing bog aster a nemoralis not to be confused with
the much taller redstalked species often found growing in the
same swamp and having like it flowerheads measuring about an
inch and a half across has rays that vary from light violet
purple to rose pink its oblong to lanceshaped leaves only two
inches long at best taper to a point at both ends and are
seated on the stem we look for this aster in sandy bogs from new
jersey northward and westward during august and september
the stiff or savoryleaved aster sandpaper or pine starwort
ionactis linariifolius now separated from the other asters
into a genus by itself is a low branching little plant with no
basal leaves but some that are very narrow and bladelike
rigid entire and onenerved ascending the stiff stems the
leaves along the branches are minute and awlshaped like those
on a branch of pine only from ten to fifteen violet ray flowers
pistillate surround the perfect disk florets from quebec to
the gulf of mexico and westward beyond the mississippi this prim
little shrub grows in tufts on dry or rocky soil and blooms from
july to october

like an aster blooming long before its season robins plantain
wears a finely cut lavender fringe around a yellow disk of minute
florets but one of the first not the last in the long
procession of composites has appeared when we see gay companies
of these flowers nodding their heads above the grass in the
spring breezes as if they were village gossips
doubtless it was the necessity for attracting insects which led
the robins plantain and other composites to group a quantity of
minute florets each one of which was once an independent
detached blossom into a common head in union there is strength
each floret still contains however its own tiny drop of nectar
its own stamens its own pistil connected with embryonic seed
below therefore when an insect alights where he can get the
greatest amount of nectar for the least effort and turns round
and round to exhaust each nectary he is sure to dust the pistils
with pollen and so fertilize an entire flowerhead in a trice
the lavender fringe and the hairy involucre and stem serve the
end of discouraging crawling insects which cannot transfer
pollen from plant to plant from pilfering sweets that cannot be
properly paid for small wonder that although the composites
have attained to their socialistic practices at a comparatively
recent day as evolutionists count time they have become as
individuals and as species the most numerous in the world the
thistle family dominant everywhere containing not less than ten
thousand members
common or philadelphia fleabane or skevish e philadelphicus
a smaller edition of robins plantain with a more findely cut
fringe its reddishpurple ray florets often numbering one
hundred and fifty may be found in low fields and woods

thistles
  carduus  thistle family
is land fulfilling the primal curse because it brings forth
thistles so thinks the farmer no doubt but not the goldfinches
which daintily feed among the fluffy seeds nor the bees nor the
painted lady which may be seen in all parts of the world where
thistles grow hovering about the beautiful rosepurple flowers
in the prickly cradle of leaves the caterpillar of this thistle
butterfly weaves a web around its main food store
when the danes invaded scotland they stole a silent night march
upon the scottish camp by marching barefoot but a dane
inadvertently stepped on a thistle and his sudden sharp cry
arousing the sleeping scots saved them and their country hence
the scotch emblem
from july to november blooms the common burr spear plume
bank horse bull blue button bell or roadside thistle
c lanceolatus or circium lanceolatum of gray a native of
europe and asia now a most thoroughly naturalized american from
newfoundland to georgia westward to nebraska its violet
flowerheads about an inch and a half across and as high as
wide are mostly solitary at the ends of formidable branches up
which few crawling creatures venture but in the deep tube of
each floret there is nectar secreted for the flying visitor who
can properly transfer pollen from flower to flower such a one
suffers no inconvenience from the prickles but on the contrary
finds a larger feast saved for him because of them dense
matted woollike hairs that cover the bristling stems of most
thistles make climbing mighty unpleasant for ants which ever
delight in pilfering sweets perhaps one has the temerity to
start upward
     fain would i climb yet fear to fall
     if thy heart fail thee climb not at all
might be the ants passionate outburst to the thistle and the
thistles reply instead of a sir walter and queen elizabeth
couplet long lanceshaped deeply cleft sharply pointed and
prickly dark green leaves make the ascent almost unendurable
nevertheless the ant bravely mounts to where the bristlepointed
overlapping scales of the deep green cup hold the luscious
flowers now his feet becoming entangled in the cottony fibers
wound about the scaly armor and a bristling bodyguard thrusting
spears at him in his struggles to escape death happily releases
him all this tragedy to insure the thistles crossfertilized
seed that seated on the autumn winds shall be blown far and
wide in quest of happy conditions for the offspring
sometimes the pasture or fragrant thistle c odoratus or c
pumilum of gray still further protects its beautiful odorous
purple or whitish flowerhead that often measures three inches
across with a formidable array of prickly small leaves just
below it in case a wouldbe pilferer breaks through these lines
however there is a slight glutinous strip on the outside of the
bracts that compose the cup wherein the nectarfilled florets are
packed and here in sight of mecca he meets his death just as
a bird is caught on limed twigs the pasture thistle whose range
is only from maine to delaware blooms from july to september
even gentle professor gray hurls anathema at the canada thistle
a vile pest he calls it as cursed corn hard and creeping
thistle it is variously known here and in europe whence it came
to overrun our land from newfoundland to virginia westward to
nebraska by horizontal rootstocks it creeps and forms patches
almost impossible to eradicate the small reddishpurple
flowerheads barely an inch across usually contain about a
hundred florets each in their tubes the abundant nectar rises
high so that numerous insects even with the shortest tongues
are able to enjoy it not only bees and butterflies but wasps
flies and beetles feast diligently when a floret opens a
quantity of pollen emerges at the upper end of the anther
cylinder pressed up by the growing style owing to their slight
stickiness and the sharp processes over their entire surface the
pollen grains which readily cling to the hairs of insects are
transported to the twobranched hairy stigma of an older floret
but even should insects not visit the flower and in fine weather
they swarm about it it is marvelously adapted to fertilize
itself farmers may well despair of exterminating a plant so
perfectly equipped in every part to win lifes battles
the colour of purplewas amongst the ancients typical of
royalty it was a kind of red richly shot with blue and the dye
producing it was attained from a shell found in considerable
numbers off the coast of tyre and on the shore near the site of
that ancient city great heaps of such shells are still to be
found the production of the true royal purple dye was a very
costly affair and therefore it was often imitated with a mixture
of cochineal and indigo  j james tissot
as many socalled purple flowers are more strictly magenta the
reader is referred to the next group if he has not found the
flower for which he is in search here also to the white and
greenish section since many colored flowers show a tendency to
revert to the white type from which doubtless all were evolved
he should remember that all flowers are more or less variable in
shade according to varying conditions

botany is a sequel of murder and a chronicle of the dead 
julian hawthorne
a plant is not to be studied as an absolutely dead thing but
rather as a sentient being to measure petals to count
stamens to describe pistils without reference to their
functions or the why and wherefore of their existence is to
content ones self with husks in the presence of a feast of
fatness  to listen to the rattle of dry bones rather than the
heavenly harmonies of life we have reason to be profoundly
thankful for the signs to be seen on every side that the dreary
stuff which was called botany in the teaching of the past will
soon cease to masquerade in its stolen costume and that our
children and our childrens children will study not dried
specimens or drier books but the living things which nature
furnishes in such profusion
the reason of this radical change is not far to seek since man
has learned that the universal brotherhood of life includes
himself as the highest link in the chain of organic creation his
interest in all things that live and move and have a being has
greatly increased the movements of the monad now appeal to him
in a way that was impossible under the old conceptions he sees
in each of the millions of living forms with which the earth is
teeming the action of many of the laws which are operating in
himself and has learned that to a great extent his welfare is
dependent on these seemingly insignificant relations that in
ways undreamed of a century ago they affect human progress

because most people cannot forbear picking this exquisite flower
that seems too beautiful to be found outside a millionaires
hothouse it is becoming rarer every year until the finding of
one in the deep forest where it must now hide has become the
event of a days walk once it was the commonest of the orchids
crossfertilization says darwin results in offspring which
vanquish the offspring of selffertilization in the struggle for
existence this has been the motto of the orchid family for
ages no group of plants has taken more elaborate precautions
against selfpollination or developed more elaborate and
ingenious mechanism to compel insects to transfer their pollen
than this
the fissure down the front of the pink ladys slipper is not so
wide but that a bee must use some force to push against its
elastic sloping sides and enter the large banquet chamber where
he finds generous entertainment secreted among the fine white
hairs in the upper part presently he has feasted enough now one
can hear him buzzing about inside trying to find a way out of
the trap toward the two little gleams of light through apertures
at the end of a passage beyond the nectary hairs he at length
finds his way narrower and narrower grows the passage until it
would seem as if he could never struggle through nor can he
until his back has rubbed along the sticky overhanging stigma
which is furnished with minute rigid sharply pointed papillae
all directed forward and placed there for the express purpose of
combing out the pollen he has brought from another flower on his
back or head the imported pollen having been safely removed he
still has to struggle on toward freedom through one of the narrow
openings where an anther almost blocks his way
as he works outward this anther drawn downward on its hinge
plasters his back with yellow granular pollen as a parting gift
and away he flies to another ladys slipper to have it combed out
by the sticky stigma as described above the smallest bees can
squeeze through the passage without paying toll to those of the
andrena and halictus tribe the flower is evidently best adapted
sometimes the largest bumblebees either unable or unwilling to
get out by the legitimate route bite their way to liberty
mutilated sacs are not uncommon but when unable to get out by
fair means and too bewildered to escape by foul the large bee
must sometimes perish miserably in his gorgeous prison

of the six floral leaves which every orchid terrestrial or

american stomachs outside of hoboken
but an orchid from the amazing cleverness of its operations is
attractive under any circumstances to whomever understands
it this earliest member of the family to appear charms the
female bumblebee to whose anatomy it is especially adapted the
males whose faces are hairy where the females are bare and
therefore not calculated to retain the sticky pollen masses are
not yet flying when the showy orchis blooms bombus americanorum
which can drain the longest spurs b separatus b terricola
and rarely butterflies as well have been caught with its
pollen masses attached the bee alights on the projecting lip
pushes her head into the mouth of the corolla and as she sips
the nectar from the horn of plenty ruptures by the slight
pressure a membrane of the pouch where two sticky buttons to
which two pollen masses are attached lie imbedded instantly
after contact these adhere to the round bare spots on her face
the viscid cement hardening before her head is fairly withdrawn
now the diverging pollen masses that look like antennae fall
from the perpendicular by remarkable power of contraction to a
horizontal attitude that they may be in the precise position to
fertilize the stigma of the next flower visited  just as if they
possessed a reasoning intelligence even after all the pollen has
been deposited on the sticky stigmas of various blossoms
stumplike caudicles to which the two little sacs were attached
have been found still plastered on a longsuffering bee but so
rich in nectar are the moistureloving orchids that to obtain a
draught the sticky plasters which she must carry do not seem too
dear a price to pay in this showy orchis the nectar often rises
an eighth of an inch in the tube and sufficient pressure to
cause a rupture will eject it a foot

entertainment in the nectary beyond so in she goes between the
platform and the column overhead pushing first her head then
brushing her back against the stigma just below the end of the
thick column that almost closes the passage any powdery pollen
she brought on her back from another pogonia must now be brushed
off against the sticky stigma her feast ended out she backs
and now a wonderful thing happens the lid of the anther which is
at the end of the column catching in her shoulders swings
outward on its elastic hinge releasing a little shower of golden
dust which she must carry on the hairs of her head or back until
the sticky stigma of the next pogonia entered kindly wipes it
off this is one of the few orchids whose pollen usually found
in masses is not united by threads without the bees aid in
releasing it from its little box the lovely species would

one flower to a plant and that one rarely maturing seed a
temptingly beautiful prize which few refrain from carrying home
to have it wither on the way pursued by that more persistent
lover than alpheus the orchidhunter who exports the bulbs to
european collectors  little wonder this exquisite orchid is
rare and that from certain of those cranberry bogs of eastern
new england which it formerly brightened with its vivid pink it
has now gone forever like arethusa the nymph whom diana changed
into a fountain that she might escape from the infatuated river
god linnaeus fancied this flower a maiden in the midst of a
spring bubbling from wet places where presumably none may follow
her
but the bee our arethusas devoted lover although no villain
still pursues her he knows that moistureloving plants secrete
the most nectar when the head of the bee enters the flower to
sip nothing happens but as he raises his head to depart it
cannot help lifting the lid of the helmetshaped anther and so
letting fall a few soft pellets of pollen on it now after he
has drained the next arethusa his pollenladen head must rub
against the long sticky stigma before it touches the helmetlike
anther lid and precipitates another volley of pollen in some
such manner most of our orchids compel insects to work for them
in preventing selffertilization
another charming but much smaller orchid that we must don our
rubber boots to find where it hides in cool peaty bogs from
canada and the northern united states to california and

top of a jointed scape that never rises more than six inches from

fortunately this lovely orchid one of the most interesting of
its highly organized family is far from rare and where we find
the rose pogonia and other bogloving relatives growing the
calopogon usually outnumbers them all limodorum translated reads
meadowgift but we find the flower less frequently in grassy
places than those who have waded into its favorite haunts could
wish
owing to the crested lip being oddly situated on the upper part
of the flower which appears to be growing upside down in
consequence one might suppose a visiting insect would not choose
to alight on it the pretty clubshaped varicolored hairs
which he may mistake for stamens and which keep his feet from
slipping irresistibly invite him there however when presto
down drops the fringed lip with startling suddenness of course
the bee strikes his back against the column when he falls now
there are two slightly upturned little wings on either side of
the column which keep his body from slipping off at either side
and necessitate its exit from the end where the stigma smears it
with viscid matter the pressure of the insect on this part
starts the pollen masses from their pocket just below and as the
bee slides off the end of the column the exposed cobwebby
threads to which the pollen grains are attached cling to his
sticky body the sticky substance instantly hardening the pollen
masses which are drawn out from their pocket as he escapes are
cemented to his abdomen in the precise spot where they must
strike against the stigma of the next calopogon he tumbles in
hence crossfertilization results what recompense does the bee
get for such rough handling none at all so far as is known the
flower which secretes no nectar is doubtless one of those gay
deceivers that sprengel named scheinsaftblumen only it leads
its visitors to look for pollen instead of nectar on the
supposition that the clubshaped hairs on the crests are stamens
the wonder is that the intelligent little bees a species of
andrenidae which chiefly are its victims have not yet learned
to boycott it
calopogon says professor robertson who knows more about the
fertilization of american wild flowers by insects than most
writers is one of a few flowers which move the insect toward
the stigma there is no expenditure in keeping up a supply of
nectar and the flower although requiring a smooth insect of a
certain size and weight suffers nothing from the visits of those
it cannot utilize then there is no delay caused by the insect
waiting to suck but as soon as it alights it is thrown down
against the stigma this occurs so quickly that while standing
net in hand i have seen insects effect pollination and escape
before i could catch them so many orchids fasten their pollinia
upon the faces and tongues of insects that it is interesting to
find one which applies them regularly to the first abdominal
segment mr darwin has observed that absence of hair on the
tongues of lepidoptera butterflies and moths and on the faces
of hymenoptera bees wasps etc has led to the more usual
adaptations and sparseness of hair has its influence in this
case species of augochlora are the only insects on which i found
pollinia these bees are very smooth depending for ornament on
the metallic sheen of their bodies an halictus repeatedly pulled
down the labella lips of flowers from which pollinia had not
been removed and the only reason i can assign for its failure to
extract pollinia is that it is more hairy than the augochlora

similar kin the erect pink spikes brightening roadsides rubbish
heaps fields and waste places from midsummer to frost the
little flowers which open without method anywhere on the spike
they choose attract many insects the smaller bees andrena
conspicuous among the host as the spreading divisions of the
perianth make nectarstealing all too easy for ants and other
crawlers that would not come in contact with anthers and stigma
where they enter a flower near its base most buckwheat plants
whose blossoms secrete sweets protect themselves from theft by
coating the upper stems with glandular hairs that effectually
discourage the pilferers shortly after fertilization the little
rounded flatsided fruit begins to form inside the persistent
pink calyx at any time the spikelike racemes contain more
bright pink buds and shining seeds than flowers familiarity
alone breeds contempt for this plant that certainly possesses
much beauty
the ladys thumb p persicaria often a troublesome weed roams
over the whole of north america except at the extreme north 
another illustration of the riotous profusion of european floral
immigrants rejoicing in the easier struggle for existence here
its pink spikes are shorter and less slender than those of the
preceding taller but similar species and its leaves which are
nearly seated on the stem have dark triangular or lunar marks
near the center in the majority of cases
an insignificant little plant found all over our continent
europe and asia is the familiar knotgrass or doorweed p
aviculare often trailing its leafy jointed stems over the
ground but at times weakly erect to display its tiny greenish
or white pinkedged flowers clustered in the axils of oblong
bluishgreen leaves that are considerably less than an inch long
although in bloom from june to october insects seldom visit it
for it secretes very little if any nectar as might be expected
in such a case its stem is smooth
when the amphibious water persicaria p amphibium lifts its
short dense rosecolored ovoid or oblong club of bloom above
ponds and lakes it is sufficiently protected from crawling
pilferers of course by the water in which it grows but suppose
the pond dries up and the plant is left on dry ground what then
now a remarkable thing happens protective glandular sticky
hairs appear on the epidermis of the leaves and stems which were
perfectly smooth when the flowers grew in water such small
wingless insects as might pilfer nectar without bringing to their
hostess any pollen from other blossoms are held as fast as on
birdlime the stem which sometimes floats sometimes is
immersed may attain a length of twenty feet the rounded
elliptic petioled leaves may be four inches long or only half
that size from quebec to new jersey and westward to the
pacific the solitary showy inflorescence which does well to
attain a height of an inch may be found during july and august
throughout the summer narrow terminal erect spikelike
racemes of small pale pink fleshcolored or greenish flowers
are sent upward by the mild water pepper p hydropiperoides it
is like a slender pale variety of the common pink persicaria
one finds its inconspicuous but very common flowers from june
to september the plant which grows in shallow water swamps
and moist places throughout the union and considerably north and
south of it rises three feet or less the cylindric sheaths
around the swollen joints of the stem are fringed with long
bristles  a clue to identification another similar water pepper
or smartweed p hydropiper is so called because of its acrid
biting juice
the climbing false buckwheat p scandens straggles over bushes
in woods thickets and by the waysides throughout a very wide
range yet its small dull greenishyellow and pinkish flowers
loosely clustered in long pedicelled racemes are so
inconspicuous during august and september when the showy
composites are in their glory that we give them scarcely a
glance the alternate leaves which are heartshaped at the base
and pointed at the lip suggesting those of the morning glory
are on petioles arising from sheaths over the enlarged joints
which in this family are always a most prominent characteristic

the arrowleaved tear thumb p sagittatum found in ditches and
swampy wet soil weakly leans on other plants or climbs over
them with the help of the many sharp recurved prickles which arm
its fourangled stem even the petioles and underside of the

job after solemnly protesting his righteousness called on his
own land to bear record against him if his words were false let
thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley he
cried according to james the firsts translators but the
noisome weeds of the original text seem to indicate that these
good men were more anxious to give the english people an adequate
conception of jobs willingness to suffer for his honors sake
than to translate literally possibly the cockle grew in southern
asia in jobs time  today its range is north
like many another immigrant to our hospitable shores this
vigorous invader shows a tendency to outstrip native blossoms in
lifes race having won in the struggle for survival in the old
country where the contest has been most fiercely waged for
centuries it finds life here easy enjoyable what are its
methods for insuring an abundance of fertile seed we see that
the tube of the flower is so nearly closed by the stamens and
fivestyled pistil as to be adapted only to the long slender
tongues of moths and butterflies for which benefactors it became
narrow and deep to reserve the nectar a certain nightflying
moth one of the dianthaecia fertilizes flowers of this genus
exclusively and its larvae feed on their unripe seeds as a
staple bees and some longtongued flies seen about the corn
cockle doubtless get pollen only but there are few flowers so
deep that the longesttongued bees cannot sip them butterflies
attracted by the bright color of the flower  and to them color
is the most catchy of advertisements  are guided by a few dark
lines on the petals to the nectary
soon after the blossom opens five of the stamens emerge from the
tube and shed their pollen on the early visitor later the five
other stamens empty the contents of their anthers on more tardy
comers finally when all danger of selffertilization is past
the styles stretch upward and the butterfly whose head is
dusted with pollen brought from earlier flowers necessarily
leaves some on their sticky surfaces as he takes the leavings in
the nectary
so much crossfertilized seed as the plant now produces and
scatters through the grain fields may well fill the farmers
prosaic mind with despair to him there is no glory in the
scarlet of the poppy comparable with the glitter of a silver
dollar no charm in the heavenly blue of the cornflower that
likewise preys upon the fertility of his soil the vivid flecks
of color with which the cockle lights up his fields mean only
loss of productiveness in the earth that would yield him greater
profit without them moreover seeds of this socalled weed not
only darken his wheat when they are threshed out together but
are positively injurious if swallowed in any quantity emerson

fresh dainty and innocentlooking as spring herself are these
bright flowers alas for the tiny creatures that try to climb up
the rosy tufts to pilfer nectar they and their relatives are not
so innocent as they appear while the little crawlers are almost
within reach of the cup of sweets their feet are gummed to the
viscid matter that coats it and here their struggles end as
flies do on sticky flypaper or birds on limed twigs a
naturalist counted sixtytwo little corpses on the sticky stem of
a single pink all this tragedy to protect a little nectar for
the butterflies which in sipping it transfer the pollen from
one flower to another and so help them to produce the most
beautiful and robust offspring
the pink which has two sets of stamens of five each elevates
first one set then the other for economys sake and to run less
risk of failure to get its pollen transferred in case of rain
when its friends are not flying after all the golden dust has
been shed however up come the three recurved styles from the

these bright spires of pink bloom attract our attention no less
than the countless eyes of flies beetles and bees ever on the
lookout for food to be eaten on the spot or stored up for future
progeny pollenfeeding insects such as these delight in the
spireas most of which secrete little or no nectar but yield an
abundance of pollen which they can gather from the crowded
panicles with little loss of time transferring some of it to the
pistils of course as they move over the tiny blossoms but most
spireas are also able to fertilize themselves insects failing
them
an instants comparison shows the steeple bush to be closely
related to the fleecy white meadowsweet often found growing
near the pink spires which bloom from the top downward have
pale brown tips where the withered flowers are toward the end of
summer
why is the under side of the leaves so woolly not as a
protection against wingless insects crawling upward that is
certain for such could only benefit these tiny clustered
flowers not against the suns rays for it is only the under
surface that is coated when the upper leaf surface is hairy we
know that the plant is protected in this way from perspiring too
freely doubtless these leaves of the steeple bush like those of
other plants that choose a similar habitat have woolly hairs
beneath as an absorbent to protect their pores from clogging with
the vapors that must rise from the damp ground where the plant
grows if these pores were filled with moisture from without how
could they possibly throw off the waste of the plant all plants
are largely dependent upon free perspiration for health but
especially those whose roots struck in wet ground are
constantly sending up moisture through the stem and leaves

to be an unappreciated unloved relative of the exquisite wild

raspberry burst forth above the roadside tangle and shady
woodland dells even those who despise magenta see beauty in them

purple as we of today understand the color the flower is not

the petals are a deep clear purplish rose that soon fades and

ring between the filaments and the base of the receptacle
bumblebees the principal and most efficient visitors which can

others help to selffertilize the flower bring to the mature
stigmas of a newly opened blossom pollen carried on their
undersides from the anthers of a flower a day or two older when
the inner row of anthers shed their pollen some doubtless falls

wild roses
  rosa  rose family
just as many members of the lily tribe show a preference for the
rule of three in the arrangements of their floral parts so the
wild roses cling to the quinary method of some primitive
ancestor a favorite one also with the buttercup and many of its
kin the geraniums mallows and various others most of our
fruit trees and bushes are near relatives of the rose five
petals and five sepals then we always find on roses in a state
of nature and although the progressive gardener of today has
nowhere shown his skill more than in the development of a
multitude of petals from stamens in the magnificent roses of
fashionable society the most highly cultivated darling of the
greenhouses quickly reverts to the original wild type setting
his work of years at naught if once it regain its natural
liberties through neglect
to protect its foliage from being eaten by hungry cattle the
rose goes armed into the battle of life with curved sharp
prickles not true thorns or modified branches but merely
surface appliances which peel off with the bark to destroy
crawling pilferers of pollen several species coat their calices
at least with fine hairs or sticky gum and to insure wide
distribution of offspring the seeds are packed in the
attractive bright red calyx tube or hip a favorite food of many
birds which drop them miles away when shall we ever learn that
not even a hair has been added to or taken from a blossom without
a lawful cause and study it accordingly fragrance abundant
pollen and brightcolored petals naturally attract many insects
but roses secrete no nectar some species of bees and a common
beetle trichius piger for example seem to depend upon certain
wild roses exclusively for pollen to feed themselves and their
larvae bumblebees to which roses are adapted require a firmer
support than the petals would give and so alight on the center
of the flower where the pistil receives pollen carried by them
from other roses although the numerous stamens and the pistils
mature simultaneously the former are usually turned outward
that the incoming pollenladen insect may strike the stigma
first when the large bees cease their visits as they may in
longcontinued dull or rainy weather the rose turning toward
the sun stands more or less obliquely and some of the pollen
must fall on its stigma occasional selffertilization matters

leaves compounded of three rarely five oval leaflets acute or
obtuse at the apex stalks and calyx often glandular odorless

perhaps only a foot high it is armed with stout hooked rather
distant prickles and few or no bristles the leaflets from five

perhaps hairy beneath to protect the pores from filling with
moisture arising from the wet ground long sharp calyx lobes
which drop off before the cup swells in fruit into a round
glandular hairy red hip are conspicuous among the clustered
pink flowers and buds

pink or white roses because it lacks the fragrance of
sweetbrier which it otherwise closely resembles it has been
branded with the dog prefix as a mark of contempt professor koch

and rapturous enjoyment bumblebees by the tens of thousands
buzzing above acres of the farmers clover blossoms should be
happy in a knowledge of their benefactions which doubtless
concern them not at all they have never heard the story of the
australians who imported quantities of clover for fodder and had
glorious fields of it that season but not a seed to plant next
years crops simply because the farmers had failed to import the
bumblebee after her immigration the clovers multiplied
prodigiously no the bees happiness rests on her knowledge that
only the butterflies long tongues can honestly share with her
the brimming wells of nectar in each tiny floret children who
have sucked them too appreciate her rapture if we examine a
little flower under the magnifying glass we shall see why its
structure places it in the pea family bumblebees so depress the
keel either when they sip or feed on pollen that their heads
and tongues get well dusted with the yellow powder which they
transfer to the stigmas of other flowers whereas the butterflies
are of doubtful value if not injurious since their long
slender tongues easily drain the nectar without depressing the
keel even if a few grains of pollen should cling to their
tongues it would probably be wiped off as they withdrew them
through the narrow slit where the petals nearly meet at the
mouth of the flower bombus terrestris delights in nipping holes
at the base of the tube which other pilferers also profit by
our country is so much richer in butterflies than europe it is
scarcely surprising that professor robertson found thirteen

and the sulphurs are always seen about the clover fields among
many others and the dusky wings and the caterpillar of several
species feeds almost exclusively on this plant
to live in clover from the insects point of view at least
may well mean a life of luxury and affluence most peasants in
europe will tell you that a dream about the flower foretells not
only a happy marriage but long life and prosperity for ages the
clover has been counted a mystic plant and all sorts of good and
bad luck were said to attend the finding of variations of its
leaves which had more than the common number of leaflets at
evening these leaflets fold downward the side ones like two
hands clasped in prayer the end one bowed over them in this
fashion the leaves of the white and other clovers also go to
sleep to protect their sensitive surfaces from cold by
radiation it is thought

peduncle in which its heads are elevated above the calyx

springing upward from a mass of cloverlike leaves these showy
little blossoms elevate themselves to arrest not our attention
but the notice of the passing bee as the claw of the standard
petal and the calyx are short he need not have a long tongue to
drain the nectary pointed out to him by a triangular white mark
at the base of the banner now as his weight depresses the
incurved keel wherein the vital organs are protected the stigma
strikes the visitor in advance of the anthers so that pollen
brought on his underside from another flower must come off on
this one before he receives fresh pollen to transfer to a third
blossom at first the keel returns to its original position when
depressed later it loses its elasticity but besides these showy
flowers intended to be crossfertilized by insects the bush
clovers bear among the others insignificantlooking tightly
closed budlike ones that produce abundant selffertilized seed
the petaliferous flowers are simply to counteract the inevitable
evils resulting from close inbreeding one usually finds

sprengel who was the first to exalt flowers above the level of
mere botanical specimens had his attention led to the intimate
relationship existing between plants and insects by studying out
the meaning of the hairy corolla of the common wild geranium of
germany g sylvaticum being convinced as he wrote in 1787
that the wise author of nature has not made even a single hair
without a definite design a hundred years before nehemias grew
had said that it was necessary for pollen to reach the stigma of
a flower in order that it might set fertile seed and linnaeus
had to come to his aid with conclusive evidence to convince a
doubting world that this was true sprengel made the next step
forward but his writings lay neglected over seventy years
because he advanced the then incredible and only partially true
statement that a flower is fertilized by insects which carry its
pollen from its anthers to its stigma in spite of his
discoveries that the hairs inside the geraniums corolla protect
its nectar from rain for the insects benefit just as eyebrows
keep perspiration from falling into the eye that most flowers
which secrete nectar have what he termed honey guides  spots
of bright color heavy veining or some such pathfinder on the
petals  in spite of the most patient and scientific research
that shed great light on natural selection a halfcentury before
darwin advanced the theory he left it for the author of the
origin of species to show that crossfertilization  the
transfer of pollen from one blossom to another not from anthers
to stigma of the same flower  is the great end to which so much
marvelous mechanism is chiefly adapted crossfertilized blossoms
defeat selffertilized flowers in the struggle for existence
no wonder sprengels theory was disproved by his scornful
contemporaries in the very case of his wild geranium which sheds
its pollen before it has developed a stigma to receive any
therefore no insect that had not brought pollen from an earlier
bloom could possibly fertilize this flower how amazing that he
did not see this our common wild cranesbill which also has
lost the power to fertilize itself not only ripens first the
outer then the inner row of anthers but actually drops them
off after their pollen has been removed to overcome the barest
chance of selffertilization as the stigmas become receptive
this is the geraniums and many other flowers method to compel
crossfertilization by insects in cold stormy cloudy weather a
geranium blossom may remain in the male stage several days before
becoming female while on a warm sunny day when plenty of
insects are flying the change sometimes takes place in a few
hours among others the common sulphur or puddle butterfly that
sits in swarms on muddy roads and makes the clover fields gay
with its bright little wings pilfers nectar from the geranium
without bringing its long tongue in contact with the pollen
neither do the smaller bees and flies which alight on the petals
necessarily come in contact with the anthers and stigmas
doubtless the larger bees are the flowers true benefactors
the socalled geraniums in cultivation are pelargoniums strictly
speaking

who was the robert for whom this his holy herb was named many
suppose that he was st robert a benedictine monk to whom the
twentyninth of april  the day the plant comes into flower in
europe  is dedicated others assert that robert duke of
normandy for whom the ortus sanitatis a standard medical
guide for some hundred of years was written is the man honored
and since there is now no way of deciding the mooted question we
may take our choice
only when the stems are young are they green later the plant
well earns the name of red shanks and when its leaves show
crimson stains of dragons blood
at any time the herb gives forth a disagreeable odor but
especially when its leaves and stem have been crushed until they
emit a resinous secretion once an alleged cure for the plague
flies that never object to a noxious smell constantly visit the
flower and have their tongues guided through passages between
little ridgelike processes on each petal to the nectar secreted
by the base of the filaments at the base of each sepal to
prevent selffertilization the five stigmas are folded close
together when the flower opens nor do they spread apart and
become receptive until after the outer row of anthers then the
inner row have shed their pollen when the elastic carpels have
ripened their seed bang go the little guns scattering them far

clumps of these delicate little pinkish blossoms and abundant
leaves cuddled close to the cold earth of northern forests
usually conceal near the dry leaves or moss from which they
spring blind flowers that never open  cleistogamous the
botanists call them  flowers that lack petals as if they were
immature buds that lack odor nectar and entrance yet they are
perfectly mature selffertilized and abundantly fruitful
fiftyfive genera of plants contain one or more species on which
these peculiar products are found the pea family having more
than any other although violets offer perhaps the most familiar
instance to most of us many of these species bury their
offspring below ground but the woodsorrel bears its blind
flowers nodding from the top of a curved scape at the base of the
plant where we can readily find them by having no petals and
other features assumed by an ordinary flower to attract insects
and chiefly in saving pollen they produce seed with literally
the closest economy it is estimated that the average blind
flower of the woodsorrel does its work with four hundred pollen
grains while the prodigal peony scatters with the help of wind
and insect visitors over three and a half millions
yet no plant however economically inclined can afford to
deteriorate its species through selffertilization therefore to
overcome the evils of inbreeding the woodsorrel like other
plants that bear cleistogamous flowers takes special pains to
produce showy blossoms to attract insects on which they
absolutely depend to transfer their pollen from flower to flower
these have their organs so arranged as to make selffertilization
impossible
every child knows how the woodsorrel goes to sleep by drooping
its three leaflets until they touch back to back at evening
regaining the horizontal at sunrise  a performance most
scientists now agree protects the peculiarly sensitive leaf from
cold by radiation during the day as well seedling scape and
leaves go through some interesting movements closely followed by
darwin in his power of movement in plants which should be read
by all interested
oxalis the greek for sour applies to all sorrels because of
their acid juice but acetosella  vinegar salt the specific

beauty of leaf and blossom is not the only attraction possessed
by this charming little plant as a family the woodsorrels have
great interest for botanists since darwin devoted such exhaustive
study to their power of movement and many other scientists have
described the several forms assumed by perfect flowers of the
same species to secure crossfertilization some members of the
clan also bear blind flowers which have been described in the
account of the white woodsorrel given above even the
rudimentary leaves of the seedlings go to sleep at evening and
during the day are in constant movement up and down the stems
too are restless and as for the mature leaves every child
knows how they droop their three leaflets back to back against
the stem at evening elevating them to the perfect horizontal
again by day extreme sensitiveness to light has been thought to
be the true explanation of so much activity and yet this is not
a satisfactory theory in many cases it is certain that drooping
leaves suffer far less from frost than those whose upper surfaces
are flatly exposed to the zenith this view that the sleep of
leaves saves them from being chilled at night by radiation is
darwins own supported by innumerable experiments and probably
it would have been advanced by linnaeus too since so many of
his observations in somnus plantarum verify the theory had the
principle of radiation been discovered in his day
the violet woodsorrel produces two sorts of perfect flowers
reciprocally adapted to each other but on different plants in
the same neighborhood the two are essentially alike except in
arrangement of stamens and pistil one flower having high anthers
and low stigmas the other having lower anthers and higher
stigmas and as the high stigmas are fertile only when pollenized
with grains from a flower having high anthers it is evident
insect aid to transfer pollen is indispensable here small bees
which visit these blossoms abundantly are their benefactors
although there is nothing to prevent pollen from falling on the
stigmas of the shortstyled form hildebrand proved that
productiveness is greatest or exists only after legitimate
fertilization to accomplish crosspollination many plants bear
flowers of opposite sexes on different individuals but the
violet woodsorrels plan utilized by the bluet and
partridgevine also has the advantage in that both kinds of its
flowers are fruitful

when these bright cloverlike heads and the inconspicuous

gay companies of these charming bright little blossoms hidden
away in the woods suggest a swarm of tiny mauve butterflies that
have settled among the wintergreen leaves unlike the common
milkwort and many of its kin that grow in cloverlike heads each
one of the gay wings has beauty enough to stand alone its oddity
of structure its lovely color and enticing fringe lead one to
suspect it of extraordinary desire to woo some insect that will
carry its pollen from blossom to blossom and so enable the plant
to produce crossfertilized seed to counteract the evil
tendencies resulting from the more prolific selffertilized
cleistogamous flowers buried in the ground below it has been
said that the fringed polygala keeps one flower for beauty and
one for use one playful flower for the world another for
serious use and posterity but surely the showy flowers the
giddy sisters borne by all cleistogamous species to save them
from degenerating through close inbreeding are no idle
irresponsible beauties let us watch a bumblebee as she alights
on the convenient fringe which edges the lower petal of this
milkwort now the weight of her body so depresses the keel or
tubular petals wherein the stamens and pistil lie protected from
the rain and useless insects that as soon as it is pressed
downward a spoontipped pistil pushes out the pollen through the
slit on the top on the bees abdomen the stigmatic surface of
the pistil is on the opposite side of the spoon nearest the base
of the flower to guard against selfpollination after the
pollen has been removed a bumblebee already dusted from other
blossoms must leave some on the stigma as she sucks the nectar

developed for the most serious purpose of life  the salvation of
the species

earth well enriched and moistened as the hollyhock thrives in

marsh mallow althaea officinalis a name frequently misapplied
to the swamp rosemallow is properly given to a much smaller
pink flower measuring only an inch and a half across at the
most and a far rarer one being a naturalized immigrant from
europe found only in the salt marshes from the massachusetts
coast to new york it is also known as wymote this is a bushy
leafy plant two to four feet high and covered with velvety down
as a protection against the clogging of its pores by the moisture
arising from its wet retreats plants that live in swamps must
perspire freely and keep their pores open from the marsh
mallows thick roots the mucilage used in confectionery is
obtained a soothing demulcent long esteemed in medicine another
relative the okra or gumbo plant of vegetable gardens hibiscus
esculentus has mucilage enough in its narrow pods to thicken a
potful of soup its pale yellow crimsoncentered flowers are
quite as beautiful as any hollyhock but not nearly so
conspicuous because of the plants bushy habit of growth in
spite of its name the althaea of our gardens or rose of sharon
hibiscus syriacus is not so closely allied to althaea
officinalis as to the swamp rosemallow
another immigrant from europe and asia sparingly naturalized in
waste places and roadsides in canada the united states and
mexico is the common high mallow cheeseflower or round dock
malva sylvestris its purplishrose flowers from which the
french have derived their word mauve first applied to this
plant appear in small clusters on slender pedicels from the leaf
axils along a leafy rather weak but ascending stem maybe only
a foot high or perhaps a yard throughout the summer months the
leaf borne on a petiole two to six inches long is divided into
from five to nine shallow angular or rounded sawedged lobes
country children eat unlimited quantities of the harmless little
circular flattened cheeses or seed vessels a characteristic
of the genus malva since the flower invites a great number of
insects to feast on its nectar secreted in five little pits
protected for them from the rain by hairs at the base of the
petals and compels its visitors to wipe off pollen brought from
the pyramidal group of anthers in a newly opened blossom to the
exserted radiating stigmas of older ones the mallow produces
more cheeses than all the dairies of the world so rich is its
store of nectar that the hivebee shut out from a legitimate
entrance to the flower when it closes in the late afternoon
climbs up the outside of the calyx and inserting his tongue
between the five petals empties the nectaries one after another
 intelligent rogue that he is
the low dwarf or running mallow m rotundifolia a very
common little weed throughout our territory europe and asia
depends scarcely at all upon insects to transfer its pollen as
might be inferred from its unattractive pale blue to white
flowers that measure only about half an inch across in default
of visitors its pollenladen anthers instead of drooping to get
out of the way of the stigmas as in the showy high mallow
remain extended so as to come in contact with the rough sticky
sides of the long curling stigmas the leaves of this spreading
plant which are nearly round with five to nine shallow
sawedged lobes are thin and furnished with long petioles
whereas the flowers which spring from their axils keep close to
the main stem usually there are about fifteen rounded carpels
that go to make up the dutch doll or fairy cheeses as the seed
vessels are called by children only once is the mallow mentioned
in the bible and then as food for the most abject and despised
poor job 30 4 but as eighteen species of mallow grow in

may safely call the plant musk mallow m moschata and expect
to find it blooming throughout the summer

late in the summer after the rather insignificant pink flowers
have withered this low plant which almost never lacks some
color in its green parts greatly increases its beauty by tinting
stems leaves and seed vessels with red like other members of
the family the flower arranges its stamens in little bundles of
three and when an insect comes to feast on the abundant pollen 
no nectar being secreted  he cannot avoid rubbing some off on
the stigmas that are on a level with the anthers he may
sometimes carry pollen from blossom to blossom it is true but
certainly the stjohnswort takes no adequate precautions
against selffertilization at any time toward the close of its
existence the flower draws its petals together toward the axils
thus bringing anthers and stigmas in contact

through darwins patient study of this trimorphic flower it has
assumed so important a place in his theory of the origin of
species that its fertilization by insects deserves special
attention on page 5 the method by which the pickerel weed
another flower whose stamens and pistil occur in three different
lengths should be read to avoid much repetition now the
loosestrife produces six different kinds of yellow and green
pollen on its two sets of three stamens and when this pollen is
applied by insects to the stigmatic surface of three different
lengths of pistil it follows that there are eighteen ways in
which it may be transferred but darwin proved that only pollen
brought from the shortest stamens to the shortest pistil from
the middlelength stamens to the middlelength pistil and from
the long stamens to the long pistil effectually fertilizes the
flower and as all the flowers on any one plant are of the same
kind we have here a marvelous mechanism to secure
crossfertilization his experiments with this loosestrife also
demonstrated that reproductive organs when of different length
behave to one another like different species of the same genus in
regard both to direct productiveness and the character of the
offspring and that consequently mutual barrenness which was
once thought conclusive proof of difference of species is
worthless as such and the last barrier that was raised between
species and varieties is broken down muller
naturally the brighthued hospitable flower which secretes
abundant nectar at the base of its tube attracts many insects
among others bees of larger and middle size and the butterflies
for which it is especially adapted they alight on the stamens

longest tongues stand on one blossom to sip from the next one
this is the butterflys customary attitude but nearly every

vermilion tubes with blackedged lower lip tipped with white
brighten the borders of so many northern flowerbeds kyphos the
greek for curved from which cuphea was derived has reference to
the peculiar swollen little seedpod from a slit on one side of
the clammy cupheas capsule the placenta set with tiny flattened
seeds sticks out like a handle probably the flower has already
fertilized itself in the bud although from the fact that the
plant has taken such pains to punish crawling insect foes by
coating itself with sticky hairs one might imagine it was wholly
dependent upon winged insects to transfer its pollen what an
unworthy relative of the purple loosestrife whose elaborate
scheme to insure crossfertilization is one of the botanical
wonders

spikes of these beautiful brilliant flowers towering upward above
dry soil particularly where the woodsmans axe and forest fires
have devastated the landscape illustrate natures abhorrence of
ugliness other kindly plants have earned the name of fireweed
but none so quickly beautifies the blackened clearings of the
pioneer nor blossoms over the charred trail in the wake of the
locomotive beginning at the bottom of the long spike the
flowers open in slow succession upward throughout the summer
leaving behind the attractive seedvessels which splitting
lengthwise in september send adrift white silky tufts attached
to seeds that will one day cover far distant wastes with beauty
almost perfect rosettes made by the young plants are met with
on ones winter walks
epi upon and lobos a pod combine to make a name applicable to
many flowers of this family in general structure the fireweed
closely resembles its relative the evening primrose bees not
moths however are its benefactors coming to a newly opened
flower the bee finds abundant pollen on the anthers and a sip of
nectar in the cup below at this stage the flower keeps its still
immature style curved downward and backward lest it should become
selffertilized  an evil ever to be guarded against by ambitious
plants in a few days or after the pollen has been removed up
stretches the style spreading its four receptive stigmas just
where an incoming bee well dusted from a younger flower must
certainly leave some pollen on their sticky surfaces
the great hairy willowherb epilobium hirsutum whose white
tufted seeds came over from europe in the ballast to be blown
over ontario and the eastern states spreads also by underground
shoots until it seems destined to occupy wide areas in these
showy magenta flowers about one inch across the stigmas and
anthers mature simultaneously but crossfertilization is usually
insured because the former surpass the latter and naturally are
first touched by the insect visitor in default of visits
however the stigmas at length curling backward come in contact
with the pollenladen anthers the fireweed on the contrary is
unable to fertilize itself
a pale magentapink or whitish very smallflowered branching

the spotted wintergreen or pipsissewa c maculata closely
resembles the princes pine except that its slightly larger
white or pinkish flowers lack the deep pink ring and the
lanceshaped leaves with rather distant sawteeth are
beautifully mottled with white along the veins when we see
shortlipped bees and flies about these flowers we may be sure
their pollencovered mouths come in contact with the moist stigma

woods and hillsides are glowing with fragrant rosy masses of
this lovely azalea the pinxterbloem or whitsunday flower of the
dutch colonists long before the seventh sunday after easter
among our earliest exports this hardy shrub the swamp azalea
and the superb flamecolored species of the alleghanies were
sent early in the eighteenth century to the old country and
there crossed with a pontica of southern europe by the belgian
horticulturalists to whom we owe the ghent azaleas the final
triumphs of the hybridizer that glorify the shrubberies on our
own lawns today the azalea became the national flower of
flanders these hardy species lose their leaves in winter
whereas the hothouse varieties of a indica a native of china
and japan have thickish leaves almost if not quite evergreen a
few of the latter stand our northern winters especially the pure
white variety now quite commonly planted in cemetery lots in
that delightfully enthusiastic little book the gardens story
mr ellwanger says of the ghent azalea in it i find a charm
presented by no other flower its soft tints of buff sulphur
and primrose its dazzling shades of apricot salmon orange and
vermilion are always a fresh revelation of color they have no
parallel among flowers and exist only in opals sunset skies
and the flush of autumn woods certainly american
horticulturists were not clever in allowing the industry of
raising these plants from our native stock to thrive on foreign
soil
naturally the azaleas protruding style forms the most convenient
alighting place for the female bee its chief friend and there
she leaves a few grains of pollen brought on her hairy underside
from another flower before again dusting herself there as she
crawls over the pretty colored anthers on her way to the nectary
honey produced from azaleas by the hive bee is in bad repute all
too soon after fertilization the now useless corolla slides along
to the tip of the pistil where it swings a while before dropping
to earth
our beautiful wild honeysuckle called naked nudiflora because
very often the flowers appear before the leaves has a peculiar

to of the similar looking but hollow stringy apples growing on
the bushy andromeda which turn black with age
from maine to florida and westward to texas chiefly near the
coast in low wet places only need we look for the swamp pink or

species than the pinxterflower with a very sticky glandular
corolla tube and deliciously fragrant blossoms by no means

when this most magnificent of our native shrubs covers whole
mountain sides throughout the alleghany region with bloom one
stands awed in the presence of such overwhelming beauty nowhere
else does the rhododendron attain such size or luxuriance there
it produces a tall trunk and towers among the trees it spreads
its branches far and wide until they interlock and form almost
impenetrable thickets locally called hells it glorifies the
loneliest mountain road with superb bouquets of its delicate
flowers set among dark glossy foliage scarcely less attractive

rhododendron r catawbiense flourishes this southern shrub
which is perfectly hardy unlike its northern sister has been

so extensively grown on lawns in this country and europe crossed

americans ever too prone to make the eagle scream on their trips
abroad need not monopolize all the glory for the cultivated
rhododendron as they are apt to do when they see it on fine

rhododendrons of brighter hue than ours furnish many of the

it would be well if americans imitating the japanese in making
pilgrimages to scenes of supreme natural beauty visited the
mountains rocky woody hillsides ravines and treegirt uplands
when the laurel is in its glory when masses of its pink and
white blossoms set among the dark evergreen leaves flush the
landscape like aurora and are reflected from the pools of
streams and the serene depths of mountain lakes peter kalm a
swedish pupil of linnaeus who traveled here early in the
eighteenth century was more impressed by its beauty than that of
any other flower he introduced the plant to europe where it is
known as kalmia and extensively cultivated on fine estates that
are thrown open to the public during the flowering season even a
flower is not without honor save in its own country we have
only to prepare a border of leafmould take up the young plant
without injuring the roots or allowing them to dry hurry them
into the ground and prune back the bush a little to establish
it in our gardens where it will bloom freely after the second
year
all the kalmias resort to a most ingenious device for compelling
insect visitors to carry their pollen from blossom to blossom a
newly opened flower has its stigma erected where the incoming bee
must leave on its sticky surface the four minute orangelike
grains carried from the anther of another flower on the hairy
underside of her body now each anther is tucked away in one of
the ten little pockets of the saucershaped blossom and the
elastic filaments are strained upward like a bow after hovering
above the nectary the bee has only to descend toward it when
her leg touching against one of the hairtriggers of the spring
trap pop goes the little anthergun discharging pollen from its
bores as it flies upward so delicately is the mechanism
adjusted the slightest jar or rough handling releases the
anthers but on the other hand should insects be excluded by a
net stretched over the plant the flowers will fall off and
wither without firing off their pollencharged guns at least
this is true in the great majority of tests as in the case of
hothouse flowers no fertile seed is set when nets keep away the
laurels benefactors one has only to touch the hairtrigger with
the end of a pin to see how exquisitely delicate is this
provision for crossfertilization
however much we may be cautioned by the apiculturalists against
honey made from laurel nectar the bees themselves ignore all
warnings and apparently without evil results  happily for
flowers dependent upon them and their kin mr frank r cheshire
in bees and beekeeping the standard english work on the
subject writes during the celebrated retreat of the ten
thousand as recorded by xenophon in his anabasis the soldiers
regaled themselves upon some honey found near trebizonde where
were many beehives intoxication with vomiting was the result
some were so overcome he states as to be incapable of standing
not a soldier died but very many were greatly weakened for
several days tournefort endeavored to ascertain whether this
account was corroborated by anything ascertainable in the
locality and had good reason to be satisfied respecting it he
concluded that the honey had been gathered from a shrub growing
in the neighborhood of trebizonde which is well known there as
producing the beforementioned effects it is now agreed that the
plants were species of rhododendron and azaleas lamberti
confirms xenophons account by stating that similar effects are
produced by honey of colchis where the same shrubs are common
in 1790 even fatal cases occurred in america in consequence of
eating wild honey which was traced to kahmia latifolia by an
inquiry instituted under direction of the american government
happily our american cousins are now never likely to thus
suffer thanks to drainage the plow and the beefarm
one of the beautiful swallowtail butterflies lays its eggs on
laurel leaves that the larvae may feed on them later yet the
foliage often proves deadly to more highly organized creatures
most cattle know enough to let it alone nevertheless some fall
victims to it every year even the intelligent grouse hard
pressed with hunger when deep snow covers much of their chosen
food are sometimes found dead and their crops distended by these
leaves how far more unkind than the bristly armored thistles is
the laurels method of protecting itself against destruction
even the ant intent on pilfering sweets secreted for bees it
ruthlessly glues to death against its sticky stems and calices
according to dr barton the indians drink a decoction of kalmia
leaves when they wish to commit suicide
as laurel wood is very hard and solid weighing fortyfour pounds
to the cubic foot it is in great demand for various purposes

sheeplaurel lambkill wicky calfkill sheeppoison
narrowleaved laurel k angustifolia and so on through a list
of folk names testifying chiefly to the plants wickedness in the
pasture may be especially deadly food for cattle but it
certainly is a feast to the eyes however much we may admire the
small deep crimsonpink flowers that we find in june and july in
moist fields or swampy ground or on the hillsides few of us will
agree with thoreau who claimed that it is handsomer than the
mountain laurel the low shrub may be only six inches high or
it may attain three feet the narrow evergreen leaves pale on
the underside have a tendency to form groups of threes standing
upright when newly put forth but bent downward with the weight
of age a peculiarity of the plant is that clusters of leaves
usually terminate the woody stem for the flowers grow in whorls
or in clusters at the side of it below
the pale or swamp laurel k glauca found in cool bogs from
newfoundland to new jersey and michigan and westward to the

can words describe the fragrance of the very breath of spring 
that delicious commingling of the perfume of arbutus the odor of
pines and the snowsoaked soil just warming into life those who
know the flower only as it is sold in the city streets tied with
wet dirty string into tight bunches withered and forlorn can
have little idea of the joy of finding the pink pearly blossoms
freshly opened among the withered leaves of oak and chestnut
moss and pine needles in which they nestle close to the cold
earth in the leafless windy northern forest even in florida
where broad patches carpet the woods in february one misses
something of the arbutuss accustomed charm simply because there
are no slushy remnants of snow drifts no reminders of winter
hardships in the vicinity there can be no glad surprise at
finding dainty spring flowers in a land of perpetual summer
little wonder that the pilgrim fathers after the first awful
winter on the stern new england coast loved this early
messenger of hope and gladness above the frozen ground at
plymouth in an introductory note to his poem the mayflowers
whittier states that the name was familiar in england as the
application of it to the historic vessel shows but it was
applied by the english and still is to the hawthorn its use in
new england in connection with the trailing arbutus dates from a
very early day some claiming that the first pilgrims so used it
in affectionate memory of the vessel and its english flower
association
    sad mayflower i watched by winter stars
       and nursed by winter gales

       to life the frozen sod
     and through dead leaves of hope shall spring
       afresh the flowers of god
some have attempted to show that the pilgrims did not find the
flowers until the last month of spring and that therefore they
were named mayflowers certainly the arbutus is not a typical may
blossom even in new england bryant associates it with the
hepatica our earliest spring flower in his poem the
twentyseventh of march

there is little use trying to coax this shyest of sylvan flowers
into our gardens where other members of its family
rhododendrons laurels and azaleas make themselves delightfully
at home it is wild as a hawk an untamable creature that slowly
pines to death when brought into contact with civilization
greedy street venders who ruthlessly tear up the plant by the
yard and others without even the excuse of eking out a paltry
income by its sale have already exterminated it within a wide
radius of our eastern cities how curious that the majority of
people show their appreciation of a flowers beauty only by
selfishly ignorantly picking every specimen they can find
in many localities the arbutus sets no fruit for it is still
undergoing evolutionary changes looking toward the perfecting of
an elaborate system to insure crossfertilization already it has
attained to perfume nectar and color to attract quantities of
insects chiefly flies and small female bees but in some flowers
the anthers produce no pollen for them to carry while others are
filled with grains yet all the stigmas in the neighboring
clusters may be defective the styles and the filaments are of
several different lengths showing a tendency toward trimorphism
perhaps like the wonderful purple loosestrife but at present
the flower pursues a most wasteful method of distributing pollen
and in different sections of the country acts so differently that
its phases are impossible to describe except to the advanced
student they may however be best summarized in the words of
professor asa gray the flowers are of two kinds each with two
modifications the two main kinds characterized by the nature and
perfection of the stigma along with more or less abortion of the
stamens their modifications by the length of the style
when our english cousins speak of the arbutus they have in mind
a very different species from ours theirs is the late flowering

blossoms and beautiful rough red berries indeed the name

a hundred thousand people are interested in the berry of this
pretty vine to one who has ever seen its flowers yet if the
blossom were less attractive to insects at least and took less
pains to shake out its pollen upon them as they cling to the cone
to sip its nectar few berries would accompany the festive
thanksgiving turkey cultivators of the cranberry know how
important it is to have the flooded bogs well drained before the
flowering season water or ice may cover the plants to the
depth of a foot or more all winter and until the 10th of may and
during the late summer it is often advisable to overflow the bogs
to prevent injury of the fine delicate roots from drought and
to destroy the worm that is the plants worst enemy but until
the flowers have wooed the bees flies and other winged
benefactors and fruit is well formed every cultivator knows
enough not to submerge his bog with flowers under water there
are no insect visitors consequently no berries dense mats of
the wiry vines should yield about one hundred and fifty bushels
of berries to the acre under skilful cultivation  a most
profitable industry since the cranberry costs less to cultivate
gather and market than the strawberry or any of the small
perishable fruits planted in muck and sand in the garden the
vines yield surprisingly good results the cape cod bell is the

ages ago theophrastus called an entirely different plant by this
same scientific name derived from dodeka  twelve and theos 
gods and although our plant is native of a land unknown to the
ancients the fanciful linnaeus imagined he saw in the flowers of
its umbel a little congress of their divinities seated around a
miniature olympus who has said science kills imagination these
handsome interesting flowers so familiar in the middle west and
southwest especially somewhat resemble the cyclamen in oddity
of form indeed these prairie wildflowers are not unknown in
florists shops in eastern cities
many flowers like the shooting star cyclamen and nightshade
with protruding cones made up of united stamens are so designed
that as the bees must cling to them while sucking nectar they
receive pollen jarred out from the end of the cone on their
undersides the reflexed petals serve three purposes first in
making the flower more conspicuous secondly in facilitating
access to nectar and pollen and finally in discouraging
crawling intruders where the short tube is thickened the bee
finds her foothold while she forces her tongue between the anther
tips the nectar is well concealed and quite deeply seated
thanks to the rigid cone few bee workers are flying at the
shooting stars early blooming season undoubtedly the female
bumblebees which by striking the protruding stigma before they

conditions than most of its moistureloving kin will tolerate
but it may be noticed that although we may oftentimes find it
growing in dry soil it never spreads in such luxuriant clusters
as when the roots are struck beside meadow runnels and ditches

three exquisite members of the sabbatia tribe keep close to the
atlantic coast in salt meadows and marshes along the borders of
brackish rivers and very rarely in the sand at the edges of
freshwater ponds a little way inland from maine to florida they
range and less frequently are met along the shores of the gulf
of mexico so far as louisiana how bright and dainty and are
whole meadows are radiant with their blushing lovliness probably
if they consented to live far away from the sea they would lose
some of the deep clear pink from out their lovely petals since
all flowers show a tendency to brighten their colors as they
approach the coast in england some of the same wildflowers we
have here are far deeperhued owing no doubt to the fact that
they live on a seagirt moistureladen island and also that the
sun never scorches and blanches at the far north as it does in
the united states
as might be expected blossoms so bright of hue as the marsh
pinks attract many insects guided by the yellow eye that serves
as a pathfinder to the nectary they feast on the generour supply
of sweets but all unwittingly they must pay for their
entertainment by carrying pollen from early to later flowers
like so many other blossoms the sabbatias guard themselves
against the evils of selffertilization by shedding their pollen
before they mature and spread their twocleft style which is now
ready to receive the golden quickening dust on its stigmatic
inner surfaces
the sea or marsh pink or rose of plymouth s stellaris whose
graceful alternate branching stem attains a height of two feet
only under most favorable conditions from july to september
opens a succession of pink flowers that often fade to white the
yellow eye is bordered with carmine they measure about one inch
across and are usually solitary at the ends of branches or else
sway on slender peduncles from the axils the upper leaves are
narrow and bractlike those lower down gradually widen as they
approach the root
similar to the rose of plymouth is the even more graceful slender
marsh pink s campanulata  the s gracilis of gray whose
upper leaves are almost threadlike in their narrowness its five
calyx lobes too are exceedingly slender and often as long as
the corolla lobes one of our soldiers in cuba during the
spanish war sent home to his sister in massachusetts some of
these same little flowers in a letter you would just love to
see the marshes here he wrote they are filled with beautiful
little pink flowers i wish i knew their names that soldier had
passed by new england marshes aglow with the blossoms all his
life but he had never noticed them until all his perceptions
became quickened by the stimulus of travel and the excitement of
war how blind and deaf we all are in some directions having
eyes we see not and ears we hear not in the natural as in the
spiritual realm
no danger of confusing the large marsh pink s dodecandra  s
chloroides of gray with its smaller more branching relatives
it displays few flowers to a plant but each measures two and a
half inches or less across and has from nine to twelve pink or
rarely white petals this sabbatia often chooses the sandy
borders of ponds for its habitat

everywhere at the north we come across this interesting rather
shrubby plant with its pretty but inconspicuous little
roseveined bells suggesting pink liliesofthevalley now that
we have learned to read the faces of flowers as it were we
instantly suspect by the color fragrance pathfinders and
structure that these are artful wilers intent on gaining ends of
their own through their insect admirers what are they up to
let us watch bees flies moths and butterflies especially the
latter hover near alighting the butterfly visitor unrolls his
long tongue and inserts it where the five pink veins tell him to
for five nectarbearing glands stand in a ring around the base of
the pistil now as he withdraws his slender tongue through one
of the vshaped cavities that make a circle of traps he may
count himself lucky to escape with no heavier toll imposed than
pollen cemented to it this granular dust he is required to rub
off against the stigma of the next flower entered some bees
too have been taken with the dogbanes pollen cemented to their
tongues but suppose a fly call upon this innocentlooking
blossom his short tongue as well as the butterflys is guided
into one of the vshaped cavities after he has sipped but
getting wedged between the traps horny teeth the poor little
victim is held a prisoner there until he slowly dies of
starvation in sight of plenty this is the penalty he must pay
for trespassing on the butterflys preserves the dogbane which
is perfectly adapted to the butterfly and dependent upon it for
help in producing fertile seed ruthlessly destroys all poachers
that are not big or strong enough to jerk away from its viselike
grasp one often sees small flies and even moths dead and
dangling by the tongue from the wicked little charmers if the
flower assimilated their dead bodies as the pitcher plant for
example does those of its victims the flys fate would seem
less cruel to be killed by slow torture and dangled like a
scarecrow simply for pilfering a drop of nectar is surely an
execution of justice medieval in its severity
in july the most splendid of our native beetles the green dandy
eumolpus auratus fastens itself to the dogbanes foliage in
numbers until often the leaves appear to be studded with these
brilliant little jewels it is not easy says william hamilton
gibson to describe its burnished hue which is either
shimmering green or peacock blue or purplishgreen or
refulgent ruby according to the position in which it rests but
it is not golden as its specific name would imply it confines
itself exclusively to the dogbane to prevent capture it has a
trick of drawing up its legs and rolling off into the grass its
body so cleverly matches
from the silky coma on which the small seeds float away from long
pods to found new colonies from the opposite leaves milky
juice and certain structural resemblances in the flowers one
might guess this plant belonged to the milkweed tribe formerly
it was so classed and although the botanists have now removed
its family one step away the milkweed butterflies especially
the monarch anosia plexippus ignoring the arbitrary dividing
line of man still includes the dogbane on its visiting list we
know that this plant derived its name from the fact that it was
considered poisonous to dogs and we also know that all the tribe
of milkweed butterflies are provided with protective secretions
which are distasteful to birds and predaceous insects enjoying
their immunity from attack it is thought from the acrid
poisonous character of the foliage on which the caterpillars
feed

after the orchids no flowers show greater executive ability
none have adopted more ingenious methods of compelling insects to
work for them than the milkweeds wonderfully have they perfected
their mechanism in every part until no member of the family even
attempts to fertilize itself hence their triumphal vigorous
march around the earth the tribe numbering over nineteen hundred
species located chiefly in those tropical and warm temperate
regions that teem with insect life
commonest of all with us is this rank weed which possesses the
dignity of a rubber plant much more attractive to human eyes at
least than the dull pale brownishpink umbels of flowers are
its exquisite silky seedtufts but not so with insects knowing
that the slightly fragrant blossoms are rich in nectar bees
wasps flies beetles and butterflies come to feast now the
visitor finding his alighting place slippery his feet claw about
in all directions to secure a hold just as it was planned they
should for in his struggles some of his feet must get caught in
the fine little clefts at the base of the flower his efforts to
extricate his foot only draw it into a slot at the end of which
lies a little darkbrown body in a newly opened flower five of
these little bodies may be seen between the horns of the crown
at equal distances around it this tiny brown excrescence is hard
and horny with a notch in its face it is continuous with and
forms the end of the slot in which the visitors foot is caught
into this he must draw his foot or claw and finding it rather
tightly held must give a vigorous jerk to get it free attached
to either side of the little horny piece is a flattened yellow
pollenmass and so away he flies with a pair of these pollinia
that look like tiny saddlebags dangling from his feet one
might think that such rough handling as many insects must submit
to from flowers would discourage them from making any more
visits but the desire for food is a mighty passion while the
insect is flying off to another blossom the stalk to which the
saddlebags are attached twists until it brings them together
that when his feet get caught in other slots they may be in the
position to get broken off in his struggles for freedom precisely
where they will fertilize the stigmatic chambers now the visitor
flies away with the stalks alone sticking to his claws
bumblebees and hivebees have been caught with a dozen
pollenmasses dangling from a single foot outrageous imposition
does this wonderful mechanism always work to perfection alas
no it is a common thing to find dead hivebees and flies hanging
from the flowers while still struggling to escape the unhappy
victims will be attacked by ants beetles and spiders or killed
by heavy showers larger and stronger insects than honeybees are
required to regularly effect pollination and free themselves
especially when they are so unfortunate as to catch several feet
in the grooves doubtless it is the bumblebee that can transfer
pollen with impunity but very many other insects not perfectly
adapted to the flowers occasionally benefit them among the
large butterflies the papilios which suck with their wings in
motion are the most useful because in using their legs to
offset the motion of their wings they rapidly repeat those
movements which are necessary to draw the pollinia from the
anther cells and insert them in the stigmatic chambers of other
flowers large butterflies like danais says professor
robertson hold their wings still in sucking spending more time
on an umbel but generally carrying pollinia small butterflies
are worse than useless they remain long on the umbels sucking
but resting their feet superficially on the flowers
since several moths were found entrapped pollination must often
be brought about by nightflying lepidoptera as a rule diptera
flies either do not transfer pollinia at all or become
hopelessly entangled when they do occasionally pollenmasses
are found on the tongues of insects especially on those of bees
and wasps which move about with their unruly member sticking
out probably no one has ever made the exhaustive and absorbingly
interesting study of the milkweeds that professor robertson has
better than any written description of the milkweed blossoms
mechanism is a simple experiment if you have neither time nor
patience to sit in the hot sun magnifying glass in hand and
watch for an unwary insect to get caught take an ordinary
housefly and hold it by the wings so that it may claw at one of
the newly opened flowers from which no pollinia have been
removed it tries frantically to hold on and with a little
direction it may be led to catch its claws in the slots of the
flower now pull it gently away and you will find a pair of
saddlebags slung over his foot by a slender curved stalk if you
are rarely skilful you may induce your fly to withdraw the
pollinia from all five slots on as many of his feet and they are
not to be thrown or scraped off let the fly try as hard as he
pleases you may now invite the fly to take a walk on another
flower in which he will probably leave one or more pollinia in
its stigmatic cavities
dr kerner thought the milky juice in milkweed plants especially
abundant in the uppermost leaves and stems serves to protect the
flowers from useless crawling pilferers he once started a number
of ants to climb up a milky stalk when they neared the summit
he noticed that at each movement the terminal hooks of their feet
cut through the tender epiderm and from the little clefts the
milky juice began to flow bedraggling their feet and the hind
part of their bodies the ants were much impeded in their
movements he writes and in order to rid themselves of the
annoyance drew their feet through their mouths their movements
however which accompanied these efforts simply resulted in
making fresh fissures and fresh discharges of milky juice so
that the position of the ants became each moment worse and worse
many escaped by getting to the edge of a leaf and dropping to the
ground others tried this method of escape too late for the air
soon hardened the milky juice into a tough brown substance and
after this all the strugglings of the ants to free themselves
from the viscid matter were in vain natures methods of
preserving a flowers nectar for the insects that are especially
adapted to fertilize it and of punishing all useless intruders
often shock us yet justice is ever stern ever kind in the
largest sense
if the asclepias really do kill some insects with their juice
others doubtless owe their lives to it among the protected
insects are the milkweed butterflies and their caterpillars
which are provided with secretions that are distasteful to birds
and predaceous insects these acrid secretions are probably due
to the character of the plants upon which the caterpillars feed
says dr holland in his beautiful and invaluable butterfly
book enjoying on this account immunity from attack they have
all in the process of time been mimicked by species in other
genera which have not the same immunity one cannot stay long
around a patch of milkweeds without seeing the monarch butterfly
anosia plexippus that splendid bright reddishbrown winged
fellow the borders and veins broadly black with two rows of
white spots on the outer borders and two rows of pale spots
across the tip of the fore wings there is a black scentpouch on
the hind wings the caterpillar which is bright yellow or
greenish yellow banded with shining black is furnished with
black fleshy horns fore and aft
like the dandelion thistle and other triumphant strugglers for
survival the milkweed sends its offspring adrift on the winds to
found fresh colonies afar children delight in making pompons for
their hats by removing the silky seedtufts from pods before they
burst and winding them one by one on slender stems with fine
thread hung in the sunshine how charmingly fluffy and soft they

among the comparatively few butterfly flowers  although of
course other insects not adapted to them are visitors  is the
purple milkweed a purpurasceus whose deep magenta umbels are
so conspicuous through the summer months hummingbirds
occasionally seek it too from eastern massachusetts to virginia
and westward to the mississippi or beyond it is to be found in
dry fields woods and thickets
the swamp milkweed a incarnata on the other hand rears its
intense purplishred or pinkish hoods in wet places its leaves
are lanceshaped or oblonglanceolate whereas the purple
milkweeds leaves are oblong or ovateoblong this is a smooth
plant and a similar species once reckoned as a mere variety a
pulchra is the hairy milkweed it differs chiefly in having some
hairs on the under side of its leaves and a great many hairs on
its stem both plants bear erect rather slender tapering pods
the poke or tall milkweed a exaltata  a phytolaecoides of
gray may attain a height of six feet if the moist soil in which
it grows be exactly to its liking drooping or spreading umbels
of flowers whose corolla segments are pale purplish green and
whose crown is clear ivory white or pink appear from june to
august from maine to georgia and far westward sometimes the
tapering oblong leaves may be nine inches long the erect
seedpods are drawn out to an unusually long point
one may always distinguish the lowgrowing fourleaved milkweed
a quadrifolia from its relatives of ranker growth by its
general air of refinement as well as by the two pairs of thin
tapering leaves that grow in an upright whorl near the middle of
the slender stem usually there are no leaves on the lower part
small terminal umbels of delicate pink and white fragrant
flowers which appear from may till july give place to very
narrow pointed pods in late summer from maine to ontario

no one need be told that the pretty bellshaped pink and white
flower on the vigorous vine clambering over stone walls and
winding about the shrubbery of wayside thickets in a suffocating
embrace is akin to the morningglory of the garden trellis c
major an exceedingly rapid climber the twining stem often
describes a complete circle in two hours turning against the
sun or just contrary to the hands of a watch late in the
season when an abundance of seed has been set the flower can
well afford to keep open longer hours also in rainy weather but
early in the summer at least it must attend to business only
while the sun shines and its benefactors are flying usually it
closes at sundown on moonlight nights however the hospitable
blossom keeps open for the benefit of certain moths in europe
the plants range is supposed to be limited to that of a
crepuscular moth sphinx convolvuli and where that benefactor
is rare as in england the bindweed sets few seeds where it does
not occur as in scotland this convolvulus is seldom found wild
whereas in italy delpino tells of catching numbers of the moths
in hedges overgrown with the common plant by standing with thumb
and forefinger over a flower ready to close it when the insect
has entered we know that every floral clock is regulated by the
hours of flight of its insect friends when they have retired
the flowers close to protect nectar and pollen from useless
pilferers in this country various species of bees chiefly
fertilize the bindweed blossoms guided by the white streaks or
pathfinders they crawl into the deep tube and sip through one of
the five narrow passages leading to the nectary a transverse
section of the flower cut to show these five passages standing in
a circle around the central ovary looks like the end of a
fivebarreled revolver insects without a suitably long proboscis
are of course excluded by this arrangement
from july until hard frost look for that exquisite little beetle
cassida aurichalcea like a drop of molten gold clinging beneath
the bindweeds leaves the small perforations reveal his hiding
places but you must be quick if you would capture him says
william hamilton gibson for he is off in a spangling streak of
glitter nor is this golden sheen all the resource of the little
insect for in the space of a few seconds as you hold him in
your hand he has become a milky iridescent opal and now
motherofpearl and finally crawls before you in a coat of dull
orange a dead beetle loses all this wonderful luster even on
the morningglory in our gardens we may sometimes find these
jeweled mites or their forktailed black larvae or the tiny
chrysalids suspended by their tails although it is the wild
bindweed that is ever their favorite abiding place
the small field bindweed c arvensis a common immigrant from
europe which has taken up its abode from nova scotia and ontario
southward to new jersey and westward to kansas trails over the
ground with a deathless persistency which fills farmers with
dismay it is like a small edition of the hedge bind weed only
its calyx lacks the leaflike bracts at its base its slender
stem rarely exceeds two feet in length and the little pink and
white flowers often grow in pairs their habit of closing both in
the evening and in rainy weather indicates that they are adapted
for diurnal insects only but if the bell hang down or if the
corolla drop off the pollen must fall on the stigma and effect
selffertilization many more insects visit this flower than the
large bindweed attracted by the peculiar fragrance and led by
the white streaks to the orangecolored under surface of the
ovary where the nectar lies concealed stigmas and anthers
mature at the same time but as the former are slightly the
longer they receive pollen brought from another flower before
the visitor gets freshly dusted

qf course the plant has some better reason for this peculiar
obedience to every breath that blows than to amuse windycheeked
boys and girls is not the ready movement useful during stormy
weather in turning the mouth of the flower away from driving
rain and in fair days when insects are abroad in presenting
its gaping lips where they can best alight we all know that
insects like birds make long flights most easily with the wind
but in rising and alighting it is their practice to turn against
it when bees for example are out for food on windy days and
must make frequent stops for refreshment among the flowers they
will be found going against the wind possibly to catch the
whiffs of fragrance borne on it that guide them to feast but
more likely that they may rise and alight readily one always
sees bumblebees conspicuous among the obedient plants visitors
after the anthers have shed their pollen  and tiny teeth at the
edges of the outer pair aid its complete removal by insects  the

half a dozen different shades of bloom worn by this handsome

sip from them and help themselves to pollen also without paying

it requires something of a struggle for even so strong and
vigorous an insect as the bumblebee to gain admission to this
inhospitablelooking flower before maturity and even he abandons
the attempt over and over again in its earliest stage before the
little heartshaped anthers are prepared to dust him over as
they mature it opens slightly but his weight alone is
insufficient to bend down the stiff yet elastic lower lip
energetic prying admits first his head then he squeezes his body
through brushing past the stamens as he finally disappears
inside at the moment when he is forcing his way in causing the
lower lip to spring up and down the eyeless turtle seems to chew
and chew until the most sedate beholder must smile at the
paradoxical show of course it is the bee that is feeding though
the flower would seem to be masticating the bee with the keenest
relish the counterfeit tortoise soon disgorges its lively
mouthful however and away flies the bee carrying pollen on his
velvety back to rub on the stigma of an older flower after the
anthers have shed their pollen and become effete the stigma
matures and occupies their place by this time the flower
presents a wider entrance and as the moistureloving plant keeps
the nectaries abundantly filled what is to prevent insects too
small to come in contact with anthers and stigma in the roof from
pilfering to their hearts content the woolly throat discourages
many to be sure but the turtlehead like its cousins the
beardtongues has a sterile fifth stamen whose greatest use is
to act as a dropbar across the base of the flower the
longtongued bumblebee can get his drink over the bar but
smaller unwelcome visitors are literally barred out
if bees are the preferred visitors of the turtlehead why do we
find the baltimore butterfly that very beautiful but freaky
creature melitaea phaeton hovering near  that is when we
find it at all for where it is present it swarms and keeps

american genus
large patches of the lavenderpink gerardia peeping above the

naturally he receives the pollen on his underside  just where it
will be rubbed off against the stigma impeding his entrance to

chanted wordsworth it is a special pity to gather the gerardias
which as they grow seem to enjoy life to the full and when
picked to be so miserable they turn black as they dry like
their relatives the foxgloves they are difficult to transplant

their roots on those of other plants when robbery becomes
flagrant nature brands sinners in the vegetable kingdom by
taking away their color and perhaps their leaves as in the case

receive pollen carried from younger flowers when the visitor sips
his reward if the hairs still contain pollen when the stigmatic

the transition from windfertilization to insectfertilization
and the first traces of adaptation to insects could only be due
to the influence of quite shortlipped insects with feebly
developed color sense the most primitive flowers are therefore
for the most part simple widely open regular devoid of nectar
or with their nectar unconcealed and easily accessible and
greenish white or yellow in color lepidoptera by the
thinness sometimes by the length of their tongues were able to
produce special modifications through their agency were
developed flowers with long and narrow tubes whose colors and
time of opening were in relation to the tastes and habits of
their visitors  hermann muller
of all colors white is the prevailing one and of white flowers
a considerably larger proportion smell sweetly than of any other
color namely 146 per cent of red only 82 per cent are
odoriferous the fact of a large proportion of white flowers
smelling sweetly may depend in part on those which are fertilized
by moths requiring the double aid of conspicuousness in the dusk
and of odor so great is the economy of nature that most flowers
which are fertilized by crepuscular or nocturnal insects emit
their odor chiefly or exclusively in the evening  charles

unlike its far more showy decorative cousin the arrowhead this
weeblossomed plant whose misty white panicles rise with
compensating generosity the world around bears only perfect
regular flowers twelve infinitesimal drops of nectar secreted
in a fleshy ring around the center are eagerly sought by flies
as the anthers point obliquely outward and away from the stigmas
an incoming fly bearing pollen on his under side usually
alights in the center and leaves some of the vitalizing dust
just where it is most needed but a fly starting from a petal
says muller usually applies its tongue to the nectardrops one
by one and after each it strokes an anther with its labellae in
so doing it may bring various parts of its body in contact with
the anthers as a rule however the parts which come in contact
with the anthers are not those which come in contact with the
stigmas in the same flower any plant that lives in shallow
water which may dry up as summer advances is under special
necessity to produce an extra quantity of crossfertilized seed
to guard against extinction during drought for the same reason
it bears several kinds of leaves adapted to its environment

wading into shallow water or standing on some muddy shore like a
heron this striking plant so often found in that birds haunts
is quite as decorative in a picture and happily far more
approachable in life indeed one of the comforts of botany as
compared with bird study is that we may get close enough to the
flowers to observe their last detail whereas the bird we have
followed laboriously over hill and dale through briers and
swamps darts away beyond the range of fieldglasses with
tantalizing swiftness
while no single plant is yet thoroughly known to scientists in
spite of the years of study devoted by specialists to separate
groups no plant remains wholly meaningless when keppler

fragile delicate pure white goldencentered flowers of the
arrowhead usually clustered about the top of the scape
naturally are the first to attract the attention whether of man
or insect below these dull green unattractive collections of
pistils which by courtesy only may be called flowers also form
little groups of three like the quakers at meeting the male and
female arrowhead flowers are separated often on distinct plants
of course the insect visitors  bees and flies chiefly  alight
on the showy staminate blossoms first and transfer pollen from
them to the dull pistillate ones later as it was intended they
should to prevent selffertilization how endless are the
devices of the flowers to guard against this evil and to compel
insects to crosspollinate them the most minute detail of the
mechanism involved which the microscope reveals only increases
our interest and wonder
any plant which elects to grow in shallow water must be
amphibious it must be able to breathe beneath the surface as the
fish do and also be adapted to thrive without those parts that
correspond to gills for ponds and streams have an unpleasant way
of drying up in summer leaving it stranded on the shore this
accounts in part for the variable leaves on the arrowhead those
underneath the water being long and ribbonlike to bring the
greatest possible area into contact with the air with which the
water is charged broad leaves would be torn to shreds by the
current through which grasslike blades glide harmlessly but
when this plant grows on shore having no longer use for its
lower ribbons it loses them and expands only broad arrowshaped
surfaces to the sunny air leaves to be supplied with carbonic
acid to assimilate and sunshine to turn off the oxygen and store
up the carbon into their system

at a glance one knows this beautiful denizen of northern bogs and
ditches to be a poor relation of the stately ethiopian calla lily
of our greenhouses where the arum grows in rich cool retreats
it is apt to be abundant its slender rootstocks running hither
and thither through the yielding soil with thrifty rapidity until
the place is carpeted with its handsome dark leaves from which
the pure white flowers arise and yet many flower lovers well
up in field practice know it not thoreau for example was no
longer young when he first saw or rather noticed it having
found this in one place he wrote i now find it in another
many an object is not seen though it falls within the range of
our visual ray because it does not come within the range of our
intellectual ray so in the largest sense we find only the
world we look for
now the true flowers of the arum and all its spadixbearing kin
are so minute that one scarcely notices them where they are
clustered on the clubshaped column in the center of the apparent
flower the beautiful white banner of the marsh calla or the
green and maroon striped pulpit from which jack preaches is no
more the flower proper than the papery sheath below the daffodil

before flying insects is not even essential to the florets
existence except as it helps them attract their pollencarrying
friends almost all waterside plants it will be noticed depend
chiefly upon flies and midges and these lack aesthetic taste
such plants have usually acquired small and inconspicuous
separate flowers says grant allen and then to make up for
their loss in attractiveness like cheap sweetmeats they have
very largely increased their numbers or to put the matter more
simply and physically in waterside situations those plants
succeed best which have a relatively large number of individually
small and unnoticeable flowers massed together into large and
closely serried bundles hence in such situations there is a
tendency for petals to be suppressed and for blossoms to grow
minute because the large and bright flowers seldom succeed in
attracting big land insects like bees or butterflies while the
small and thickset ones usually do succeed in attracting a great
many little flitting midges flies which are guided far more by
their sense of smell than by sight resort to the petalless
insignificant florets of the illscented marsh calla in numbers
and as the uppermost clusters are staminate only while the lower
florets contain stamens and pistil it follows they must often
effect crosspollination as they crawl over the spadix but here
is no trap to catch the tiny benefactors such as is set by wicked
jackinthepulpit or the skunkcabbage or another cousin a
still more terrible executioner the cuckoopint arum maculatum
of europe
few coroners inquests are held over the dead bodies of our
feathered friends and it is not known whether the
innocentlooking marsh calla really poisons the birds on which it
depends to carry its bright seeds afar or not the cuckoopint
as is well known destroys the winged messenger bearing its
offspring to plant fresh colonies in a distant bog because the
decayed body of the bird acts as the best possible fertilizer
into which the seedling may strike its roots most of our noxious
weeds like our vermin have come to us from europe but heaven
deliver us from this cannibalistic pest
the very common green arrowarum peltandra virginica found in
shallow water ditches swamps and the muddy shores of ponds
throughout the eastern half of the united states attracts us
more by its stately growth and the beauty of its bright lustrous
green arrowshaped leaves which have been found thirty inches
long than by the insignificant florets clustered on the spadix
within a long pointed green sheath that closely enfolds it
pistillate florets cover it for only about onefourth its length

the rest of the spadix after the club is set with green berries

red ones  the flower stalk curves bends downward and the

as if to offer opportunities for comparison to the confused
novice the true solomons seal and the socalled false species 
quite as honest a plant  usually grow near each other grace of
line rather than beauty of blossom gives them both their chief
charm but the feathery plume of greenishwhite blossoms that
crowns the false solomons seals somewhat zigzagged stem is
very different from the small greenish bellshaped flowers
usually nodding in pairs along the stem under the leaves from
the axils of the true solomons seal later in summer when
hungry birds wander through the woods with increased families
the wild spikenard offers them branching clusters of pale red
speckled berries whereas the latter plant feasts them with
blueblack fruit in the hope that they will drop the seeds miles
away
by clustering its small slightly fragrant flowers at the end of
its stem the wild spikenard offers a more taking advertisement
to its insect friends than its cousin can show a few flies and
beetles visit them but apparently the less specialized bees
chiefly those of the halictus tribe which predominate in may
are the principal guests these alight in the center of the
widely expanded blossoms set on the upper side of the branching
raceme so as to make their nectar and pollen easily accessible
and as the newly opened flower has its stigma already receptive
to pollen brought to it while its own anthers are closed it

the birds to perpetuate itself

the dingy little cylindric flowers hidden beneath the leaves
may be either selfpollenized or crosspollenized by the
bumblebees to which they are adapted we may suppose says
professor robertson that the pendulous position of the flowers
owes its origin to the fact that it renders them less convenient
to other insects but equally convenient to the higher bees which
are the most efficient pollinators and that the resulting
protection to pollen and nectar is merely an incidental effect

pink strongly veined petals may exceed two inches and in
michigan a monstrous form has been found the broadly rhombic
leaves tapering to a point and lacking petioles are seated in
the usual whorl of three at the summit of the stem which may
attain a foot and a half in height from the center the
decorative flower arises on a long peduncle at first the
entrance to the blossom is closed by the long anthers which much
exceed the filaments and hivebees among other insects in
collecting pollen transfer it to older and now expanded flowers
in which the low stigmas appear between the tall separated
stamens nectar stored in septal glands at the base invites the
visitor laden with pollen from young flowers to come in contact
with the three late maturing stigmas the berry is black from
quebec to florida and far westward we find this tardy wakerobin
in may or june
certainly the commonest trillium in the east although it thrives
as far westward as ontario and missouri and south to georgia is
the nodding wakerobin t cernuum whose white or pinkish
flower droops from its peduncle until it is all but hidden under
the whorl of broadly rhombic tapering leaves the wavy margined
petals about as long as the sepals  that is to say half an
inch long or over  curve backward at maturity according to miss
carter who studied the flower in the botanical garden at south
hadley mass it is slightly proterandrous maturing its anthers
first but with a chance of spontaneous selfpollination by the
stigmas recurving to meet the shorter stamens she saw bumblebees
visiting it for nectar in late summer an eggshaped pendulous
redpurple berry swings from the summit one finds the plant in
bloom from april to june according to the climate of its long
range
perhaps the most strikingly beautiful member of the tribe is the
painted trillium t undulatum t erythrocarpum of gray at the
summit of the slender stem rising perhaps only eight inches or
maybe twice as high this charming flower spreads its long
wavyedged waxywhite petals veined and striped with deep pink
or wine color the large ovate leaves longtapering to a point
are rounded at the base into short petioles the rounded
threeangled bright red shining berry is seated in the
persistent calyx with the same range as the nodding trilliums
the painted wakerobin comes into bloom nearly a month later  in
may and june  when all the birds are not only wide awake but
have finished courting and are busily engaged in the most
serious business of life

quite different from the showy orchis is this far more chaste
showy ladys slipper which dr gray has called the most
beautiful of the genus because the plants live in inaccessible
swampy places where only the most zealous flower lover

wonderfully interesting structure and the comparative rarity of
this orchid rather than superficial beauty are responsible for
the thrill of pleasure one experiences at the sight of the spike
of unpretentious flowers two great leaves sometimes as large as
dinner plates attract the eye to where they glisten on the
ground the spur of the blossom the nectary implies a welcome
to a tongue two inches long and will reward none other says
william hamilton gibson this clearly shuts out the bees
butterflies and smaller moths what insect then is here
implied the sphinx moth one of the lesser of the group a
larger individual might sip the nectar it is true but its
longer tongue would reach the base of the tube without effecting
the slightest contact with the pollen which is of course the
desideratum how the moth in sipping the nectar thrusts his
head against the sticky buttons to which the pollen messes are
attached and in trying to release himself loosens them how he
flies off with these little clubs sticking to his eyes how they
automatically adjust themselves to the attitude where they will
come in contact with the stigma of the next flower visited and
so crossfertilize it has been told in the account of the great
purplefringed orchis of similar construction to that species
the interested reader is therefore referred or better still
to the luminous description by dr asa gray

one who selfishly imagines that all the floral beauty of the
earth was created for mans sole delight will wonder why a flower
so exquisitely beautiful as this dainty little orchid should be
hidden in inaccessible peatbogs where overshoes and tempers get
lost with deplorable frequency and the watersnake and bittern
mock at mans intrusion of their realm by the ease with which
they move away from him not for man but for the bee the moth
and the butterfly are orchids where they are and what they are
the whitefringed orchis grows in watery places that it may more
easily manufacture nectar and protect itself from crawling
pilferers its flowers are clustered on a spike their lips are
fringed they have been given fragrance and a snowywhite color
that they may effectually advertise their sweets on whose removal
by an insect benefactor that will carry pollen from flower to
flower as he feeds depends their chance of producing fertile
seed it is probable the flower is white that nightflying moths
may see it shine in the gloaming from the length and slenderness
of its spur it is doubtless adapted to the sphinx moth
at the entrance to the nectary two sticky disks stand on guard
ready to fasten themselves to the eyes of the first moth that
inserts his tongue and he finds on withdrawing his head that two
pollenmasses attached to these disks have been removed with
them this plastering over of insects eyes by the orchids might
be serious business indeed were not the lepidoptera gifted with
numerous pairs the fragrance of many orchids however would be
a sufficient guide even to a blind insect with the pollenmasses
sticking to his forehead the moth enters another flower and
necessarily rubs off some grains from the pollen masses that
have changed their attitude during his flight that they may be in
the precise position to fertilize the viscid stigma in almost
the same way the similar yellowfringed orchis h ciliaris and
the great green orchids compel insects to work for them
a largerflowered species the prairie whitefringed orchis h
lepicophea found in bloom in june and july on moist open
ground from western new york to minnesota and arkansas differs
from the preceding chiefly in having larger and greenishwhite
flowers the lip cleft into wedgeshaped segments deeply fringed
the hawkmoth removes on its tongue one but not often both of
the pollinia attached to disks on either side of the entrance to
the spur

this last orchid of the season and perhaps the commonest of its
interesting tribe in the eastern united states at least bears
flowers that however insignificant in size are marvelous pieces
of mechanism to which such men as charles darwin and asa gray
have devoted hours of study and these two men particularly much
correspondence
just as a woodpecker begins at the bottom of a tree and taps his
way upward so a bee begins at the lower and older flowers on a
spike and works up to the younger ones a fact on which this
little orchid like many another plant that arranges its b1ossoms
in long racemes depends let us not note for the present what
happens in the older flowers but begin our observations with
the help of a powerful lens when the bee has alighted on the
spreading lip of a newly opened blossom toward the top of the
spire as nectar is already secreted for her in its receptacle
she thrusts her tongue through the channel provided to guide it
aright and by the slight contact with the furrowed rostellum it
splits and releases a boatshaped disk standing vertically on
its stern in the passage within the boat is an extremely sticky
cement that hardens almost instantly on exposure to the air the
splitting of the rostellum curiously enough never happens
without insect aid but if a bristle or needle be passed over it
ever so lightly a stream of sticky milky fluid exudes hardens
and the boatshaped disk with pollen masses attached may be
withdrawn on the bristle just as the bee removes them with her
tongue each pollinium consists of two leaves of pollen united
for about half their length in the middle with elastic threads
as the pollinia are attached parallel to the disk they stick
parallel on the bees tongue yet she may fold up her proboscis
under her head if she choose without inconvenience from the
pollen masses or without danger of loosening them now having
finished sucking the newly opened flowers at the top of the
spike away she flies to an older flower at the bottom of another
one here a marvelous thing has happened the passage which when
the flower first expanded scarcely permitted a bristle to pass
has now widened through the automatic downward movement of the
column in order to expose the stigmatic surfaces to contact with
the pollen masses brought by the bee without the bees help this
orchid with a host of other flowers must disappear from the
face of the earth so very many species which have lost the power
to fertilize themselves now depend absolutely on these little
pollen carriers it is safe to say that should the bees perish
one half our flora would be exterminated with them on the slight
downward movement of the column in the ladies tresses then as
well as on the bees ministrations the fertilization of the
flower absolutely depends if the stigma of the lowest flower
has already been fully fertilized says darwin little or no
pollen will be left on its dried surface but on the next
succeeding flower of which the stigma is adhesive large sheets
of pollen will be left then as soon as the bee arrives near the
summit of the spike she will withdraw fresh pollinia will fly to
the lower flowers on another plant and fertilize them and thus
as she goes her rounds and adds to her store of honey she
continually fertilizes fresh flowers and perpetuates the race of
autumnal spiranthes which will yield honey to future generations

tufts of these beautifully marked little leaves carpeting the
ground in the shadow of the hemlocks attract the eye rather than
the spires of insignificantly small flowers whoever wishes to
know how the bumblebee ruptures the sensitive membrane within the
tiny blossom with her tongue and draws out the pollinia that are
instantly cemented to it after much the same plan employed by the
ladies tresses must use a good lens in studying the operation
to the structural botanist the rattlesnake plantains form an
interesting connecting link between orchids of d1stinct forms in
them we see a tendency to lengthen the pollenmasses into
caudicles as the showy orchis for example has done goodyera
probably shows us the state of organs in a group of orchids now
mostly extinct says darwin but the parents of many living
descendants
it has been said that the indians use this plant to cure bites of
the rattlesnake that they will handle the deadly creature
without fear if some of these leaves are near at hand  in fact
a good deal is said about indians by palefaces that makes even
the stolid red man smile when confronted with the white mans
tales about him an intelligent indian student declares that none
of his race will handle a rattlesnake unless its fangs have been
removed that this plant takes its name from the resemblance of
its nettedveined leaves to the belly of a serpent and not to
their curative powers and finally that the southern tribes
especially so reverence the rattlesnake that far from trying to
cure its bite they count themselves blessed to be bitten to
death by one indeed the rattle a sacred symbol has been
employed in religious ceremonies of most tribes snakes may be
revered in other lands but only in america is the rattlesnake
worshipped among the moquis there still survives much of the
religion of the snakeworshipping aztecs bernal diaz tells how
living rattlesnakes kept in the great temple at mexico as sacred

the fragrance arising from these curious drooping taillike
spikes of flowers where they grow in numbers must lure their
insect friends as it does us since no showy petals or sepals
advertise their presence nevertheless they are what are known as
perfect flowers each possessing stamens and pistils the only
truly essential parts however desirable a gaily colored perianth
may be to blossoms attempting to woo such large land insects as
the bumblebee and butterfly since flies whose color sense is by
no means so acute as their sense of smell are by far the most
abundant fertilizers of waterside plants we can see a tendency
in such to suppress their petals for the flowers to become
minute and massed in series that the little visitors may more
readily transfer pollen from one to another and to become
fragrant  just what the lizards tail has done

dainty clusters of these delicate starry blossoms mostly turned
in one direction expand in the sunshine only like their gaudy
cousin the portulaca and the insignificant little yellow flowers
of another relative the ubiquitous invincible pussley
immortalized in my summer in a garden at night and during
cloudy stormy weather when their benefactors are not flying
the claytonias economically close their petals to protect nectar
and pollen from rain and pilferers pick them the whole plant
droops and the blossoms close with indignation nor will any
coaxing but a combination of hot water and sunshine induce them
to open again theirs is a long beauty sleep they are
supersensitive exquisites however hardy
very early in the spring a race is run with the hepatica
arbutus adders tongue bloodroot squirrel corn and anemone
for the honor of being the earliest wild flower and although
john burroughs and dr abbott have had the exceptional experience
of finding the claytonia even before the hepatica  certainly the
earliest spring blossom worthy the name in the middle and new
england states  of course the rank skunkcabbage whose name is
snobbishly excluded from the list of fair competitors has
quietly opened dozens of minute florets in its incurved horn
before the others have even started
whether the petals of the spring beauty are white or pink they
are always exquisitely marked with pink lines converging near the
base and ending in a yellow blotch to serve as pathfinders for
the female bumblebees and the little brown bombylius among other
pollen carriers a newly opened flower with its stamens
surrounding the pistil must be in peril of selffertilization
one would think who did not notice that when the pollen is in
condition for removal by the bees and flies the stigmatic
surfaces of the threecleft style are tightly pressed together
that not a grain may touch them but when the anthers have shed
their pollen and the filaments have spread outward and away from
the pistil the three stigmatic arms branch out to receive the
fertilizing dust carried from younger flowers by their busy
friends

feathery white panicles of the starry campion whose protruding
stamens and fringed petals give it a certain fleeciness are
dainty enough for spring by midsummer we expect plants of ranker
growth and more gaudy flowers to save the nectar in each deep
tube for the moths and butterflies which crossfertilize all this
tribe of night and day blossoms most of them  and the campions
are notorious examples  spread their calices and some their
pedicels as well with a sticky substance to entrap little
crawling pilferers although a popular name for the genus is
catchfly it is usually the ant that is glued to the viscid
parts for the fly that moves through the air alights directly on
the flower it is too shortlipped to suck an ant catching its
feet on the miniature limetwig at first raises one foot after
another and draws it through its mouth hoping to rid it of the
sticky stuff but only with the result of gluing up its head and
other parts of the body in ten minutes all the pathetic
struggles are ended let no one guilty of torturing flies to
death on sticky paper condemn the silenes
the bladder campion s vulgaris s inflata of gray to be
recognized by its much inflated calyx especially round in fruit
the twocleft white petals and its opposite leaves that are
spatulate at the base of the plant is a european immigrant now
naturalized and locally very common from illinois eastward to new
jersey and north to new brunswick like the nightflowering
catchfly this blossom has adapted itself to the nightflying
moths but when either remains open in the morning bumblebees
gladly take the leavings in the deep cup to insure
crossfertilization some of the bladdercampion flowers have
stamens only some have a pistil only some have both organs
maturing at different times in all the nightflowering silene
each flower unless unusually disturbed lasts three days and
three nights late in the afternoon of the first day when the
petals begin to expand the five stamens opposite the sepals
lengthen in about two hours and by sunset the anthers which
have matured at the same time are covered with pollen so they
remain until the forenoon of the second day and then the emptied
anthers hang like shriveled bags or drop off altogether late in
the second afternoon the second set of stamens repeat the
actions of their predecessors bend backward and shed their
anthers the following that is to say the third morning but on
the third afternoon up rise the sshaped twisted stigmas which
until now had been hidden in the center of the flower moths
therefore must transfer pollen from younger to older blossoms
with this lengthening and bending of the stamens and stigmas
says dr kerner goes hand in hand the opening and shutting of
the corolla with the approach of dusk the bifid limbs of the
petals spread out in a flat surface and fall back against the
calyx in this position they remain through the night and not
till the following morning do they begin more quickly in
sunshine and with a mild temperature more slowly with a cloudy
sky and in cold wet weather to curl themselves up in an
incurved spire while at the same time they form longitudinal
creases and look as though they were gathered in or
wrinkledbut no sooner does evening return than the wrinkles
disappear the petals become smooth uncurl themselves and fall
back upon the calyx and the corolla is again expanded
curiously enough these flowers which by day we should certainly
say were not fragrant give forth a strong perfume at evening the
better to guide moths to their feast from eight in the evening
until three in the morning the fragrance is especially strong
the white blossoms so conspicuous at night have little
attraction for colorloving butterflies and bees by day then as
there is no pollen to be carried from the shriveled anther sacs
no visitor is welcome and the petals close to protect the nectar
for the flowers true benefactors indeed few flowers show more
thorough adaptation to the nightflying moths than these silene

when the pokeweed is all on fire with ripeness as thoreau
said when the stout vigorous stem which he coveted for a
cane the large leaves and even the footstalks take on
splendid tints of crimson lake and the dark berries hang heavy
with juice in the thickets then the birds with increased
hungry families gather in flocks as a preliminary step to
traveling southward has the brilliant strongscented plant no
ulterior motive in thus attracting their attention at this
particular time surely robins flickers and downy woodpeckers
chewinks and rosebreasted grosbeaks among other feathered
agents may be detected in the act of gormandizing on the fruit
whose undigested seeds they will disperse far and wide their
droppings form the best of fertilizers for young seedlings
therefore the plants which depend on birds to distribute seeds
as most berry bearers do send their children abroad to found new
colonies well equipped for a vigorous start in life what a
hideous mockery to continue to call this fruit the pigeonberry

annihilated from this land of liberty by the fowlers net and
yet flocks of wild pigeons containing not thousands but millions
of birds nested here even thirty years ago when the market
became glutted with them they were fed to hogs in the west
children and some grownups find the deep magenta juice of the
inkberry useful notwithstanding the poisonous properties of the
root in some sections the young shoots are boiled and eaten like
asparagus evidently with no disastrous consequences for any
service this plant may render to man and bird they are under
special obligation to the little halictus bees but to other

successfully competes with our native blossoms by readily
adjusting itself to new conditions filling places unoccupied
and chiefly by prolonging its season of bloom beyond theirs to

eye small bees flies and even thrips visit the blossoms whose

natures garden
now cultivation of our native water lilies and all their hardy
kin like charity begins at home their culture in tubs casks
or fountains on the lawn is so very simple a matter and the
flowers bloom so freely every garden should have a corner for
aquatic plants secure the waterlily roots as early in the
spring as possible and barely cover them with good rich loam or
muck spread over the bottom of the sunken tub to a depth of six
or eight inches after it has been filled with water and
replenished from time to time to make good the loss by
evaporation the water garden needs no attention until autumn
then the tub should be drained and removed to a cellar or it
may be covered over with a thick mattress of dry leaves to
protect from hard freezing in their natural haunts water lilies
sink to the bottom where the water is warmest in winter
possibly the seed is ripened below the surface for the same
reason at no time should the crown of the cultivated plant be
lower than two feet below the water if a number of species are
grown it is best to plant each kind in a separate basket sunk
in the shallow tub to prevent the roots from growing together
as well as to obtain more effective decoration charming results
may be obtained with small outlay of either money or time

opening some time after six oclock in the morning the white

many other creatures on wings alight too i have named two
species of bees halictus nelumbonis and prosopis nelumbonis on
account of their close economic relation to these flowers says
professor robertson who has captured over two hundred and fifty
species of bees near his home in carlinville illinois and
described nearly a third of them as new linnaeus no doubt the
first to conceive the pretty idea of making a floral clock drew
up a list of blossoms whose times of opening and closing marked
the hours on its face but even linnaeus failed to understand
that the flight of insects is the mainspring on which flowers
depend to set the mechanism going in spite of its whiteness and
fragrance the water lily requires no help from nightflying
insects in getting its pollen transferred therefore when the
bees and flies rest from their labors at sundown it may close
the blinds of its shop business being ended for the day
when doctors disagree who shall decide it is contended by one
group of scientists that the water lily which shows the plainest
metamorphosis of some sort has developed its stamens from petals
 just the reverse of natures method other botanists claim a
perfect flower we know may consist of only a stamen and a
pistil the essential organs all other parts being desirable
but of only secondary importance gardeners taking advantage of
a wild flowers natural tendency to develop petals from stamens
and to become double are able to produce the magnificent roses
and chrysanthemums of today and so it would seem that the water
lily which may be either selffertilized or crossfertilized by
pollencarriers in its present state of development is looking
to a more ideal condition by increasing its attractiveness to
insects as it increases the number of its petals and by

beavers when they used to be common in the east so often made
use of the laurel magnolia not only of the roots for food but
of the trunk whose bitter bark white sapwood and soft
reddishbrown heartwood were gnawed in constructing their huts
that in some sections it is still known as the beavertree
according to delpino the conspicuous pollenladen magnolia
flowers with their easily accessible nectar attract beetles
chiefly these winged messengers entering the heart of a newly
opened blossom find shelter beneath the inner petals that form a
vault above their heads and warmth that may be felt by the
finger and abundant food consequently they remain long in an
asylum so delightful or until the expanding petals turn them out
to carry the pollen with which they have been thoroughly dusted
during their hospitable entertainment to younger flowers as the
blossoms mature their stigmas in the first stage and the anthers
in the second it follows the beetles must regularly
crossfertilize them as they fly from one shelter to another

the shining evergreen thriceparted leaves with which this
charming little plant carpets its retreats form the best of
backgrounds to set off the fragile tiny white flowers that look
like small wood anemones why does the goldthread choose to
dwell where bees and butterflies most flowers best friends

develops abundant fungi also perfectly suits the fungus gnats and
certain fungusfeeding beetles that are its principal
benefactors the entire flower is constructed with reference to
their visits says mr clarence moores weed the showy sepals
attract their attention the abnormal petals furnish them food
the many small stamens with white anthers and white pollen
furnish a surface to walk upon and a foreground in which the
yellow nectarcups are distinctly visible the longspreading
recurved stigmas cover so large a portion of the blossom that it
would be difficult even for one of the tiny visitors to take many
steps without contact with one of them on a sunny june day the
lens usually reveals at least one tiny gnat making his way from
one clubshaped petal to another  for the insignificant petals
are mere nectaries  and transferring pollen from flower to

fully ripen and the rigid stems which bear them thicken and
redden we cannot fail to notice them as the sepals fall early
the white stamens and stigmas are the most conspicuous parts of
the flowers a cluster opening its blossoms almost
simultaneously the plants only hope of crossfertilization lies
in the expectation that the small female bees halictus which
come for pollen  no nectar being secreted  will leave some
brought from another flower on the stigma as they enter and
before collecting a fresh supply the time elapsing between the
maturity of the stigmas and the anthers is barely perceptible
nevertheless there is a tendency toward the former maturing

tall white rockets shooting upward from a mass of large handsome
leaves in some heavily shaded midsummer woodland border cannot
fail to impress themselves through more than one sense for their
odor is as disagreeable as the fleecy white blossoms are
striking obviously such flowers would be most attractive to the
carrion and meat flies cimicifuga meaning to drive away bugs
and the old folkname of bugbane testify to a degree of
offensiveness to other insects where the flies enjoyment
begins as these are the only insects one is likely to see about
the fleecy wands doubtless they are their benefactors the
countless stamens which feed them generously with pollen
willingly left for them alone must also dust them well as they
crawl about before flying to another fetid lunch

according to one poetical greek tradition anemos the wind
employs these exquisitely delicate little starlike namesakes as
heralds of his coming in early spring while woods and hillsides
still lack foliage to break his gusts rude force pliny declared
that only the wind could open anemones another legend utilized
by countless poets pictures venus wandering through the forests
griefstricken over the death of her youthful lover
    alas the paphian fair adonis slain
     tears plenteous as his blood she pours amain
     but gentle flowers are born and bloom around
     from every drop that falls upon the ground
     where streams his blood there blushing springs the rose
     and where a tear has dropped a windflower blows
indeed in reading the poets ancient and modern for references to
this favorite blossom one realizes as never before the
significance of an anthology literally a flower gathering
but it is chiefly the european anemone that is extolled by the
poets nevertheless our more slender fragile palerleaved and
smallerflowered species known strange to say by the same
scientific name possesses the greater charm doctors with more
prosaic eyes than the poets find acrid and dangerous juices in
the anemone and its kin certain european peasants will run past
a colony of these pure innocent blossoms in the belief that the
very air is tainted by them yet the romans ceremonially picked
the first anemone of the year with an incantation supposed to
guard them against fever the identical plant that blooms in our
woods which may be found also in asia is planted on graves by
the chinese who call it the death flower
to leave legend and folk lore the practical scientist sees in
the anemone trembling and bending before the wind a perfect
adaptation to its environment anchored in the light soil by a
horizontal rootstock furnished with a stem so slender and
pliable no blast can break it its pretty leaves whorled where
they form a background to set off the fragile beauty of the
solitary flower above them a corolla economically dispensed
with since the white sepals are made to do the advertising for
insects the slightly nodding attitude of the blossom in cloudy
weather that the stigmas may be in the line of the fall of
pollen jarred out by the wind in case visitors seeking pollen
fail to bring any from other anemones   all these features teach
that every plant is what it is for excellent reasons of its own
that it is a sentient being not to be admired for superficial
beauty merely but also for those same traits which operate in
the human race making it the most interesting of studies
note the clusters of tuberous dahlialike roots the whorl of
thin threelobed rounded leaflets on long fine petioles
immediately below the smaller pure white or pinkish flowers
usually growing in loose clusters to distinguish the more common
rueanemone syndesmon thalictroides  thalictrum anemonoides of
gray from its cousin the solitary flowered wood or true anemone
generally there are three blossoms of the rueanemone to a
cluster the central one opening first the side ones only after
it has developed its stamens and pistils to prolong the season of
bloom and encourage crosspollination by insects in the eastern
half of the united states and less abundantly in canada these
are among the most familiar spring wild flowers pick them and
they soon wilt miserably lift the plants early with a good ball
of soil about the roots and they will unfold their fragile
blossoms indoors bringing with them something of the unspeakable
charm of their native woods and hillsides just waking into life
the tall or summer anemone a virginiana called also
thimbleweed from its oblong thimblelike fruithead bears
solitary inconspicuous greenish or white flowers often over an
inch across and generally with five rounded sepals on erect
long stalks from june to august contrasted with the dainty

hairy plant two or three feet tall its preference is for
woodlands whereas another summer bloomer the longfruited
anemone a cylindrica a smaller silkyhairy plant often
confused with it chooses open places fields and roadsides the
leaves of the thimbleweed which are set in a whorl high up on
the stem and also spring from the root after the true anemone
fashion are long petioled threeparted the divisions variously
cut lobed and sawedged the flowerstalks which spring from
this whorl continue to rise throughout the summer the first or
middle of these peduncles lacks leaves later ones bear two
leaves in the middle from which more flowerstalks arise and so

distribution  georgia and kansas northward less common beyond

fleecy white clusters of wild clematis festooning woodland and
roadside thickets vary so much in size and attractiveness that
one cannot but investigate the reason examination shows that
comparatively few of the flowers are perfect that is few
contain both stamens and pistils the great majority are either
male  the more showy ones  or female  the ones so conspicuous
in fruit  and like quakers in meeting the sexes are divided
the plant that bears staminate blossoms produces none that are
pistillate and vice versa  another marvelous protection against
that horror of the floral race selffertilization and a case of
absolute dependence on insect help to perpetuate the race since
the clematis blooms while insect life is at its height and after
most if not all of the ranunculaceae have withdrawn from the
competition for trade moreover since its white color so
conspicuous in shady retreats and its accessible nectar attract
hosts of flies and the small shorttongued bees chiefly that
are compelled to work for it by transferring pollen while they
feed it goes without saying that the vine is a winner in lifes
race
charles darwin who made so many interesting studies of the power
of movement in various plants devoted special attention to the
clematis clan of which about one hundred species exist but
alas none to our travellers joy that flings out the right hand
of good fellowship to every twig within reach winds about the
sapling in brotherly embrace drapes a festoon of flowers from
shrub to shrub hooks even its sensitive leafstalks over any
available support as it clambers and riots on its lovely way by
rubbing the footstalk of a young leaf with a twig a few times on
any side darwin found a clematis leaf would bend to that side in
the course of a few hours but return to the straight again if
nothing remained on which to hook itself to show how sensitive
the young petioles are he wrote i may mention that i just
touched the undersides of two with a little watercolor which
when dry formed an excessively thin and minute crust but this
sufficed in twentyfour hours to cause both to bend downwards
in early autumn when the long silvery decorative plumes
attached to a ball of seeds form feathery hoary masses even more
fascinating than the flower clusters the name of old mans beard
is most suggestive these seeds never open but when ripe each
is borne on the autumn gales to sink into the first moist
springy resting place

masses of these soft feathery flowers towering above the ranker
growth of midsummer possess an unseasonable ethereal chaste
springlike beauty on some plants the flowers are white and
exquisite others again are dull and coarser why is this
because these are what botanists term polygamous flowers ie
some of them are perfect containing both stamens and pistils
some are male only others again are female naturally an
insect like ourselves is first attracted to the more beautiful
male blossoms the pollen bearers and of course it transfers the
vitalizing dust to the dull pistillate flowers visited later but
the meadowrue which produces a superabundance of very light
dry pollen easily blown by the wind is often fertilized through
that agent also just as grasses plantains sedges birches
oaks pines and all conebearing trees are as might be
expected a plant which has not yet ascended the evolutionary
scale high enough to economize its pollen by making insects carry
it invariably overtops surrounding vegetation to take advantage
of every breeze that blows
the early meadowrue t dioicum found blooming in open rocky
woods during april and may from alabama northward to labrador
and westward to missouri grows only one or two feet high and
like its tall sister bears fleecy greenishwhite flowers the
staminate and the pistillate ones on different plants these
produce no nectar they offer no showy corolla advertisement to
catch the eye of passing insects yet so abundant is the dry
pollen produced by the male blossoms that insects which come to
feed on it must occasionally transfer some albeit this primitive
genus still depends largely on the wind not its flower but the
exquisite foliage resembling sprays of a robust maidenhair fern
is this meadowrues chief charm
the purplish meadowrue t purpurascens so like the tall
species in general characteristics that one cannot tell the dried
and pressed specimens of these variable plants apart is easily
named afield by the purplish tinge of its green polygamous
flowers often its stems show color also sometimes not always
the plant is downy and the comparatively thick leaflets which
are dark green above are waxy beneath we look for this
meadowrue in copses and woodlands from northern canada to
florida and far westward after the early meadowrue has
flowered but before the tall one spreads its fleecy panicles

rootstocks corms and bulbs which store up food during the
winter like the irises solomons seals bloodroot adders
tongue and crocuses are prepared to rush into blossom far
earlier in spring than fibrousrooted species that must
accumulate nourishment after the season has opened
a newly opened flower which is in the female stage has its
anthers tightly closed and pollen must therefore be carried from
distinct plants by the shorttongued bees and flies out
collecting it no nectar rewards their search although they
alight on young blossoms in the expectation of finding some food
and so crossfertilize them late in the afternoon the petals
which have been in a showy horizontal position during the day
rise to the perpendicular before closing to protect the flowers

supply in separate nurseries and sealed up she dies from
exhaustion leaving her grub progeny to eat its way through the
larva into the chrysalis state and finally into that of a winged
bee that flies away to liberty these are the little bees so
constantly seen about willow catkins
country children on their way to school through the woods often
dig up the curious long crisp root of the toothwort which
tastes much like the watercress to eat with their sandwiches at
the noon recess then as they examine the little pointed
projections on the rootstock they see why the plant received its
name
another toothwort found throughout a similar range the
cutleaved toothwort or pepperroot d laciniata has its
equally edible rootstock scarcely toothed but rather constricted
in places giving its little tubers the appearance of beads
strung into a necklace its white or pale purplishpink
crossshaped flowers loosely clustered at the end of an
unbranched stem rise by preference above moist ground in rich
woods often beside a spring from april to june  a longer
season for wooing and working its insect friends than the
twoleaved toothwort has attained to  hence it is the commoner
plant instead of having two leaves on its stem this species
spreads whorls of three leaves thrice divided almost to the
base the divisions toothed or lobed and the side ones sometimes
deeply cleft the larger longer petioled leaves that rise
directly from the rootstock have scarcely developed at flowering

at a glance one knows it to be related to the alyssum and

vaunted purses  the tiny heartshaped seedpods that so rapidly
succeed the flowers what is the secret of its successful march
over the face of the earth like the equally triumphant
chickweed it is easily satisfied with unoccupied wasteland it
avoids the fiercest competition for insect trade by prolonging
its season of bloom far beyond that of any native flower for
there is not a month in the year when one may not find it even in
new england in sheltered places having vanquished in the fiercer
struggle for survival in the old world it finds life here one
long holiday and finally by clustering a large number of
relatively small flowers together it attracts the insects that
this method of arrangement pleases best the flies syrphidae and
muscidae which crossfertilize it in fine weather transferring
enough pollen from plant to plant to save the species from
degeneracy through close inbreeding however the long stamens
standing on a level with the stigma are well calculated to
selfpollenize the flowers the flies failing them

an insignificantly small plant too common however to be wholly
ignored although each tiny flower secretes four drops of nectar
between the bases of the short stamens and the long ones next
them it would be unreasonable to depend wholly upon insects to
carry pollen since there is so little else to attract them
therefore the anthers of the four long stamens regularly shed
directly upon the stigma below them leaving to the few visitors
the small bees chiefly the transferring from flower to flower of
pollen from the two short stamens which must be touched if they
would reach the nectar in spite of the persistency with which
these little blossoms fertilize themselves they certainly
increase at a prodigious rate but how much larger and more
beautiful might they not be if they possessed more executive
ability
a similar but larger plant with its hairy leaves not only tufted
at the base but also alternating up the stiff stem is the hairy

here is a bloodthirsty little miscreant that lives by reversing
the natural order of higher forms of life preying upon lower
ones an anomaly in that the vegetable actually eats the animal
the dogbane as we have seen simply catches the flies that dare
trespass upon the butterflies preserves for excellent reasons
of its own the silenes and phloxes among others spread their
calices with a sticky gum that acts as limed twigs do to birds
in order to guard the nectar secreted for flying benefactors from
pilfering ants the honey bee being an imported not a native
insect and therefore not perfectly adapted to the milkweed
occasionally gets entrapped by it the big bumblebee is sometimes
fatally imprisoned in the moccasin flowers gorgeous tomb  the
punishment of insects that do not benefit the flowers is infinite
in its variety but the local venuss flytrap dionaea
muscipula gathered only from the low savannas in north carolina
to entertain the owners of hothouses as it promptly closes the
crushing trap at the end of its sensitive leaves over a hapless
fly and the common sundew that tinges the peatbogs of three
continents with its little reddish leaves belong to a distinct
class of carnivorous plants which actually masticate their animal
food depending upon it for nourishment as men do upon cattle
slaughtered in an abattoir darwins luminous account of these
two species alone which occupies over three hundred absorbingly
interesting pages of his insectivorous plants should be read by
everyone interested in these freaks of nature
when we go to some sunny cranberry bog to look for these sundews
nothing could be more innocent looking than the tiny plant its
nodding raceme of buds usually with only a solitary little
blossom that opens only in the sunshine at the top of the
curve its leaves glistening with what looks like dew though the
midsummer sun may be high in the heavens a little fly or gnat
attracted by the bright jewels alights on a leaf only to find
that the clear drops more sticky than honey instantly glue his
feet that the pretty reddish hairs about him act like tentacles
reaching inward to imprison him within their slowly closing
embrace here is one of the horrors of the inquisition operating
in this land of liberty before our very eyes excited by the
struggles of the victim the sensitive hairs close only the
faster working on the same principle that a vines tendrils do
when they come in contact with a trellis more of the sticky
fluid pours upon the hapless fly plastering over his legs and
wings and the pores on his body through which he draws his
breath slowly surely the leaf rolls inward making a temporary
stomach the cruel hairs bind the glue suffocates and holds him
fast death alone releases him and now the leafs orgy begins
moistening the fly with a fresh peptic fluid which helps in the
assimilation the plant proceeds to digest its food curiously
enough chemical analysis proves that this sundew secretes a
complex fluid corresponding almost exactly to the gastric juice
in the stomach of animals
darwin who fed these leaves with various articles found that
they could dissolve matter out of pollen seeds grass etc yet
without a human caterer how could a leaf turn vegetarian when a
bit of any undesirable substance such as chalk or wood was
placed on the hairs and excited them they might embrace it
temporarily but as soon as the mistake was discovered it would
be dropped he also poisoned the plants by administering acids
and gave them fatal attacks of indigestion by overfeeding them
with bits of raw beef
other common sundews the spatulateleaved sundew d intermedia
and the threadleaved sundew d filiformis whose purplishpink
flowers are reared above wet sand along the coast possess
contrivances similar to the roundleaved plants to pursue their
gruesome business why should these vegetables turn carnivorous
doubtless because the soil in which they grow can supply little
or no nitrogen very small roots testify to the small use they
serve the water sucked up through them from the bog aids in the
manufacture of the fluid so freely exuded by the bristly glands
but nitrogen must be obtained by other means even at the
sacrifice of insect victims

whats in a name certainly our common grass of parnassus which

home of the muses nor sought the steaming savannas of the

have sprung up on mount parnassus is at home here only in the
canadian border states and northward
at first analysis one is puzzled by the clusters of filaments at
the base of each petal of what use are they we have seen in the

fleecy white plumes of meadowsweet the spires of closely
clustered bloom sung by dora read goodale are surely not
frequently found near dusty waysides scorched with barren heat
even in her berkshires their preference is for moister soil
often in the same habitat with a first cousin the pink
steeplebush but plants like humans are capricious creatures
if the meadowsweet always elected to grow in damp ground whose
rising mists would clog the pores of its leaves doubtless they
would be protected with a woolly absorbent as its cousins are
inasmuch as perfume serves as an attraction to the more highly
specialized aesthetic insects not required by the spiraeas our
meadowsweet has none in spite of its misleading name small
bees especially andrenidae flies syrphidae and beetles
among other visitors come in great numbers seeking the
accessible pollen and in this case nectar also secreted in a
conspicuous orangecolored disk when a floret first opens or
even before the already mature stigmas overtop the incurved
undeveloped stamens so that any visitor dusted from other
clusters crossfertilizes it but as the stigmas remain fresh
even after the stamens have risen and shed their abundant pollen
it follows that in longcontinued stormy weather when few
insects are flying the flowers fertilize themselves
selffertilization with insect help must often occur in the
flowers second stage the fragrant yellowishwhite english

leaves are compounded of several leaflets like those on its
relative the rosebush from new york southward and westward to
missouri also on the pacific coast to alaska is its range on
this continent very many more beetles than any other visitors
transfer pollen from the staminate flowers on one plant to the
pistillate ones on another other plants produce only perfect

appearance
another herbaceous perennial once counted a spiraea is the common
indian physic or bowmansroot porteranthus trifoliatus

pretty clusters of white or pale pink flowers comparatively few
in the whole panicle each blossom measuring about a half inch
across and borne on a slender pedicel a tubular 5toothed calyx
has the long slender petals inserted within owing to the depth
and narrowness of the tube the small longtongued bees cannot
reach the nectar without dusting their heads with pollen from the
anthers inserted in a ring around the entrance or leaving some on
the stigmas of other blossoms later the five carpels make as

who but the bees and such small visitors care about the raspberry
blossoms notwithstanding the nectar secreted in a fleshy ring
for their benefit comparatively few insects enter the flowers
whose small erect petals imply no hospitable welcome
occasionally a visitor laden with pollen from another plant
alights in the center of a blossom and leaves some on the
stigmas in bending his head down between them and the stamens to
reach the refreshment but inasmuch as the erect petals allow no
room for the stamens to spread out and away from the stigmas it
follows that selffertilization very commonly occurs
of course men and children bears and birds are vastly more
interested in the delicious berries men for the reason that
several excellent market varieties some white or pale red the
cuthbert and hansall berries among others owe their origin to
this hardy native many superior sorts derived from its european
counterpart r idaeus cannot well endure our rigorous northern
climate as in the case of most berrybearing species the
raspberry depends upon the birds to drop its undigested seeds
over the country that new colonies may arise under freer
conditions indeed one of the best places for the budding
ornithologist to take operaglasses and notebook is to a
raspberry patch early in the morning
the black raspberry black cap or scotch cap or thimbleberry r

chooses but especially in burnedover districts from virginia
northward and westward has very long smooth canelike stems
often bending low until they root again at the tips these are

more compactly are sparingly visited by insects nevertheless

purplishblack berries hollow like a thimble where they drop

hybrids have been derived from this prolific species also indeed
its offspring are the easiest raspberries to grow since they
form new plants at the tips of the branches yet do not weaken
themselves with suckers and so even without care yield immense

     there was a man of our town
      and he was wondrous wise
      he jumped into a bramble bush 
if we must have poetical associations for every flower mother
goose furnishes several
but for the practical mind this plants chief interest lies in
the fact that from its wild varieties the famous lawton and
kittatinny blackberries have been derived the late peter
henderson used to tell how the former came to be introduced a
certain mr secor found an unusually fine blackberry growing wild
in a hedge at new rochelle new york and removed it to his
garden where it increased apace but not even for a gift could
he induce a neighbor to relieve him of the superfluous bushes so
little esteemed were blackberries in his day however a shrewd
lawyer named lawton at length took hold of it exhibited the
fruit advertised it cleverly and succeeded in pocketing a snug
little fortune from the sale of the prolific plants another fine
variety of the common wild blackberry which was discovered by a
clergyman at the edge of the woods on the kittatinny mountains in
new jersey has produced fruit under skilled cultivation that
still remains the best of its class when clusters of blossoms
and fruit in various stages of green red and black hang on the
same bush few ornaments in natures garden are more decorative
because bramble flowers show greater executive ability than the
raspberries do they flaunt much larger petals and spread them
out flat to attract insect workers as well as to make room for
the stamens to spread away from the stigmas  an arrangement
which gives freer access to the nectar secreted in a fleshy ring
at the base heavy bumblebees which require a firm support
naturally alight in the center just as they do in the wild
roses and deposit on the early maturing stigmas some imported
pollen they may therefore be regarded as the truest benefactors
and it will be noticed that for their special benefit the nectar
is rather deeply concealed where shorttongued insects cannot
rob them of it small bees which come only to gather pollen from
first the outer and then the inner rows of stamens and a long
list of other lightweight visitors too often alight on the
petals to effect crossfertilization regularly but they usually
selffertilize the blossoms competition between these flowers

sugar and cream one fervently quotes dr boteler with dear old
lzaak walton shakespeare says  my lord of ely when i was last
in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there is not
this the first reference to the strawberry under cultivation
since the time of henry v what multitudes of garden varieties
past the reckoning have been evolved from the smooth conic
european wood strawberry f vesca now naturalized in our
eastern and middle states as well as from our own precious
pitted native some authorities claim the berry received its name
from the straw laid between garden rows to keep the fruit clean
but in earliest anglosaxon it was called streowberie and later
straberry from the peculiarity of its straying suckers lying as
if strewn on the ground and so after making due allowance for
the erratic goasyouplease spelling of early writers it would
seem that there might be two theories as to the origin of the
name
since the different sexes of these flowers frequently occur on
separate plants good reason have they to woo insect messengers
with a showy corolla a ring of nectar and abundant pollen to be
transferred while they are feasted lucky is the gardener who
succeeds in keeping birds from pecking their share of the berries
which of course were primarily intended for them in english
gardens one is almost certain to find a thrush or two imprisoned
under the nets so futilely spread over strawberry beds just as
their american cousin the robin is caught here in june
a young botanist may be interested to note the difference in the
formation of the raspberry or blackberry and the strawberry in
the former it is the carpels ovaries that swell around the
spongy receptacle into numerous little fruits drupelets united
into one berry whereas it is the cushionlike receptacle itself
in the strawberry blossom that swells and reddens into fruit

the shadbush or swamp sugarpear a botryapium because it was
formerly accounted a mere variety oblongifolia of the preceding
species still shares with it its popular names but swamps
river banks brook sides and moist thickets are its habitat
consequently both its inflorescence and pale green glossy
foliage are covered with a sort of whitish cotton absorbent when
young to prevent the pores from clogging with vapors arising
from its damp retreats late in the season when streams narrow
or dry up altogether and the air becomes drier as the sun rises
higher in the heavens the foliage is usually quite smooth it
will be noticed that lovely as the shadbush is its smaller
flowers have shorter pedicels than the serviceberrys

happy must the honeybees have been to find that the sweet clover
one of their dearest delights in the old world had preceded them
in immigrating to the new immense numbers of insects  bees in
great variety wasps flies moths and beetles  visit the
little blossoms that provide entertainment so generous and
accessible but honeybees are ever especially abundant slight
weight depresses the keel releasing the stigma and anthers
therefore so soon as a bee alights and opens the flower he is
hit below the belt by the projecting stigma pollen carried by
him there from other clovers comes off on its sticky surface
before his abdomen gets freshly dusted from the anthers which
are necessarily rubbed against while he sips nectar on the
removal of his pressure the floret springs back to its closed
condition to protect the precious nectar and pollen from rain
and pilferers as the stigma projects too far beyond the anthers
to be likely to receive any of the flowers own pollen good
reason is there for the blossoms guarding their attractions for
the benefit of their friends which transfer the vitalizing dust
from one floret to another by clustering its small flowers in
spikes to make them conspicuous as well as to facilitate dining
for its benefactors by prolonging its season of bloom to get
relief from the fiercest competition for insect trade and so to
insure an abundance of vigorous crossfertilized seed this plant
reveals at a glance some of the reasons why it has been able to
establish itself so quickly throughout our vast area
both the white and the yellow sweet clover put their leaves to
sleep at night in a remarkable manner the three leaflets of each
leaf twist through an angle of 90 degrees until one edge of each
vertical blade is uppermost the two side leaflets darwin found
always tend to face the north with their upper surface one
facing northnorthwest and the other northnortheast while the
terminal leaflet escapes the chilling of its sensitive upper
surface through radiation by twisting to a vertical also but
bending to either east or west until it comes in contact with
the vertical upper surface of either of the side leaflets thus
the upper surface of the terminal and of at least one of the side
leaflets is sure to be well protected through the night one is
left out in the cold
the dried branches of sweet clover will fill a room with
delightful fragrance but they will not drive away flies nor
protect woolens from the ravages of moths as old women once
taught us to believe
the ubiquitous white or dutch clover trifolium repens whose
creeping branches send up solitary round heads of white or
pinkish flowers on erect leafless stems from may to december
in fields open waste land and cultivated places throughout our
area europe and asia devotes itself to wooing bees since
these are the only insects that effect crossfertilization
regularly other visitors aiding it only occasionally when nets
are stretched over these flowers to exclude insects only
onetenth the normal quantity of fertile seed is set therefore
for the bees benefit does each little floret conceal nectar in
a tube so deep that small pilferers cannot reach it but when a
honeybee for example depresses the keel of the papilionaceous
blossom abundant reward awaits him in consideration of his
services in transferring pollen after the floret which he has
been the means of fertilizing closes over its seedvessel on his
departure it gradually withers grows brown and hangs downward
partly to indicate to the next bee that comes along which fords
in the head still contain nectar and which are done for partly
to hide the precious little vigorous green seedpod in the center
of each withered papery corolla from the visitation of certain
insects whose minute grubs destroy countless millions of the
progeny of less careful plants thus the erect florets in a head
stand awaiting their benefactors those drooping around the outer
edge are engaged in the most serious business of life sometimes
a solitary old maid remains standing looking anxiously for a
lover at the end of the season usually all the florets are then
bent down around the stem in a brown and crumpled mass but
however successfully the clover guards its seeds from
annihilation its foliage is the favorite food of very many
species of caterpillars and of all grazing cattle the world
around this is still another plant frequently miscalled
shamrock good luck or bad attends the finding of the leaves
when compounded of an even or an odd number of leaflets more than
the normal count according to the saying of many simpleminded
folk
the little rabbitsfoot pussy oldfield or stone clover t
arvense has silky plumed calices to hold its minute whitish
florets giving the dense oblong heads a charming softness and
dove color after it has gone to seed like most other clovers it
has come to us from the old world

are no more the true flowers in the one case than the large red

involucres are in the other from the milky juice alone one might
guess the spurge to be related to the rubber plant still another
familiar cousin is the stately castoroil plant and while the
common dull purplish ipecac spurge e ipecacuanhae also
suggests unpleasant doses it is really a member of quite another

and flies dipteria seeking the freely exposed nectar secreted
in five orangecolored glands in the shallow little cups as some
of the flowers are staminate and some pistillate although others

the loss of the decorative darkred velvety panicles beware
only of the poison sumacs deadly round grayishwhite berries
most sumacs contain more or less tannin in their bark and leaves
that are therefore eagerly sought by agents for the leather
merchants the beautiful smoke or mist tree r cotinus

black or mountain sumac r copallina may be known by its
dark glossy green foliage pale on the underside and by the
broadening of the stem into wings between the leaflets hungry
migrating birds alight to feast on the harmless acid red fruit
when the gorgeous autumnal foliage illuminates their route
southward but while they are of course the natural agents for
distributing the plants over the country men find that by
cutting bits of any sumac root and planting them in good garden
soil strong specimens are secured within a year an exquisite

most painful swelling and irritation to the skin of some people
though they do nothing more than pass it by when the wind is
blowing over it others may handle both these plants with
impunity in spring they are especially noisome but when the
pores of the skin are opened by perspiration people who are at
all sensitive should give them a wide berth at any season
usually the poison sumac grows in wet or swampy ground its bark
is gray its leafstalks are red the leaves are compounded of
fewer leaflets than those of the innocent sumacs  that is of
from seven to thirteen  which are green on both sides the
flowers which are dull whitishgreen grow in loose panicles
from the axils of the leaves and naturally the berries follow
them in the same unusual situation by their fruits ye shall

to freeze he tells us because it was believed to repel
lightning the romans planted it near their houses and a branch
of it thrown after any refractory animal even if it did not hit
him would subdue him instantly and cause him to lie down meekly
beside the stick can it be that the italian peasants who still
believe cattle kneel in their stalls at midnight on the
anniversary of jesus birth decorate the mangers on christmas
eve with holly among other plants because of a survival of this
old pagan notion about its subduing effect on animals
would that the beautiful holly of english gardens i

than our own might live here but it is too tender to withstand

being filled the mother emits a substantial froth at the end of

grapevine planted
what fragrance is more delicious than that of the blossoming
grape to swing in a loop made by some strong old vine when the
air almost intoxicates one with its sweetness on a june evening
is many a country childs idea of perfect bliss not until about
nine oclock do the leaves go to sleep by becoming depressed in
the center like saucers this was the signal for bedtime that one
child at least used to wait for we have seen in the clematis
how its sensitive leafstalks hook themselves over any support
they rub against but the grapevine has gone a step farther and
by discarding an occasional flower cluster and prolonging the
flower stalk into a coiling forking tendril it moors itself to
the thicket we know that all tendrils are either transformed
leaves as in the case of the pea vine where each branch of its
tendril represents a modified leaflet or they are transformed
flower stalks or other organs occasionally the tendril of a
grapevine reveals its ancestry by bearing a blossom or a cluster
of flowers and sometimes even fruit about midway on the coil
which attempts to fill all offices at once like pooh bah
the phylloxera having destroyed many of the finest vineyards in
europe it would seem that americans have the best of chances to
supply the world with highclass wines for there is not a state
in the union where the vine will not flourish here its worst
enemy is mildew a parasitical fungus which attacks the leaves
revealing itself in yellowishbrown patches on the upper side
and thin frosty patches underneath soon the leaves become sere
and then they fall the microscope reveals a miniature forest of
growth in each leaf with the threadlike roots of the fungi
searching about the leaf cells for food to burn old leaves and
to blow sulphur over the vine while it is wet are efficacious
remedies bees and wasps which puncture grapes to feast on them
are the innocent means of destroying quantities

another familiar member of the grape family the virginia
creeper false grape american or fiveleaved ivy also
erroneously called woodbine parthenocissus quinquefolia
formerly ampelopsis quinquefolia  is far more charming in its
glorious autumnal foliage when its small dark blue berries hang
from red peduncles than when its insignificant greenish flower
clusters appear in july the leaves compounded of five leaflets
should sufficiently distinguish the harmless vine from the
threeleaved poison ivy sometimes confounded with it from
manitoba and mexico to the atlantic ocean and even in cuba the
virginia creeper rambles over thickets fences and walls
ascends trees festoons rocky woodlands drapes our verandas
making its way with the help of modified flower stalks that are
now branching tendrils each branch bearing an adhesive disk at
the end in the course of about two days after a tendril has
arranged its branches so as to press upon any surface says
darwin its curved tips swell become bright red and form on
their undersides little disks or cushions with which they adhere
firmly it is supposed that these disks secrete a cement at any
rate we know that they have a very tenacious hold because often
one contracting tendril as elastic as a steel spring supports
by means of these little disks the entire weight of the branch
it lifts up darwin concluded that a tendril with five
diskbearing branches on which he experimented would stand a
strain of ten pounds even after ten years exposure to high
winds and softening rains

the wild spikenard or false solomons seal has not the remotest
connection with this tribe of plants inasmuch as some of the
american spikenards tiny flowers are staminate and some
pistillate while others again are perfect they depend upon
flies chiefly  but on some wasps and beetles too  to transfer
pollen and enable the fertile ones to set seed how certain of
the winter birds gormandize on the resinous spicy little
berries a flock of juncos will strip the fruit from every

the wild or false sarsaparilla a nudicaulis so common in
woods hillsides and thickets shelters its three spreading
umbels of greenishwhite flowers in may and june beneath a canopy
formed by a large solitary compound leaf the aromatic roots
which run horizontally sometimes three feet or more through the
soil send up a very short smooth proper stem which lifts a tall
leafstalk and a shorter naked flower stalk the single large
leaf of exquisite bronzy tints when young is compounded of from
three to five oval toothed leaflets on each of its three
divisions the tiny fiveparted flowers have their petals curved
backward over the calyx to make their refreshments more
accessible for the flies on which they chiefly rely for aid in
producing those close clusters of darkpurple berries on which
migrating birds feast in early autumn by these agents the plant
has been distributed from newfoundland to the carolinas westward
from manitoba to missouri which is not surprising when we
remember that certain birds travel from the gulf of mexico to the
great lakes in a single night while the true sarsaparilla of
medicine should come from a quite different herb that flourishes
in mexico and south america this one furnishes a commercial
substitute enormously used as a blood purifier and cooling summer
drink burrowing rabbits delight to nibble the long slender
fragrant roots
the ginseng panax quinquefolium aralia quinquefolia of gray
found in rich woods from quebec to alabama and westward to
nebraska  that is where found at all for much hunting has all

small yellowishgreen fiveparted polygamous flowers in july
and august at the end of a smooth stem about a foot high bright
crimson berries follow the clusters on the female plants in early
autumn three longpetioled leaves which grow in a whorl at the
top of the low stem are palmately divided into five thin ovate
pointed and irregularly toothed leaflets but it is the deep
fusiform root simple or branched about which the americanized
chinese at least are most concerned for centuries chinese
physicians have ascribed miraculous virtues to the manchurian
ginseng not only can it remove fatigue and restore lost powers
but by its use veterans became frisky youths again according to
these wise men of the east in short they consider it the
panacea for all ills panax pan  all akos  remedy  the
source of immortality naturally the roots were and are in great
demand especially such as branch so as to resemble the human
form both the chinese name schinsen and garantoguen the
indian one are said to mean like a man here is an interesting
clue for the ethnologists to follow  imperial edict prohibited
the chinese from digging up their native plant lest it be
exterminated so jesuit missionaries who discovered our similar
ginseng were not slow in exporting it to china when it was
literally worth its weight in gold indeed it is always sold by
weight  a fact on which the heathen chinee with ways that are
dark and tricks that are vain not infrequently relies chinamen
who gather large quantities in our western states to sell to the
wholesale druggists for export sometimes drill holes into the
largest roots pour in melted lead and plug up the drills so
ingeniously that druggists refuse to pay for a chinamans

to spread its delicate wheels over our summer landscape until
whole fields are whitened by them east of the mississippi having
proved fittest in the struggle for survival in the fiercer
competition of plants in the overcultivated old world it takes

favorable conditions for colonizing in our vast uncultivated

what is the secret of the wild carrots triumphal march as
usual it is to be sought chiefly in the flowers scheme to
attract and utilize visitors nectar being secreted in open disks
near to one another the shortesttongued insects can lick it up
from the umbelliferae with even less loss of time than from the
tubular florets of the cornpositae over sixty distinct species
of insects may be taken on the wild carrot by any amateur since
it blooms while insect life is at its height but as might be
expected the longtongued and colorloving specialized bees and
butterflies do not often waste time on florets so easily drained
by the mob ants find the stiff hairs on the stem disagreeable
obstacles to pilfering but no visitors seem to object to the
flowers suffocating odor
one of these lacy white umbels must be examined under a lens
before its delicate structure and perfection of detail can be
appreciated naturally a visitor is attracted first by the
largest most showy florets situated around the outer edge of the
wheel on which he leaves pollen brought from another umbel and
any vitalizing dust remaining on his under side may be left on
the less conspicuous hermaphrodite blossoms as he makes his way
toward the center where the tiny pollenbearing florets are
grouped from the latter as he flies away he will carry fresh
pollen to the outer row of florets on another umbel and so on 
at least this is the usual and highly advantageous method after
general fertilization the slender flowerstalks curl inward and
the umbel forms a hollow nest that gradually contracts as it
dries almost if not quite closing at the top albeit the
fiction that bees and spiders make their home in the seeding
umbels circulates freely
still another fiction is that the cultivated carrot introduced
to england by the dutch in queen elizabeths reign was derived
from this wild species miller the celebrated english botanist
and gardener among many others has disproved this statement by
utterly failing again and again to produce an edible vegetable
from this wild root when cultivation of the garden carrot lapses
for a few generations it reverts to the ancestral type a
species quite distinct from daucus carota

graceful in gesture with delicate fernlike leaves and
anisescented roots that children like rabbits delight to
nibble the sweet cicely attracts attention by its fragrance
however insignificant its flowers in wooded places such as it
prefers to dwell in white blossoms which are far more
noticeable in a dim light than colored ones and finely cut
leaves that can best withstand the drip from trees abound these
white umbels bear a large proportion of male or pollenbearing
florets to the number of hermaphrodite or twosexed florets
but as the latter mature their pollen before their stigmas become
susceptible to it selffertilization is well guarded against
and crossfertilization is effected with the help of as many
flies as small bees which come in numbers to lick up the nectar
so freely exposed in consideration of their short tongues we
have to thank these little creatures for the long slender seeds
armed with short bristles along the ribs that they may snatch
rides on our garments together with the beggarticks burdock

was there no more important genus  containing if possible red
white and blue flowers  to have named in honor of the father of
his country
another member of the carrot family the sanicle or black
snakeroot sanicula marylandica found blooming from may to july
in such rich moist woodlands and shrubbery as the sweet cicely
prefers lifts spreading two to four rayed umbels of
insignificantlooking but interesting little greenishwhite
florets at first the tips of the five petals are tucked into the
center of each little flower underneath them the stamens are now
imprisoned while any danger of selffertilizing the stigma
remains the few hermaphrodite florets have their styles
protruding from the start and incoming insects leave pollen
brought from staminate florets on the earlymaturing stigmas
after crossfertilization has been effected it is the pistils
turn to keep out of the way and give the imprisoned stamens a
chance the styles curve until the stigmas are pressed against
the sides of the ovary that not a grain of pollen may touch
them the petals spread and release the stamens but so great is
the flowers zeal not to be fertilized with its own pollen that
it sometimes holds the anthers tightly between the petals until
all the vitalizing dust has been shed around the hermaphrodite
florets are a large number of male florets in each hemispheric
cluster hooked bristles and slender curved styles protrude from
the little burrlike seeds that any creature passing by may give
them a lift to fresh colonizing land the firm bluishgreen
leaves palmately divided into from five to seven oblong
irregularly sawedged segments the upper leaves seated on the
stem the lower ones longpetioled help us to identify this
common weed
with splendid vigorous gesture the cowparsnip heracleum
lanatum rears itself from four to eight feet above moist rich

carrot tribe in june and july when a myriad of winged creatures
are flying large compound manyrayed umbels of both
hermaphrodite and male white flowers are spread to attract their
benefactors the flies of which twentyone species visit them
regularly besides small bees wasps and other shorttongued
insects which have no difficulty in licking up the freely
exposed nectar the anthers maturing first compel
crossfertilization which accounts for the plants vigor and its
aggressive march across the continent a very stout ridged
hairy stem the petioled leaves compounded of three broadly
ovate lobed and sawedged divisions downy on the underside and
the great umbels which sometimes measure a foot across all bear
out the general impression of a hercules of the fields
fools parsley or cicely or dogpoison aethusa cynapium a

familiar fragrance of true parsley the little narrow bracts
turned downward around each separate flowercluster give it a
bearded appearance otherwise the white umbel suggests a small
wild carrot head of bloom cows have died from eating this
innocentlooking little plant among the herbage but most
creatures know by instinct that it must not be touched
strange that a family which furnishes the carrot parsnip
parsley fennel caraway coriander and celery to mankind
should contain many members with deadly properties fortunately
the large coarse water hemlock spotted cowbane musquash root
or beaverpoison cicuta maculata has been branded as a
murderer purple streaks along its erect branching stem
correspond to the marks on cains brow above swamps and low
ground it towers twice or thrice pinnate leaves the lower ones
longstalked and often enormous the leaflets conspicuous veins
apparently ending in the notches of the coarse sharp teeth help
to distinguish it from its innocent relations sometimes
confounded with it its several tuberiform fleshy roots contain
an especially deadly poison nevertheless some highly
intelligent animals beavers rabbits and the omnivorous small
boy among others have mistaken it for sweetcicely with fatal
results indeed the potion drunk by socrates and other
philosophers and criminals at athens is thought to have been a
decoction made from the roots of this very hemlock many little
white flowers in each cluster make up a large umbel and many
umbels to a plant attract great numbers of flies small bees and
wasps which sip the freely exposed nectar apparently with only
the happiest consequences as they transfer pollen from the male
to the proterandrous hermaphrodite flowers just as the
cowparsnip shows a preponderance of flies among its visitors so
the water hemlock seems to attract far more bees and wasps than
any of the umbelbearing carrot tribe it blooms from the end of
june through august
still another poisonous species is the hemlock waterparsnip
sium cicutaefolium found in swampy places throughout canada
and the united states from ocean to ocean the compound
longrayed umbels of small white flowers fringybracted below
which measure two or three inches across the extremely variable
pinnate leaves which may be divided into from three to six pairs
of narrow and sharply toothed leaflets or perhaps the lower
longstalked ones as finely dissected as a wild carrot leaf where
they grow in water and the stout grooved branching stem from
two to six feet tall are its distinguishing characteristics in
these umbels it will be noticed there are far more hermaphrodite
or twosexed florets maturing their anthers first than there
are male ones consequently quantities of unwelcome seed are set
with the help of small bees wasps and flies which receive
generous entertainment from july to october
the mock bishopsweed ptilimnium capillaceum a slender

other common dogwoods there are  shrubs from three to ten feet
in height  which bear flat clusters of small white flowers
without the showy petallike bracts imitating a corolla as in
the two preceding species but each little fourparted blossom
attracting its miscellaneous crowd of benefactors by association
with dozens of its counterparts in a showy cyme because these
flowers expand farther than the minute florets of the dwarf
cornel or the flowering dogwood and the sweets are therefore

liliesofthevalley growing wild but closer inspection of the
rounded pearlike leaves in a cluster from the running root and
the concave not bellshaped white waxen blossoms with the

blossoms range from greenish white fleshcolor and pink to deep
purplish rose have so many features in common they were once
counted mere varieties of this roundleaved wintergreen  an
easygoing classification broken up by laterday systematists who
now rank the varieties as distinct species it will be noticed
that all these flowers have their anthers erect in the bud but
reversed at flowering time each of the two sacs opening by a
pore which in reality is at the base of the sac though by
reversion it appears to be at the top to these pores small bees
and flies fasten their short lips to feed on pollen some of
which will be necessarily jarred out on them as they struggle
for a foothold on the stamens and will be carried by them to
another flowers protruding stigma which impedes their entrance
purposely to receive the imported pollen

when the little serrated or onesided wintergreen p secunda
first sends up its slender raceme in june or july it is erect
but presently the small greenishwhite flowers opening
irregularly along one side appear to weigh it downward into a
curve usually several bracted scapes rise from a running
branched rootstock to a height of from three to rarely ten
inches above a cluster of basal evergreen leaves these latter
are rather thin oval slightly pointed wavy or slightly
sawedged the midrib prominent above and below a peculiarity of
the flowers is that their petals are partially welded together
into little bells with the clapper alias the straight green
pistil protruding and the stamens united around its base after
the blossoms have been fertilized the tiny round
fivescalloped seed capsules with the pistil still protruding

roots of pines in such yielding soil as will enable its long
stem to run just below the surface oneflowered pyrola it is
often called although it belongs to a genus all its own a
boldly curved stalk like a miniature bopeep crook enables the
solitary white or pink widely open flower to droop from the tip
thus protecting its precious contents from rain and from
crawling pilferers to whom a pendent blossom is as inaccessible
as a hanging birds nest is to snakes this fivepetalled waxen
flower half an inch across or over with its ten white
yellowtipped stamens and green clubshaped pistil projecting
from a conspicuous round ovary never nods more than six inches
above the ground often at only half that height when there is
no longer need for the stalk to crook that is to say after the
flower has begun to fruit it gradually straightens itself out so
that the little seed capsule with the style and its fivelobed
stigma still persistent is held erect the thin rounded finely
notched leaves measuring barely an inch in length are clustered
in whorls next the ground whether one comes upon colonies of
this gregarious little plant or upon a lonely straggler the

only a delightfully imaginative optimist like linnaeus could feel
the enthusiasm he expended on this dwarf shrub with its little

the beautiful lowgrowing staggerbush pieris mariana has its
small cylindric fiveparted white or pinktinted flowers
clustered at intervals along one side of the upright nearly
leafless smooth darkdotted branches of the preceding year
when the glossy oval leaves black dotted beneath are freshly
put forth in early summer  for the shrub is not strictly an
evergreen however late the old leaves may cling  it is said
that stupid sheep and calves which find them irresistibly
attractive stagger about from their poisonous effect just as
they do after feeding on this shrubs relative the lambkill
qv in sandy soil from southern new england to florida
rarely far inland one finds the staggerbush in bloom from may to
july on the dry plains of long island where it is common
indeed it appears a not unworthy relative of the fetterbush
pieris fioribunda that exquisite little evergreen with
quantities of small white urns drooping along its twigs which
nurserymen acquire from the mountains of our southern states to
adorn garden shrubbery at home and abroad mr william robinson
in his delightful book the english flower garden a book by
the way that rudyard kipling reads as the puritan read his
bible counts this fetterbush among the indispensables
much taller than the preceding dwarfs is the common privet
andromeda found in swamps and low ground from new england to the
gulf and in the southwest xolisma ligustrina whoever has seen
the privet almost universally grown in hedges is familiar with
the general aspect of this muchbranched shrub most farmers
boys know the andromedas mock mayapple a hollow stringy
growth of insect origin which they are not likely to confuse
with the pulpy juicy apple found on the closely related azaleas
qv abundant terminal spikelike or branched clusters of
white globular four or five parted flowers in close array
attract quantities of bees from the end of may to early july
notwithstanding each individual flower measures barely an eighth
of an inch across we have seen the fine hairtriggers which
other members of this same family the beautiful pink laurels
qv have set to be sprung by an incoming visitor now this
andromeda and similarly several of its immediate kin have a
quite different but equally effective method of throwing pollen
on its friends who come to call when one of the little banded
bees clings as he must to the tiny flower scarce half his size
thrusting his tongue obliquely through the globes narrow opening
to reach the nectar suddenly a shower of pollen is inhospitably
thrown upon him from within in probing between the ring of
anthers that are pressed against the style by the sshaped
curvature of the filaments so as to retain the pollen he needs
must displace some of them and release the vitalizing dust
through the large terminal pores in the anthersacs is he
discouraged by such rough treatment not at all off he flies to
another andromeda blossom and leaves some of the dust with which
he is powdered on the sticky stigma that impedes his entrance
before precipitating a fresh shower as he sips another reward
the straight columnlike pistil stigmatic on its tip only
allows the flowers own pollen to slide harmlessly down its
sides how exquisite are the most minute adjustments of floral
mechanism is it possible for one to remain an agnostic after the
evidences even the flowers show us of infinite wisdom and love
another denizen of swamps and low ground next of kin to the
trailing arbutus is the leatherleaf or dwarf cassandra
chamaedaphne calyculata a modest little shrub its stiff
slender branches plentifully set with thick oblong leaves that
grow gradually smaller the higher they go and when young are
densely covered with minute scurfy scales sometimes before the
snow has melted in april the leafy terminal shoots are hung with
multitudes of little waxywhite cylindric typical heath flowers
only about a quarter of an inch long each nodding from a leaf
axil and the whole forming onesided racemes but as the shrub
ranges from newfoundland to georgia and westward to illinois
british columbia and alaska some people find it blooming even
in july
mythological names were evidently in high favor among the
botanists who labeled the genuses comprising the heath family
phyllodoce the seanymph cassiope mother of andromeda
leucothoe andromeda herself pieris a name sometimes applied to
the muses from their supposed abode at pieria thessaly and
cassandra daughter of priam the prophetess who was shut up in a
madhouse because she prophesied the ruin of troy  these names
are as familiar to the student of this group of shrubs today as
they were to the devout greeks in the brave days of old

however truly the poets may make us feel the spirit of nature in
their verse can many be trusted when it comes to the letter of
natural science where camels arch their cool dark boughs oer
beds of wintergreen wrote bryant yet it is safe to say that
nine colonies of this hardy little plant out of every ten he saw
were under evergreen trees not dogwoods when the july sun melts
the fragrance out of the pines high overhead and the dim cool
forest aisles are more fragrant with commingled incense from a
hundred natural censers than any stone cathedrals the
wintergreens little waxy bells hang among the glossy leaves that
form their aromatic carpet on such a day in such a resting
place how one thrills with the consciousness that it is good to
be alive
omnivorous children who are addicted to birchchewing prefer
these tender yellowgreen leaves tinged with red when newly put
forth in june  youngsters rural new englanders call them then
in some sections a kind of tea is steeped from the leaves which
also furnish the oldfashioned embrocation wintergreen oil late
in the year the glossy bronze carpet of old leaves dotted over
with vivid red berries invites much trampling by hungry birds
and beasts especially deer and bears not to mention wellfed
humans coveys of bob whites and packs of grouse will plunge
beneath the snow for fare so delicious as this spicy mealy fruit
that hangs on the plant till spring of course for the benefit of
just such colonizing agents as they quite a different species
belonging to another family bears the true partridgeberry
albeit the wintergreen shares with it a number of popular names
in a strict sense neither of these plants produces a berry for
the fruit of the true partridgeberry vine mitchella repens is
a double drupe or stone bearer each half containing four hard
seedlike nutlets while the wintergreens so called berry is
merely the calyx grown thick fleshy and gaily colored  only a
coating for the fivecelled ovary that contains the minute seeds
little baskets of wintergreen berries bring none too high prices
in the fancy fruit and grocery shops when we calculate how many
charming plants such unnatural use of them sacrifices
closely allied to the wintergreen is the red bearberry
kinnikinic bears grape foxberry or mealberry as it is
variously called arctostaphylosuvaursi  bearberry trailing
its spreading branches over sandy ground rocky hillsides and
steeps until it sometimes forms luxuriant mats it closely
resembles its cousin the arbutus in its manner of growth and has
been mistaken for it by at least one poet but its tiny rounded
urnshaped flowers which come in may and june are white not
salver form and pink the entire plant is not rustyhairy the
dark little leathery evergreen leaves are spatulate and
moreover it bears small but abundant clusters of round
berrylike fruit an attainment the arbutus still struggles for
but cannot yet reach bumblebees are the flowers chief
benefactors game fowl especially grouse but many other birds
too and various animals which are glad to add the clusters of
smooth red bearberries to their scanty winter menu however
insipid and dry they may be have distributed the seed from

this common huckleberry oftener found in pies and muffins by the
average observer than in its native thickets unfortunately
ripens in flytime when the squeamish boarder in the summer
hotel does well to carefully scrutinize each mouthful for the
abundant fruit set on huckleberry bushes as on so many others
we are indebted chiefly to the lesser bees which receiving the
pollen jarred out from the terminal chinks in the anthersacs on
their undersides as they cling transfer it to the protruding
stigmas of the next blossom visited after fertilization when
the now useless corolla falls the tencelled ovary is protected
by the encircling calyx that grows rapidly swells fills with
juice and takes on color until it and the ovary together become
a socalled berry whose seeds are dropped far and wide by birds
and beasts the name huckleberry which is applied
indiscriminately to several species of vaccinium and
gaylussacia says professor l h bailey is evidently a
corruption of whortleberry whortleberry is in turn a corruption
of myrtleberry in the middle ages the true myrtleberry was
largely used in cookery and medicine but the european bilberry
or vaccinium so closely resembled it that the name was
transferred to the latter plant a circumstance commemorated by
linnaeus in the giving of the name vaccinium myrtillus to the
bilberry from the european whortleberry the name was transferred
to the similar american plants
a common little bushy shrub not a true blueberry found in moist
woods especially beside streams from new england to the gulf
states and westward to ohio is the blue tangle tangleberry or
dangleberry now tall huckleberry g frondosa it bears a few

racemes and corresponding clusters of most delicious sweet
darkblue berries covered with hoary bloom in midsummer the
abundant resinous leaves on its slender gray branches are pale
and hoary beneath the caterpillars of several species of sulphur
butterflies colias feed on huckleberry leaves
to a genus quite distinct from the huckleberries belong the true
blueberries however interchangeably these names are misused
perhaps the first species to send its fruit to market in june and
july is the dwarf sugar or lowbush blueberry vaccinium
pennsylvanicum sometimes six inches tall never more than
twenty inches it prefers sandy or rocky soil from southern new
jersey far northward and west to illinois shortly after the
small bellshaped white or pink flowers that grow in racemes
on the ends or sides of the angular green warty branches of
nearly all blueberry bushes have been fertilized by bees this
species forms an especially sweet berry with a bloom on its blue
surface the alternate oblong leaves smooth and green on both
sides are very finely and sharply sawedged
another and perhaps the commonest as it is the finest species
whose immature fruit is still green or red when the dwarfs is
ripe is the highbush tall or swamp blueberry v corymbosum
found in low wet ground from virginia westward to the
mississippi and very far north only the bees and their kind
concern themselves with the little cylindric fiveparted
nectarbearing flowers these appear with the oblong entire

white color a faint odor and liberal entertainment may be seen
about the clusters many visitors are useless pilferers no
doubt but certainly the bees which depart with pollen masses
cemented to their lips or tongues to leave them in the stigmatic
cavities of the next blossoms their heads enter pay a fair price
for all they get

in describing the common milkweed qv so many statements were
made that apply quite as truly to this far daintier and more
ethereal species the reader is referred back to the pink and
magenta section compared with some of its rankgrowing heavy
relatives how exquisite is this little denizen of the uplands
with its whorls of needlelike leaves set at intervals along a
slender swaying stem the entire plant with its delicate foliage
and greenishwhite umbels of flowers rather suggests a member of
the carrot tribe and much the same class of smallsized
shorttongued visitors come to seek its accessible nectar as we
find about the parsnips for example when little bees alight 
and these are the truest benefactors however frequently larger
bees wasps flies and even the almost useless butterflies come
around  their feet slip about within the low crown to find a
secure lodging as they rise to fly away after sucking the
pollen masses which have attached themselves to the hairs on the
lower part of their legs are drawn out to be transferred to
other blossoms perhaps today perhaps not for a fortnight
annoying as they may be it is very rarely indeed that an
insect can rid itself of the pollen masses carried from either
orchids or milkweeds except by the method nature intended and
it is not until the longsuffering bee is outrageously loaded
that he attains his greatest usefulness to milkweed blossoms of
ninetytwo specimens bearing corpuscula of asclepias
verticillata says professor robertson eightyeight have them
on hairs alone and four on the hairs and claws and again as
far as the mere application of pollen to an insect is concerned
a flower with loose pollen has the advantage but the advantage
is on the side of asclepias after the insect is loaded with it
it is only a general rule that insects keep to flowers of a
particular species on their honey and pollen gathering
expeditions if a bee dusted with loose pollen visits flowers of
another species it will not long retain pollen in sufficient
quantity to effectually fertilize flowers of the original
species on the other hand if an insect returns at any time
during the day or even after a few days to the species of
asclepias from which it got a load of pollinia it may bring with
it all or most of the pollinia which it has carried from the
first plants visited the firmness with which the pollinia keep
their hold on the insect is one of the best adaptations for
crossfertilization
ants the worst pilferers of nectar extant find the hairy stem
of the whorled milkweed as well as its sticky juice most
discouraging if not fatal obstacles to climbing how daintily
the goldfinch picks at the milkweed pods and sets adrift the
seeds attached to silky aeronautic fluff

no one need be told that this flaring trumpetshaped flower is
next of kin to the morningglory that clambers over the trellises
of countless kitchen porches and escapes back to natures garden
whenever it can when the ancestors of these blossoms welded
their five petals into a solid deep bell which still shows on
its edges the trace of five once separate parts they did much to
protect their precious contents from rain but some additional
protection was surely needed against the little interlopers not
adapted to fertilize the flower which could so easily crawl down
its tube doubtless the hairs on the base of the filaments
between which certain bumblebees and other longtongued
benefactors can easily penetrate to suck the nectar secreted in a
fleshy disk below act as a stockade to little wouldbe
pilferers the color in the throat serves as a pathfinder to the
deephidden sweets how pleasant the way is made for such insects
as a flower must needs encourage for these the perennial wild
potato vine keeps open house far later in the day than its annual
relatives professor robertson says it is dependent mainly upon
two bees entechnia taurea and xenoglossa ipomoeae the latter
its namesake
one has to dig deep to find the huge fleshy potatolike root
from which the vine derived its name of manoftheearth such a
storehouse of juices is surely necessary in the dry soil where
the wild potato lives
happily the common morningglory i purpurea   the
convolvulus major of seedsmens catalogues  has so commonly
escaped from cultivation in the eastern half of the united states
and canada as now to deserve counting among our wild flowers
albeit south america is its true home surely no description of
this commonest of all garden climbers is needed everyone has an
opportunity to watch how the bees crossfertilize it
the vine has a special interest because of darwins illuminating
experiments upon it when he planted six selffertilized seeds and
six seeds fertilized with the pollen brought from flowers on a
different vine on opposite sides of the same pot vines produced
by the former reached an average height of five feet four inches
whereas the crosspollenized seed sent its stems up two feet
higher and produced very many more flowers if so marked a
benefit from imported pollen may be observed in a single
generation is it any wonder that ambitious plants employ every
sort of ingenious device to compel insects to bring them pollen
from distant flowers of the same species how punctually the
moonflower i grandiflora next of kin to the morningglory
opens its immense pure white sweetscented flowers at night to
attract nightflying moths because their long tongues which
only can drain the nectar may not be withdrawn until they are
dusted with vitalizing powder for export to some waiting sister

like tangled yellow yarn wound spirally about the herbage and

bunched try to loosen its hold on the support it is climbing up
and the secret of its guilt is out at once for no honest vine is
this but a parasite a degenerate of the lowest type with
numerous sharp suckers haustoria penetrating the bark of its
victim and spreading in the softer tissues beneath to steal all
their nourishment so firmly are these suckers attached that the
golden threadlike stem will break before they can be torn from
their hold
not a leaf now remains on the vine to tell of virtue in its
remote ancestors the absence of green matter chlorophyll

pipe not even a root is left after the seedling is old enough
to twine about its hardworking respectable neighbors starting

tender young twiner develops an appetite for strong drink and
murder combined such as would terrify any budding criminal in
five points or seven dials no sooner has it laid hold of its
victim and tapped it than the now useless root and lower portion
wither away leaving the dodder in midair without any
connection with the soil below but abundantly nourished with
juices already stored up and even assimilated at its hosts

so very many flowers especially adapted to the bumblebee are in
bloom when the cymes of the waterleaf uncoil like the borages
from their immature roll that some special inducement to attract
this benefactor were surely needed in high altitudes the
clusters became deeper hued but much as the more specialized
bees love color food appeals to them far more accordingly the
five lobes of each little flower stand erect to increase the
difficulty a shorttongued insect would have to drain its
precious stores the stamens are provided with hairs for the same
reason and even the calyx is bristly to discourage crawling
ants the worst pilferers out by these precautions against
theft plenty of nectar remains for the large bees to prevent
selffertilization pollen is shed on visitors which remove it
from a newly opened flower before the stigmas become receptive to
any but in any case these are elevated in maturity above the

when we consider that there are over five million gypsies
wandering about the globe and that the narcotic seeds of the
thorn apple which apparently heal as well as poison have been
a favorite medicine of theirs for ages we can understand at
least one means of the weed reaching these shores from tropical
asia hindoo dhatura our indians who call it white mans
plant associate it with the jamestown settlement  a plausible
connection for raleighs colonists would have been likely to
carry with them to the new world the seeds of an herb yielding an
alkaloid more esteemed in the england of their day than the
alkaloid of opium known as morphine daturina the narcotic and
another product known in medicine as stramonium smoked by
asthmatics are by no means despised by uptodate practitioners
were it not for the rank odor of its leaves the vigorous weed
coarse as it is would be welcome in mens gardens indeed many
of its similar relatives adorn them the fragrant petunia and
tobacco plants of the flower beds the potato tomato and
eggplant in the kitchen garden call it cousin
late in the afternoon the plaited corolla of this long
trumpetshaped flower expands to welcome the sphinx moths so
deep a tube implies their tongues not that these are the
benefactors to which the blossom originally adapted itself  they

make excellent substitutes for there is no abatement of the
weeds vigor here as there surely would be did it habitually
fertilize itself any time after four oclock in the afternoon
according to the light the sphinx moth a creature of the
gloaming begins its rounds to be mistaken for a hummingbird
seven times out of ten hovering about its chosen white or yellow
flowers that open for it at the approach of twilight it remains
poised above one a second as if motionless  although the faint
hum of its wings while sucking indicates that no magic suspends
it  then darts swift as thought to another deep tube to feast
again of course transferring pollen as it goes but what if the
jamestown weed miscalculate the hour of her lovers call and open
too soon mischievous bees quick to seize so golden an
opportunity squeeze into the flower when it begins to unfold

breath of the whitespiked clethra comes at the same season and
one cannot but wonder why these two bushes which are so
beautiful when most garden shrubbery is out of flower should be
left to waste their sweetness if not on desert air exactly on

examine a welldeveloped ball of bloom on the buttonbush under a
magnifying glass to appreciate its perfection of detail after
counting two hundred and fifty minute florets tightly clustered
ones tired eyes give out a honeyball with a well of nectar in
each of these narrow tubes invites hosts of insects to its
hospitable feast but only visitors long and slender of tongue
can drain the last drop therefore the vicinity of this bush is
an excellent place for a butterfly collector to carry his net
butterflies are by far the most abundant visitors honeybees
also abound bumblebees carpenter and mining bees wasps a
horde of flies and some destructive beetles but the short
tongues can reach little nectar why do the pistils of the
florets protrude so far even before each minute bud opened all
its pollen had been shed on the tip of the style to be in a
position to be removed by the first visitor alighting on the ball
of bloom after the removal of the pollen from the still immature
stigma it becomes sticky to receive the importation from other
blossoms did not the floret pass through two distinct stages

luxuriance of growth growing near our homes the partridge vine
offers an excellent opportunity for study
the two flowers at the tip of a branch may grow distinct down to
their united ovaries or their tubes may be partly united like
siamese twins  a union which in either case accounts for the odd
shape of the socalled berry that shows further traces of
consolidation in its two eyes the remnants of eight calyx
teeth experiment proves that when only one of the twin flowers
is pollenized by insects excluded from the other one by a net
fruit is rarely set but when both are a healthy seeded berry
follows to secure crossfertilization the partridge flower
like the bluets qv occurs in two different forms on distinct
plants seed from either producing after its kind in one form
the style is low within the tube and the stamens protrude in
the other form the stamens are concealed and the style with its
four spreading stigmas is exserted no single flower matures

cannot reach the nectar reserved for the blossoms benefactors
because of the hairs inside the tube which nearly close it but
larger bees and butterflies coming to suck a flower with tall
stamens receive pollen on the precise spot on their long tongues

like the wild carrot among all the umbelbearers and the daisy
among the horde of composites the elder flower has massed its
minute florets together knowing that there was no hope of
attracting insect friends except in such union where clumps of
elder grow  and society it ever prefers to solitude  few
shrubs looked at from above which of course is the winged
insects point of view offer a better advertisement there are
people who object to the honeylike odor of the flowers
doubtless this is what most attracts the flies and beetles while
the lesser bees that frequent them also are more strongly
appealed to through the eye no nectar rewards visitors
consequently butterflies rarely stop on the flat clusters but
there is an abundant lunch of pollen for such as like it each
minute floret has its five anthers so widely spread away from the
stigmas that selfpollination is impossible but with the help of
small winged pollen carriers plenty of crossfertilized fruit
forms with the help of migrating birds the minute nutlets
within the berries are distributed far and wide

decorative feature of the woods in may when the shrubbery in
natures garden as in mens is in its glory for what reason
are there two sizes and kinds of flowers in each cluster around
the outer margin are large showy shams they lack the essential
organs the stamens and pistil therefore what use are they
undoubtedly they are mere advertisements to catch the eye of
passing insects  no small service however it is the
inconspicuous little flowers grouped within their circle that
attend to the serious business of life the shrub found it good
economy to increase the size of the outer row of flowers even at
the expense of their reproductive organs simply to add to the
conspicuousness of the clusters when so many blossoms enter into
fierce competition with them for insect trade many beetles
attracted by the white color come to feed on pollen and often
destroy the anthers in their greed but the lesser bees andrena
chiefly and more flies whose short tongues easily obtain the
accessible nectar render constant service these welcome guests
we have to thank for the clusters of coralred berries that make
the shrub even more beautiful in september than in may
because it sometimes sends its straggling branches downward in
loops that touch the ground and trip up the unwary pedestrian

the flattopped flower clusters abundantly in may shorttongued
visitors quickly lick up the abundant nectar secreted at the base
of each little style crossfertilizing their entertainers as
they journey across the cyme so widely do the anthers diverge

turn a dark blue with a bloom like the huckleberrys the
opposite oval to oblong rather thick smooth leaves and the
somewhat scurfy twigs help the novice to name this common shrub

bundles but whose leaves cannot be recommended as a substitute

overrun the earth
like the daisy each small flower in a cluster as symmetrically
arranged as brain coral is made up of a large number of minute
but perfect florets suited to attract insects by making a better
show than each could do alone and by offering them accessible
feeding places close together where they may feast with minimum
loss of time simultaneous crossfertilization of many florets
must be effected by every visitor crawling over a cluster the
florets in each disk open in regular array toward the centers at
the expense of stamens which are absent in the grayishwhite ray

conquest of our territory a naturalized immigrant from europe
and asia how could it so quickly take possession in the
overcultivated old world no weed can have half the chance for
unrestricted colonizing that it has in our vast unoccupied area
most of our weeds are naturalized foreigners not natives once
released from the harder conditions of struggle at home the
seeds being safely smuggled in among the ballast of freight
ships or hay used in packing they find life here easy
pleasant as if to make up for lost time they increase a
thousandfold if we look closely at a daisy  and a lens is
necessary for any but the most superficial acquaintance  we
shall see that far from being a single flower it is literally a
host in itself each of the socalled white petals is a female
floret whose open corolla has grown large white and showy to
aid its sisters in advertising for insect visitors  a prominence
gained only by the loss of its stamens the yellow center is
composed of hundreds of minute tubular florets huddled together
in a green cup as closely as they can be packed inside each of
these tiny yellow tubes stand the stamens literally putting
their heads together as the pistil within the ring of stamens
develops and rises through their midst two little hair brushes
on its tip sweep the pollen from their anthers as a rounded brush
would remove the soot from a lamp chimney now the pollen is
elevated to a point where any insect crawling over the floret
must remove it the pollen gone the pistil now spreads its two
arms that were kept tightly closed together while any danger of
selffertilization lasted their surfaces become sticky that
pollen brought from another flower may adhere to them notice
that the pistils in the white ray florets have no hairbrushes on
their tips because no stamens being there there is no pollen
to be swept out because daisies are among the most conspicuous
of flowers and have facilitated dining for their visitors by
offering them countless cups of refreshment that may be drained
with a minimum loss of time almost every insect on wings alights
on them sooner or later in short they run their business on the
principle of a cooperative department store immense quantities
of the most vigorous because crossfertilized seed being set in
every patch small wonder that our fields are white with daisies
 a long and a merry life to them
since all flowers must once have passed through a white stage
before attaining gay colors so evolution teaches it is not
surprising that occasional reversions to the white type should be
found even among the brightesthued species again some white
flowers which are in a transition state show aspirations after
color often so marked in individuals as to mislead one into
believing them products of a far advanced colored type also
pale colors blanch under a summer sun these facts must be borne
in mind and the blue pink and yellow blossoms should be
investigated before the reader despairs of identifying a flower
not found in the white group
yellow and orange flowers
all variations which render the blossoms more attractive either
by scent color size of corolla or quantity of nectar make the
insect visit more sure and therefore the production of seed more
likely thus the conspicuous blossoms secure descendants which
inherit the special variations of their parents and so
generation after generation we have selections in favor of
conspicuous flowers where insects are at work their
appreciation of color because it has brought the blossom
possessing it more immediately into their view and more surely
under their attention has enabled them through the ages to be
preparing the specimens upon which man now operates he taking up
the work where they have left it selecting inoculating and
hybridizing according to his own rules of taste and developing
a beauty which insects alone could never have evolved his are
the finishing touches his the apparent effects yet no less is
it true that the results of his floriculture would never have
been attainable without insect helpers it is equally certain
that the beautiful perfume and the nectar also are in their
present development the outcome of repeated insect selection
and here it seems to me we get an inkling of a deep mystery
why is life in all its forms so dependent upon the fusion of
two individual elements is it not that thus the door of
progress has been opened if each alone had reproduced itself
allinall advance would have been impossible the insect and
human florists and pomologists like the improvers of animal
races would have had no platform for their operation and not
only the forms of life but life itself would have been
stereotyped unalterably ever mechanically giving repetition to

not our gorgeous lilies that brighten the lowlying meadows in
early summer with pendent swaying bells possibly not a true
lily at all was chosen to illustrate the truth which those who
listened to the sermon on the mount and we equally anxious
foolishly overburdened folk of today so little comprehend
     consider the lilies of the field how they grow
        they toil not neither do they spin
      and yet i say unto you
      that even solomon in all his glory
        was not arrayed like one of these
opinions differ as to the lily of scripture eastern peoples use
the same word interchangeably for the tulip anemone ranunculus
iris the waterlilies and those of the field the superb
scarlet martagon lily l chalcedonicum grown in gardens here
is not uncommon wild in palestine but whoever has seen the large
anemones there carpeting every plain and luxuriantly pervading
the land is inclined to believe that jesus who always chose the
most familiar objects in the daily life of his simple listeners
to illustrate his teachings rested his eyes on the slopes about
him glowing with anemones in all their matchless loveliness what
flower served him then matters not at all it is enough that
scientists  now more plainly than ever before  see the
universal application of the illustration the more deeply they
study nature and can include their little brothers of the air
and the humblest flower at their feet when they say with paul

tallest and most prolific of bloom among our native lilies as it
is the most variable in color size and form the turks cap or
turban lily l superburn sometimes nearly merges its identity
into its canadian sisters travelers by rail between new york
and boston know how gorgeous are the low meadows and marshes in
july or august when its clusters of deep yellow orange or
flamecolored lilies tower above the surrounding vegetation like
the color of most flowers theirs intensifies in salt air
commonly from three to seven lilies appear in a terminal group
but under skilful cultivation even forty will crown the stalk
that reaches a height of nine feet where its home suits it
perfectly or maybe only a poor array of dingy yellowish caps top
a shriveled stem when unfavorable conditions prevail there
certainly are times when its specific name seems extravagant
its range is from maine to the carolinas westward to minnesota
and tennessee a wellconducted turks cap is not bellshaped at
maturity like the canada lily it should open much farther
until the six points of its perianth curve so far backward beyond
the middle as to expose the stamens for nearly their entire
length one of the purpledotted divisions of the flower when
spread out flat may measure anywhere from two and a half to four
inches in length smooth lanceshaped leaves tapering at both
ends occur in whorls of threes to eights up the stem or the
upper ones may be alternate abundant food hidden in a round
whiteshingled storehouse under ground nourishes the plant and
similarly its bulbbearing kin when emergency may require  a
thrifty arrangement that serves them in good stead during
prolonged drought and severe winters
why one may ask are some lilies radiantly colored and speckled
others like the easter lily deep chaliced white spotless
now in all our lily kin nectar is secreted in a groove at the
base of each of the six divisions of the flower and upon its
removal by that insect best adapted to come in contact with
anthers and stigma as it flies from lily to lily depends all hope
of perpetuating the lovely race for countless ages it has been
the flowers business to find what best pleased the visitors on
whom so much depended some lilies decided to woo one class of
insects some another those which literally set their caps for
colorloving bees and butterflies whose long tongues could easily
drain nectar deeply hidden from the mob for their special
benefit assumed gay hues speckling the inner side of their
spreading divisions even providing lines as pathfinders to their
nectaries in some cases lest a visitor try to thrust in his
tongue between the petallike parts while standing on the
outside and so defeat their welllaid plan it is almost
pathetic to see how bright and spotted they are inside that the
visitor may not go astray thus we find the chief pollenizers of
the canada and the turks cap lilies to be specialized bees the
interesting upholsterers or 1eafcutters conspicuous among the
throng nectar they want of course but the dark rich pollen is
needed also to mix with it for the food supply of a generation
still unborn anyone who has smelled a lily knows how his nose
looks afterward the bees have no difficulty whatever in removing
lily pollen and transferring it so much for the colored lilies
the long white trumpetshape type of lily chooses for her lover
the sphinx moth for him she wears a spotless white robe 
speckles would be superfluous  that he may see it shine in the
dusk when colored flowers melt into the prevailing blackness
for him she breathes forth a fragrance almost overwhelming at
evening to guide him to her neighborhood from afar in
consideration of his very long slender tongue she hides her
sweets so deep that none may rob him of it taking the additional
precaution to weld her six once separate parts together into a
solid tube lest any pilferer thrust in his tongue from the side

colonies of these dainty little lilies that so often grow beside
leaping brooks where and when the trout hide justify at least
one of their names but they have nothing in common with the
violet or a dogs tooth their faint fragrance rather suggests a
tulip and as for the bulb which in some of the lilykin has
toothlike scales it is in this case a smooth eggshaped corm
producing little round offsets from its base much fault is also
found with another name on the plea that the curiously mottled
and delicately pencilled leaves bring to mind not a snakes
tongue but its skin as they surely do whoever sees the sharp
purplish point of a young plant darting above ground in earliest
spring however at once sees the fitting application of adders
tongue but how few recognize their plant friends at all seasons
of the year
every one must have noticed the abundance of lowgrowing spring
flowers in deciduous woodlands where later in the year after
the leaves overhead cast a heavy shade so few blossoms are to be
found because their light is seriously diminished the thrifty
adders tongue by laying up nourishment in its storeroom
underground through the winter is ready to send its leaves and
flower upward to take advantage of the sunlight the still naked
trees do not intercept just as soon as the ground thaws but the
spring beauty the rueanemone bloodroot toothwort and the
first blue violet palmata among other early spring flowers
have not been slow to take advantage of the light either fierce
competition therefore rages among them to secure visits from
the comparatively few insects then flying  a competition so
severe that the adders tongue often has to wait until afternoon
for the spring beauty to close before receiving a single caller
hivebees and others only about half their size of the andrena
and halictus clans the first to fly the bombylius frauds and
common yellow butterflies come in numbers then guided by the
speckles to the nectaries at the base of the flower they must
either cling to the stamens and style while they suck or fall
out thus crossfertilization is commonly effected but in the
absence of insects the lily can fertilize itself crawling
pilferers rarely think it worthwhile to slip and slide up the
smooth footstalk and risk a tumble where it curves to allow the
flower to nod  the reason why this habit of growth is so
popular the adders tongue which is extremely sensitive to the
sunlight will turn on its stalk to follow it and expand in its
warmth at night it nearly closes
a similar adders tongue bearing a white flower purplish tinged
on the outside yellow at the base within to guide insects to the
nectaries is the white adders tongue e albidum rare in the

it would be safe to say says john burroughs that there is a
species of smilax with an unsavory name that the bee does not
visit herbacea the production of this plant is a curious freak
of nature it would be a cruel joke to offer it to any person
not acquainted with it to smell it is like the vent of a
charnelhouse thoreau compared its odor to that of a dead rat
in a wall it is first cousin to the trilliums among the
prettiest of our native wild flowers continues burroughs and
the same bad blood crops out in the purple trillium or
birthroot
strange that so close an observer as burroughs or thoreau should
not have credited the carrionflower with being something more
intelligent than a mere repellent freak like the purple trillium
qv it has deliberately adapted itself to please its
benefactors the little green flesh flies so commonly seen about
untidy butcher shops in summer these sharing with many beetles
the unthankful task of removing putrid flesh and fowl from the
earth acting the part of scavengers for nature are naturally
attracted to carrionscented flowers of these they have an
ungrudged monopoly but the purple trillium has an additional
advantage in both smelling and looking like the same thing  a
piece of raw meat past its prime bees and butterflies with
their highly developed aesthetic sense ever delighting in
beautiful colors perfume and nectar naturally let such flowers
as these alone  another object aimed at by them for then the
flies get all the pollen they can eat some they transfer of
course from the larger staminate flowers to the smaller
pistillate ones as they crawl over one umbel of the
carrionflower then alight on another

swinging outward from a leafclasped stem this orchid attracts
us by its flaunted beauty and decorative form from tip to root
not less than the aesthetic little bees for which its adornment
and mechanism are so marvelously adapted doubtless the heavy
oily odor is an additional attraction to them parallel purplish
lines converging toward the circular opening of the pale yellow
inflated pouch guide the visitor into a spacious banquethall
labellum such as the pink ladys slipper qv also entertains
her guests in fine hairs within secrete tiny drops of fluid at
their tips  a secretion which hardens into a brittle crust like
a syrups when it dries darwin became especially interested in
this flower through a delightful correspondence with professor
asa gray who was the first to understand it and he finally
secured a specimen to experiment on
i first introduced some flies into the labellum through the
large upper opening darwin wrote but they were either too
large or too stupid and did not crawl out properly i then
caught and placed within the labellum a very small bee which
seemed of about the right size namely andrena parvula the
bee vainly endeavored to crawl out again the same way it entered
but always fell backwards owing to the margins being inflected
the labellum thus acts like one of those conical traps with the
edges turned inwards which are sold to catch beetles and
cockroaches in london kitchens it could not creep out through
the slit between the folded edges of the basal part of the
labellum as the elongated triangular rudimentary stamen here
closes the passage ultimately it forced its way out through one
of the small orifices close to one of the anthers and was found
when caught to be smeared with the glutinous pollen i then put
the same bee into another labellum and again it crawled out
through one of the small orifices always covered with pollen i
repeated the operation five times always with the same result i
afterwards cut away the labellum so as to examine the stigma
and found its whole surface covered with pollen it should be
noticed that an insect in making its escape must first brush
past the stigma and afterwards one of the anthers so that it
cannot leave pollen on the stigma until being already smeared
with pollen from one flower it enters another and thus there
will be a good chance of crossfertilization between two distinct
plants thus the use of all parts of the flower  namely the
inflected edges or the polished inner sides of the labellum the
two orifices and their position close to the anthers and stigma
 the large size of the medial rudimentary stamen  are rendered
intelligible an insect which enters the labellum is thus
compelled to crawl out by one of the two narrow passages on the
sides of which the pollenmasses and stigma are placed
these common orchids which are not at all difficult to
naturalize in a welldrained shady spot in the garden should be
lifted with a good ball of earth and plenty of leafmould

where this brilliant beautiful orchid and its lovely white
sister grow together in the bog  which cannot be through a very
wide range since one is common northward where the other is
rare and vice versa  the yellow fringed orchis will be found
blooming a few days later in general structure the plants
closely resemble each other their similar method of enforcing
payment for a sip of nectar concealed in a tube so narrow and
deep none but a sphinx moth or butterfly may drain it all though
large bumblebees occasionally get some too from brimming
nectaries has been described qv to which the interested
reader is referred both these orchids have their sticky discs
projecting unusually far as if raised on a pedicel  an
arrangement which indicates that they are to be stuck to the
face or head of some nectarsucking insect of appropriate size
that visits the flowers wrote dr asa gray over forty years
ago various species of hawk moths common in different parts of
our area of course have tongues of various lengths and
naturally every visitor does not receive his load of pollen on
the same identical spot at dusk when sphinx moths begin their
rounds it will be noticed that the white and yellow flowers
remain conspicuous long after blossoms of other colors have
melted into the general darkness such flowers as cater to these
moths if they have fragrance emit it then most strongly as an
additional attraction again it will be noticed that few such
flowers provide a strong projecting petalplatform for visitors
to alight on that would be superfluous since sphinx moths suck
while hovering over a tube with their wings in exceedingly rapid
motion just like a hummingbird for which the larger species are
so often mistaken at twilight this deephued orchid apparently
attracts as many butterflies as sphinx moths which show a
predilection for the white species
from ontario and the mississippi eastward and southward to the
gulf the tubercled or small pale green orchis h flava lifts a
spire of inconspicuous greenishyellow flowers more attractive
to the eye of the structural botanist than to the aesthete it
blooms in moist places as most orchids do since water with
which to manufacture nectar enough to fill their deep spurs is a
prime necessity orchids have arrived at that pinnacle of
achievement that it is impossible for them to fertilize
themselves more than that some are absolutely sterile to their
own pollen when it is applied to their stigmas artificially with
insect aid however a single plant has produced over 1000700
seeds no wonder then that as a family they have adopted the
most marvelous blandishments and mechanism in the whole floral
kingdom to secure the visits of that special insect to which each
is adapted and having secured him to compel him unwittingly to
do their bidding in the steaming tropical jungles where
vegetation is luxuriant to the point of suffocation and where
insect life swarms in mvriads undreamed of here we can see the
best of reasons for orchids mounting into trees and living on air
to escape strangulation on the ground and for donning larger and
more gorgeous apparel to attract attention in the fierce
competition for insect trade waged about them here where the
struggle for survival is incomparably easier we have terrestrial
orchids small and quietly clad for the most part
having the gorgeous exotic air plants of the hothouse in mind
this little tubercled orchis seems a very poor relation indeed
in june and july about a week before the ragged orchis comes
out we may look for this small fringeless sister its clasping
leaves which decrease in size as they ascend the stem not to
shut off the light and rain from the lower ones are
parallelveined elliptic or the higher ones lanceshaped a
prominent tubercle or palate growing upward from the lip
almost conceals the entrance to the nectary and makes a side
approach necessary why usually an insect has free straight
access down the center of a flowers throat but here he cannot
have it a slender tongue must be directed obliquely from above
into the spur and it will enter the discal groove as a thread
enters the eye of a needle by this arrangement the tongue must
certainly come in contact with one of the sticky discs to which
an elongated pollen gland is attached the cement on the disc
hardening even while the visitor sucks the pollen gland is
therefore drawn out because firmly attached to his tongue at
first the pollen mass stands erect on the proboscis but in the
fraction of a moment which it takes a butterfly to flit to
another blossom it has bent forward automatically into the exact
position required for it to come in contact with the sticky
stigma of the next tubercled orchis entered where it will be
broken off now we understand the use of the palate butterfly
collectors often take specimens with remnants of these pollen
stumps stuck to their tongues in his classical work on the
fertilization of orchids by insects darwin tells of finding a
mottled rustic butterfly whose proboscis was decorated with
eleven pairs of pollen masses taken from as many blossoms of the
pyramidal orchis have these flowers no mercy on their
longsuffering friends a bee with some orchid pollenstumps
attached to its head was once sent to mr frank cheshire the
english expert who had just discovered some strange bee diseases
he was requested to name the malady that had caused so abnormal
an outgrowth on the bees forehead
often found growing in the same bog with the tubercled species is
the ragged or fringed green orchis h lacera so inconspicuous
we often overlook it unawares examine one of the dingy
greenishyellow flowers that are set along the stern in a spike
to make all the show in the world possible each with its
threeparted spreading lip finely and irregularly cut into
threadlike fringe to hail the passing butterfly and we shall
see that it too has made ingenious provision against the
draining of its spur by a visitor without proper pay for his
entertainment even without the gay color that butterflies ever
delight in these flowers contain so much nectar in their spurs

by assuming the functions of petals the colored sepals advertise
for insects beetles which answer the first summons to a free
lunch crowd in as the sepals begin to spread in the center the
starlike disc already sticky is revealed and on it any pollen
they have carried with them from older flowers necessarily rubs
off at first or while the stigma is freshly receptive to
pollen an insect cannot make his entrance except by crawling
over this large sticky plate at this time the anthers being
closed selffertilization is impossible a day or two later
after the pollen begins to ripen on countless anthers the flower
is so widely open that visitors have no cause to alight in the
center anyway no harm could result if they did
crossfertilization having been presumably accomplished while
beetles especially donacia are ever abundant visitors it is
likely they do much more harm than good so eagerly do they gnaw
both petals and stamens which look like loops of narrow yellow
ribbon within the bowl of an older flower that although they
must carry some pollen to younger flowers as they travel on it
is probable they destroy ten times more than their share flies
transport pollen too the smaller bees halictus and andrena
chiefly find some nectar secreted on the outer faces of the

not a true marigold and even less a cowslip it is by these

but the glitter of the buttercup which is as nothing to the
glitter of a gold dollar in the eyes of a practical farmer fills
him with wrath when this immigrant takes possession of his
pastures cattle will not eat the acrid caustic plant  a
sufficient reason for most members of the ranunculaceae to stoop
to the low trick of secreting poisonous or bitter juices
selfpreservation leads a cousin the garden monks hood even to
murderous practices since children will put everything within
reach into their mouths they should be warned against biting the
buttercups stem and leaves that are capable of raising
blisters beggars use the juice to produce sores upon their
skin says mrs creevy a designer might employ these
exquisitely formed leaves far more profitably
this and the bulbous buttercup having so much else in common
have also the same visitors it is a remarkable fact says sir
john lubbock as aristotle long ago mentioned that in most
cases bees confine themselves in each journey to a single species
of plant though in the case of some very nearly allied forms
this is not so for instance it is stated on good authority
muller that ranunculus acris r repens and r bulbosus are
not distinguished by the bees or at least are visited
indifferently by them as is also the case with two of the
species of clover from what we already know of the brilliant
syrphidae flies fondness for equally brilliant colors it is not
surprising to find great numbers of them about the buttercups
with bees wasps and beetles  upwards of sixty species modern
scientists believe that the habit of feeding on flowers has
called out the colorsense of insects and the taste for bright
colors and that sexual selection has been guided by this taste
the most unscientific among us soon finds evidence on every hand
that flowers and insects have developed together through mutual
dependence
by having its nourishment thriftily stored up underground all
winter the bulbous buttercup r bulbosus is able to steal a
march on its fibrousrooted sister that must accumulate hers all
spring consequently it is first to flower coming in early may
and lasting through june it is a low and generally more hairy
plant but closely resembling the tall buttercup in most
respects and like it a naturalized european immigrant now
thoroughly at home in fields and roadsides in most sections of
the united states and canada
much less common is the creeping buttercup r repens which
spreads by runners until it forms large patches in fields and
roadsides chiefly in the eastern states its leaves which are
sometimes blotched are divided into three parts the terminal
one often all three stalked mayjuly
first to bloom in the vicinity of new york from march to may is
the hispid buttercup r hispidus densely hairy when young the
leaves which are pinnately divided into from three to five
leaflets cleft or lobed chiefly arise on long petioles from a
cluster of thickened fibrous roots the flower may be only half
an inch or an inch and a half across it is found in dry woods
and thickets throughout the eastern half of the united states

commonest of the early buttercups is the tufted buttercup r
fascicularis a little plant seldom a foot high found in the
woods and on rocky hillsides from texas and manitoba east to the
atlantic flowering in april or may the longstalked leaves are
divided into from three to five parts the bright yellow flowers
with rather narrow distant petals measure about an inch across
they open sparingly usually only one or two at a time on each
plant to favor pollination from another one
scattered patches of the swamp or marsh buttercup p
septentrionalis brighten low rich meadows also with theirlarge
satiny yellow flowers whose place in the botany even the
untrained eye knows at sight the smooth spreading plant
sometimes takes root at the joints of its branches and sends
forth runners but the stems mostly ascend the large lower
mottled leaves are raised well out of the wet or above the
grass on long petioles they have three divisions each lobed
and cleft from georgia and kentucky far northward this buttercup
blooms from april to july opening only a few flowers at a timea
method which may make it less showy but more certain to secure
crosspollination between distinct plants
the yellow water buttercup or crowfoot r deiphinifolius r
multifidus of gray found blooming in ponds through the summer
months certainly justifies the family name derived from rana  a
frog many other members grow in marshes it is true but this
ranunculus lives after the manner of its namesake sometimes
immersed sometimes stranded on the muddy shore two types of
leaves occur on the same stem their waving filaments which make
the immersed leaves look fringy take every advantage of what
little carbonic acid gas is dissolved under the surface
moreover they are better adapted to withstand the waters
pressure and possible currents than solid blades would be the
floating leaves which loll upon the surface to take advantage of
the air and sunlight expand three four or five divisions
variously lobed on this plant we see one set of leaves perfectly
adapted to immersion and another set to aerial existence the
stem which may measure several feet in length roots at the
joints when it can range from the mississippi and ontario
eastward to the atlantic ocean
the white watercrowfoot batrachium trichophyllum ranunculus
aquatilis of gray has its fine threadlike leaves entirely
submerged but the flowers like a whale as the old conundrum
put it come to the surface to blow the latter are small white
or only yellow at the base where each petal bears a spot or
little pit that serves as a pathfinder to the flies when the
water rises unusually high the blossoms never open but remain
submerged and fertilize themselves seen underwater the
delicate leaves which are little more than forked hairs spread
abroad in dainty patterns lifted cut of the water these flaccid
filaments utterly collapse in ponds and shallow slow streams

when the twigs of barberry bushes arch with the weight of
clusters of beautiful bright berries in september everyone must
take notice of a shrub so decorative which receives scant
attention from us however when its insignificant little flowers
are out yet these blossoms small as they are are up to a
marvelous trick quite as remarkable as the laurels qv or
the calopogons qv to compel insects to do their bidding
three of the six sepals by their size and color attend to the
advertising playing the part of a corolla and partly by curving
inward at the tip partly by the drooping posture of the flower
help protect the stamens pistil and nectar glands within from
rain did the flowers hang vertically not obliquely such
curvature of the tips of sepals and petals would be unnecessary
six stamens surround a pistil but each of their six anthers
which are in reality little pollen boxes opening by trapdoors on
either side is tucked under the curving tip of a petal at whose
base lie two orangecolored nectar glands a small bee or fly
enters the flower what happens to reach the nectar he must
probe between the bases of two exceedingly irritable stamens the
merest touch of a visitors tongue against them releases two
anthers just as the nibbling mouse all unsuspectingly releases
the wire from the hook of the wooden trap he is caught in as the
two stamens spring upward on being released pollen instantly
flies out of the trapdoors of the anther boxes on the bee which
suffers no greater penalty than being obliged to carry it to the
stigma of another flower so short are the stamens it is
improbable that a flowers pollen ever reaches its own stigma
except through the occasional confused fumbling of a visitor
usually he is so startled by the sudden shower of pollen that he
flies away instantly
in the barberry bushes as in the gorse when grown in dry
gravelly situations we see many leaves and twigs modified into
thorns to diminish the loss of water through evaporation by
exposing too much leaf surface to the sun and air that such
spines protect the plants which bear them from the ravages of
grazing cattle is of course an additional motive for their
presence under cultivation in wellwatered garden soil  and
how many charming varieties of barberries are cultivated  the
thorny shrub loses much of its armor putting forth many more
leaves in rosettes along more numerous twigs instead even the
pricklypear cactus might become mild as a lamb were it to
forswear sandy deserts and live in marshes instead country

the bleak gray woods its only rivals among the shrubbery the
serviceberry and its twin sister the shadbush have scarcely
had the temerity to burst into bloom when the little clusters of
lemonyellow flowers cuddled close to the naked branches give
us our first delightful spring surprise all the favor they ask
of the few insects then flying is that they shall transfer the
pollen from the sterile to the fertile flowers as a recompense
for the early feast spread inasmuch as no single blossom
contains both stamens and pistil little wonder the flowers
should woo with color and fragrance the guests on whose

sharp eyes may have noticed how often the leaves on both the
spicebush and the sassafras tree are curled have you ever drawn
apart the leaf edges and been startled by the large fat green
caterpillar speckled with blue whose two great black eyes
stare up at you as he reposes in his comfortable nest  a cradle
which also combines the advantages of a restaurant this is the
caterpillar of the common spicebush swallowtail butterfly
papilio troilus an exquisite dark velvety creature with pale
greenishblue markings on its hind wings see dr hollands
butterfly book plate xli the yellow stage of this
caterpillar which william hamilton gibson calls the spicebush
bugaboo indicates he says that its period of transformation
is close at hand selecting a suitable situation it spins a tiny
tuft of silk into which it entangles its hindmost pair of feet
after which it forms a vshaped loop about the front portion of
its body and hangs thus suspended soon changing to a chrysalis
of a pale wood color these chrysalides commonly survive the
winter and in the following june the beautiful blue
swallowtail will emerge and may be seen suggestively
fluttering and poising about the spice and sassafras bushes

whatever it touches a drop of this acrid fluid on the tip of the

blue and violet these vary according to the amount of acid or
alkali in the sap try the effect of immersing a blue morning
glory in an acid solution or a deep pink one in an alkaline
solution one theory to account for the presence of color is that
it exists to screen the plants protoplasm from light that it
has a physiological function with which insects have nothing

raised and the plant is protected from cold every one who has

the kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed
which a man took and sowed in his field which indeed is less than
all seeds but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and
becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in
the branches thereof
commentators differ as to which is the mustard of the parable 
this common black mustard or a rarer shrublike tree salvadora
persica with an equivalent arabic name a pungent odor and a
very small seed inasmuch as the mustard which is systematically
planted for fodder by old world farmers grows with the greatest
luxuriance in palestine and the comparison between the size of
its seed and the plants great height was already proverbial in
the east when jesus used it evidence strongly favors this
wayside weed indeed the late dr royle who endeavored to prove
that it was the shrub that was referred to finally found that it
does not grow in galilee
now there are two species which furnish the most powerfully
pungent condiment known to commerce but the tiny dark brown
seeds of the black mustard are sharper than the serpents tooth
whereas the pale brown seeds of the white mustard often mixed
with them are far more mild the latter sinapis alba is a
similar but more hairy plant with slightly larger yellow
flowers its pods are constricted like a necklace between the
seeds
the coarse hedge mustard sisymbrium officinale with rigid
spreading branches and spikes of tiny pale yellow flowers
quickly followed by awlshaped pods that are closely appressed to
the stem abounds in waste places throughout our area it blooms
from may to november like the next species
another common and most troublesome weed from europe is the field
or corn mustard charlock or field kale brassica arvensis
sinapis arvensis of gray found in grain fields gardens rich
waste lands and rubbish heaps the alternate leaves which stand
boldly out from the stem are oval coarsely sawtoothed or the
lower ones more irregular and lobed at their bases all rough to
the touch and conspicuously veined the fourparted yellow
flowers measuring half an inch or more across have six stamens
like the other members of this crossbearing family containing
nectar at their bases two of them are shorter than the other
four honeybees ever abundant the brilliant syrphidae flies
which love yellow and other small visitors after pollen and
nectar to obtain the latter insert their tongues between the
stamens and usually crossfertilize the flowers in stormy
weather when few insects fly the anthers finally turn their
pollencovered tips upward then by a curvature of the tip of
the stamens they are brought in contact with the flowers own
stigma for it is obviously better that even selffertilized seed
should be set than none at all see ladiessmock the birds
of the air may not lodge in the charlocks few and feeble
branches nevertheless they come seeking the mild seeds in the
strongly nerved smooth pods that spread in a loose raceme
domestic pigeons eat the seeds greedily
the highly intelligent honeybee which usually confines itself
to one species of plant on its flights apparently does not know
the difference between the field mustard and the wild radish or
jointed or white charlock raphanus raphanistrum or knowing
it does not care to make distinctions for it may be seen
visiting these similar flowers indiscriminately at first the
blossoms of the radish are yellow but they quickly fade to
white and their purplish veins become more conspicuous rarely
the flowers are all purplish the entire plant is rough to the
touch the leaves similar to those of the garden radish are
deeply cleft lyratepinnatifid the seed pods which soon
follow the flowers up the spike are nearly cylindric when fresh
but become constricted between the seeds as they dry until each
little pod looks like a section of a bead necklace
the garden radish of the market r sativus occasionally
escaped from cultivation although credited to china is entirely
unknown in its native state it has long been held in high
esteem wrote peter henderson and before the christian era a
volume was written on this plant alone the ancient greeks in
offering their oblations to apollo presented turnips in lead
beets in silver and radishes in vessels of beaten gold pliny
describes a radish eaten in rome as being so transparent one
might see through the root it was not until the sixteenth
century that the plant was introduced into england gerarde

addressed at least the first stanza of his familiar lines see
fringed gentian the shrub doubtless gives the small bees and
flies their last feast of the season in consideration of their
services in transferring pollen from the staminate to the fertile
flowers very slowly through the succeeding year the seeds within
the woody capsules mature until by the following autumn when
fresh flowers appear they are ready to bombard the neighborhood
after the violets method in the hope of landing in moist
yielding soil far from the parent shrub to found a new colony

forefinger pinching it so the large bony shining black
whitetipped witchhazel seeds are discharged through the elastic

nowhere more than in the naming of wild flowers can we trace the
homesickness of the early english colonists in america any plant
even remotely resembling one they had known at home was given the
dear familiar name now our witchhazel named for an english
hazel tree of elm lineage has similar leaves it is true but
likeness stops there nevertheless all the folklore clustered
about that mystic tree has been imported here with the title by
the help of the hazels diviningrod the location of hidden
springs of water precious ore treasure and thieves may be
revealed according to old superstition cornish miners who live
in a land so plentifully stored with tin and copper lodes they
can have had little difficulty in locating seams of ore with or
without a hazel rod scarcely ever sink a shaft except by its
direction
the literature of europe is filled with allusions to it swift
wrote
     they tell us something strange and odd
      about a certain magic rod
      that bending down its top divines
      whereer the soil has hidden mines
      where there are none it stands erect
      scorning to show the least respect
a good story is told on linnaeus in baringgoulds curious myths
of the middle ages when the great botanist was on one of his
voyages hearing his secretary highly extol the virtues of his
diviningwand he was willing to convince him of its
insufficiency and for that purpose concealed a purse of one
hundred ducats under a ranunculus which grew by itself in a
meadow and bid the secretary find it if he could the wand
discovered nothing and linnaeuss mark was soon trampled down by
the company present so that when he went to finish the
experiment by fetching the gold himself he was utterly at a loss
where to find it the man with the wand assisted him and
informed him that it could not lie in the way they were going
but quite the contrary so they pursued the direction of the wand
and actually dug out the gold linnaeus said that another such
experiment would be sufficient to make a proselyte of him
many a well has been dug even in this land of liberty where our
witchhazel indicated but here its kindly magic is directed
chiefly through the soothing extract distilled from its juices

how many of us ever pause to test the sensitiveness of this
exquisite foliage that borders the roadsides and in appearance
is almost identical with the south american sensitive plants so
commonly cultivated in hothouses here failing to see its fine
little leaflets fold together instantly when brushed with the
hand as they do in the tropical species mimosa pudica many
pass on concluding its title a misnomer by simply touching the
leaves however roughly only a tardy and slight movement
follows a sharp blow produces quicker effect while if the whole
plant be shaken by forcibly snapping the stem with the finger
all the leaves will be strongly affected their sensitiveness
being apparently more aroused by vibration through jarring than
by contact with foreign bodies the leaves which ordinarily
spread out flat partly close in bright sunshine and go to
sleep at night not to expose their sensitive upper surfaces to
fierce heat in the first case and to cold by radiation in the
second lifeless things may be moved or acted on says asa
gray living beings move and act  plants less conspicuously
but no less really than animals in sharing the mysterious gift
of life they share some of its simpler powers
the partridge pea or largeflowered sensitive plant c
chamaecrista likewise goes to sleep the ten to fifteen pairs of
leaflets which with a terminal one make up each pinnate leaf
slowly turning their outer edges uppermost after sunset and
overlapping as they flatten themselves against their common stem
until the entire aspect of the plant is changed by day the
expanded foliage is feathery fine acacialike at night the
bushy branching spreading plant that measures only a foot or
two high appears to produce nothing but pods these leaves
respond slowly to vibration just as the sensitive peas do in
spite of their names neither produces the butterflyshaped
papilionaceous blossom of true peas the partridge pea bears
from two to four showy flowers together each measuring an inch
or more across on a slender pedicel from the axils it fully
expands only four of its five bright yellow petals they are
somewhat unequal in size the upper ones with touches of red at
the base as pathfinders not however as nectarguides since
no sweets are secreted here curiously enough both right and
left hand flowers are found upon the same plant that is to say
the sickleshaped pistil turns either to the right or the left
one lateral petal instead of being flexible and spread like the
rest stands so stiffly erect and incurved that it commonly
breaks on being bent back why the pistil it will be noticed
points away from the ten long black anthers obviously then the
flower cannot fertilize itself its benefactors are bumblebee
females and workers out after pollen cupshaped nectaries
extra nuptial are situated on the upper side and near the
base of the leaf stalks on these cassia plants where they can
have no direct influence on the fertilization of the blossoms
apparently they are free lunchcounters kept open out of pure
charity landing upon the long black anthers with pores in their
tips to let out the pollen the bumblebees seize them between
their mandibles says professor robertson and stroke them
downward with a sort of milking motion the pollenfalls either
directly upon the bee or upon the erect lateral petal which is
pressed close against the bees side in this way the side of the
bee which is next to the incurved petal receives the most
pollen a bee visiting a lefthand flower receives pollen upon
the right side and then flying to a righthand flower strikes
the same side against the stigma when we find circular holes in
these petals we may know the leafcutter or upholsterer bee

these exquisite bright flowers hanging at a horizontal like
jewels from a ladys ear may be responsible for the plants folk
name but whoever is abroad early on a dewy morning or after a
shower and finds notched edges of the drooping leaves hung with
scintillating gems dancing sparkling in the sunshine sees
still another reason for naming this the jewelweed in a brook
pond spring or wayside trough which can never be far from its
haunts dip a spray of the plant to transform the leaves into
glistening silver they shed water much as the nasturtiums do
when the tiny rubythroated hummingbird flashes northward out of
the tropics to spend the summer where can he hope to find nectar
so deeply secreted that not even the longtongued bumblebee may
rob him of it all beyond the birds bill his tongue can be run
out and around curves no other creature can reach now the early
blooming columbine its slender cornucopias brimming with sweets
welcomes the messenger whose needlelike bill will carry pollen
from flower to flower presently the coral honeysuckle and the
scarlet paintedcup attract him by wearing his favorite color
next the jewelweed hangs horns of plenty to lure his eye and
the trumpet vine and cardinal flower continue to feed him
successively in natures garden albeit cannas nasturtiums
salvia gladioli and such deep irregular showy flowers in mens
flower beds sometimes lure him away these are bird flowers
dependent in the main on the rubythroat which is not to say
that insects never enter them for they do only they are not the
visitors catered to watch the big velvety bumblebee approach a
roomy jewelweed blossom and nearly disappear within the large
bunch of united stamens suspended directly over the entrance
bears copious white pollen so much comes off on his back that
after visiting a flower or two he becomes annoyed clings to a
leaf with his fore legs while he thoroughly brushes his back and
wings with his middle and hind pairs and then collects the
sticky grains into a wad on his feet which he presently kicks off
with disgust to the ground examine a jewelweed blossom to see
that the clumsy bumblebees pollenladen back is not so likely to
come in contact with the short fiveparted stigma concealed
beneath the stamens as a hummingbirds slender bill that is
thrust obliquely into the spur while he hovers above
but as if the plant had not sufficient confidence in its
visitors to rely exclusively on them for help in continuing the
lovely species it bears also cleistogamous blossoms that never
open  economical products without petals which ripen abundant
selffertilized seed see white wood sorrel it is calculated
that each jewelweed blossom produces about two hundred and fifty
pollen grains yet each is by no means able to produce seed in
spite of its prodigality nevertheless enough crossfertilized
seed is set to save the species from the degeneracy that follows
close inbreeding among plants as well as animals in england
where this jewelweed is rapidly becoming naturalized darwin
recorded there are twenty plants producing cleistogamous flowers
to one having showy blossoms which even when produced seldom
set seed what more likely since hummingbirds are confined to
the new world therefore why should the plant waste its energy on
a product useless in england it can never attain perfection
there until hummingbirds are imported as bumblebees had to be
into australia before the farmers could harvest seed from their
clover fields see red clover
familiar as we may be with the nervous little seedpods of the
touchmenot which children ever love to pop and see the seeds
fly as they do from balsam pods in grandmothers garden they
still startle with the suddenness of their volley touch the
delicate hairtrigger at the end of a capsule and the lightning
response of the flying seeds makes one jump they sometimes land
four feet away at this rate of progress a year and with the
other odds against which all plants have to contend how many
generations must it take to fringe even one mill pond with
jewelweed yet this is rapid transit indeed compared with many

flower gets its name says f schuyler mathews from the
superstition that on st johns day the 24th of june the dew
which fell on the plant the evening before was efficacious in
preserving the eyes from disease so the plant was collected
dipped in oil and thus transformed into a balm for every wound

only for a day and that must be a bright sunny one does the
solitary frostflower expand its delicate yellow petals on the
next after pollen has been brought to it by insect messengers
and its own carried away the now useless petal advertisements
fall and the numerous stamens inserted upon the receptacle with
them also drop off leaving the clubshaped pistil to develop
with the ovary into a rounded ovoid threevalved capsule
notice how flat the stamens lie upon the petals to keep safely
out of reach of the stigma another flower exactly like the
first now expands and the bloom continues for weeks why does
only one blossom open at a time because the whole aim of the
showy flowers is to set crossfertilized seed and when only one
at a time appears pollination not only between distinct blossoms
but between distinct plants insures the healthiest most vigorous
offspring  a wise precaution against degeneracy in view of the
quantities of selffertilized seed that will be set late in
summer by the tiny apetalous flowers that never open see white
wood sorrel surely two kinds of blossoms should be enough for
any species but why call this the frostflower when its bloom is
ended by autumn only the witchhazel may be said to flower for

upwards of one hundred and fifty species of opuntia which elect
to grow in parching sands beneath a scorching sun often
prostrate on baking hot rocks on glaring plains beaches and
deserts from massachusetts to peru  for all are natives of the
new world  show so marvelous an adaptation to environment in
each instance that no group of plants is more interesting to the
botanist more decorative in form and color from an artistic
standpoint more distinctively characteristic plants choosing
such habitats as they have adopted usually in tropical or
semitropical regions had to resort to various expedients to
save loss of water through transpiration and evaporation now as
leaves are the natural outlets for moisture thrown off by any
plant manifestly the first thing to do was either to reduce the
number of branches and leaves or to modify them into sharp
spines not surface prickles like the roses to cultivate a low
habit of growth not to expose unnecessary surface to sun and
air to thicken the skin until little moisture could evaporate
through the leathery coat and finally to utilize the material
thus saved in developing stems so large fleshy and juicy that
they should become wells in a desert with powers of sustenance
great enough to support the plant through its fiery trials a
common expedient of plants in dry situations even at the north
is to modify their leaves into spines as the gorse and the
barberry for example have done that such an armor also serves
to protect them against the ravages of grazing animals is an
additional advantage of course but not their sole motive in
wearing it popular to destruction would the cool juices of the
cacti be in thirsty lands if only they might be obtained without
painful and often poisonous scratches given moist soil and
greater humidity of atmosphere to grow in spiny plants at once
show a tendency to grow taller to branch and become leafy a
covering of hairs which reflect the light thus diminishing the
amount that might reach the juicy interior area has likewise
been employed by many cacti among other denizens of dry soil
in this common prickly pear cactus of the atlantic seaboard
where the air is laden with moisture from the ocean few or no
spines are produced and dotted over the surface of its
branching fleshy flattened joints we find tiny awlshaped
leaves whereas foliage is entirely wanting in the densely
prickly rounded solid unbranched hairy cacti of the
southwestern deserts and the arid plains of mexico
in sunshine the beautiful yellow blossom of our prickly pear
expands to welcome the bees folding up its petals again for
several successive nights william hamilton gibson says it
encloses its buzzing visitor in a golden bower from which he
must emerge at the roof as dusty as a miller only to enter
another blossom and leave some pollen on its numerous stigmas
but the cochineal not the bee is forever associated with cacti
in the popular mind indeed several species are extensively
grown on plantations known as nopaleries which furnish food to
countless trillions of these tiny insects like its relative the
aphis of rose bushes see wild roses the cochineal fastens
itself to a cactus plant by its sucking tube to live on the
juices the males are winged and only the female which yields
the valuable dye sticks tight to the plant three crops of
insects a year are harvested on a mexican plantation after three
months sucking the females are brushed off dried in ovens and
sold for about two thousand dollars a ton the annual yield of
mexico amounting to many thousands of tons it is no wonder the
cactus plant which furnishes so valuable an industry should
appear on the coatofarms of the mexican republic some cacti
are planted for hedges the fruit of others furnishes a
refreshing drink in tropical climates the juices are used as a
water color and to dye candies  in short this genus opuntia
and allied clans have great commercial value
the western prickly pear 0 humifusa o rafnesquii of gray  a
variable species ranging from minnesota to texas is similar to

like a ballroom beauty the evening primrose has a jaded
bedraggled appearance by day when we meet it by the dusty
roadside its erect buds fading flowers from last nights
revelry wilted ones of previous dissipations and hairy oblong
capsules all crowded together among the willowlike leaves at
the top of the rank growing plant but at sunset a bud begins to
expand its delicate petals slowly timidly  not suddenly and
with a pop as the evening primrose of the garden does
now its fragrance that has been only faintly perceptible during
the day becomes increasingly powerful why these blandishments
at such an hour because at dusk when sphinx moths large and
small begin to fly see jamestown weed the primroses special
benefactors are abroad all these moths whose length of tongue
has kept pace with the development of the tubes of certain white
and yellow flowers dependent on their ministrations find such
glowing like miniature moons for their special benefit when
blossoms of other hues have melted into the deepening darkness
if such have fragrance they prepare to shed it now nectar is
secreted in tubes so deep and slender that none but the moths
long tongues can drain the last drop an exquisite little
rosepink twilight flyer his wings bordered with yellow
flutters in ecstasy above the evening primroses freshly opened
flowers transferring in his rapid flight some of their abundant
sticky pollen that hangs like a necklace from the outstretched
filaments by day one may occasionally find a little fellow
asleep in a wilted blossom which serves him as a tent under
whose flaps the brightest bird eye rarely detects a dinner after
a single nights dissipation the corolla wilts hangs a while
then drops from the maturing capsule as if severed with a sharp
knife few flowers sometimes only one opens on a spike on a
given evening  a plan to increase the chances of

long succession of bloom if a flower has not been pollenized
during the night it remains open a while in the morning
bumblebees now hurry in and an occasional hummingbird takes a
sip of nectar toward the end of summer when so much seed has
been set that the flower can afford to be generous it distinctly
changes its habit and keeps open house all day

rosettes of yearold evening primrose plants  exquisitely
symmetrical complex stars from whose center the flower stalks of

floriform sunshine bursts forth from roadsides fields and
prairies when the common sundrops kneiffia fructicosa formerly
qenothera fructicosa  is in flower it is first cousin to the

blossom on a stalk expands at a time to increase the chances of
crossfertilization between distinct plants but where colonies
grow it is a conspicuous acquaintance for its large bright
yellow corollas remain open all day bumblebees with their long
tongues and some butterflies drain the deeply hidden nectar
smaller visitors get some only when it wells up high in the tube
as the stigma surpasses the anthers selffertilization is
impossible unless an insect blunders by alighting elsewhere than
on the lower side where the stigma is purposely turned to be
rubbed against his pollenladen ventral surface when he settles

the island continent and has thence spread northward and
westward until in its migrations it has reached java and
sumatra and long ago took possession of the philippines it
has established a more or less precarious foothold for itself in

surely here is a butterfly flower if ever there was one and such
are rare very few are adapted to tongues so long and slender
that the bumblebee cannot help himself to their nectar but one
almost never sees him about the butterflyweed while other bees
a few wasps and even the rubythroated hummingbird which ever
delights in flowers with a suspicion of red about them sometimes
visit these bright clusters it is to the everpresent butterfly
that their marvelous structure is manifestly adapted only
visitors long of limb can easily remove the pollinia which are
usually found dangling from the hairs of their legs we may be
sure that after generously feeding its guests the flower does
not allow many to depart without rendering an equivalent service
the method of compelling visitors to withdraw pollenmasses from
one blossom and deposit them in another  an amazing process 
has been already described under the common milkweed lacking the
quantity of sticky milky juice which protects that plant from
crawling pilferers the butterflyweed suffers outrageous
robberies from black ants the hairs on its stem not sufficient
to form a stockade against them serve only as a screen to
reflect light lest too much may penetrate to the interior juices

place to rest a while and satisfy it presently a bumblebee
attracted by the odor from afar alights on the fringed platform
too weak to hold him dropping downward he snatches the
filaments of the two long stamens to save himself and as he
does so pollen jarred out of their anther sacs falls on his
thorax at the juncture of his wings hanging beneath the flower a
second he sips its nectar and is off many bees large and
small go through a similar performance now the young newly
opened flowers have the forked stigmas of the long style only
protruding at this stage the miniature stamens being still
curled within the tube obviously a pollendusted bee coming to
one of these young flowers must rub off some of the vitalizing
dust on the sticky fork that purposely impedes his entrance at
the precise spot necessary notice that after a flowers stamens
protrude in the second stage of its development the fork is
turned far to one side to get out of harms way

delpino long ago pointed out that the blossom is best adapted to
pollencollecting bees which alighting on the two long
protruding stamens rub off pollen on their undersides while
clinging for support to the wool on the three shorter stamens
whose anthers supply their needs as a bee settles on another
flower the stigma is calculated to touch the pollen on his under

effected three stamens furnish a visitor with food two others

i have come three thousand miles to see the mullein cultivated
in a garden and christened the velvet plant says john
burroughs in an october abroad but even in england it grows
wild and much more abundantly in southern europe while its
specific name is said to have been given it because it was so
common in the neighborhood of thapsus but whether the place of
that name in africa or the sicilian town mentioned by ovid and
virgil is not certain strange that europeans should labor under
the erroneous impression that this mullein is native to america
whereas here it is only an immigrant from their own land rapidly
taking its course of empire westward from our seaports into which
the seeds smuggled their passage among the ballast it is now
more common in the eastern states perhaps than any native
forty or more folknames have been applied to it mostly in
allusion to its alleged curative powers its use for candlewick
and funeral torches in the middle ages the generic title first
used by pliny is thought to be a corruption of barbascum  with
beards in allusion to the hairy filaments or as some think to
the leaves
of what use is this feltlike covering to the plant the
importance of protecting the delicate sensitive active cells
from intense light draught or cold have led various plants to
various practices none more common however than to develop
hairs on the epidermis of their leaves sometimes only enough to
give it a downy appearance sometimes to coat it with felt as in
this case where the hairs branch and interlace fierce sunlight
in the exposed dry situations where the mullein grows prolonged
drought which often occurs at flowering season when the
perpetuation of the species is at stake and the intense cold
which the exquisite rosettes formed by yearold plants must
endure through a winter before they can send up a flowerstalk
the second spring  these trials the wellscreened juicy warm
plant has successfully surmounted through its coat of felt
hummingbirds have been detected gathering the hairs to line their

itself in stormy weather insects failing to transfer its pollen
to drain ten of these spurs a minute is no difficult task for the

hivebees and leafcutters squeeze in between the tight lips an
occasional butterfly inserts its long thin tongue and without
transferring a grain of pollen for the flower robs it of sweets

in the vegetable kingdom as in the spiritual all degrees of
backsliding sinners may be found each branded with a mark of
infamy according to its deserts we have seen how the dodder vine
lost both leaf and roots after it consented to live wholly by
theft of its hardworking hosts juices through suckers that
penetrate to the vitals how the indian pipes blanched face
tells the story of guilt perpetrated under cover of darkness in
the soil below how the broomrape and beechdrops lost their
honest green color and finally the foxgloves show us plants
with their faces so newly turned toward the path of perdition
their larceny so petty that only the expert in criminal botany
cases condemns them like its cousins the gerardias qv the
downy false foxglove is only a partial parasite attaching its
roots by disks or suckers to the roots of white oak or witch
hazel qv not only that but quite as frequently groping
blindly in the dark it fastens suckers on its own roots
actually thieving from itself it is this piratical tendency
which makes transplanting of foxgloves into our gardens so very
difficult even when lifted with plenty of their beloved
vegetable mould the term false foxglove it should be explained
is by no means one of reproach for dishonesty it was applied
simply to distinguish this group of plants from the true
foxgloves cultivated not wild here which yield digitalis to
the doctors
but if these foxgloves live at others expense there are
creatures which in turn prey upon them caterpillars of a peacock

from july to september all the foxgloves elevate their sticky
stigmas to the mouth of their tubes that the pollendusted
bumblebee may leave some of the vitalizing dust brought from
another flower on its surface before she turns upside down and
enters in this unusual fashion to receive a fresh supply on her
way to the nectar in the base of the tube her pressure against
the pointed anthertips causes the light dry pollen to sift out
on the removal of her pressure the gaping chinks close to save it

to four feet tall the broad trumpetshaped yellow flower
which is sticky outside measures an inch or an inch and a half
long and is sometimes almost as wide across the most abundant
visitor and the one for which the flower is most perfectly
adapted says professor robertson is bombus americanorum this
bee always turns head downwards on entering the flower when it
enters or backs out the basal joints of its legs strike the
tips of the anthercells when the pollen falls out i had often
wondered why this bee turned upside down to enter the flower
i discovered that the form of the flower requires it the
modification which requires the bees to reverse is associated
with the peculiar mode of pollen discharge smaller bumblebees
and some other bees which never or rarely try to suck hang under
the anthers and work out the pollen by striking the triggerlike
awns they reverse of their own accord since they are so small
they are not compelled to do so on account of the form of the
flower the tube is largeso that most bumblebee workers could
easily reach the nectar if the tube were not curved in the
opposite direction from that of most flowers and if the anthers
did not obstruct the entrance sometimes small bees despairing
of getting into the tube through the mouth suck at holes in the
flowers sides because legitimate feasting was made too
difficult for the poor little things the rubythroated
hummingbird hovering a second above the tube drains it with

here is an extraordinary little plant indeed which by its
amazing cleverness now overruns the globe  one of the higher
order of intelligence so closely akin to the animals that the
gulf which separates such from them seems not very wide after
all in studying the watercrowfoots qv and other aquatic
plants we learned why submerged leaves must be so finely cut
but what mean the little bladders tipped with bristles among the
popweeds threadlike foliage formerly these were regarded as
mere floats  a thoughtless theory for branches without bladders
might have been observed floating perfectly it is now known they
are traps for capturing tiny aquatic creatures nearly every
bladder you examine under a microscope contains either minute
crustaceans or larvae worms or lower organisms some perhaps
still alive but most of them more or less advanced toward
putrefaction  a stage hastened it is thought by a secretion
within the bladders for the plant cannot digest fresh food it
can only absorb through certain processes within the bladders
walls the fluid products of decay the little insectivorous
sundew qv on the contrary not only digests but afterward
absorbs animal matter tiny aquatic creatures ever seeking
shelter from larger ones ready to devour them enter the popweed
bladders by bending inward the free edge of the valve which
being strongly elastic snaps shut again behind them instantly
abandon hope all ye who enter here might be written above the
entrance no victim ever escapes from that prison scientists are
not agreed that the bristles draw creatures into the bladder
whatever touches the sensitive valves is at once drawn in to
show how closely the edge fits says charles darwin i may
mention that my son found a daphnia which had inserted one of its
antennae into the slit and it was thus held fast during a whole
day on three or four occasions i have seen long narrow larvae
both dead and alive wedged between the corner of the valve and
collar with half their bodies within the bladder and half out
professor cohn of germany tells of immersing a plant of this
bladderwort one evening in clear water swarming with tiny
crustaceans and by the next morning most of the bladders
contained them entrapped and swimming around in their prisons
so much for what is going on below the surface of the water what
above it several flowers on the showy spike attract numerous
insects one alighting on the lower lip must thrust his tongue
beneath the upper one to reach the nectar in the spur passing on
its way the irritable stigma which receives any pollen he has
brought in instantly it is touched the stigma folds up to be
out of the way of the tongue when it is withdrawn from the spur
now laden with fresh pollen it is thus that selffertilization
is escaped many vigorous seeds follow in each capsule this
marvelous piece of mechanism is what thoreau termed a
dirtyconditioned flower like a sluttish woman with a gaudy
yellow bonnet
not through its seeds alone however has the little plant
succeeded in firmly establishing itself in early autumn the
stems terminate in large buds which falling off lie dormant all
winter at the bottom of the pond in spring they root and put
forth leaves bearing bladders which at this stage of existence
are filled with water to help anchor the plant as flowering
season approaches the bladders undergo an internal change to fit
them for a change of function they now fill with air when the
buoyed plant rises toward the surface to send up its flowering
scape while the bladders proceed with their nefarious practices
to nourish it more abundantly while its system is heavily taxed

entire leaves and bladders its benefactors bumblebees and
butterflies with their highly developed aesthetic taste are

in packing this was the chance for expansion they had been

practically impossible to escape from the vigilance of gardeners
here others with a better plan for disseminating seed quickly

august and sparingly again in autumn
when daylight begins to fade these long slendertubed buds
expand to welcome their chosen benefactors the sphinx moths
wooing them with fragrance so especially strong and sweet at this
time that long after dark guests may be guided from afar by it
alone and entertaining them with copious draughts of deeply
hidden nectar which their long tongues alone may drain poised
above the blossoms they sip without pause of their whirring
wings and it is not strange that many people mistake them in the
half light for hummingbirds indeed they are often called
hummingbird moths darting away suddenly and swift as thought
they have also earned the name of hawk moths because the
caterpillars have a curious trick of raising the fore part of
their bodies and remaining motionless so long like an egyptian
sphinx the commoner name seems most appropriate a sphinx moth
at rest curls up its exceedingly long tongue like a watch
spring in action only the hummingbird can penetrate to such
depths hence that honeysuckle which prefers to woo the tiny
bird whose decided preference is for red is the trumpet or
coral honeysuckle whereas the other twiners developed deep
tubular flowers that are white or yellow so that the moths may
see them in the dark when red blossoms are engulfed in the
prevailing blackness moreover the latter bloom at a season when
the crepuscular and nocturnal moths are most abundant rough
rounded pollen grains carried on the hairs and scales on the
under side of the moths body from his head to his abdomen
including antennae tongue legs and wings cannot but be rubbed
off on the protruding sticky stigma of the next honeysuckle tube
entered hence crossfertilization is regularly effected by moths
alone the next day such interlopers as bees flies butterflies

pollen remains if the previous evening has been calm and fine
they will find little or none but if the night has been wild and
stormy keeping the moths under cover the tubes will brim with
sweets after fertilization the corolla turns yellow to let

the coral honeysuckle determined to woo the hummingbird by
wearing his favorite color the twining white and yellow
honeysuckles of our porches chose for their benefactors the
sphinx moths attracting them by delicious fragrance and deeply
hidden nectar in slender tubes that are visible even in the dark
whereas the smallflowered bush honeysuckles still cater to the
bees which in all probability once sufficed for the entire
family for them a conspicuous landing place has been provided in
the more highly colored lower lobe of this flower from which the
visitor cannot fail to find the pocket full of nectar that swells
the base of the tube but when he alights pollen laden from
another blossom he must pay toll by leaving some of the
vitalizing dust on the projecting stigma before he feasts and
dusts himself afresh after they have been plundered and
consequently fertilized all the honeysuckles change color this
one taking on a deeper yellow to let the bees know the larder is
empty that they may waste no precious time but confine their
visits where they are needed many flowers adapted to bees show

insight into cooperative methods as opposed to individualism the
young man anxious to learn how to get on parents with children
to be equipped for the struggle for existence business men and
employers of labor all sit down beside the dandelion and take
its lesson to heart how has it managed without navies and armies
 for it is no imperialist  to land its peaceful legions on
every part of the civilized world and take possession of the
soil how can this neglected wayside composite weed triumph over
the most gorgeous hothouse individual on which the horticulturist
expends all the science at his command to flourish where others
give up the struggle defeated to send its vigorous offspring
abroad prepared for similar conquest of adverse conditions
wherever met to attract myriads of customers to its department
store and by consummate executive ability to make every visitor
unwittingly contribute to its success any one who doubts the
dandelions fitness to survive should humble himself by spending
days and weeks on his knees trying to eradicate the plant from
even one small lawn with a knife only to find the turf starred
with golden blossoms or worse still from his point of view
hoary with seed balloons the following spring
deep very deep the stocky bitter root penetrates where heat and
drought affect it not nor nibbling rabbits moles grubs of
insects and other burrowers break through and steal cut off the
upper portion only with your knife and not one but several
plants will likely sprout from what remains and however late in
the season will economize stem and leaf to produce flowers and
seeds cuddled close within the tuft that set all your pains at
naught never say die is the dandelions motto an exceedingly
bitter medicine is extracted from the root of this dandelion
formerly known as t officinale likewise are the leaves bitter
although they appear so early in the spring they must be
especially tempting to grazing cattle and predaceous insects the
rosettes remain untouched while other succulent agreeable
plants are devoured wholesale only italians and other thrifty
oldworld immigrants who go about then with sack and knife
collecting the fresh young tufts give the plants pause but even
they leave the roots intact when boiled like spinach or eaten
with french salad dressing the bitter juices are extracted from
the leaves or disguised  mean tactics by an enemy outside the
dandelions calculation all nations know the plant by some
equivalent for the name dent de lion  lions tooth which the
jagged edges of the leaves suggest
presently a hollow scape arises to display the flower above the
surrounding grass bridge builders and constructing engineers
know how yielding and economical yet how invincibly strong is
the hollow tube march winds may buffet and bend the dandelions
stem without harm how children delight to split this slippery
tube and run it in and out of their mouths until curls form at
the top of the scape is a double involucre of narrow green
leaflike scales similar to what all composites have half the
involucre bends downward to protect the flower from crawling
pilferers half stands erect to play the role for the community
of florets within that the calyx does for individual blossoms
when it is time to close the dandelion shop business being ended
for the day this upperhalf of the involucre protects it like
the heavy shutters merchants put up at their windows
seated on a fleshy receptacle not one flower but often two
hundred minute perfect florets generously cooperate in union
there is strength is another motto adopted not only by the
chicory clan but by the entire horde of composites each floret
of itself could hope for no attention from busy insects united
how gorgeously attractive these disks of overlapping rays are
doubtless each tiny flower was once a fivepetaled blossom for
in the five teeth at the top and the five lines are indications
that once distinct parts have been welded together to form a more
showy and suitable corolla each floret insures crosspollination
from insects crawling over the head much as the minute yellow
tubes in the center of a daisy do qv quantities of small
bees wasps flies butterflies and beetles  over a hundred
species of insects  come seeking the nectar that wells up in
each little tube and the abundant pollen which are greatly
appreciated in early spring when food is so scarce in rainy
weather and at night when its benefactors are not flying the
canny dandelion closes completely to protect its precious
attractions because the plant which is likely to bloom every
month in the year may not always certainly reckon on being
pollinated by insects each neglected floret will curl the two
spreading sticky branches of its style so far backward that they
come in contact with any pollen that has been carried out of the
tube by the sweeping brushes on their tips occasional
selffertilization is surely better than setting no seed at all
when insects fail not a chance does the dandelion lose to get
on
after flowering it again looks like a bud lowering its head to
mature seed unobserved presently rising on a gradually
lengthened scape to elevate it where there is no interruption for
the passing breeze from surrounding rivals the transformed head
now globular white airy is even more exquisite set as it is
with scores of tiny parachutes ready to sail away a childs
breath puffing out the time of day a vireo plucking at the
fluffy ball for lining to put in its nest the summer breeze the
scythe rake and mowing machines sudden gusts of winds sweeping
the country before thunderstorms  these are among the agents
that set the flying vagabonds free in the hay used for packing
they travel to foreign lands in ships and once landed readily
adapt themselves to conditions as they find them after soaking
in the briny ocean for twentyeight days  long enough for a
current to carry them a thousand miles along the coast  they are
still able to germinate

few gardeners allow the table lettuce sativa to go to seed but
as it is next of kin to this common wayside weed it bears a
strong likeness to it in the loose narrow panicles of

they were nobody knows herodotus says lettuce was eaten as a

the hairy or red wild lettuce l hirsuta similar to the
preceding but often with dark reddish stem peduncles and tiny
flowercups the ray florets varying from yellow to pale reddish
or purplish has longer leaves deeply cut or lobed almost to the
wide midrib after what we learned when studying the barberry and
the prickly pear cactus for example about plants that choose to
live in dry soil it is not surprising to find that this is a
lower less leafy and more hairy plant than the moistureloving
tall lettuce
an european immigrant naturalized here but recently the prickly
lettuce l scariola has nevertheless made itself so very much
at home in a short time that it has already become a troublesome
weed from new england to pennsylvania westward to minnesota and
missouri but when we calculate that every plant produces over
eight thousand fluffy whitewinged seeds on its narrow panicle
ready to sail away on the first breeze no wonder so well endowed
and prolific an invader marches triumphantly across continents
the long pale green spinymargined milky leaves with stiff
prickles on the midrib beneath are doubly protected against
insect borers and grazing cattle

while longfellow must have had the coarsegrowing
yellowflowered daisylike prairie rosinweed silphium
laciniatum in mind when he wrote this stanza of evangeline
his lines apply with more exactness to the delicate prickly
lettuce our eastern compass plant not until 1895 did professor
j c arthur discover that when the garden lettuce is allowed to
flower its stem leaves also exhibit polarity the great lower
leaves of the rosinweed which stand nearly vertical with their
faces to the east and west and their edges to the north and
south have directed many a traveler not from acadia only
across the prairie until it has earned the titles pilotweed
compass or polar plant various theories have been advanced to
account for the curious phenomenon some claiming that the leaves
contained sufficient iron to reader them magnetic  a theory
promptly exploded by chemical analysis others supposed that the
resinous character of the leaves made them susceptible to
magnetic influence but as rosin is a nonconductor of
electricity of course this hypothesis likewise proved untenable
at last dr asa gray brought forward the only sensible
explanation inasmuch as both surfaces of the rosinweed leaf are
essentially alike there being very nearly as many stomata on the
upper side as on the under both surfaces are equally sensitive
to sunlight therefore the leaf twists on its petiole until both
sides share it as equally as is possible while the polarity of
the prickly lettuce leaves is by no means so marked dr grays
theory about the rosinweed may be applied to them as well

when these flowers transform whole acres into fields of the
clothofgold the slender wands swaying by every roadside and
purple asters add the final touch of imperial splendor to the
autumn landscape already glorious with gold and crimson is any
parterre of natures garden the world around more gorgeous than
that portion of it we are pleased to call ours within its limits
eightyfive species of goldenrod flourish while a few have
strayed into mexico and south america and only two or three
belong to europe where many of ours are tenderly cultivated in
gardens as they should be here had not nature been so lavish
to name all these species or the asters the sparrows and the
warblers at sight is a feat probably no one living can perform
nevertheless certain of the commoner goldenrods have
welldefined peculiarities that a little field practice soon
fixes in the novices mind
along shady roadsides and in moist woods and thickets from
august to october the bluestemmed wreath or woodland goldenrod
s caesia sways an unbranched stem with a bluish bloom on it
it is studded with pale golden clusters of tiny florets in the
axils of lanceshaped featherveined leaves for nearly its
entire length range from maine ontario and minnesota to the
gulf states none is prettier more dainty than this common
species
in rich woodlands and thicket borders we find the zigzag or
broadleaved goldenrod s flexicaulis s latifolia of gray its
prolonged angled stem that grows as if waveringly uncertain of
the proper direction to take strung with small clusters of
yellow florets somewhat after the manner of the preceding
species but its sawedged leaves are ovate sharply tapering to
a point and narrowed at the base into petioles it blooms from
july to september range from new brunswick to georgia and
westward beyond the mississippi
during the same blooming period and through a similar range our
only albino with an irishbull name the white goldenrod or
more properly silverrod s bicolor cannot be mistaken its
creamwhite florets also grow in little clusters from the upper
axils of a usually simple and hairy gray stem six inches to four
feet high most of the heads are crowded in a narrow terminal
pyramidal cluster this plant approaches more nearly the idea of
a rod than its relatives the leaves which are broadly oblong
toward the base of the stem and narrowed into long margined
petioles are frequently quite hairy for the silverrod elects
to live in dry soil and its juices must be protected from heat
and too rapid transpiration
in swamps and peat bogs the bog goldenrod s uliginosa sends up
two to four feet high a densely flowered oblong terminal spire
its short branches so appressed that this stem also has a
wandlike effect the leaves which are lanceshaped or oblong
gradually increase in size and length of petiole until the lowest
often measure nine inches long season july to september range
from newfoundland to pennsylvania and westward beyond the
mississippi
now we leave the narrow unbranched wand goldenrods strung with
clusters of minute florets which however slender and charming
are certainly far less effective in the landscape than the
following members of their clan which have their multitudes of
florets arranged in large compound more or less widely
branching terminal pyramidal clusters on this latter plan the
showy or noble goldenrod s speciosa displays its splendid
dense ascending branches of bloom from august to october
european gardeners object to planting goldenrods complaining
that they so quickly impoverish a rich bed that neighboring
plants starve this noble species becomes ignoble indeed unless
grown in rich soil when it spreads in thrifty circular tufts
the stout stem which often assumes reddish tints rises from
three to seven feet high and the smooth firm broadly oval
sawtoothed lower leaves are longpetioled range from nova
scotia to the carolinas westward to nebraska
when crushed in the hand the dotted bright green lanceshaped
entire leaves of the sweet goldenrod or blue mountain tea s
odora cannot be mistaken for they give forth a pleasant anise
scent the slender simple smooth stem is crowned with a
graceful panicle whose branches have the florets seated all on
one side dry soil new england to the gulf states july to
september
the wrinkleleaved or tall hairy goldenrod or bitterweed s
rugosa a perversely variable species its hairy stem perhaps
only a foot high or maybe over seven feet its rough leaves
broadly oval to lanceshaped sharply sawedged few if any
furnished with footstems lifts a large compound and gracefully
curved panicle whose florets are seated on one side of its
spreading branches sometimes the stem branches at the summit
one usually finds it blooming in dry soil from july to november
throughout a range extending from newfoundland and ontario to the
gulf states
usually the elmleaved goldenrod s ulmifolia sends up several
slender narrow spires of deep yellow bloom from about the same
point at the summit of the smooth stem like long tapering
fingers small oblong entire leaves are seated on these
elongated sprays while below the inflorescence the large leaves
taper to a sharp point and are coarsely and sharply toothed in
woods and copses from maine and minnesota to georgia and texas
this common goldenrod blooms from july to september
the unusually beautiful spreading recurved branching panicle
of bloom borne by the early plume or sharptoothed goldenrod or
yellowtop s juncea so often dried for winter decoration may
wave four feet high but usually not over two at the summit of a
smooth rigid stem toward the top narrow elliptical uncut
leaves are seated on the stalk below much larger leaves their
sharp teeth slanting forward taper into a broad petiole whose
edges may be cut like fringe in dry rocky soil this is
perhaps the first and last goldenrod to bloom having been found
as early as june and sometimes lasting into november range
from north carolina and missouri very far north
west of the mississippi how beautiful are the dry prairies in
autumn with the missouri goldenrod s missouriensis its short
broad spreading panicle waving at the summit of a smooth
slender stem from two to five feet tall its firm rather thick
leaves are lanceshaped triplenerved entire very
roughmargined or perhaps the lowest ones with a few scattered
teeth
perhaps the commonest of all the lovely clan east of the
mississippi or throughout a range extending from arizona and
florida northward to british columbia and new brunswick is the
canada goldenrod or yellowweed s canadensis surely everyone
must be familiar with the large spreading denseflowered
panicle with recurved sprays that crowns a rough hairy stem
sometimes eight feet tall or again only two feet its
lanceshaped acutely pointed triplenerved leaves are rough
and the lower ones sawedged from august to november one cannot
fail to find it blooming in dry soil
most brilliantly colored of its tribe is the lowgrowing gray or
field goldenrod or dyers weed s nemoralis the rich deep
yellow of its little spreading recurved and usually onesided
panicles is admirably set off by the ashy gray or often cottony
stem and the hoary grayishgreen leaves in the open sterile
places where they arise from july to november quebec and the
northwest territory to the gulf states
no longer classed as a true solidago but the type of a distinct
genus the lanceleaved bushy or fragrant goldenrod euthamia
graminifolia formerly s lanceolata lifts its flattopped
tansylike fragrant clusters of flowerheads from two to four
feet above moist ground from july to september it transforms
whole riverbanks low fields and roadsides into a veritable el
dorado its numerous leaves are very narrow lanceshaped triple
or five nerved uncut sometimes with a few resinous dots range
from new brunswick to the gulf and westward to nebraska
     along the roadside like the flowers of gold
        that tawny incas for their gardens wrought
      heavy with sunshine droops the goldenrod
bewildered by the multitude of species and wondering at the
enormous number of representatives of many of them we cannot but
inquire into the cause of such triumphal conquest of a continent
by a single genus much is explained simply in the statement that
goldenrods belong to the vast order of compositae flowers in
reality made up sometimes of hundreds of minute florets united
into a faradvanced socialistic community having for its motto
in union there is strength see daisy in the first place
such an association of florets makes a far more conspicuous
advertisement than a single flower one that can be seen by
insects at a great distance for most of the composite plants
live in large colonies each plant as well as each floret
helping the others in attracting their benefactors attention
the facility with which insects are enabled to collect both
pollen and nectar makes the goldenrods exceedingly popular
restaurants finally the visits ofinsects are more likely to
prove effectual because any one that alights must touch several
or many florets and crosspollinate them simply by crawling over
a head the disk florets mostly contain both stamens and pistil
while the ray florets in one series are all male immense numbers
of wasps hornets bees flies beetles and bugs feast without
effort here indeed the budding entomologist might form a large
collection of hymenoptera diptera coleoptera and hemiptera
from among the visitors to a single field of goldenrod alone
usually to be discovered among the throng are the velvety black
lytta or cantharis that impostor waspbeetle the black and
yellow wavybanded redlegged locusttree borer and the painted
clytus banded with yellow and sable squeaking contentedly as he
gnaws the florets that feed him
where the slender brown plumetipped wands etch their charming
outline above the snowcovered fields how the sparrows finches
buntings and juncos love to congregate of course helping to
scatter the seeds to the wind while satisfying their hunger on

annus have attained for many years the origin of the latter
flower which suddenly shone forth in european gardens with
unwonted splendor was in doubt only lately it was learned that
when champlain and segur visited the indians on lake hurons
eastern shores about three centuries ago they saw them
cultivating this plant which must have been brought by them from
its native prairies beyond the mississippi  a plant whose stalks
furnished them with a textile fiber its leaves fodder its
flowers a yellow dye and its seeds most valuable of all food
and hair oil early settlers in canada were not slow in sending
home to europe so decorative and useful an acquisition swine
poultry and parrots were fed on its rich seeds its flowers
even under indian cultivation had already reached abnormal size
of the sixty varied and interesting species of wild sunflowers
known to scientists all are north american
moores pretty statement
     as the sunflower turns on her god when he sets
      the same look which she turnd when he rose
lacks only truth to make it fact the flower does not travel
daily on its stalk from east to west often the top of the stem
turns sharply toward the light to give the leaves better
exposure but the presence or absence of a terminal flower
affects its action not at all
formerly the garden species was thought to be a native not of
our prairies but of mexico and peru because the spanish
conquerors found it employed there as a mystic and sacred symbol
much as the egyptians employed the lotus in their sculpture in
the temples the handmaidens wore upon their breasts plates of
gold beaten into the likeness of the sunflower but none of the
eighteen species of helianthus found south of our borders
produces under cultivation the great plants that stand like a
goldenhelmeted phalanx in every oldfashioned garden at the

tuberosus often called wild sunflower too has an interesting
history similar to the darkcentered common garden sunflowers
in a musty old tome printed in 1649 and entitled a perfect
description of virginia we read that the english planters had
rootes of several kindes potatoes sparagus carrets and
hartichokes  not the first mention of the artichoke by
angloamericans long before their day the indians who taught
them its uses had cultivated it and wherever we see the bright
yellow flowers gleaming like miniature suns above roadside
thickets and fence rows in the east we may safely infer the spot
was once an aboriginal or colonial farm white men planted it
extensively for its edible tubers which taste not unlike celery
root or salsify as early as 1617 the artichoke was introduced
into europe and only twelve years later parkinson records that
the roots had become very plentiful and cheap in london the
italians also cultivated it under the name girasole articocco
sunflower artichoke but it did not take long for the girasole
to become corrupted into jerusalem hence the name jerusalem
artichoke common to this day when the greater value of the
potato came to be generally recognized the use of artichoke
roots gradually diminished quite different from this sunflower
is the true artichoke cynara scolymus a native of southern
europe whose large unopened flowerheads offer a tiny edible
morsel at the base of each petallike part
the jerusalem artichoke sends up from its thickened fleshy
tuberbearing rootstock hairy branching stems six to twelve
feet high especially are the flowerstalks rough partly to
discourage pilfering crawlers the firm oblong leaves taper
pointed at the apex and sawedged are rough above the lower

is a gay deceiver a wolf in sheeps clothing literally a

it as they would upon a pious young clergyman complains mr
ellwanger a poor relation of the stately calla lily one knows
jack to be at a glance her lovely white robe corresponding to
his striped pulpit her bright yellow spadix to his sleek
reverence in the damp woodlands where his pulpit is erected
beneath leafy cathedral arches minute flies or gnats recently
emerged from maggots in mushrooms toadstools or decaying logs
form the main part of his congregation
now to drop the clerical simile let us peep within the
sheathing spathe or better still strip it off altogether dr
torrey states that the darkstriped spathes are the fertile
plants those with green and whitish lines sterile within are
smooth glossy columns and near the base of each we shall find
the true flowers minute affairs some staminate others on
distinct plants pistillate the berry bearers or rarely both
male and female florets seated on the same club as if jacks
elaborate plan to prevent selffertilization were not yet
complete plants may be detected in process of evolution toward
their ideals just as nations and men are doubtless when jacks
mechanism is perfected his guilt will disappear a little way
above the florets the club enlarges abruptly forming a
projecting ledge that effectually closes the avenue of escape for
many a guileless victim a fungus gnat enticed perhaps by the
striped house of refuge from cold spring winds and with a
prospect of food below enters and slides down the inside walls
or the slippery colored column in either case descent is very
easy it is the return that is made so difficult if not
impossible for the tiny visitors squeezing past the projecting
ledge the gnat finds himself in a roomy apartment whose floor 
the bottom of the pulpit  is dusted over with fine pollen that
is if he is among staminate flowers already mature to get some
of that pollen with which the gnat presently covers himself
transferred to the minute pistillate florets waiting for it in a
distant chamber is of course jacks whole aim in enticing
visitors within his polished walls but what means are provided
for their escape their efforts to crawl upward over the slippery
surface only land them weak and discouraged where they started
the projecting ledge overhead prevents them from using their
wings the passage between the ledge and the spathe is far too
narrow to permit flight now if a gnat be persevering he will
presently discover a gap in the flap where the spathe folds
together in front and through this tiny opening he makes his
escape only to enter another pulpit like the trusted but too
trusting messenger he is and leave some of the vitalizing
pollen on the fertile florets awaiting his coming
but suppose the fly small as he is is too large to work his way
out through the flap or too bewildered or stupid to find the
opening or too exhausted after his futile efforts to get out
through the overhead route to persevere or too weak with hunger
in case of long detention in a pistillate trap where no pollen
is what then open a dozen of jacks pulpits and in several at
least dead victims will be found  pathetic little corpses
sacrificed to the imperfection of his executive system had the
flies entered mature spathes whose walls had spread outward and
away from the polished column flight through the overhead route
might have been possible however glad we may be to make every
due allowance for this sacrifice of the higher life to the lower
as only a temporary imperfection of mechanism incidental to the
plants higher development jacks present cruelty shocks us no
less or it may be he will become insectivorous like the
pitcher plant in time he comes from a rascally family anyhow

cabbages dark incurved horn shelters within its hollow tiny
malodorous florets why is the entire plant so fetid that one
flees the neighborhood pervaded as it is with an odor that
combines a suspicion of skunk putrid meat and garlic after
investigating the carrionflower qv and the purple trillium
among others we learned that certain flies delight in foul odors
loathsome to higher organisms that plants dependent on these
pollen carriers woo them from long distances with a stench and
in addition sometimes try to charm them with color resembling the
sort of meat it is their special mission with the help of
beetles and other scavengers of nature to remove from the face
of the earth in such marshy ground as the skunk cabbage lives
in many small flies and gnats live in embryo under the fallen
leaves during the winter but even before they are warmed into
active life the hivebees natives of europe and with habits
not perfectly adapted as yet to our flora nor our floras habits
to theirs  see milkweed are out after pollen where would they
find any so early if not within the skunk cabbages livid horn
of plenty not even an alder catkin or a pussy willow has
expanded yet in spite of the bees refined taste in the matter
of perfume and color she has no choice now but to enter so
generous an entertainer at the top of the thick rounded spadix
within the skunk cabbage florets there first mature their
stigmas and pollen must therefore be carried to them on the
bodies of visitors later these stigmas wither and abundant
pollen is shed from the now ripe anthers meantime the lower
younger florets having matured their stigmas some pollen may
fall directly on them from the older flowers above a bee
crawling back and forth over the spadix gets thoroughly dusted
and flying off to another cluster of florets crossfertilizes
them  that is if all goes well but because the honeybee never
entered the skunk cabbages calculations useful as the immigrant
proved to be the horn that was manifestly designed for smaller
flies often proves a fatal trap occasionally a bee finds the
entrance she has managed to squeeze through too narrow and
slippery for an exit and she perishes miserably
a couple of weeks after finding the first bee says mr william
trelease in the american naturalist the spathes will be found
swarming with the minute black flies that were sought in vain
earlier in the season and their number is attested not only by
the hundreds of them which can be seen but also by the many
small but very fat spiders whose webs bar the entrance to
threefourths of the spathes during the present spring a few
specimens of a small scavenger beetle have been captured within
the spathes of this plant finally other and more attractive
flowers opening the bees appear to cease visiting those of this
species and countless small flies take their place compensating
for their small size by their great numbers these of course
are the benefactors the skunk cabbage catered to ages before the
honeybee reached our shores
after the flowering time come the vivid green crowns of leaves
that at least please the eye lizards make their home beneath
them and many a yellowthroat taking advantage of the plants
foul odor gladly puts up with it herself and builds her nest in
the hollow of the cabbage as a protection for her eggs and young
from fourfooted enemies cattle let the plant alone because of
the stinging acrid juices secreted by it although such tender
fresh bright foliage must be especially tempting like the
hellebores after a dry winter diet sometimes tiny insects are
found drowned in the wells of rain water that accumulate at the
base of the grooved leafstalks

window where tropical air plants send forth gorgeous blossoms
exquisite in color marvelous in form so that when this

stooped to become ghoulish saprophytes an honest herb abounds in
good green coloring matter chlorophyll that serves as a light
screen to the cellular juices of leaf and stem it also forms
part of its digestive apparatus aiding a plant in the
manufacture of its own food out of the soil water and gases
whereas a plant that lives by piracy  a parasite  or a
saprophyte that sucks up the already assimilated products of
anothers decay loses its useless chlorophyll as surely as if it
had been kept in a cellar in time its equally useless leaves
dwindle to bracts or disappear nature wastes no energy fungi
for example are both parasites and saprophytes and so when
plants far higher up in the evolutionary scale than they lose
leaves and green color too we may know they are degenerates
belonging to that disreputable gang of branded sinners which
includes the indianpipe broomrape dodder pinesap and
beechdrops others like the gerardias and foxgloves may even
now be detected on the brink of a fall from grace

like the wicked servant who buried the one talent entrusted to
his care the wild ginger hides its solitary flower if not
actually under the dry leaves that clothe the ground in the still
leafless woodlands then not far above them why when most
plants flaunt their showy blossoms aloft where they may be seen
of all why should this one bear only one dull firm cup
inconspicuous in color as in situation in early spring  and it
is one of the earliest flowers  gnats and small flies are
warming into active life from the maggots that have lain under
dead leaves and the bark of decaying logs all winter to such
guests a flower need offer few attractions to secure them in
swarms bright beautiful colors sweet fragrance luscious
nectar with which the highly specialized bees butterflies and
moths are wooed would all be lost on them lacking as they do
esthetic taste for flies a snug shelter from cold spring winds
such as jackinthepulpit the marsh calla the pitcherplant
or the skunk cabbage offers sometimes a fetid odor like the
latters or dull purplish red or brownish color resembling stale
meat which the purple trillium likewise wears as an additional
attraction are necessary when certain carrion flies must be
catered to and above all an abundance of pollen for food 
with any or all of these seductions a flower dependent on flies
has nothing to fear from neglect therefore the wild ginger does
not even attempt to fertilize itself within the cozy cup one can
usually find a contented fly seeking shelter or food close to
the ground it is warm and less windy when the cup first opens
only the stigmas are mature and sticky to receive any pollen the
visitors may bring in on their bodies from other asylums where
they have been hiding these stigmas presently withering up rise
the twelve stamens beside them to dust with pollen the flies
coming in search of it only one flower from a root compels
crossfertilizing between flowers of distinct plants  a means to
insure the most vigorous seed as darwin proved evidently the
ginger is striving to attain some day the ambitious mechanism for
temporarily imprisoning its guests that its cousin the dutchmans
pipe has perfected after fertilization the cup nods inverted
and the leathery capsule following it bursts irregularly
discharging many seeds
no ruminant will touch the leaves owing to their bitter juices
nor will a grub or nibbling rodent molest the root which bites

after learning why the pitcher plant jackinthepulpit and

surprised on opening this curious flower to find numbers of
little flies within the pipe certain relatives of this vine
produce flowers that are not only colored like livid putrid meat
around the entrance but also emit a fetid odor to attract
carrion flies especially see purple trillium
in may when the pipevine blooms gauzywinged small flies and
gnats gladly seek food and shelter from the wind within so
attractive an asylum as the curving tube offers they enter
easily enough through the narrow throat around which fine hairs
point downward  an entrance resembling an eel traps any pollen
they may bring in on their bodies now rubs off on the sticky
stigma lobes already matured at the bottom of a newly opened
flower in which they buzz crawl slide and slip seeking an
avenue of escape none presents itself they are imprisoned the
hairs at the entrance approached from within form an
impenetrable stockade must the poor little creatures perish is
the flower heartless enough to murder its benefactors on which
the continuance of its species depends by no means is it so
shortsighted a few tiny drops of nectar exuding from the center
table prevent the visitors from starving presently the
fertilized stigmas wither and when they have safely escaped the
danger of selffertilization the pollen hidden under their lobes
ripens and dusts afresh the little flies so impatiently awaiting
the feast now and not till now it is to the advantage of the
species that the prisoners be released that they may carry the
vitalizing dust to stigmas waiting for it in younger flowers
accordingly the slippery pipe begins to shrivel thus offering a
foothold the once stiff hairs that guarded its exit grow limp
and the happy gnats after a generous entertainment and snug
protection escape uninjured and by no means unwilling to repeat
the experience evidently the wild ginger belonging to a genus
next of kin is striving to perfect a similar prison in the

hover near our showy wild columbine with its five tempting horns
of plenty but sail away again knowing as they do that their
weak legs are not calculated to stand the strain of an inverted
position from a pendent flower nor are their tongues adapted to
slender tubes unless these may be entered from above the tongues
of both butterflies and moths bend readily only when directed
beneath their bodies it will be noticed that our columbines
funnelshaped tubes contract just below the point where the
nectar is secreted  doubtless to protect it from small bees

visitors to the nectaries the stamens protrude like a golden
tassel after the anthers pass the still immature stigmas the
pollen of the outer row ripens ready for removal while the
inner row of undeveloped stamens still acts as a sheath for the
stigmas owing to the pendent position of the flower no pollen
could fall on the latter in any case the columbine is too highly
organized to tolerate selffertilization when all the stamens
have discharged their pollen the styles then elongate and the
feathery stigmas opening and curving sidewise bring themselves
at the entrance of each of the five cornucopias just the
position the anthers previously occupied probably even the small
bees collecting pollen only help carry some from flower to
flower but perhaps the largest bumblebees and certainly the
hummingbird must be regarded as the columbines legitimate

there must always be something shocking in the sacrifice of the
higher life to the lower of the sensate to what we are pleased
to call the insensate although no one who has studied the
marvelously intelligent motives that impel a plants activities
can any longer consider the vegetable creation as lacking
sensibility science is at length giving us a glimmering of the
meaning of the word universe teaching as it does that all
creatures in sharing the one life share in many of its powers
and differ from one another only in degree of possession not in
kind the transition from one socalled kingdom into another
presumably higher one is a purely arbitrary line marked by man
and often impossible to define the animalcule and the
insectivorous plant know no boundaries between the animal and the
vegetable and who shall say that the sundew or the bladderwort
is not a higher organism than the amoeba animated plants and
vegetating animals parallel each other several hundred
carnivorous plants in all parts of the world have now been named
by scientists
it is well worth a journey to some spongy sphagnum bog to gather
clumps of pitcherplants which will furnish an interesting study
to an entire household throughout the summer while they pursue
their nefarious business in a shallow bowl on the veranda a
modification of the petiole forms a deep hollow pitcher having
for its spout a modification of the blade of the leaf usually
the pitchers are half filled with water and tiny drowned victims
when we gather them some of this fluid must be rain but the
open pitcher secretes much juice too certain relatives whose
pitchers have hooded lids that keep out rain are nevertheless
filled with fluid on the pacific coast the golden jars of
darlingtonia californica with their overarching hoods are often
so large and watery as to drown small birds and field mice note
in passing that these otherwise dark prisons have translucent
spots at the top whereas our pitcherplant is lighted through
its open transom
a sweet secretion within the pitchers rim which some say is
intoxicating others that it is an anaesthetic invites insects
to a fatal feast it is a simple enough matter for them to walk
into the pitcher over the band of stiff hairs pointing downward
like the withes of a lobster pot that form an inner covering or
to slip into the well if they attempt crawling over its polished
upper surface to fly upward in a perpendicular line once their
wings are wet is additionally hopeless because of the hairs that
guard the mouth of the trap and so after vain attempts to fly
or crawl out of the prison they usually sink exhausted into a
watery grave
when certain plants live in soil that is so poor in nitrogen
compounds that protein formation is interfered with they have
come to depend more or less on a carnivorous diet the sundew
qv actually digests its prey with the help of a gastric juice
similar to what is found in the stomach of animals but the
bladderwort qv and pitcherplants can only absorb in the form
of soup the products of their victims decay flies and gnats
drowned in these pitchers quickly yield their poor little bodies

no one knows better than the omnivorous barefoot boy that
     where the groundnut trails its vine
there is hidden something really good to eat under the soft
moist soil where legions of royal fern usually standing guard
above it must be crushed before he digs up the coveted tubers
he would be the last to confuse it with the wild kidney bean or
bean vine phaseolus polystachyus p perennis of gray the
latter has loose racemes of smaller purple flowers and leaflets
in threes nevertheless it is often confounded with the
groundnut vine by older naturalists whose knowledge was learned
of schools
usually a bee simply by alighting on the wings of a blossom
belonging to the pea family releases the stamens and pistil from
the keel not so here the sickleshaped keel of the groundnuts
flower rests its tip firmly in a notch of the standard petal nor
will any jar or pressure from outside release it a bee guided
to the nectary by the darker color of the underside of the curved
keel which spans the open cavity of the flower enters at least
partially and so releases by his pressure applied from
underneath the tip of the sickle from its notch in the standard
now the released keel curves all the more and splits open to
release the stigmatic tip of the style that touches any pollen
the bee may have brought from another blossom continuing to
curve and coil while the bee sucks it presently dusts him afresh
with pollen from the now released anthers a mass of pulp between
anthers and stigma prevents any of the flowers own pollen from

here and there the fresh green meadows show a touch of as vivid a
red as that in which vibert delighted to dip his brush
                         scarlet tufts
      are glowing in the green like flakes of fire
      the wanderers of the prairie know them well
      and call that brilliant flower the painted cup
thoreau who objected to this name thought flame flower a better
one the name the indians gave to oswego tea but here the floral
bracts not the flowers themselves are on fire lacking good
honest deep green one suspects from the yellowish tone of
calices stem and leaves that this plant is something of a
thief that it still possesses foliage proves only petty larceny
against it similar to the foxgloves qv caterpillars of
certain checkerspot butterflies in turn prey upon castilleja
under cover of darkness in the soil below the roots of our
painted cup occasionally break in and steal from the roots of its
neighbors such juices as the plant must work over into vegetable
tissue therefore it still needs leaves indispensable parts of a
digestive apparatus were it wholly given up to piracy like the
dodder or as parasitic as the indian pipe even the green and
the leaf that it hath would be taken away from this slothful
servant
but even without honest leaf green chlorophyll we know that
plants as low in the scale as fungi often take on the most
brilliant of yellows and reds in the painted cup the bracts
which enfold the insignificant yellowish cloistered flowers like
a cape render them great service in attracting the rubythroated
hummingbird by donning his favorite color no lip landing place
is provided for insects as in other members of the figwort
family dependent on bees although bumblebees which desire one
and butterflies which suck with their wings in motion may be
rarely caught robbing the short tubes among the wild flowers
only the columbine with an almost parallel blooming season
rivals the painted cup for the birds beneficent attentions the
latter flowers at about the time the rubythroat flashes
northward out of the tropics to spend the summer professor
robertson of illinois says in 1886 the first hummingbird seen
was on may 5 visiting the castilleja
wood betony lousewort beefsteak plant high healall
  pedicularis canadensis  figwort family
flowers  greenish yellow and purplish red in a short dense
spike calyx oblique tubular cleft on lower side and with 2 or
3 scallops on upper corolla about 34 in long 2lipped the
upper lip arched concave the lower 3lobed 4 stamens in pairs
1 pistil stems clustered simple hairy 6 to 18 in high
leaves mostly tufted oblong lanceshaped in outline and
pinnately lobed
preferred habitat  dry open woods and thickets
flowering season  apriljune
distribution  nova scotia to florida westward to manitoba
colorado and kansas
when the italians wish to extol someone they say he has more
virtues than betony alluding of course to the european
species betonica officinalis a plant that was worn about the
neck and cultivated in cemeteries during the middle ages as a
charm against evil spirits and prepared into plasters
ointments syrups and oils was supposed to cure every ill that
flesh is heir to our commonest american species fulfils its
mission in beautifying roadside banks and dry open woods and
copses with thick short spikes of bright flowers that rise
above large rosettes of coarse hairy fernlike foliage at
first these flowers beloved of bumblebees are all greenish
yellow but as the spike lengthens with increased bloom the
arched upper lip of the blossom becomes dark purplish red the
lower one remains pale yellow and the throat turns reddish
while some of the beefsteak color often creeps into stems and
leaves as well
farmers once believed that after their sheep fed on the foliage
of this group of plants a skin disease produced by a certain
tiny louse pediculus would attack them  hence our innocent
betonys repellent name
beechdrops
  septamnium virginianum epifegus virginiana of gray
broomrape family
flowers  small dull purple and white tawny or brownish
striped scattered along loose tiny bracted ascending branches
stem brownish or reddish tinged slender tough branching
above 6 in to 2 ft tall from brittle fibrous roots
preferred habitat  under beech oak and chestnut trees
flowering season  augustoctober
distribution  new brunswick westward to ontario and missouri
south to the gulf states
nearly related to the broomrape is this less attractive pirate
a taller brownishpurple plant with a disagreeable odor whose
erect branching stem without leaves is still furnished with
brownish scales the remains of what were once green leaves in
virtuous ancestors no doubt but perhaps even these relics of
honesty may one day disappear nature brands every sinner
somehow and the loss of green from a plants leaves may be taken
as a certain indication that theft of anothers food stamps it
with this outward and visible sign of guilt the grains of green
to which foliage owes its color are among the most essential of
products to honest vegetables that have to grub in the soil for a
living since it is only in such cells as contain it that
assimilation of food can take place as chlorophyll or
leafgreen acts only under the influence of light and air most
plants expose all the leaf surface possible but a parasite
which absorbs from others juices already assimilated certainly
has no use for chlorophyll nor for leaves either and in the
broomrape beechdrops and indian pipe among other thieves we
see leaves degenerated into bracts more or less without color
according to the extent of their crime now they cannot
manufacture carbohydrates even if they would any more than
fungi can
on the beechdrops slender branches two kinds of flowers are
seated below are the minute fertile ones which never open but
without imported pollen ripen an abundance of seed with
literally the closest economy nevertheless to save the species
from still deeper degeneracy through perpetual
selffertilization small purplishstriped flowers above them
mature stigmas and anthers on different days and invite insect
visits to help them produce a few crossfertilized seeds even a
few will save it every plant which bears cleistogamous or blind
flowers  violets woodsorrel jewelweed among others  must
also display some showy ones

from early may untll the middle of october the rubythroated
hummingbird forsakes the tropics to spend the flowery months with
us which wild flowers undertake to feed him years before showy
flowers were brought from all corners of the earth to adorn our
gardens about half a dozen natives in that parterre of natures
east of the mississippi catered to him in orderly succeswsion in
feasting at their board he could not choose but reciprocate the
favor by transferring their pollen as they took pains to arrange
matters nectar and tiny insects he is ever seeking of course
hundreds of flowers secrete nectar which taxes them little and
while the vast majority of these are avowedly adapted to insect
benefactors what is to prevent the birds needlelike bill from
probing the sweets from most of them certain flowers dependent
on him finding that the mere offering of nectar was not enough
to insure his fidelity that he was constantly lured away had to
offer some especially strong attractions to make his regular
visits sure how did these learn that red is irresistibly
fascinating to him and orange scarcely less so perhaps for the
sake of the red that is mixed with the yellow today we find such
flowers as need him sorely wearing his favorite colors but even
this delicate attention is not enough he demands that his
refreshments shall be reserved for him in a tube so deep or
inaccessible that when he calls he will find all he desires
notwithstanding the occasional intrusion of such longtongued
insects as bumblebees butterflies and moths first the
longspurred red and yellow columbine and the painted cup then
the coral honeysuckle jewelweed trumpetcreeper oswego tea
and cardinal flower have the honor of catering to the exacting
little sprite from spring to autumn his sojourn in our gardens
is prolonged until his beloved gladioli cannas honeysuckles
nasturtiums and salvia succumb to frost
where a trumpet vine climbs with the help of its aerial roots
like an ivys and sends forth clusters of brilliant tubes at the
tips of long wiry branches there one is sure to see sooner or
later the rubythroat flashing whirring darting from flower to
flower eight birds at once were counted about a vine one sunny
morning the next a pair of tame pigeons walked over the roof of
the summerhouse where the creeper grew luxuriantly and
punctured with a pop that was distinctly heard fifty feet away

afternoon all the corollas discolored and no hummers came near

smallflowered bush honeysuckles elected to serve and be served
by bees those with longer tubes welcomed bumblebees the white
and yellow flowered twining honeysuckles deep of tube and
deliciously fragrant especially after dark when they are still
visible cater to the sphinx moths see sweet wild honeysuckle
but surely the longesttongued bumblebee could not plumb the
depths of this slendertubed trumpet honeysuckle nor the
nightflying moth discover a flower that has melted into the
prevailing darkness when he begins his rounds and takes no pains
to guide him with perfume what creature then does it cater to
after reading of the aims of the trumpetflower on the preceding
page no one will be surprised to hear that the rubythroated
hummingbirds visits are responsible for most of the berries that
follow these charming generous abundant flowers so eminently
to his liking larger migrants than he in search of fare so
attractive distribute the seeds far and wide is any other

by the depth and brilliancy of its incomparable hue the shade
with which vibert delighted to illumine his rich canvases the
color of the famous hat worn by seventy ecclesiastical princes of
the roman church but a richer red than the bird which shares the
name can boast the cardinal flower proclaims its title to all
beholders because its vivid beauty cannot be hid and few
withstand the temptation to pick it its extermination goes on as
rapidly as its bird namesakes
     hast thou named all the birds without a gun
      loved the wood rose and left it on its stalk
the easy cultivation from seed of this peerless wildflower   and
it is offered in many trade catalogues  might save it to those
regions in natures wide garden that now know it no more the
ranks of floral missionaries need recruits
curious that the great blue lobelia should be the cardinal
flowers twin sister why this difference of color sir john
lubbock proved by tireless experiment that the bees favorite
color is blue and the shortertubed blue lobelia elected to woo
them as her benefactors whoever has made a study of the
rubythroated hummingbirds habits must have noticed how red
flowers entice him  columbines painted cups coral honeysuckle

flowers wonderful mechanism works to utilize his visits has
already been told under great lobelia in the description of the

greater than the rubythroat that the jeweledfeathered atom
could be concealed under one of its talons is the red lobelia
