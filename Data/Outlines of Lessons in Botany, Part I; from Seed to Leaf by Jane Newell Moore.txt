preface
in this study as in all scientific teaching the teachers aim should
be to foster in his pupils the power of careful observation and clear
expression the actual amount of knowledge gained at school must needs be
small and often quickly forgotten but the habit of right study is an
invaluable possession
the former method of teaching botany was confined almost wholly to dry
technical classification the pupil learned to find the name and order of
a plant but its structure its habits its life in short were untouched
by him we know now that nature is the best textbook the pupil should
first ask his questions of her and try to interpret her answers then he
may learn with profit what those who better understand her speech have to
tell him
this method of teaching however requires much very much of the
teacher he must be himself intelligent well trained and able to give
time to the preparation of his lessons it seems to us who are but
amateurs as if it were impossible to teach thus without a thorough
comprehension of the whole field our own ignorance oppresses us so much
that we feel tempted to say that we cannot attempt it but if the work of
leading children to observe the wonders about them is to be done at all
it must be done by us who are not masters of our subject and we must
find out for ourselves how we can best accomplish this result since we
have so little to guide us
it is with the hope that the experience of one who has tried to do
this with some fair amount of success may be of use to other puzzled
experimenters that i venture to write out some outlines of lessons in
botany for beginners
the method of beginning with the simpler forms of life is one that appeals
to the scientific tendencies of the day it seems logical to begin with
lower forms and work up to the higher but this method is only suitable
for mature minds we do not teach a child english by showing him the
sources of the language he learns it by daily use so also the beginning
of the study of any natural science by the young should be the observation
of the most obvious things about them the things which they can see and
handle and experiment upon naturally without artificial aids therefore
this book concerns itself only with the flowering plants
the author believes that the simplest botanical study should afford the
means of identifying plants as a large part of the students pleasure in
the science will be the recognition of the things about him the present
volume affords the basis for future classification which part ii on
flowers will develop it is doubtless as good a way perhaps the best
to begin with a single plant and study root stem leaves and flowers
as belonging to a whole but the problem is complicated by practical
difficulties in our climate there are but two months of the school year
when flowers are easily obtained on the other hand the material for
these lessons can be got throughout the winter and the class well
trained in methodical work will begin the study of flowers at the season
when every day brings some fresh wonder of beauty
the author will receive gladly any criticisms or suggestions

introduction
the lessons here outlined are suitable for children of twelve years of
age and upwards for younger pupils they would require much adaptation
and even then they would not be so good as some simpler method such as
following the growth of one plant and comparing it with others at every
step the little ones profit most by describing the very simple things
that they see without much reference to theories
the outlines follow the plan of dr grays first lessons and how plants
grow and are intended to be used in connection with either of those
books the necessary references will be found at the end of every section
the book contains also references to a course of interesting reading in
connection with the subjects of the lessons
the lessons may begin like the textbooks with the subject of
germination if the seeds are planted before they are required for use
but it is generally preferable to use the first recitation with the class
for planting the seeds in order to have them under the direct care of the
pupils some general talks about plants are therefore put at the beginning
to occupy the time until the seedlings are ready for study
some nasturtiums tropolum majus and morningglories should be planted
from the first in boxes of earth and allowed to grow over the window as
they are often used for illustrations
i
plants and their uses1
footnote 1 this section may be omitted and the lessons begun with
seedlings if the teacher prefer
what is botany the pupils are very apt to say at first that it is
learning about flowers the teacher can draw their attention to the fact
that flowers are only a part of the plant and that botany is also the
study of the leaves the stem and the root botany is the science of
plants ask them what the geranium is tell them to name some other
plants the teacher should keep a few growing plants in the schoolroom for
purposes of illustration
ask them what else there is in the world besides plants by this question
the three kingdoms animal vegetable and mineral are brought up it
will give occasion for a discussion of the earth and what it contains the
mountains formed of rocks and soil the plants growing on the earth
and the animals that inhabit it including man let them name the three
kingdoms with some example of each which of these kingdoms contain living
things the words organic and inorganic can be brought in here an
organ greek ergon meaning work is any part that does a special
work as the leaves the stem of a plant and the eye the ear of animals
an organism is a living being made up of such organs the inorganic
world contains the mineral kingdom the organic world includes the
vegetable and animal kingdoms
ones aim in these lessons should always be to tell the pupils as little
as possible try to lead them to think out these things for themselves
ask them how plants differ from animals they will say that plants are
fixed to one place while animals can move about that plants have no will
or consciousness and that animals have these answers are true when we
compare the higher animals with plants but the differences become lost as
we descend in the scale and approach the border land where botanist and
zoologist meet on a common ground seaanemones are fixed to the rock on
which they grow while some of the lower plants are able to move from
place to place and it is hardly safe to affirm that a jellyfish is more
conscious of its actions than is a sensitive plant the leaves of which
close when the stem is touched
there is no real division between animals and plants we try to classify
the objects about us into groups according to the closeness of their
relationships but we must always remember that these hard lines are ours
not natures we attempt for purposes of our own convenience to divide a
whole which is so bound together that it cannot be separated into parts
that we can confidently place on different sides of a dividing line
1 plants as foodproducersthe chief distinguishing characteristic of
plants is one that the pupils may be led to think out for themselves by
asking them what animals feed upon to help them with this ask them what
they had for breakfast oatmeal is mentioned perhaps this is made from
oats which is a plant coffee and tea bread made from wheat potatoes
etc all come from plants1 beef butter and milk come from the cow
but the cow lives upon grass the plant on the other hand is nourished
upon mineral or inorganic matter it can make its own food from the soil
and the air while animals can only live upon that which is made for
them by plants these are thus the link between the mineral and animal
kingdoms ask the scholars if they can think of anything to eat or drink
that does not come from a plant with a little help they will think of
salt and water these could not support life so we see that animals
receive all their food through the vegetable kingdom one great use of
plants is that they are foodproducers

2 clothingplants are used for clothing of the four great clothing
materials cotton linen silk and woollen the first two are of
vegetable the last two of animal origin cotton is made from the hairs of
the seed of the cotton plant1 linen is made of the inner fibre of
the bark of the flax plant it has been cultivated from the earliest
historical times
footnote 1 reader in botany ii the cotton plant
3 purification of the airthe following questions and experiments are
intended to show the pupils first that we live in an atmosphere the
presence of which is necessary to support life and combustion 1 and 2
secondly that this atmosphere is deprived of its power to support life
and combustion by the actions of combustion 2 and of respiration 3
thirdly that this power is restored to the air by the action of plants
4
we have the air about us everywhere a socalled empty vessel is one
where the contents are invisible the following experiment is a good
illustration of this
1 wrap the throat of a glass funnel with moistened cloth or paper so
that it will fit tightly into the neck of a bottle and fill the funnel
with water if the space between the funnel and the bottle is airtight
the water will not flow into the bottle
illustration fig 1
do not explain this in advance to the pupils ask them what prevents
the water from flowing into the bottle if they are puzzled loosen the
funnel and show them that the water will now flow in in the first case
as the air could not escape the water could not flow in in the second
the air was displaced by the heavier water
ask the pupils why the air in a crowded room becomes so difficult to
breathe could a person live if he were shut up in an airtight room for a
long time fresh air is necessary to life the teacher may explain that it
is the oxygen in the air that supports life air is composed onefifth of
this gas and fourfifths of nitrogen the gases are mixed and the nitrogen
simply dilutes the oxygen as it were
fresh air is necessary to support combustion as well as life ask them why
we put out a fire by throwing a blanket or a rug over it the following
experiment illustrates this
2 take a small widemouthed bottle covered with a card or cork to
this cover fasten a piece of bent wire with a taper on the end light the
taper and lower it into the jar it will burn a few seconds and then go
out raise and light it again and it will be extinguished as soon as it
is plunged into the bottle this shows that the oxygen of the air is used
up by burning substances as it is by breathing animals
illustration fig 2
the following experiment shows that fire will not burn in an atmosphere of
gas from our lungs
3 fill a bottle with gas by breathing into it through a bit of glass
tubing passed through a card or cork and reaching to the bottom of the
bottle the bottle will be dimmed with moisture showing the presence of
aqueous vapor a lighted match plunged into the bottle will be immediately
extinguished a better way which however takes some skill in
manipulation is to fill the bottle with water cover it with a flat piece
of glass and invert the bottle in a dish of water taking care that no
air bubbles enter then through a bit of glass tubing blow into the
bottle till the water is expelled cover the mouth with the glass under
water and holding it tightly down invert the bottle quickly set it
down light a match take away the glass and at the same instant plunge
in the match if no air has been allowed to enter the match will go out
at once no animal could live in an atmosphere which could not support
combustion
from these experiments the pupils have seen that the lifesustaining
quality of the air is used up by combustion and respiration to bring in
the subject of purification by plants ask them why all the oxygen in
the world is not exhausted by the people and the fires in it after the
subject has been explained the following experiment can be prepared and
put aside till the next lesson
4 fill two bottles with air from the lungs as in 3 having previously
introduced a cutting from a plant into one of the bottles allow them to
stand in the sun for a day or two then test both bottles with a burning
match if properly done the result will be very striking the end of
the cutting should be in the water of the dish this experiment will not
succeed excepting with bottles such as are used for chemicals which have
their mouths carefully ground common bottles allow the air to enter
between the bottle and the glass1
footnote 1 see note on page 13
illustration fig 3
4 fuellight a match and allow it to burn until half charred blow it
out gently so as to leave a glowing spark when this spark goes out it
will leave behind a light gray ash we have to consider the flame the
charred substance and the ash
flame is burning gas in all ordinary fuels carbon and hydrogen in
various combinations and free make the principal part the first effect
of the heat is to set free the volatile compounds of carbon and hydrogen
the hydrogen then begins to unite with the oxygen of the air forming
water setting free the carbon which also unites with oxygen forming
carbonic acid gas the burning gases cause the flame the following
experiment will illustrate this
illustration fig 4
5 fit a testtube with a tight cork through which a bit of glass
tubing drawn out into a jet is passed the tubing within being even with
the cork place some bits of shaving in the tube cork it and make the
cork perfectly airtight by coating it with bees wax or paraffine heat
the testtube gently over an alcohol lamp the wood turns black and vapor
issues from the jet which may be lighted fig 4 care should be taken
to expel all the air before lighting
6 that the burning hydrogen forms water by uniting with the oxygen of
the air may be shown by holding a cold glass tumbler over the jet or
over any flame the glass will be dimmed by drops of moisture
the charred part of the wood is charcoal which is one form of carbon
our ordinary charcoal is made by driving off all the gases from wood by
burning it under cover where only a little air can reach it the volatile
gases burn more readily than the carbon and are the first substances to
be driven off so that the carbon is left behind nearly pure in the same
way we have driven off all the gases from the halfburned match and left
the carbon the teacher should have a piece of charcoal to show the
pupils it still retains all the markings of the wood
if the combustion is continued the carbon also unites with the oxygen of
the air till it is all converted into carbonic acid gas this was the
case with the match where we left the glowing spark the gray ash that was
left behind is the mineral matter contained in the wood
7 we can show that this gas is formed by pouring lime water into a
bottle in which a candle has been burned as in 2 the water becomes
milky from a fine white powder formed by the union of the carbonic acid
gas with the lime forming carbonate of lime this is a chemical test
the wood of the match is plainly of vegetable origin so also is the
charcoal which is nearly pure carbon coal is also carbon the remains of
ancient forests from which the gases have been slowly driven off by heat
and pressure all the common fuels are composed principally of carbon and
hydrogen when these elements unite with oxygen carbonic acid gas and
water are formed1
footnote 1 transcribers note this note is missing from original
text
8 the same products are formed by respiration we breathe out carbonic
acid gas and water from our lungs breathe on a cold glass it is bedewed
exactly as it is by the candle flame breathe through a bit of glass
tubing into a bottle of lime water it becomes milky showing the presence
of carbonic acid gas why is this
every act or thought is accompanied by a consumption of material in the
body which thus becomes unfit for further use these waste substances
composed chiefly of carbon and hydrogen unite with oxygen breathed in
from the air forming carbonic acid gas and water which are breathed
out of the system the action is a process of slow combustion and it is
principally by the heat thus evolved that the body is kept warm as we are
thus constantly taking oxygen from the air a close room becomes unfit to
live in and a supply of fresh air is indispensable the cycle of changes
is completed by the action of plants which take in carbonic acid gas use
the carbon and return most of the oxygen to the atmosphere

seedlings
1 directions for raising in the schoolroomthe seeds should be
planted in boxes tilled with clean sand plates or shallow crockery pans
are also used but the sand is apt to become caked and the pupils are
likely to keep the seeds too wet if they are planted in vessels that
will not drain the boxes should be covered with panes of glass till the
seedlings are well started and should be kept at a temperature of from
65 to 70 fahr it is very important to keep them covered while the seeds
are germinating otherwise the sand will be certain to become too dry if
kept in a sufficiently warm place light is not necessary and in winter
time the neighborhood of the furnace is often a very convenient place
to keep them safe from frost they should not be in the sun while
germinating when the first sprouts appear above the ground let another
set be planted and so on till a series is obtained ranging from plants
several inches high to those just starting from the seed the seeds
themselves should be soaked for a day and the series is then ready
for study the time required for their growth varies according to the
temperature moisture etc dr goodale says they should be ready in ten
days1
footnote 1 concerning a few common plants by gl goodale boston dc
heath  co this little book which is published in pamphlet form for
fifteen cents will be found exceedingly useful
i have never been able to raise them so quickly in the schoolroom nor
have the pupils to whom i have given them to plant done so at home
generally it is three weeks at least before the first specimens are as
large as is desirable
germinating seeds need warmth moisture and air the necessary conditions
are supplied in the very best way by growing them on sponge but it would
be difficult to raise enough for a large class in this manner place a
piece of moist sponge in a jellyglass or any glass that is larger at the
top so that the sponge may not sink to the bottom and pour some water
into the glass but not so much as to touch the sponge the whole should
be covered with a larger inverted glass which must not be so close as
to prevent a circulation of air the plants can thus be watched at every
stage and some should always be grown in this way the water in the
tumbler will keep the sponge damp and the roots after emerging from
the sponge will grow well in the moist air seeds can also be grown on
blotting paper put the seeds on several thicknesses of moist blotting
paper on a plate cover them with more moist paper and invert another
plate over them taking care to allow the free entrance of air
if possible it is by far the best way to have the seeds growing in the
schoolroom and make it a regular custom for the pupils to observe them
every morning and take notes of their growth
these lessons on seeds are suitable for pupils of every age from adults
to the youngest children who go to school the difference should be only
in the mode of treatment but the same principles should be brought out
whatever the age and power of comprehension of the pupil
for these lessons the following seeds should be planted according to the
above directions
morningglory sunflower or squash bean pea red clover flax corn
wheat and oats1 if they can be procured plant also acorns pineseeds
mapleseeds and horsechestnuts
footnote 1 a package of these seeds may be obtained for fifty cents
from joseph breck  son boston mass they will be sent by mail postage
paid
2 study of morningglory sunflower bean and peafor reasons
hereafter given i consider the morningglory the best seedling to begin
upon having a series as above described before them the pupils should
draw the seedlings when the drawings are made let them letter alike the
corresponding parts beginning with the plantlet in the seed and using
new letters when a new part is developed the seed coats need not be
lettered as they do not belong to the plantlet
illustration fig 5germination of morning glory a caulicle b
cotyledons c plumule d roots
illustration fig 6germination of sunflower
after drawing the morningglory series let them draw the sunflower or
squash in the same way then the bean and finally the pea let them write
answers to the following questions
morningglory1
footnote 1 it has been objected that the morningglory seed is too small
to begin upon if the teacher prefer he may begin with the squash bean
and pea the questions will require but little alteration and he can take
up the morningglory later
tell the parts of the morningglory seed
what part grows first
what becomes of the seedcovering
what appears between the first pair of leaves
was this to be seen in the seed
how many leaves are there at each joint of stem after the first pair
how do they differ from the first pair
sunflower or squash
what are the parts of the seed
what is there in the morningglory seed that this has not
how do the first leaves change as the seedling grows
bean
what are the parts of the seed
how does this differ from the morningglory seed
how from the sunflower seed
how do the first pair of leaves of the bean change as they grow
how many leaves are there at each joint of stem1
footnote 1 there are two simple leaves at the next node to the
cotyledons after these there is one compound leaf at each node
how do they differ from the first pair
pea
what are the parts of the seed compare it with the morningglory
sunflower and bean
how does it differ in its growth from the bean
what have all these four seeds in common
illustration fig 7germination of pea a caulicle b
cotyledons c plumule d roots
illustration fig 8germination of bean
what has the morningglory seed that the others have not
what have the bean and pea that the morningglory has not
how does the pea differ from all the others in its growth
what part grows first in all these seeds
from which part do the roots grow
what peculiarity do you notice in the way they come up out of the
ground1
footnote 1 this question refers to the arched form in which they come
up in this way the tender growing apex is not rubbed
the teacher must remember that unless the pupils have had some previous
training they will first have to learn to use their eyes and for this
they will need much judicious help they should be assisted to see what is
before them not told what is there it is absolutely necessary that these
questions should be thoroughly understood and correctly answered before
any conclusions are drawn from them for this purpose abundant material is
indispensable it is better not to attempt these lessons on seeds at
all unless there is material enough for personal observation by all the
pupils
after this preliminary work has been done the names of the parts can
be given to the pupils they may be written under each drawing
thusacaulicle1 bcotyledons croots dplumule the whole plantlet
in the seed is the embryo or germ whence the sprouting of seeds is
called germination
footnote 1 the term radicle is still in general use the derivation
little root makes it undesirable dr gray has adopted caulicle little
stem in the latest edition of his textbook which i have followed other
writers use the term hypocotyl meaning under the cotyledons
i consider this the best order to study the seeds because in the
morningglory the cotyledons are plainly leaves in the seed and in the
squash or sunflower2 the whole process is plainly to be seen whereby
a thick body most unlike a leaf becomes an ordinary green leaf with
veins3 in the sunflower the true leaves are nearly the same shape as
the cotyledons so that this is an especially good illustration for the
purpose thus without any hint from me my pupils often write of the
bean it has two thick leaves and two thin leaves in this way the bean
and pea present no difficulty the cotyledons in the first make apparently
an unsuccessful effort to become leaves which the second give up
altogether
footnote 2 the large russian sunflower is the best for the purpose
footnote 3 these lessons are intended as has been said for children
over twelve years of age if they are adapted for younger ones it is
especially important to begin with a seed where the leaflike character
of the cotyledons is evident or becomes so maple is excellent for the
purpose morningglory is too small squash will answer very well i think
it characteristic of the minds of little children to associate a term with
the first specimen to which it is applied if the term cotyledon be given
them first for those of the bean and pea they will say when they come to
the morningglory but those are leaves not cotyledons cotyledons are
large and round it will be very difficult to make them understand that
cotyledons are the first seedleaves and they will feel as if it were a
forced connection and one that they cannot see for themselves
the teachers object now is to make the pupils understand the meaning of
the answers they have given to these questions in the first place they
should go over their answers and substitute the botanical terms they have
just learned for the ones they have used
comparison of the parts of the soaked seeds
morningglory a seed covering some albumen two cotyledons a
caulicle
sunflower an outer covering1 an inner covering two cotyledons a
caulicle2
footnote 1 the socalled seed of sunflower is really a fruit the outer
covering is the wall of the ovary the inner the seedcoat such closed
oneseeded fruits are called akenes
footnote 2 the plumule is sometimes visible in the embryo of the
sunflower
bean a seed covering two cotyledons a caulicle a plumule
pea the same as the bean
they have also learned how the first leaves in the last three differ from
those of the morningglory being considerably thicker in the sunflower
and very much thicker in the bean and pea why should the morningglory
have this jelly that the others have not why do the first leaves of the
sunflower change so much as the seedling grows what becomes of their
substance why do those of the bean shrivel and finally drop off by this
time some bright pupil will have discovered that the babyplant needs food
and that this is stored around it in the morningglory and in the leaves
themselves in the others it is nourished upon this prepared food until
it has roots and leaves and can make its own living the food of the
morningglory is called albumen it does not differ from the others in
kind but only in its manner of storage1
footnote 1 reader in botany iii seedfood
also the questions have brought out the fact that the bean and pea
have the plumule ready formed in the seed while the morningglory and
sunflower have not why should this be it is because there is so much
food stored in the first two that the plumule can develop before a root is
formed while in the others there is only nourishment sufficient to enable
the plantlet to form its roots these must make the second leaves by their
own labor
3 comparison with other dicotyledonsthe pupils should now have other
seeds to compare with these four let them arrange flax four oclock
horsechestnut almond nasturtium mapleseeds etc under two heads
seeds with the food stored               seeds with the food stored
outside the plantlet                      in the embryo itself
albuminous                            exalbuminous
flax fouroclock                       acorn horsechestnut almond
morningglory                            maple sunflower squash
                                          bean pea nasturtium
they may also be divided into those with and without the plumule
without plumule                        with plumule
flax maple sunflower                   acorn horsechestnut
fouroclock                             almond bean pea
morningglory                            squash nasturtium
those with plumules will be seen to have the most abundant nourishment in
many cases this is made use of by man
these last can be again divided into those in which the cotyledons come up
into the air and those where they remain in the ground
in the air                             in the ground
bean almond squash                     acorn horsechestnut
                                          pea nasturtium
in the latter the cotyledons are so heavily gorged with nourishment that
they never become of any use as leaves as darwin points out they have
a better chance of escaping destruction by animals by remaining in the
ground
the cotyledons are very good illustrations of the different uses to which
a single organ may be put and the thorough understanding of it will
prepare the pupils minds for other metamorphoses and for the theory that
all the various parts of a plant are modified forms of a very few members
4 nature of the caulicleprobably some of the pupils will have called
the caulicle the root it is however of the nature of stem the root
grows only at the end from a point just behind the tip the stem
elongates throughout its whole length this can be shown by marking the
stem and roots of a young seedling with ink india ink must be used as
common ink injures the plants dip a needle in the ink and prick a row
of spots at equal distances on a young root corn is very good for this
purpose but morningglory or bean is better for experiments on the
stem the plants should then be carefully watched and the changes in
the relative distance of the spots noted the experiment is very easily
conducted with the seedlings growing on sponge with their roots in the
moist air of the tumbler as before described
dr goodale says of this experimentlet a young seedling of corn be
grown on damp paper in the manner described in no 11 and when the
longest root is a few centimetres long let it be marked very carefully by
means of india ink or purple ink put on with a delicate camelshair
pencil just one centimetre apart plants thus marked are to be kept under
favorable conditions with respect to moisture and warmth so that growth
will be as rapid as possible the marks on the older part of the root
will not change their relative distance but the mark at the tip will be
carried away from the one next it showing that the growth has taken place
only at this point such experiments as the one described are perfectly
practicable for all classes of pupils except the very youngest how far
the details of these experiments should be suggested to the pupils or
rather how far they should be left to work out the problem for themselves
is a question to be settled by the teacher in each case the better plan
generally is to bring the problem in a very clear form before the whole
class or before the whole school and ask whether anybody can think of a
way in which it can be solved for instance in this case how can it be
found out whether roots grow only at their tip or throughout their whole
length if the way is thought out by even a single pupil the rest will be
interested in seeing whether the plan will work successfully
footnote 1 concerning a few common plants page 25
i have been more successful in pricking the roots than in marking them
with a brush
the caulicle can be proved by the manner of its growth to be of the nature
of stem not root the main root grows from its naked end roots can also
grow from the sides of the caulicle as in indian corn in this it acts
precisely as does the stem of a cutting it can be prettily shown with the
seedlings by breaking off a bean at the ground and putting the slip in
water it will throw out roots and the pupil will readily understand that
the caulicle does the same thing
darwin has made very interesting experiments on the movements of
seedlings if the teacher wishes to repeat some of the experiments he will
find the details very fully given in the power of movement of plants1
the pupils can observe in their growing seedlings some of the points
mentioned and have already noticed a few in their answers they have said
that the caulicle was the part to grow first and have spoken of the
arched form of the young stem their attention should also be drawn to the
roothairs which are well seen in corn wheat and oats they absorb the
liquid food of the plants a secondary office is to hold the seed firmly
so that the caulicle can enter the ground this is shown in red clover
which may be sown on the surface of the ground it puts out roothairs
which attach themselves to the particles of sand and hold the seed these
hairs are treated more fully in the lessons on roots

5 leaves of seedlingscoming now to the question as to the number of
leaves at each joint of the stem the morningglory sunflower and bean
will present no difficulty but probably all the pupils will be puzzled by
the pea the stipules so large and leaflike look like two leaves
with a stem between bearing other opposite leaves and terminating in a
tendril while in the upper part it could not be told by a beginner which
was the continuation of the main stem for these reasons i left this out
in the questions on the pea but it should be taken up in the class how
are we to tell what constitutes a single leaf the answer to this question
is that buds come in the axils of single leaves that is in the inner
angle which the leaf makes with the stem if no bud can be seen in the
pea the experiment may be tried of cutting off the top of the seedling
plant buds will be developed in the axils of the nearest leaves and it
will be shown that each is a compound leaf with two appendages at its
base called stipules and with a tendril at its apex buds can be forced
in the same way to grow from the axils of the lower scales and even from
those of the cotyledons and the lesson may be again impressed that organs
are capable of undergoing great modifications the teacher may use his own
judgment as to whether he will tell them that the tendril is a modified
leaflet

while to attempt to make the pupils see the embryo in wheat and oats but
the embryo of indian corn is larger and can be easily examined after long
soaking removing the seedcovering we find the greater part of the seed
to be albumen closely applied to one side of this so closely that it
is difficult to separate it perfectly is the single cotyledon this
completely surrounds the plumule and furnishes it with food from the
albumen there is a line down the middle and if we carefully bend back
the edges of the cotyledon it splits along this line showing the
plumule and caulicle within the plumule consists of successive layers of
rudimentary leaves the outer enclosing the rest fig 10 1 c the
latter is the first leaf and remains undeveloped as a scaly sheath fig
10 2 c in wheat and oats the cotyledon can be easily seen in the
largest seedlings by pulling off the dry husk of the grain the food will
he seen to have been used up

the series of corn seedlings at least should be drawn as before and
the parts marked this time with their technical terms the following
questions should then be prepared
corn
what are the parts of the seed
compare these parts with the morningglory sunflower bean and pea
where is the food stored
how many cotyledons have corn wheat and oats
how many have bean pea morningglory and sunflower
compare the veins of the leaves of each class and see what difference you
can find
this will bring up the terms dicotyledon and monocotyledon di means
two mono means one this difference in the veins netted in the first
class parallel in the second is characteristic of the classes pupils
should have specimens of leaves to classify under these two heads
flowering plants are divided first into these two classes the
dicotyledons and the monocotyledons
if pineseeds can be planted the polycotyledonous embryo can also be
studied
7 food of seedlingsthe food of the wheat seedling may be shown in
fine flour 1the flour is to be moistened in the hand and kneaded until
it becomes a homogeneous mass upon this mass pour some pure water and
wash out all the white powder until nothing is left except a viscid lump
of gluten this is the part of the crushed wheatgrains which very closely
resembles in its composition the flesh of animals the white powder washed
away is nearly pure wheatstarch of course the other ingredients such as
the mineral matter and the like might be referred to but the starch at
least should be shown when the seed is placed in proper soil or upon a
support where it can receive moisture and can get at the air and still be
warm enough a part of the starch changes into a sort of gum like that on
postage stamps and finally becomes a kind of sugar upon this sirup the
young seedling feeds until it has some good green leaves for work and as
we have seen in the case of some plants it has these very early
footnote 1 concerning a few common plants page 18
the presence of starch can be shown by testing with a solution of iodine
starch is turned blue by iodine and may thus be detected in flour in
seeds in potatoes etc
after all this careful experimental work the subject may be studied in the
textbook and recited the recitation constituting a thorough review of
the whole
a charming description of the germination of a seed will be found in the
reader v the birth of picciola

roots
this subject can be treated more conveniently while the young seedlings
are still growing because their roots are very suitable for study it
seems best therefore to take it up before examining the buds
1 study of the roots of seedlingsone or two of the seedlings should
be broken off and the slips put into a glass of water they will be
studied later bean and sunflower are the best for the purpose
begin by telling the pupils to prepare for their first lesson a
description of the roots of their seedlings those grown on sponge or
paper will show the development of the roothairs while those grown on
sand are better for studying the form of the root give them also some
fleshy root to describe as a carrot or a radish and a spray of english
ivy as an example of arial roots
throughout these lessons the method is pursued of giving pupils specimens
to observe and describe before teaching them botanical terms it is better
for them to name the things they see than to find examples for terms
already learned in the first case they feel the difficulty of expressing
themselves and are glad to have the want of exact terms supplied this
method is discouraging at first especially to the younger ones but
with time and patience they will gradually become accustomed to describe
whatever they can see they have at any rate used their eyes and
though they may not understand the real meaning of anything they have
seen they are prepared to discuss the subject intelligently when they
come together in the class if they will first write out their unassisted
impressions and subsequently an account of the same thing after they
have had a recitation upon it they will be sure to gain something in the
power of observation and clear expression it cannot be too strongly
urged that the number of facts that the children may learn is not of the
slightest consequence but that the teacher should aim to cultivate the
quick eye the ready hand and the clear reason
the root of the morningglory is primary it is a direct downward growth
from the tip of the caulicle it is about as thick as the stem tapers
towards the end and has short and fibrous branches in some plants the
root keeps on growing and makes a taproot in the bean it soon becomes
lost in the branches these are all simple that is there is but one
primary root sometimes there are several or many and the root is then
said to be multiple the pumpkin is an example of this the root of
the pea is described in the older editions of grays lessons as being
multiple but it is generally simple indian corn also usually starts
with a single root but this does not make a taproot and is soon
followed by many others from any part of the caulicle or even from the
stem above giving it the appearance of having a multiple root
the root of the radish is different from any of these it is fleshy
often it tapers suddenly at the bottom into a root like that of
the morningglory with some fibres upon it it is in fact as the
morningglory would be if the main root were to be thickened up by
food being stored in it it is a primary taproot the radish is
spindleshaped tapering at top and bottom the carrot is conical the
turnip is called napiform some radishes are shaped like the turnip
the arial roots of the english ivy answer another purpose than that of
giving nourishment to the plant they are used to support it in climbing
these are an example of secondary roots which are roots springing
laterally from any part of the stem the sweet potato has both fleshy and
fibrous roots and forms secondary roots of both kinds every year1 some
of the seedlings will probably show the roothairs to the naked eye these
will be noticed hereafter

it is my experience that pupils always like classifying things under
different heads and it is a good exercise the following table may be
made of the roots they have studied adding other examples dr gray says
that ordinary roots may be roughly classed into fibrous and fleshy1
thom classes them as woody and fleshy2

footnote 3 the irish potato will very likely be mentioned as an example
of a fleshy root the teacher can say that this will be explained later
2 fleshy rootsthe scholars are already familiar with the storing
of food for the seedling in or around the cotyledons and will readily
understand that these roots are storehouses of food for the plant the
turnip carrot and beet are biennials that is their growth is
continued through two seasons in the first year they make a vigorous
growth of leaves alone and the surplus food is carried to the root in the
form of a syrup and there stored having been changed into starch or
something very similar at the end of the first season the root is filled
with food prepared for the next year so that the plant can live on its
reserve fund and devote its whole attention to flowering these roots
are often good food for animals there are some plants that store their
surplus food in their roots year after year using up in each season the
store of the former one and forming new roots continually the sweet
potato is an example of this class these are perennials the food in
perennials however is usually stored in stems rather than in roots as
in trees annuals are generally fibrousrooted and the plant dies after
its first year the following experiment will serve as an illustration of
the way in which the food stored in fleshy roots is utilized for growth
cut off the tapering end of a carrot and scoop out the inside of the
larger half in the form of a vase leaving about half of the flesh behind
put strings through the upper rim fill the carrot cup with water and
hang it up in a sunny window keep it constantly full of water the
leafbuds below will put forth and grow into leafy shoots which turning
upwards soon hide the vase in a green circle this is because the dry
starchy food stored in the carrot becomes soft and soluble and the supply
of proper food and the warmth of the room make the leafbuds able to grow
it is also a pretty illustration of the way in which stems always grow
upward even though there is enough light and air for them to grow
straight downwards why this is so we do not know
3 differences between the stem and the rootask the pupils to tell
what differences they have found
stems                           roots
ascend into the air               descend into the ground
grow by a succession of similar    grow only from a point
  parts each part when young        just behind the tip
  elongating throughout
bear organs                       bear no organs
there are certain exceptions to the statement that roots descend into the
ground such as arial roots and parasitic roots the arial roots of the
ivy have been mentioned other examples of roots used for climbing are
the trumpet creeper tecoma radicans and the poison ivy rhus
toxicodendron parasitic roots take their food readymade from the
plants into which they strike the roots of airplants such as certain
orchids draw their nourishment from the air
the experiment of marking roots and stem has been already tried but it
should be repeated repetition of experiments is always desirable as it
fixes his conclusions in the pupils mind the stem grows by a succession
of similar parts phytomera each part or phyton consisting of node
internode and leaf thus it follows that stems must bear leaves the
marked stems of seedlings show greater growth towards the top of the
growing phyton it is only young stems that elongate throughout the older
parts of a phyton grow little and when the internode has attained a
certain length variable for different stems and different conditions it
does not elongate at all
the root on the contrary grows only from a point just behind the tip
the extreme tip consists of a sort of cap of hard tissue called the
rootcap through a simple lens or sometimes with the naked eye it can
be distinguished in most of the roots of the seedlings looking like a
transparent tip the root whatever its origin in any case may be grows
in length only in one way namely at a point just behind its very
tip this growing point is usually protected by a peculiar cap which
insinuates its way through the crevices of the soil if roots should grow
as stems escaping from the budstate dothat is throughout their whole
lengththey would speedily become distorted but since they grow at the
protected tips they can make their way through the interstices of soil
which from its compactness would otherwise forbid their progress1
footnote 1 concerning a few common plants p 25
the third difference is that while the stem bears leaves and has buds
normally developed in their axils roots bear no organs the stem
however especially when wounded may produce buds anywhere from the
surface of the bark and these buds are called adventitious buds in the
same manner roots occasionally produce buds which grow up into leafy
shoots as in the apple and poplar1
footnote 1 see grays structural botany p 29
it should be made perfectly clear that the stem is the axis of the plant
that is it bears all the other organs roots grow from stems not steins
from roots except in certain cases like that of the poplar mentioned
above this was seen in the study of the seedling the embryo consisted of
stem and leaves and the roots were produced from the stem as the seedling
grew
for illustration of this point the careful watching of the cuttings
placed in water will be very instructive after a few days small hard
lumps begin to appear under the skin of the stem of the broken seedling
bean these gradually increase in size until finally they rupture the
skin and appear as rootlets roots are always thus formed under the outer
tissues of the stem from which they spring or the root from which they
branch in the bean the roots are in four long rows quartering the stem
this is because they are formed in front of the woody bundles of the stem
which in the seedling bean are four in the sunflower the roots divide the
circumference into six parts in some of my cuttings of beans the stem
cracked in four long lines before the roots had really formed showing the
parenchyma in small hillocks so to speak in these the gradual formation
of the rootcap could be watched throughout with merely a small lens i
do not know a better way to impress the nature of the root on the pupils
mind these forming roots might also be marked very early and so be shown
to carry onward their rootcap on the growingpoint
4 roothairs these are outgrowths of the epidermis or skin of the
root and increase its absorbing power in most plants they cannot be seen
without the aid of a microscope indian corn and oats however show them
very beautifully and the scholars have already noticed them in their
seedlings they are best seen in the seedlings grown on damp sponge in
those grown in sand they become so firmly united to the particles of
soil that they cannot be separated without tearing the hairs away from
the plant this will suggest the reason why plants suffer so much from
careless transplanting
the roothairs have the power of dissolving mineral matters in the soil
by the action of an acid which they give out they then absorb these
solutions for the nourishment of the plant the acid given out was first
thought to be carbonic acid but now it is supposed by some experimenters
to be acetic acid by others to vary according to the plant and the time
the action can be shown by the following experiment suggested by sachs
illustration fig 12 i seedling of sinapis alba showing roothairs
ii same showing how fine particles of sand cling to the roothairs
sachs
cover a piece of polished marble with moist sawdust and plant some seeds
upon it when the seedlings are somewhat grown remove the sawdust and
the rootlets will be found to have left their autographs behind wherever
the roots with their roothairs have crept they have eaten into the
marble and left it corroded the marks will become more distinct if the
marble is rubbed with a little vermilion
in order that the processes of solution and absorption may take place it
is necessary that free oxygen should be present all living things must
have oxygen to breathe and this gas is as needful for the germination of
seeds and the action of roots and leaves as it is for our maintenance of
life it is hurtful for plants to be kept with too much water about their
roots because this keeps out the air this is the reason why houseplants
are injured if they are kept too wet
a secondary office of roothairs is to aid the roots of seedlings to enter
the ground as we have before noticed
the roothairs are found only on the young parts of roots as a root grows
older the roothairs die and it becomes of no further use for absorption
but it is needed now for another purpose as the support of the growing
plant in trees the old roots grow from year to year like stems and
become large and strong the extent of the roots corresponds in a general
way to that of the branches and as the absorbing parts are the young
rootlets the rain that drops from the leafy roof falls just where it is
needed by the delicate fibrils in the earth below1
footnote 1 reader in botany vi the relative positions of leaves and
rootlets
5 comparison of a carrot an onion and a potatoit is a good
exercise for a class to take a potato an onion and a carrot or radish to
compare writing out the result of their observations
the carrot is a fleshy root as we have already seen the onion consists
of the fleshy bases of last years leaves sheathed by the dried remains
of the leaves of former years from which all nourishment has been drawn
the parallel veining of the leaves is distinctly marked the stem is a
plate at the base to which these fleshy scales are attached in the
centre or in the axils of the scales the newlyforming bulbs can be
seen in onions that are sprouting if possible compare other bulbs as
those of tulip hyacinth or snowdrop and the bulb of a crocus in which
the fleshy part consists of the thickened base of the stem and the leaves
are merely dry scales this is called a corm
the potato is a thickened stem it shows itself to be a stem because it
bears organs the leaves are reduced to little scales eyelids in the
axils of which come the buds eyes the following delightful experiment
has been recommended to me
in a growing potato plant direct upwards one of the low shoots and
surround it with a little cylinder of stiff carpet paper stuffed with
sphagnum and loam cut away the other tuberdisposed shoots as they
appear the enclosed shoot develops into a tuber which stands more or less
vertical and the scales become pretty little leaves removing the paper
the tuber and leaves become green and the latter enlarge a little a
better illustration of the way in which organs adapt themselves to their
conditions and of the meaning of morphology could hardly be found

buds and branches
1 there is an astonishing amount to be learned from naked branches
and if pursued in the right way the study will be found exceedingly
interesting professor beal in his pamphlet on the new botany1 says
before the first lesson each pupil is furnished or told where to procure
some specimen for study if it is winter and flowers or growing plants
cannot be had give each a branch of a tree or shrub this branch may be
two feet long the examination of these is made during the usual time for
preparing lessons and not while the class is before the teacher for the
first recitation each is to tell what he has discovered the specimens are
not in sight during the recitation in learning the lesson books are not
used for if they are used no books will contain a quarter of what the
pupil may see for himself if there is time each member of the class is
allowed a chance to mention anything not named by any of the rest the
teacher may suggest a few other points for study the pupils are not told
what they can see for themselves an effort is made to keep them working
after something which they have not yet discovered if two members
disagree on any point on the next day after further study they are
requested to bring in all the proofs they can to sustain their different
conclusions for a second lesson the students review the first lesson
and report on a branch of a tree of another species which they have
studied as before now they notice any point of difference or of
similarity in like manner new branches are studied and new comparisons
made for this purpose naked branches of our species of elms maples
ashes oaks basswood beech poplars willows walnut butternut
hawthorns cherries and in fact any of our native or exotic trees or
shrubs are suitable a comparison of the branches of any of the evergreens
is interesting and profitable discoveries very unexpected are almost
sure to reward a patient study of these objects the teacher must not
think time is wasted no real progress can be made till the pupils begin
to learn to see and to learn to see they must keep trying to form the
habit from the very first and to form the habit they should make the
study of specimens the main feature in the course of training
footnote 1 the new botany by wj beal philadelphia ch marot 814
chestnut st 1882 page 5
horsechestnut sculus hippocastanum
we will begin with the study of a branch of horsechestnut1 the pupils
should examine and describe their specimens before discussing them in the
classroom they will need some directions and hints however to enable
them to work to any advantage tell them to open both large and small
buds it is not advisable to study the horsechestnut bud by cutting
sections as the wool is so dense that the arrangement cannot be seen in
this way the scales should be removed with a knife one by one and the
number texture etc noted the leaves and flowercluster will remain
uncovered and will be easy to examine the gum may be first removed by
pressing the bud in a bit of paper the scholars should study carefully
the markings on the stem in order to explain if possible what has
caused them the best way to make clear the meaning of the scars is to
show them the relation of the bud to the branch they must define a bud
ask them what the bud would have become the next season if it had been
allowed to develop it would have been a branch or a part of one a bud
then is an undeveloped branch they can always work out this definition
for themselves conversely a branch is a developed bud or series of
buds and every mark on the branch must correspond to something in the
bud let them examine the specimens with this idea clearly before their
minds the lesson to prepare should be to write out all they can observe
and to make careful drawings of their specimens ask them to find a way
if possible to tell the age of the branch
footnote 1 the pupils should cut their names on their branches and keep
them they will need them constantly for comparison and reference
at the recitation the papers can be read and the points mentioned
thoroughly discussed this will take two lessonhours probably and the
drawing may be left if desired as the exercise to prepare for the second
recitation
1the buds of horsechestnut contain the plan of the whole growth of the
next season they are scaly and covered especially towards the apex with
a sticky varnish the scales are opposite like the leaves the outer
pairs are wholly brown and leathery the succeeding ones tipped with
brown wherever exposed so that the whole bud is covered with a thick
coat the inner scales are green and delicate and somewhat woolly
especially along the lapping edges there are about seven pairs of
scales the larger terminal buds have a flowercluster in the centre and
generally two pairs of leaves the small buds contain leaves alone two or
three pairs of them the leaves are densely covered with white wool to
protect them from the sudden changes of winter the use of the gum is to
ward off moisture the flowercluster is woolly also
footnote 1 all descriptions are made from specimens examined by me
other specimens may differ in some points plants vary in different
situations and localities
the scars on the stem are of three kinds leaf budscale and
flowercluster scars the pupils should notice that the buds are always
just above the large triangular scars if they are still in doubt as to
the cause of these marks show them some houseplant with welldeveloped
buds in the axils of the leaves and ask them to compare the position of
these buds with their branches the buds that spring from the inner angle
of the leaf with the stem are axillary buds those that crown the stems
are terminal since a bud is an undeveloped branch terminal buds carry
on the axis which they crown axillary buds give rise to sideshoots the
leafscars show the leafarrangement and the number of leaves each year
the leaves are opposite and each pair stands over the intervals of the
pair below the same is observed to be true of the scales and leaves
of the bud1 all these points should be brought out by the actual
observation of the specimens by the pupils with only such hints from the
teacher as may be needed to direct their attention aright the dots on the
leafscar are the ends of woody bundles fibrovascular bundles which in
autumn separated from the leaf by counting these we can tell how many
leaflets there were in the leaf three five seven nine or occasionally
six or eight
footnote 1 budscales are modified leaves and their arrangement is
therefore the same as the leaves this is not mentioned in the study of
the horsechestnut bud because it cannot be proved to the pupils but the
transition is explained in connection with lilac where it may be clearly
seen the scales of the bud of horsechestnut are considered to be
homologous with petioles by analogy with other members of the same
family in the sweet buckeye a series can be made exhibiting the gradual
change from a scale to a compound leaf see the botanical textbook part

3 same more advanced
the bud scalescars these are rings left by the scales of the bud and
may be seen in many branches they are well seen in horsechestnut if the
pupils have failed to observe that these rings show the position of former
buds and mark the growth of successive years this point must be brought
out by skilful questioning there is a difference in the color of the more
recent shoots and a pupil when asked how much of his branch grew the
preceding season will be able to answer by observing the change in color
make him see that this change corresponds with the rings and he will
understand how to tell every years growth then ask what would make the
rings in a branch produced from one of his buds and he can hardly fail to
see that the scales would make them when the scholars understand that the
rings mark the years growth they can count them and ascertain the age
of each branch the same should be done with each sideshoot usually the
numbers will be found to agree that is all the buds will have the
same number of rings between them and the cut end of the branch but
occasionally a bud will remain latent for one or several seasons and then
begin its growth in which case the numbers will not agree the difference
will be the number of years it remained latent there are always many buds
that are not developed the undeveloped buds do not necessarily perish
but are ready to be called into action in case the others are checked
when the stronger buds are destroyed some that would else remain dormant
develop in their stead incited by the abundance of nourishment which the
former would have monopolized in this manner our trees are soon reclothed
with verdure after their tender foliage and branches have been killed by
a late vernal frost or consumed by insects and buds which have remained
latent for several years occasionally shoot forth into branches from the
sides of old stems especially in certain trees1
footnote 1 structural botany p 48
the pupils can measure the distance between each set of rings on the main
stem to see on what years it grew best
the flowercluster scars these are the round somewhat concave scars
found terminating the stem where forking occurs or seemingly in the
axils of branches on account of one of the forking branches growing more
rapidly and stoutly than the other and thus taking the place of the main
stem so that this is apparently continued without interruption if the
pupils have not understood the cause of the flowercluster scars show
them their position in shoots where they are plainly on the summit of the
stem and tell them to compare this with the arrangement of a large
bud the flowercluster terminates the axis in the bud and this scar
terminates a branch when the terminal bud is thus prevented from
continuing its growth the nearest axillary buds are developed1 one
shoot usually gets the start and becomes so much stronger that it throws
the other to one side the tendency of the horsechestnut to have its
growth carried on by the terminal buds is so strong that i almost feel
inclined to say that vigorous branches are never formed from axillary
buds in old trees except where the terminal bud has been prevented from
continuing the branch this tendency gives to the tree its characteristic
size of trunk and branches and lack of delicate spray on looking closely
at the branches also they will be seen to be quite irregular wherever
there has been a flowercluster swerving to one side or the other
footnote 1 the first winter that i examined horsechestnut buds i found
in many cases that the axillary shoots had from a quarter of an inch to
an inch of wood before the first set of rings i could not imagine what
had formed this wood and it remained a complete puzzle to me until the
following spring when i found in the expanding shoots that wherever
a flowercluster was present there were one or two pairs of leaflets
already well developed in the axils and that the next seasons buds were
forming between them while the internodes of these leaflets were making
quite a rapid growth subsequently i found the leaflets also in the buds
themselves i found these leaflets developed on the tree only in the
shoots containing flowerclusters where they would be needed for the
future growth of the branches i suppose the reason must be that the
flowercluster does not use all the nourishment provided and that
therefore the axillary buds are able to develop it would be interesting
to know what determines the stronger growth of the one which eventually
becomes the leader
there is one thing more the pupils may have noticed the small round dots
all over the young stem which become long rifts in the older parts are
breaks in the epidermis or skin of the stem through which the inner
layers of bark protrude they are called lenticels they provide a passage
for gases in and out of the stem in some trees as the birch they are
very noticeable
after discussing the subject thoroughly in the classroom the pupils
should rewrite their papers and finally answer the following questions
as a species of review i have thus spent three recitations on the
horsechestnut the work is all so new and if properly presented
so interesting that a good deal of time is required to exhaust its
possibilities of instruction if the teacher finds his scholars wearying
however he can leave as many of the details as he pleases to be treated
in connection with other branches
questions on the horsechestnut
how many scales are there in the buds you have examined
how are they arranged
how many leaves are there in the buds
how are they arranged
where does the flowercluster come in the bud
do all the buds contain flowerclusters
what is the use of the wool and the gum
where do the buds come on the stem
which are the strongest
how are the leaves arranged on the stem
do the pairs stand directly over each other
what are the dots on the leafscars
how old is your branch
how old is each twig
which years were the best for growth
where were the former flowerclusters
what happens when a branch is stopped in its growth by flowering
what effect does this have on the appearance of the tree
in some parts of the country the horsechestnut is not so commonly planted
as in new england in the southern states the magnolia may be used in its
stead but it is not nearly so simple an example of the main points to be
observed1
footnote 1 reader in botany vii trees in winter

the bud may be examined by removing the scales with a knife as in
horsechestnut and also by cutting sections the outer scales enfold the
whole bud and each succeeding pair cover all within they are joined
and it is frequently difficult to tell where the suture is though it can
generally be traced at the apex of the bud on the back is a thick
stalk which is the base of the leafstalk remove the scales by cutting
carefully through a single pair opposite the leafstalk and peeling
them off the scales are modified stipules instead of leafstalks as in
horsechestnut the outer pair are brown and thick the inner green and
becoming more delicate and crumpled as we proceed toward the centre of the
bud the leaves begin with the second or third pair of scales the first
one or two are imperfect being small brown and dry the leaves grow
larger towards the centre of the bud they are covered with short
silky hairs and are folded lengthwise with the inner surface within
conduplicate in the specimens i have examined i do not see much
difference in size between the buds with flowers and those without in
every bud examined which contained a flower there was an axillary bud in
the axil of the last or next to the last leaf this bud is to continue
the interrupted branch in the same way as in horsechestnut
there are from six to ten good leaves in the buds that i have seen those
without flowers contain more leaves as in horsechestnut in the centre of
these buds the leaves are small and undeveloped the flower is very easy
to examine the floral envelopes stamens and pistils being plainly
discernible the bud may also be studied in crosssection this shows the
whole arrangement the plan is not so simple as in horsechestnut where
the leaves are opposite the subject of leafarrangement should be passed
over until phyllotaxy is taken up
the scars on the stem differ from horsechestnut in having no distinct
bands of rings the scales being stipules leave a line on each side of
the leafscar and these are separated by the growth of the internodes
in the beech the scales are also stipules but whereas in the magnolia
there are only one or two abortive leaves in the beech there are eight or
nine pairs of stipules without any leaves at all the rings thus become
separated in magnolia while in the beech the first internodes are not
developed leaving a distinct band of rings to mark the seasons growth
the magnolia is therefore less desirable to begin upon the branches are
swollen at the beginning of a new growth and have a number of leafscars
crowded closely together the leafscars are roundish the lower line more
curved they have many dots on them from each leafscar runs an irregular
line around the stem this has been left by the stipules
the flowerscar is on the summit of the axis and often apparently in the
axil of a branch as in horsechestnut sometimes the nearest axillary bud
is developed sometimes there are two when the branch forks the axillary
buds seldom grow unless the terminal bud is interrupted the tree
therefore has no fine spray
lilac syringa vulgaris
ask the scholars to write a description of their branches and to compare
them with horsechestnut these papers should be prepared before coming
into the class as before
the buds are foursided the scales and leaves are opposite as in
horsechestnut the outer pair sometimes have buds in their axils remove
the scales one by one with a knife or better with a stout needle the
scales gradually become thinner as we proceed and pass into leaves so
that we cannot tell where the scales end and leaves begin after about six
pairs are removed we come in the larger buds to leaves with axillary
flowerclusters the leaves grow smaller and the flowerclusters
larger till we come to the centre where the axis is terminated by a
flowercluster there is a great difference in the buds on different
bushes and on shoots of the same bush some being large green and easy
to examine others small hard and darkcolored it is better of course
to select as soft and large buds as possible for examination
illustration fig 14lilac i branch in winter state a leafscar
b budscar reduced 2 same less reduced 3 branch with leafbuds
expanded 4 series in a single bud showing the gradual transition from
scales to leaves
that the scales are modified leaves is plainly shown by the gradual
transition they undergo and also by the fact that buds are developed in
their axils if any of these can be shown to the pupils remind them of
the experiment where the top of a seedling pea was cut off and buds forced
to develop in the axils of the lower scales1 the transition from scales
to leaves can be well studied by bringing branches into the house where
they will develop in water and towards spring may even be made to
blossom cherry apple forsythia and other blossoming trees and shrubs
can be thus forced to bloom place the branches in hot water and cut off
a little of their ends under water if the water is changed every day
and the glass kept near the register or stove they will blossom out very
quickly these expanded shoots may be compared with the buds the number
of leaves in the bud varies
footnote 1 see p 31
the leafscars of lilac are horseshoeshaped and somewhat swollen it can
often be plainly seen that the outer tissue of the stem runs up into the
scar it looks as if there were a layer of bark ending with the scar
fastened over each side of the stem these apparent layers alternate as
well as the scars the epidermis or skin of the leaves is in fact always
continuous with that of the stem there are no dots on the leafscars
the rings are not nearly so noticeable as in horsechestnut but they can
be counted for some years back
the flowercluster can often be traced by a dried bit of stem remaining on
the branch
the terminal bud in the lilac does not usually develop and the two
uppermost axillary buds take its place giving to the shrub the forked
character of its branching in all these bud studies the pupil should
finish by showing how the arrangement of the buds determines the growth of
the branches
questions on the lilac
how do the scales differ from those of horsechestnut
how many scales and leaves are there
how are they arranged
where does the flowercluster come in the bud
do all the buds contain flowerclusters
how does the arrangement of leaves and flowerclusters differ from that of
horsechestnut
how old is your branch
which buds develop most frequently
how does this affect the appearance of the shrub
copper beech fagus sylvatica var purpurea
the buds are long and tapering the scales thin and scarious the outer
naked the inner with long silky hairs remove the scales one by one as
in lilac the outer four or six pairs are so minute that the arrangement
is not very clear but as we proceed we perceive that the scales are in
alternate pairs as in horsechestnut that is that two scales are exactly
on the same plane but we have learned in the lilac that the scales are
modified leaves and follow the leafarrangement of the species the
beech is alternateleaved and we should therefore expect the scales to
alternate the explanation is found as we go on removing the scales at
the eighth or ninth pair we come upon a tiny silky leaf directly between
the pair of scales and removing these another larger leaf opposite the
first but higher up on the rudimentary stem and so on with the rest of
the bud there are five or more leaves each placed between a pair of
scales our knowledge of the parts of a leaf shows us at once that the
scales must be modified stipules and that therefore they must be in
pairs1 other examples of scales homologous with stipules are the
american elm tuliptree poplar and magnolia the leaves are plaited
on the veins and covered with long silky hairs the venation is very
distinct the outer leaves are smaller and on examining the branch it
will be seen that their internodes do not make so large a growth as the
leaves in the centre of the bud
footnote 1 see the stipules of the pea p 31
illustration fig 15copper beech 1 branch in winter state a
leafscar b budscar 2 branch with leafbuds expanding showing the
plicate folding of the leaves
the leafscars are small soon becoming merely ridges running half round
the stem
the budrings are very plain and easily counted for this reason and
because it branches freely it is a good tree for measurements of growth
as is seen in the following tables nos 1 2 3 and 4 were made by a
class of girls from fourteen to sixteen from a tree on my lawn no 5
was made by a pupil whom i taught by correspondence from a tree of the
same species in another town no 6 was made by myself from my own tree
the measurements of the first four tables were somewhat revised by me as
they were not perfectly accurate the pupils should always be cautioned
to measure from the beginning of one set of rings to the beginning of the
next1
footnote 1 care must be taken to select branches well exposed to the
light of course there are many circumstances that may aid or hinder the

one question brought up by these measurements is whether there is any
correspondence in growth between the main axis and its branches it
appears in these tables that there is a general correspondence in this
tree at least in the recitation of the class whose tables are given
above nos 1 2 3 and 4 we took all the measurements of these four
branches for the year 1885 and added them we did the same for 1886 and
compared the results the total growth for 1885 was 311516 inches for
1886 leaving out the measurement of the twig whose entire growth was in
that year 10934 inches or nearly 312 times as much the proportion
held in a general way throughout there being only a single case of a
branch where the growth was greater in the first year1 but there is a
point that must not be overlooked in this connection the branches of the
beech seem to grow about equally well in the first second third or any
succeeding year in some trees as the ash the axillary buds make a large
growth and the succeeding terminal buds carry on the branch much more
slowly in other trees as the cherry a branch grows very slowly in the
first few years and then suddenly takes a start these facts would appear
in tables of growth made from branches of these trees but the addition
of results for any particular year would have no significance
footnote 1 the spring of 1880 was a remarkably early one thus i find in
my diary of that year the following entries
april 17 the red maples are in full bloom the elms almost over the
leaves of the horsechestnut are quite large the lilacs are nearly in
leaf april 24 we went up to waverley and found bloodroot up spice bush
out violets dogtooths and anemones also caltha april 28 all the
cherries are in full bloom april 29 picked an apple blossom in bud
beautifully pink
the season was nearly three weeks earlier than usual 1885 on the other
hand was a late spring
in table no 5 the addition of the measurements for 1885 and 1886 shows
the growth in the latter year to be about twice that of the former this
branch came from a tree in another town we have tried also to discover
whether the number of leaves each year has any relation to growth i
cannot see that it has but it requires many experiments to determine
these points to study this make tables of the number of leaves on the
branch each year i think teachers would find it interesting to keep all
data of this kind of work done by their classes with a view to tabulation
and comparison the scholars themselves are exceedingly interested in
anything that partakes of the nature of an original investigation1
footnote 1 the class previously mentioned were much interested in the
addition of their results one of them asked me whether this subject of
measurements had been treated in any book i replied that i had never seen
it mentioned my attention was afterwards called to what may be learned
from a tree by prof harlan couitas d appleton  co new york 1863
i found greatly to my surprise that he had not only given diagrams of
growth but that he also had selected a copper beech as his example
the leafarrangement of the beech is alternate on the onehalf plan the
small twigs turn upwards so that all the spray is on the upper side
giving a flat appearance to the branch1 this gives the leaves a better
exposure to the light both the terminal and axillary buds grow freely
thus forming long straight limbs with many branches and much fine spray
footnote 1 phyllotaxy is treated later by a comparison and study of
many branches but the teacher can draw the pupils attention to the fact
that each beech leaf and twig is on exactly the opposite side of the
branch from the preceding one this allows all the twigs to grow towards
one side of the branch whereas in trees on the twofifths plan as the
apple poplar oak etc no such regularity would be possible on account
of their many different angles with the stem
the bark of the beech is beautifully smooth the extreme straightness of
the trunk and limbs is very striking and may be compared to the crooked
limbs of the horsechestnut where the branch is continually interrupted by
the flowercluster in the beech the flowers are axillary
questions on the beech
how are the scales of the beech bud arranged
how many leaves are there in the bud
how does the arrangement of the scales and leaves in the bud differ from
that of the horsechestnut
how are the leaves folded in the bud
what is the arrangement of the leaves on the stem
how does this differ from horsechestnut and lilac
how old is your branch
how old is each twig
what years were the best for growth
how does the growth of the branches differ from that of horsechestnut
from lilac
explain these differences with reference to the growth and arrangement of
the buds
in what direction do the twigs grow
how does this affect the appearance of the tree
compare the amount of spray of the beech and horsechestnut and explain the
reason of the difference
these questions are only intended for review they are never to be used
for the first study of the specimen
american elm ulmus americana
the buds are covered with brown scales which are hairy on the edges the
flowerbuds are larger than the leafbuds and are in the axils of the
lower leaves of the preceding year each leaf in the bud is enclosed by
a pair of scales they are so small that the pupils unused to delicate
work will hardly discover them under a glass they can be seen to be
ovate folded on the midrib with the inner face within conduplicate
and with an ovate scale joined to the base of the leaf on either side the
scales thus show themselves to be modified stipules the venation of the
leaves is very plain the scales are much larger than the leaves the
flowerbuds contain a cluster of flowers on slender green pedicels the
calyx is bellshaped unequal and lobed the stamens and pistil can
be seen the flowerclusters do not seem to leave any mark which is
distinguishable from the leafscar
illustration fig 16american elm 1 branch in winter state a
leafscars b budscars d leafbuds e flowerbuds 2 branch
with staminate flowerbuds expanding 3 same more advanced 4 branch
with pistillate flowers the leafbud also expanding
the leafscars are small and extend about half around the stem the
arrangement is alternate on the onehalf plan there are three dots on the
scar
the rings are quite plain the tree can be used to make tables of growth
like those of the beech
the buds will probably be too small for examination by the pupils at
present but their position and development can be studied and are very
instructive as the leafbuds are all on the ends of the branchlets the
twigs and branches will be just below the budrings and then there will
be a space where no twigs nor branches will be found till the next set
of rings is reached this gives the branches more room to develop
symmetrically the terminal buds do not develop in the elm in old trees
the bud axillary to the last leaf of the season taking its place and most
of the other axillary buds growing also this makes the tree break out
into very fine spray a tree like the elm where the trunk becomes lost in
the branches is called deliquescent when the trunk is continued to the
top of the tree as in the spruce it is excurrent
the small feathery twigs and branches that are often seen on the trunks
and great limbs of the elm grow from buds which are produced anywhere on
the surface of the wood such buds are called adventitious buds they
often spring from a tree when it is wounded
the american elm is in most parts of the state the most magnificent
tree to be seen from a root which in old trees spreads much above
the surface of the ground the trunk rises to a considerable height in a
single stem here it usually divides into two or three principal branches
which go off by a gradual and easy curve theses stretch upwards and
outwards with an airy sweep become horizontal the extreme half of the
limb pendent forming a light and regular arch this graceful curvature
and absence of all abruptness in the primary limbs and forks and all the
subsequent divisions are entirely characteristic of the tree and enable
an observer to distinguish it in the winter and even by night when
standing in relief against the sky as far as it can be distinctly
seen1
footnote 1 a report on the trees and shrubs growing naturally in the
forests of massachusetts by geo b emerson boston little brown and
co 1875
this book will be found very useful containing careful descriptions of
many trees and shrubs and interesting facts about them
questions on the american elm
how do the flowerbuds differ from the leafbuds in position and
appearance
what is the arrangement of the leaves
what other tree that you have studied has this arrangement
how old is your branch
where would you look to see if the flowercluster had left any mark
why is it that several twigs grow near each other and that then comes a
space without any branches
what buds develop most frequently
how does this affect the appearance of the tree
what is a tree called when the trunk is lost in the branches
balm of gilead populus balsamifera var candicans
the buds are pointed the terminal slightly angled the axillary flattened
against the stem1 some of the axillary buds contain leaves and some
flowers the appearance of the leafbuds and flowerbuds being the same
the scales of the bud are modified stipules the terminal buds have about
three pairs of the outer scales brown and leathery the inner scales as
well as the leaves are coated with resinous matter which has a strong
odor and a nauseous taste the smaller outer scales have no corresponding
leaf and apparently are modified stipules of the leaves of the preceding
year but the larger ones have a leaf to each pair of scales the outer
and inner leaves are small the middle ones larger comparing the branch
it will be seen that these leaves make the largest growth of internode
the leaves are rolled towards the midrib on the upper face involute
there are about ten which are easily seen and counted the inner ones
being very small with minute scales the axillary buds have a short
thick scale on the outer part of the bud then about three pairs of large
scales each succeeding one enwrapping those within the outer one brown
and leathery the scales of the flowerbuds are somewhat gummy but not
nearly so much so as those of the leafbuds within is the catkin each
pistil or stamen they are on separate trees dioecious is in a little
cup and covered by a scale which is cut and fringed
footnote 1 these buds cannot be satisfactorily examined in cross
section on account of the resin the scales must be removed one by one
with a knife with a complete disregard of the effect upon the hands
the leafscars are somewhat threelobed on the young parts with three
dots indicating the fibrovascular bundles which ran up into the leaf
the scars are swollen making the young branches exceedingly rough in
the older parts the scars become less noticeable strong young shoots
especially those which come up from the root are strongly angled
with three ridges running up into each leafscar making them almost
clubshaped there are often from twenty to thirty leaves in one years
growth in such shoots and all the leaves are not rudimentary in the bud
the growth in this case is said to be indefinite usually in trees with
scaly buds the plan of the whole years growth is laid down in the bud
and the term definite is applied branches like the rose that go on
growing all summer grow indefinitely
the budscale scar is quite different from the other trees which we have
examined it is not composed of definite rings but of leafscars with
long ridges running from each side of them showing the scales to be
modified stipules the leafscars have become somewhat separated by the
growth of the internodes in the beech there are eight or more pairs of
scales with no leaves so that the internodes do not develop and a ring
is left on the branch
the flowercluster leaves a concave semicircular scar in the leafaxil

tuliptree liriodendron tulipifera
the buds are small flat and rounded at the apex they are sheathed by
scales each leaf being covered by a pair whose edges cohere the outer
pair are brown and are the stipules of the last leaf of the preceding
year the leaves are conduplicate as in magnolia and have the blade bent
inwards on the petiole inflexed their shape is very clearly to be
seen and no bud is more interesting in the closeness of its packing
axillary buds are often found within the flowers grow high upon the trees
and towards the ends of the branches
the leafscars are round with many dots the scar of the stipules is a
continuous line around the stem as in magnolia
cherry prunus cerasus
the leafbuds are terminal or in the axils of the upper leaves of the
preceding year the flower buds are axillary there is but one bud in each
axil and usually two or three flowers in each bud but the leaves on
the twigs are crowded and the flowers therefore appear in clusters the
blossombuds are larger and more rounded than the leafbuds
the buds of the tree develop very easily in the house and as they are
so small they can be better studied in watching them come out than by
attempting to dissect them unless the scholars are sufficiently advanced
to use the microscope easily it is always bad for a pupil to attempt to
describe what he sees but imperfectly he will be sure to jump at any
conclusions which he thinks ought to be correct
the leafscars are semicircular small and swollen
the budrings are plain the twigs make a very small growth in a season
so that the leafscars and rings make them exceedingly rough
the flowercluster scars are small circles with a dot in the centre in
the leafaxils the flowers come before the leaves
the leafarrangement is alternate on the 25 plan the pupils may compare
the branching with that of their other specimens
red maple acer rubrum
this is a good specimen for the study of accessory buds there is usually
a bud in the axil of each lower scale of the axillary buds making three
side by side we have already noticed this as occurring sometimes in
lilac it is habitually the case with the red maple the middle bud which
is smaller and develops later is a leafbud the others are flowerbuds
the leafscars are small with three dots on each scar the rings are very
plain the flowercluster leaves a round scar in the leafaxil as in
cherry
the leaves are opposite and the tree branches freely the twigs seem to
be found just below the budrings as the upper leafbuds usually develop
best and the lower buds are single containing flowers only
norway spruce picea excelsa
the buds are terminal and axillary from the axils of the leaves of the
preceding year usually from those at the ends of the branchlets they are
covered with brown scales and contain many leaves

flowerbuds
the leaves are needleshaped and short1 they are arranged densely on
the branches alternately on the 821 plan see section on phyllotaxy
when they drop off they leave a hard blunt projection which makes the
stem very rough as the terminal bud always develops unless injured the
tree is excurrent forming a straight trunk throwing out branches on
every side the axillary buds develop near the ends of the branchlets
forming apparent whorls of branches around the trunk in the smaller
branches as the tree grows older the tendency is for only two buds to
develop nearly opposite each other forming a symmetrical branch
footnote 1 the pupils should observe how much more crowded the leaves
are than in the other trees they have studied the leaves being smaller
it is necessary to have more of them largeleaved trees have longer
internodes than those with small leaves
the budscales are persistent on the branches and the growth from year to
year can be traced a long way back
the cones hang on the ends of the upper branches they are much larger
than in our native species of black and white spruce
the evergreens are a very interesting study and an excellent exercise in
morphology for the older scholars
2 vernation this term signifies the disposition of leaves in the bud
either in respect to the way in which each leaf is folded or to the
manner in which the leaves are arranged with reference to each other
the pupils have described the folding of the leaves in some of their
specimens
in the beech the leaf is plicate or plaited on the veins in the elm
magnolia and tuliptree it is conduplicate that is folded on
the midrib with the inner face within in the tuliptree it is also
inflexed the blade bent forwards on the petiole in the balm of gilead
the leaf is involute rolled towards the midrib on the upper face
other kinds of vernation are revolute the opposite of involute where
the leaf is rolled backwards towards the midrib circinate rolled from
the apex downwards as we see in ferns and corrugate when the leaf is
crumpled in the bud
illustration fig 20branch of norway spruce
in all the trees we have studied the leaves simply succeed each other
each leaf or pair of leaves overlapping the next in order the names of
the overlapping of the leaves among themselves imbricated convolute
etc will not be treated here as they are not needed they will come
under stivation the term used to describe the overlapping of the
modified leaves which make up the flower1
footnote 1 reader in botany viii young and old leaves
3 phyllotaxy the subject of leafarrangement is an extremely difficult
one and it is best even with the older pupils to touch it lightly the
point to be especially brought out is the disposition of the leaves so
that each can get the benefit of the light this can be seen in any plant
and there are many ways in which the desired result is brought about the
chief way is the distribution of the leaves about the stem and this is
well studied from the leafscars
the scholars should keep the branches they have studied it is well to
have them marked with the respective names that the teacher may examine
and return them without fear of mistakes
in the various branches that the pupils have studied they have seen that
the arrangement of the leaves differs greatly the arrangement of leaves
is usually classed under three modes the alternate the opposite
and the whorled but the opposite is the simplest form of the whorled
arrangement the leaves being in circles of two in this arrangement the
leaves of each whorl stand over the spaces of the whorl just below the
pupils have observed and noted this in horsechestnut and lilac in these
there are four vertical rows or ranks of leaves in whorls of three leaves
there would be six ranks in whorls of four eight and so on
when the leaves are alternate or single at each node of the stem they
are arranged in many different ways ask the pupils to look at all the
branches with alternate leaves that they have studied and determine in
each case what leaves stand directly over each other that is beginning
with any leaf count the number of leaves passed on the stem till one is
reached that stands directly over the first1 in the beech and the elm
the leaves are on opposite sides of the stem so that the third stands
directly over the first this makes two vertical ranks or rows of
leaves dividing the circle into halves it is therefore called the
12 arrangement another way of expressing it is to say that the angular
divergence between the leaves is 180 or onehalf the circumference
footnote 1 the pupils must be careful not to pass the budrings when
they are counting the leaves
the 13 arrangement with the leaves in three vertical ranks is not very
common it may be seen in sedges in the orangetree and in black alder
ilex verticillata in this arrangement there are three ranks of
leaves and each leaf diverges from the next at an angle of 120 or
onethird of the circumference
by far the commonest arrangement is with the leaves in five vertical
ranks the cherry the poplar the larch the oak and many other trees
exhibit this in this arrangement there are five leaves necessary to
complete the circle we might expect then that each leaf would occupy
onefifth of the circle this would be the case were it not for the fact
that we have to pass twice around the stem in counting them so that each
leaf has twice as much room or twofifths of the circle to itself this
is therefore the 25 arrangement this can be shown by winding a thread
around the stem passing it over each leafscar in the beech we make one
turn of the stem before reaching the third leaf which stands over the
first in the apple the thread will wind twice about the stem before
coming to the sixth leaf which is over the first
another arrangement not very common is found in the magnolia the holly
and the radical leaves of the common plantain and tobacco the thread
makes three turns of the stem before reaching the eighth leaf which stands
over the first this is the 38 arrangement it is well seen in the
marguerite a greenhouse plant which is very easily grown in the house
look now at these fractions 12 13 25 and 38 the numerator of
the third is the sum of the numerators of the first and second its
denominator the sum of the two denominators the same is true of the
fourth fraction and the two immediately preceding it continuing the
series we get the fractions 513 821 1334 these arrangements can
be found in nature in cones the scales of which are modified leaves and
follow the laws of leafarrangement1
footnote 1 see the uses and origin of the arrangement of leaves in
plants by chauncey wright memoirs amer acad ix p 389 this essay
is an abstruse mathematical treatise on the theory of phyllotaxy the
fractions are treated as successive approximations to a theoretical angle
which represents the best possible exposure to air and light
modern authors however do not generally accept this mathematical view of
leafarrangement
1it is to be noted that the distichous or 12 variety gives the maximum
divergence namely 180 and that the tristichous or 13 gives the
least or 120 that the pentastichous or 25 is nearly the mean between
the first two that of the 38 nearly the mean between the two preceding
etc the disadvantage of the tworanked arrangement is that the leaves are
soon superposed and so overshadow each other this is commonly obviated by
the length of the internodes which is apt to be much greater in this
than in the more complex arrangements therefore placing them vertically
further apart or else as in elms beeches and the like the branchlets
take a horizontal position and the petioles a quarter twist which gives
full exposure of the upper face of all the leaves to the light the 13
and 25 with diminished divergence increase the number of ranks the 38
and all beyond with mean divergence of successive leaves effect a more
thorough distribution but with less and less angular distance between the
vertical ranks
footnote 1 grays structural botany chap iv p 126
for directions for finding the arrangement of cones see grays structural
botany chap iv sect 1
the subject appears easy when stated in a textbook but practically it
is often exceedingly difficult to determine the arrangement stems often
twist so as to alter entirely the apparent disposition of the leaves the
general principle however that the leaves are disposed so as to get the
best exposure to air and light is clear this cannot be shown by the study
of the naked branches merely because these do not show the beautiful
result of the distribution1 many house plants can be found which will
afford excellent illustrations fig 21 the marguerite and tobacco both
easily grown in the house are on the 38 plan the latter shows the eight
ranks most plainly in the rosette of its lower leaves the distribution is
often brought about by differences in the lengths of the petioles as in
a horsechestnut branch fig 22 where the lower larger leaves stand
out further from the branch than the upper ones or by a twist in the
petioles so that the upper faces of the leaves are turned up to the
light as in beech fig 23 if it is springtime when the lessons are
given endless adaptations can be found

stems
the stem as the scholars have already learned is the axis of the plant
the leaves are produced at certain definite points called nodes and the
portions of stem between these points are internodes the internode
node and leaf make a single plantpart and the plant is made up of a
succession of such parts
the stem as well as the root and leaves may bear planthairs the
accepted theory of plant structure assumes that these four parts root
stem leaves and planthairs are the only members of a flowering plant
and that all other forms as flowers tendrils etc are modified from
these while this idea is at the foundation of all our teaching causing
us to lead the pupil to recognize as modified leaves the cotyledons of a
seedling and the scales of a bud it is difficult to state it directly
so as to be understood except by mature minds i have been frequently
surprised at the failure of even bright and advanced pupils to grasp this
idea and believe it is better to let them first imbibe it unconsciously
in their study whenever their minds are ready for it it will be readily
understood the chief difficulty is that they imagine that there is a
direct metamorphosis of a leaf to a petal or a stamen
briefly the theory is this the beginnings of leaf petal tendril etc
are the same at an early stage of their growth it is impossible to tell
what they are to become they develop into the organ needed for the
particular work required of them to do the organ that under other
circumstances might develop into a leaf is capable of developing into a
petal a stamen or a pistil according to the requirements of the plant
but no actual metamorphosis takes place sometimes instead of developing
into the form we should normally find the organ develops into another
form as when a petal stands in the place of a stamen or the pistil
reverts to a leafy branch this will be more fully treated under flowers
the study of the different forms in which an organ may appear is the study
of morphology
1 forms of stemsstems may grow in many ways let the pupils compare
the habits of growth of the seedlings they have studied the sunflower and
corn are erect this is the most usual habit as with our common trees
the morning glory is twining the stem itself twists about a support
the bean pea and nasturtium are climbing the stems are weak and
are held up in the first two by tendrils in the last by the twining
leafstalks the english ivy as we have seen is also climbing by means
of its arial roots the red clover is ascending the branches rising
obliquely from the base some kinds of clover as the white clover are
creeping that is with prostrate branches rooting at the nodes and
forming new plants such rooting branches are called stolons or when
the stem runs underground suckers the gardener imitates them in
the process called layering that is bending down an erect branch and
covering it with soil causing it to strike root when the connecting stem
is cut a new plant is formed long and leafless stolons like those of
the strawberry are called runners stems creep below the ground as well
as above probably the pupil will think of some examples the pretty
little gold thread is so named from the yellow running stems which grow
beneath the ground and send up shoots or suckers which make new plants
many grasses propagate themselves in this way such stems are called
rootstocks that these are really stems and not roots is evident
from the way in which they grow from their consisting of a succession of
joints and from the leaves which they bear on each node in the form
of small scales just like the lowest ones on the upright stem next the
ground they also produce buds in the axils of these scales showing the
scales to be leaves whereas real roots bear neither leaves nor axillary
buds1 rootstocks are often stored with nourishment we have already
taken up this subject in the potato but it is well to repeat the
distinction between stems and roots a thick short rootstock provided
with buds like the potato is called a tuber compare again the corm of
crocus and the bulb of onion to find the stem in each in the former it
makes the bulk of the whole in the latter it is a mere plate holding the
fleshy bases of the leaves
footnote 1 grays first lessons revised edition 1887 page 42
2 movements of stemslet a glass thread no larger than a coarse
hair be affixed by means of some quickly drying varnish to the tip of the
laterally inclined stem of one of the young morningglory plants in the
schoolroom stand a piece of cardboard beside the pot at right angles to
the stem so that the end of the glass will be near the surface of the
card make a dot upon the card opposite the tip of the filament taking
care not to disturb the position of either in a few minutes observe that
the filament is no longer opposite the dot mark its position anew and
continue thus until a circle is completed on the cardboard this is a
rough way of conducting the experiment darwins method will be found in
the footnote1
footnote 1 plants growing in pots were protected wholly from the light
or had light admitted from above or on one side as the case might require
and were covered above by a large horizontal sheet of glass and with
another vertical sheet on one side a glass filament not thicker than a
horsehair and from a quarter to threequarters of an inch in length
was affixed to the part to be observed by means of shellac dissolved in
alcohol the solution was allowed to evaporate until it became so thick
that it set hard in two or three seconds and it never injured the
tissues even the tips of tender radicles to which it was applied to the
end of the glass filament an excessively minute bead of black sealingwax
was cemented below or behind which a bit of card with a black dot was
fixed to a stick driven into the ground the bead and the dot on the
card were viewed through the horizontal or vertical glassplate according
to the position of the object and when one exactly covered the other a
dot was made on the glass plate with a sharply pointed stick dipped in
thick india ink other dots were made at short intervals of time and these
were afterwards joined by straight lines the figures thus traced were
therefore angular but if dots had been made every one or two minutes the
lines would have been more curvilinearthe power of movement in plants
p 6
the use of the glass filament is simply to increase the size of the circle
described and thus make visible the movements of the stem all young
parts of stems are continually moving in circles or ellipses to learn
how the sweeps are made one has only to mark a line of dots along the
upper side of the outstretched revolving end of such a stem and to note
that when it has moved round a quarter of a circle these dots will be on
one side when half round the dots occupy the lower side and when the
revolution is completed they are again on the upper side that is the
stem revolves by bowing itself over to one sideis either pulled over or
pushed over or both by some internal force which acts in turn all round
the stem in the direction in which it sweeps and so the stem makes its
circuits without twisting1
footnote 1 how plants behave by asa gray ivison blakeman taylor 
co new york 1872 page 13
the nature of the movement is thus a successive nodding to all the points
of the compass whence it is called by darwin circumnutation the
movement belongs to all young growing parts of plants the great sweeps of
a twining stem like that of the morningglory are only an increase in
the size of the circle or ellipse described1
footnote 1 in the course of the present volume it will be shown
that apparently every growing part of every plant is continually
circumnutating though often on a small scale even the stems of seedlings
before they have broken through the ground as well as their buried
radicles circumnutate as far as the pressure of the surrounding earth
permits in this universally present movement we have the basis or
groundwork for the acquirement according to the requirements of the
plant of the most diversified movements thus the great sweeps made by
the stems of the twining plants and by the tendrils of other climbers
result from a mere increase in the amplitude of the ordinary movement of
circumnutationthe power of movement in plants p 3
when a young stem of a morningglory thus revolving comes in contact
with a support it will twist around it unless the surface is too smooth
to present any resistance to the movement of the plant try to make
it twine up a glass rod it will slip up the rod and fall off the
morningglory and most twiners move around from left to right like the
hands of a clock but a few turn from right to left
while this subject is under consideration the tendrils of the pea and
bean and the twining petioles of the nasturtium will be interesting for
comparison the movements can be made visible by the same method as was
used for the stem of the morningglory tendrils and leaf petioles are
often sensitive to the touch if a young leaf stalk of clematis be rubbed
for a few moments especially on the under side it will be found in a day
or two to be turned inward and the tendrils of the cucumber vine will
coil in a few minutes after being thus irritated1 the movements of
tendrils are charmingly described in the chapter entitled how plants
climb in the little treatise by dr gray already mentioned
footnote 1 reader in botany x climbing plants
the socalled sleep of plants is another similar movement the oxalis is
a good example the leaves droop and close together at night protecting
them from being chilled by too great radiation
the cause of these movements is believed to lie in changes of tension
preceding growth in the tissues of the stem1 every stem is in a state
of constant tension naudin has thus expressed it the interior of every
stem is too large for its jacket2 if a leafstalk of nasturtium be
slit vertically for an inch or two the two halves will spring back
abruptly this is because the outer tissues of the stem are stretched
and spring back like indiarubber when released if two stalks twining
in opposite directions be slit as above described the side of the stem
towards which each stalk is bent will spring back more than the other
showing the tension to be greater on that side a familiar illustration of
this tension will be found in the dandelion curls of our childhood
footnote 1 see physiological botany by geo l goodale ivison  co
new york 1885 page 406
footnote 2 the following experiment exhibits the phenomenon of tension
very strikingly from a long and thrifty young internode of grapevine
cut a piece that shall measure exactly one hundred units for instance
millimeters from this section which measures exactly one hundred
millimeters carefully separate the epidermal structures in strips and
place the strips at once under an inverted glass to prevent drying
next separate the pith in a single unbroken piece wholly freed from the
ligneous tissue finally remeasure the isolated portions and compare
with the original measure of the internode there will be found an
appreciable shortening of the epidermal tissues and a marked increase in
length of the pithphysiological botany p 391
the movements of the sensitive plant are always very interesting to
pupils and it is said not to be difficult to raise the plants in the
schoolroom the whole subject indeed is one of the most fascinating
that can be found and its literature is available both for students and
teachers darwins essay on climbing plants and his later work on the
power of movement in plants dr grays how plants behave and the
chapter on movements in the physiological botany will offer a wide
field for study and experiment
3 structure of stemslet the pupils collect a series of branches of
some common tree or shrub from the youngest twig up to as large a branch
as they can cut and describe them poplar elm oak lilac etc will be
found excellent for the purpose
while discussing these descriptions a brief explanation of
plantstructure may be given in treating this subject the teacher must
govern himself by the needs of his class and the means at his command
explanations requiring the use of a compound microscope do not enter
necessarily into these lessons the object aimed at is to teach the pupils
about the things which they can see and handle for themselves looking at
sections that others have prepared is like looking at pictures and while
useful in opening their eyes and minds to the wonders hidden from our
unassisted sight fails to give the real benefit of scientific training
plants are built up of cells the delicatewalled spherical or polygonal
cells which make up the bulk of an herbaceous stem constitute cellular
tissue parenchyma this was well seen in the stem of the cutting of
bean in which the roots had begun to form1 the strengthening fabric
in almost all flowering plants is made up of woody bundles or woody
tissue2 the woodcells are cells which are elongated and with thickened
walls there are many kinds of them those where the walls are very thick
and the cavity within extremely small are fibres a kind of cell not
strictly woody is where many cells form long vessels by the breaking away
of the connecting walls these are ducts these two kinds of cells
are generally associated together in woody bundles called therefore
fibrovascular bundles we have already spoken of them as making the dots
on the leafscars and forming the strengthening fabric of the leaves3
footnote 1 see page 46
footnote 2 if elements of the same kind are untied they constitute a
tissue to which is given the name of those elements thus parenchyma cells
form parenchyma tissue or simply parenchyma corkcells form cork etc a
tissue can therefore be defined as a fabric of united cells which have had
a common origin and obeyed a common law of growthphysiological botany
p 102
footnote 3 see page 58
we will now examine our series of branches the youngest twigs in spring
or early summer are covered with a delicate nearly colorless skin
beneath this is a layer of bark usually green which gives the color to
the stem an inner layer of bark the wood and the pith the pith is soft
spongy and somewhat sappy there is also sap between the bark and the
wood an older twig has changed its color there is a layer of brown bark
which has replaced the colorless skin in a twig a year old the wood is
thicker and the pith is dryer comparing sections of older branches with
these twigs we find that the pith has shrunk and become quite dry and
that the wood is in rings it is not practicable for the pupils to
compare the number of these rings with the budrings and so find out for
themselves that the age of the branch can be determined from the wood for
in young stems the successive layers are not generally distinct but in
all the specimens the sap is found just between the wood and the bark
and here where the supply of food is is where the growth is taking
place each year new wood and new bark are formed in this cambiumlayer
as it is called new wood on its inner new bark on its outer face trees
which thus form a new ring of wood every year are called exogenous or
outsidegrowing
ask the pupils to separate the bark into its three layers and to try
the strength of each the two outer will easily break but the inner is
generally tough and flexible it is this inner bark which makes the
poplar and willow branches so hard to break these strong woody fibres
of the inner bark give us many of our textile fabrics flax and hemp come
from the inner bark of their respective plants linum usitatissimum and
cannabis sativa and russia matting is made from the bark of the linden
tilia americana
we have found in comparing the bark of specimens of branches of various
ages that in the youngest stems the whole is covered with a skin or
epidermis which is soon replaced by a brown outer layer of bark called
the corky layer the latter gives the distinctive color to the tree
while this grows it increases by a living layer of corkcambium on its
inner face but it usually dies after a few years in some trees it goes
on growing for many years it forms the layers of bark in the paper birch
and the cork of commerce is taken from the cork oak of spain the green
bark is of cellular tissue with some green coloring matter like that of
the leaves it is at first the outer layer but soon becomes covered with
cork it does not usually grow after the first year scraping the bark of
an old tree we find the bark homogeneous the outer layers have perished
and been cast off as the tree grows from within the bark is stretched
and if not replaced cracks and falls away piecemeal so in most old
trees the bark consists of successive layers of the inner woody bark
stems can be well studied from pieces of wood from the woodpile the ends
of the log will show the concentric rings these can be traced as long
wavy lines in vertical sections of the log especially if the surface is
smooth if the pupils can whittle off different planes for themselves
they will form a good idea of the formation of the wood in many of
the specimens there will be knots and the nature of these will be an
interesting subject for questions if the knot is near the centre of the
log lead back their thoughts to the time when the tree was as small as
the annular ring on which the centre of the knot lies draw a line on this
ring to represent the tree at this period of its growth what could the
knot have been it has concentric circles like the tree itself it was a
branch which decayed or was cut off year after year new rings of wood
formed themselves round this broken branch till it was covered from
sight and every year left it more deeply buried in the trunk
extremely interesting material for the study of wood will be found in thin
sections prepared for veneers packages of such sections will be of great
use to the teacher1 they show well the reason of the formation of a
dividing line between the wood of successive seasons in a cross section
of oak or chestnut the wood is first very open and porous and then close
this is owing to the presence of ducts in the wood formed in the spring
in other woods there are no ducts or they are evenly distributed but
the transition from the close autumn wood consisting of smaller and
more closely packed cells to the wood of looser texture formed in the
following spring makes a line that marks the seasons growth
footnote 1 mr romeyn b hough of lowville ny will supply a package
of such sections for one dollar the package will consist of several
different woods in both cross and vertical section and will contain
enough duplicates for an ordinary class
he also issues a series of books on woods illustrated by actual and neatly
mounted specimens showing in each case three distinct views of the grain
the work is issued in parts each representing twentyfive species and
selling with text at 5 expressage prepaid the mounted specimens alone
at 25 cts per species or twentyfive in neat box for 4 he has also
a line of specimens prepared for the stereopticon and another for the
microscope they are very useful and sell at 50 cts per species or
twentyfive for 10
let each of the scholars take one of the sections of oak and write a
description of its markings the age is easily determined the pith rays
or medullary rays are also plain these form what is called the silver
grain of the wood the ducts also are clear in the oak and chestnut
there is a difference in color between the outer and inner wood the older
wood becomes darker and is called the heartwood the outer is the
sapwood in birdseye maple and some other woods the abortive buds
are seen they are buried in the wood and make the disturbance which
produces the ornamental grain in sections of pine or spruce no ducts
can be found the wood consists entirely of elongated thickened cells or
fibres in some of the trees the pith rays cannot be seen with the naked
eye
let the pupils compare the branches which they have described with a
stalk of asparagus rattan or lily a cross section of one of these shows
dots among the soft tissue these are ends of the fibrovascular bundles
which in these plants are scattered through the cellular tissue instead of
being brought together in a cylinder outside of the pith in a vertical
section they appear as lines there are no annular rings
if possible let the pupils compare the leaves belonging to these
different types of stems the parallelveined leaves of monocotyledons
have stems without distinction of wood bark and pith the nettedveined
leaves of dicotyledons have exogenous stems
dicotyledons have bark wood and pith and grow by producing a new ring
of wood outside the old they also increase by the growth of the woody
bundles of the leaves which mingle with those of the stem1 twist off
the leafstalk of any leaf and trace the bundles into the stem
footnote 1 see note p 127 physiological botany
monocotyledons have no layer which has the power of producing new wood
and their growth takes place entirely from the intercalation of new
bundles which originate at the bases of the leaves the lower part of a
stem of a palm for instance does not increase in size after it has lost
its crown of leaves this is carried up gradually the upper part of the
stem is a cone having fronds and below this cone the stem does not
increase in diameter the word endogenous insidegrowing is not
therefore a correct one to describe the growth of most monocotyledons
for the growth takes place where the leaves originate near the exterior
of the stem

leaves
we have studied leaves as cotyledons budscales etc but when we speak
of leaves we do not think of these adapted forms but of the green
foliage of the plant
1 forms and structureprovide the pupils with a number of green
leaves illustrating simple and compound pinnate and palmate sessile and
petioled leaves they must first decide the question what are the parts
of a leaf all the specimens have a green blade which in ordinary
speech we call the leaf some have a stalk or petiole others are
joined directly to the stem in some of them as a roseleaf for
instance there are two appendages at the base of the petiole called
stipules these three parts are all that any leaf has and a leaf that
has them all is complete
let us examine the blade those leaves which have the blade in one
piece are called simple those with the blade in separate pieces are
compound we have already answered the question what constitutes a
single leaf1 let the pupils repeat the experiment of cutting off the
top of a seedling pea if it is not already clear in their minds and find
buds in the leafaxils of other plants2
footnote 1 see page 31
footnote 2 with one class of children i had much difficulty in making
them understand the difference between simple and compound leaves i did
not tell them that the way to tell a single leaf was to look for buds in
the axils but incautiously drew their attention to the stipules at the
base of a rose leaf as a means of knowing that the whole was one soon
after they had a locust leaf to describe and immediately with the
acuteness that children are apt to develop so inconveniently to their
teacher they triumphantly refuted my statement that it was one leaf by
pointing to the stiples there was no getting over the difficulty and
although i afterwards explained to them about the position of the buds
and showed them examples they clung with true childlike tenacity to their
first impression and always insisted that they could not see why each
leaflet was not a separate leaf
an excellent way to show the nature of compound leaves is to mount a
series showing every gradation of cutting from a simple serrate leaf to
a compound one figs 24 and 25 a teacher who would prepare in summer
such illustrations as these would find them of great use in his winter
lessons the actual objects make an impression that the cuts in the book
cannot give
illustration fig 24series of palmatelyveined leaves
illustration fig 25series of pinnatelyveined leaves
let the pupils compare the distribution of the veins in their specimens
they have already distinguished parallelveined from nettedveined leaves
and learned that this difference is a secondary distinction between
monocotyledons and dicotyledons1 the veins in nettedveined leaves are
arranged in two ways the veins start from either side of a single midrib
featherveined or pinnatelyveined or they branch from a number of
ribs which all start from the top of the petiole like the fingers from
the palm of the hand palmatelyveined the compound leaves correspond
to these modes of venation they are either pinnately or palmately
compound
footnote 1 see page 34
these ribs and veins are the woody framework of the leaf supporting the
soft green pulp the woody bundles are continuous with those of the stem
and carry the crude sap brought from the roots into the cells of every
part of the leaf where it is brought into contact with the external
air and the process of making food assimilation 4 is carried on
physiologically leaves are green expansions borne by the stern
outspread in the air and light in which assimilation and the processes
connected with it are carried on1
footnote 1 grays structural botany p 85
the whole leaf is covered with a delicate skin or epidermis continuous
with that of the stem1

2 descriptionsas yet the pupils have had no practice in writing
technical descriptions this sort of work may be begun when they come to
the study of leaves in winter a collection of pressed specimens will be
useful do not attach importance to the memorizing of terms let them be
looked up as they are needed and they will become fixed by practice the
pupils may fill out such schedules as the following with any leaves that
are at hand

footnote 1 the specimen described is a leaf of copper beech
in describing shapes etc the pupils can find the terms in the book as
they need them it is desirable at first to give leaves that are easily
matched with the terms keeping those which need compound words such as
lanceovate etc to come later the pupils are more interested if they
are allowed to press and keep the specimens they have described it is not
well to put the pressed leaves in their note books as it is difficult to
write in the books without spoiling the specimens it is better to mount
the specimens on white paper keeping these sheets in brown paper covers
the pupils can make illustrations for themselves by sorting leaves
according to the shapes outlines etc and mounting them
3 transpirationthis term is used to denote the evaporation of water
from a plant the evaporation takes place principally through breathing
pores which are scattered all over the surface of leaves and young stems
the breathing pores or stomata of the leaves are small openings
in the epidermis through which the air can pass into the interior of the
plant each of these openings is called a stoma they are formed by a
transformation of some of the cells of the epidermis and consist usually
of a pair of cells called guardian cells with an opening between
them which communicates with an airchamber within and thence with the
irregular intercellular spaces which permeate the interior of the leaf
through the stomata when open free interchange may take place between
the external air and that within the leaf and thus transpiration be
much facilitated when closed this interchange will be interrupted or
impeded1
footnote 1 grays structural botany page 89 for a description of the
mechanism of the stomata see physiological botany p 269
in these lessons however it is not desirable to enter upon subjects
involving the use of the compound microscope dr goodale says whether
it is best to try to explain to the pupils the structure of these valves
or stomata must be left to each teacher it would seem advisable to
pass by the subject untouched unless the teacher has become reasonably
familiar with it by practical microscopical study of leaves for a teacher
to endeavor to explain the complex structure of the leaf without having
seen it for himself is open to the same objection which could be urged
against the attempted explanation of complicated machinery by one who has
never seen it but has heard about it what is here said with regard to
stomata applies to all the more recondite matters connected with plant
structure1
footnote 1 concerning a few common plants p 29
there are many simple experiments which can be used to illustrate the
subject
1 pass the stem of a cutting through a cork fitting tightly into the
neck of a bottle of water make the cork perfectly airtight by coating it
with beeswax or paraffine the level of the liquid in the bottle will be
lowered by the escape of water through the stem and leaves of the cutting
into the atmosphere
2 cut two shoots of any plant leave one on the table and place the
other in a glass of water1 the first will soon wilt while the other
will remain fresh if the latter shoot be a cutting from some plant that
will root in water such as ivy it will not fade at all also leave one
of the plants in the schoolroom unwatered for a day or two till it begins
to wilt if the plant be now thoroughly watered it will recover and the
leaves will resume their normal appearance
footnote 1 lessons in elementary botany by daniel oliver london
macmillan  co 1864 pp 1415
evaporation is thus constantly taking place from the leaves and if there
is no moisture to supply the place of what is lost the cells collapse and
the leaf as we say wilts when water is again supplied the cells swell
and the leaf becomes fresh
3 place two seedlings in water one with its top the other with its
roots in the jar the latter will remain fresh while the first wilts and
dies
absorption takes place through the roots the water absorbed is drawn up
through the woody tissues of the stem 4 and the veins of the leaves
5 whence it escapes into the air 6
4 plunge a cut branch immediately into a colored solution such as
aniline red and after a time make sections in the stem above the liquid
to see what tissues have been stained1
footnote 1 the essentials of botany by charles e bessey new york
henry holt  co 1884 page 74 see also physiological botany pp
259260
5 that water finds its way by preference through the fibrovascular
bundles even in the more delicate parts is shown by placing the cut
peduncle of a white tulip or other large white flower in a harmless dye
and then again cutting off its end in order to bring a fresh surface in
contact with the solution1 when after a short time the dye will mount
through the flowerstalk and tinge the parts of the perianth according to
the course of the bundles2
footnote 1 if the stems of flowers are cut under water they will last a
wonderfully long time one of the most interesting characteristics of the
woody tissues in relation to the transfer of water is the immediate change
which the cut surface of a stem undergoes upon exposure to the air
unfitting it for its full conductive work de vries has shown that when a
shoot of a vigorous plant for instance a helianthus is bent down under
water care being taken not to break it even in the slightest degree
a clean sharp cut will give a surface which will retain the power of
absorbing water for a long time while a similar shoot cut in the open
air even if the end is instantly plunged under water will wither much
sooner than the firstphysiological botany p 263
footnote 2 physiological botany p 260
6 let the leaves of a growing plant rest against the windowpane
moisture will be condensed on the cold surface of the glass wherever the
leaf is in contact with it this is especially well seen in nasturtium
tropolum leaves which grow directly against a window and leave the
marks even of their veining on the glass because the moisture is only
given out from the green tissue and where the ribs are pressed against
the glass it is left dry
sometimes the water is drawn up into the cells of the leaves faster than
it can escape into the atmosphere1 this is prettily shown if we place
some of our nasturtium seedlings under a wardcase the air in the case is
saturated with moisture so that evaporation cannot take place but the
water is nevertheless drawn up from the roots and through the branches
and appears as little drops on the margins of the leaves that this is
owing to the absorbing power of the roots may be shown by breaking off
the seedling and putting the slip in water no drops now appear on the
leaves but as soon as the cutting has formed new roots the drops again
appear
footnote 1 see lectures on the physiology of plants by sidney howard
vines cambridge england university press 1886 page 92
this constant escape of water from the leaves causes a current to flow
from the roots through the stem into the cells of the leaves the dilute
mineral solutions absorbed by the roots1 are thus brought where they
are in contact with the external air concentrated by the evaporation of
water and converted in these cells into food materials such as starch
the presence of certain mineral matters as potassium iron etc are
necessary to this assimilating process but the reason of their necessity
is imperfectly understood as they do not enter in the products formed
footnote 1 see page 48
the amount of water exhaled is often very great certain plants are used
for this reason for the drainage of wet and marshy places the most
important of these is the eucalyptus tree1
footnote 1 reader in botany xii transpiration
the amount of water taken from the soil by the trees of a forest and
passed into the air by transpiration is not so large as that accumulated
in the soil by the diminished evaporation under the branches hence there
is an accumulation of water in the shade of forests which is released
slowly by drainage1 but if the trees are so scattered as not materially
to reduce evaporation from the ground the effect of transpiration in
diminishing the moisture of the soil is readily shown it is noted
especially in case of large plants having a great extent of exhaling
surface such for instance as the common sunflower among the plants
which have been successfully employed in the drainage of marshy soil by
transpiration probably the species of eucalyptus notably e globulus
are most efficient2

4 assimilationit is not easy to find practical experiments on
assimilation those which follow are taken from physiological botany p
305
   fill a fiveinch test tube provided with a foot with fresh drinking
   water in this place a sprig of one of the following water
   plantselodea canadensis myriophyllum spicatum m
   verticillatum or any leafy myriophyllum in fact any small
   leaved water plant with rather crowded foliage this sprig should be
   prepared as follows cut the stem squarely off four inches or so
   from the tip dry the cut surface quickly with blotting paper then
   cover the end of the stein with a quickly drying varnish for
   instance asphaltvarnish and let it dry perfectly keeping the rest
   of the stem if possible moist by means of a wet cloth when the
   varnish is dry puncture it with a needle and immerse the stem in
   the water in the test tube keeping the varnished larger end
   uppermost if the submerged plant be now exposed to the strong rays
   of the sun bubbles of oxygen gas will begin to pass off at a rapid
   and even rate but not too fast to be easily counted if the simple
   apparatus has begun to give off a regular succession of small
   bubbles the following experiments can be at once conducted
   1 substitute for the fresh water some which has been boiled a few
   minutes before and then allowed to completely cool by the boiling
   all the carbonic acid has been expelled if the plant is immersed in
   this water and exposed to the suns rays no bubbles will be evolved
   there is no carbonic acid within reach of the plant for the
   assimilative process but
   2 if breath from the lungs be passed by means of a slender glass
   tube through the water a part of the carbonic acid exhaled from the
   lungs will be dissolved in it and with this supply of the gas the
   plant begins the work of assimilation immediately
   3 if the light be shut off the evolution of bubbles will presently
   cease being resumed soon after light again has access to the plant
   5 place round the base of the test tube a few fragments of ice in
   order to appreciably lower the temperature of the water at a certain
   point it will be observed that no bubbles are given off and their
   evolution does not begin again until the water becomes warm
the evolution of bubbles shows that the process of making food is going
on the materials for this process are carbonic acid gas and water the
carbonic acid dissolved in the surrounding water is absorbed the carbon
unites with the elements of water in the cells of the leaves forming
starch etc and most of the oxygen is set free making the stream of
bubbles when the water is boiled the dissolved gas is driven off and
assimilation cannot go on but as soon as more carbonic acid gas is
supplied the process again begins we have seen by these experiments
that sunlight and sufficient heat are necessary to assimilation and that
carbonic acid gas and water must be present the presence of the green
coloring matter of the leaves chlorophyll is also essential and some
salts such as potassium iron etc are needful though they may not
enter into the compounds formed
the food products are stored in various parts of the plant for future use
or are expended immediately in the growth and movements of the plant in
order that they shall be used for growth free oxygen is required and
this is supplied by the respiration of the plant
some plants steal their food readymade such a one is the dodder which
sends its roots directly into the plant on which it feeds this is a
parasite1 it has no need of leaves to carry on the process of making
food some parasites with green leaves like the mistletoe take the crude
sap from the hostplant and assimilate it in their own green leaves
plants that are nourished by decaying matter in the soil are called
saprophytes indian pipe and beechdrops are examples of this they need
no green leaves as do plants that are obliged to support themselves
footnote 1 reader in botany xiv parasitic plants
some plants are so made that they can use animal matter for food this
subject of insectivorous plants is always of great interest to pupils if
some sundew drosera can be obtained and kept in the schoolroom it
will supply material for many interesting experiments1 that plants
should possess the power of catching insects by specialized movements and
afterwards should digest them by means of a gastric juice like that of
animals is one of the most interesting of the discoveries that have been
worked out during the last thirty years2

5 respirationtry the following experiment in germination
place some seeds on a sponge under an airtight glass will they grow
what causes them to mould
seeds will not germinate without free access of air they must have free
oxygen to breathe as must every living thing we know that an animal
breathes in oxygen that the oxygen unites with particles of carbon within
the body and that the resulting carbonic acid gas is exhaled1 the same
process goes on in plants but it was until recently entirely unknown
because it was completely masked during the daytime by the process of
assimilation which causes carbonic acid to be inhaled and decomposed and
oxygen to be exhaled2 in the night time the plants are not assimilating
and the process of breathing is not covered up it has therefore long
been known that carbonic acid gas is given off at night the amount
however is so small that it could not injure the air of the room as
is popularly supposed respiration takes place principally through the
stomata of the leaves3 we often see plants killed by the wayside dust
and we all know that on this account it is very difficult to make a hedge
grow well by a dusty road the dust chokes up the breathing pores of the
leaves interfering with the action of the plant it is suffocated
the oxygen absorbed decomposes starch or some other food product of the
plant and carbonic acid gas and water are formed it is a process of slow
combustion4 the energy set free is expended in growth that is in the
formation of new cells and the increase in size of the old ones and in
the various movements of the plant
footnote 1 see page 13

this process of growth can take place only when living protoplasm is
present in the cells of the plant the substance we call protoplasm is
an albuminoid like the white of an egg and it forms the flesh of both
plants and animals a living plant can assimilate its own protoplasm an
animal must take it readymade from plants but a plant can assimilate its
food and grow only under the mysterious influence we call life life
alone brings forth life and we are as far as ever from understanding
its nature around our little island of knowledge built up through the
centuries by the labor of countless workers stretches the infinite ocean
of the unknown
