     i dare not choose my lot
       i would not if i might
     choose thou for me my god
       so shall i walk aright
the rustic portion of the congregation shouted the familiar hymn with
laborious goodwill overpowering the more cultivated voices that rose
from the chancel and the front pewsalmost defeating the harsh notes
wrung from the harmonium by the village schoolmistress who also led the
singing in a piercing key supported raucously by her pupils gathered
about the unmusical instrument even in the early nineties nothing so
ambitious as an organ or a surpliced choir had as yet been attempted in
this remote westcountry parish though with the advent of the new vicar
innovations had begun actually of late the high oak pews had been
removed to make way for shining pitchpine seats that in the little
norman church produced much the same effect as a garish oleograph set in
an antique frame most of the parishioners approved the change
certainly it had the advantage of permitting everyone to observe at
leisure who came to church what they wore and how they behaved during
the sermon even if those who were somnolently inclined found the
publicity disconcerting
stella carrington for one infinitely preferred the new seats though
no longer a childseventeen last birthdayshe could never quite forget
the hours of misery she had endured in the old pew the smell of dust
and hassocks the feeling of captivity the desperate impulse that would
assail her to kick open the door to fling a prayerbook over the
barrier to jump up on the seat only the fear of grandmammas wrath had
restrained her from such antics this sunday as she stood between aunt
augusta and aunt ellen singing the hymn that preceded the sermon
recollections returned to her of her childhoods trials in the high pew
and with these unaccountably came the old sense of imprisonment the
feeling disturbed her she searched her mind for the cause and became
conscious that it was somehow connected with the presence of maud
verrall seated with her parents in the religious preserve of the squire
and his family in the chancel the verralls had been absent from the
court for a considerable period and now here was maud who when stella
last saw her had been in short petticoats with her hair down her back
transformed into a young lady she had a curled fringe bangles and
puffed sleeves her dress touched the ground she had a waist and her
hat of a fashionable sailor shape was set well to the back of her
head and all this though she was no older than her former playmate
stella carrington whose skirts even now barely reached her ankles
whose hair still hung in a plait whose hat in her own opinion was
more suited to a child in a perambulator than to a girl of seventeen no
wonder she felt stifled cramped she realised why the memory of her
tortures in the old boxlike pew had recurred to her mind and then
suddenly the hymn that she knew so well and had sung on such countless
sundays paying no special heed to the words struck her as the acme of
hypocrisy she ceased singing amazed that the recognition had not come
to her sooner surely whoever was responsible for the wording of this
hymn could never have known the tedium for a young person of living with
a stonyhearted grandmother and two maiden aunts in a small village
where nothing ever happened the author must have belonged to people
like the verralls who were of course satisfied with their lot and
did not want to change it people who could dare do anything they
pleased if she stella carrington could choose her lot at this moment
she would change places with maud verrall and she wondered how maud
would feel if she found herself forced to accept the lot of stella
carrington would maud still humbly proclaim that she would not change
it even if she might
only when aunt augusta regarding her severely touched her arm did
stella discover that the hymn was ended that the congregation was
settling down for the sermon she sank to her seat blushing abashed
summer had set in early that year and the sun poured through the
stained glass window subscribed for by the parish to a former squire
verrall casting kaleidoscopic patterns of purple and crimson on to
grandmammas brown silk bonnet a premature bumblebee droned and bumped
up and down the panes the atmosphere felt airless and aunt ellen
sniffed elegantly at her green saltsbottle stella grew drowsy she
could not attend to the sermon and her thoughts strayed on in
confusion would canon grass the vicar dare to change his lot if he
might perhaps he would like to change mrs grass who was older than
himself for the pretty visitor who was one of the court party in the
chancel pew and how about mrs daw who was so artistic and
considered her talents wasted in her position as wife to a country
doctor who complained that no one in the village really understood or
appreciated art how much happier mrs daw would be in london had
she the opportunity of changing her lotof converting her husband into
a west end physician and as to the villagers everyone knew that they
were never contented no matter what was done for them at this point in
her reflections stella fell asleep
the service over she followed grandmamma and the aunts slowly down the
aisle while the school children clattered through the porch the court
party left the building by the chancel door and stella saw them pace
down the slope of the churchyard between the tombstones and the yew
trees to where a carriage and pair of horses awaited them at the gates
squire verrall went first in a black coat and a square hat like a box
his whiskers were brushed smartly aside from his ruddy cheeks his large
nose shone in the sun he waved his malacca cane to the school children
marshalled on either side of the pathway mrs verrall followed
delicate smiling sweet in dark green satin and a white ostrich
feather floating from a boatshaped hat with her came the pretty
visitor who walked with a grecian bend  and maud stella observed
that maud was showing off that she minced and looked down her nose as
she passed between the rows of bobbing saluting children and villagers
stella was filled with an envious contempt for such conceit such airs
and graces three maidservants completed the procession even they
would drive back to the court on the rumble of the big carriage while
stella carrington would walk through the lanes to the chestnuts pulling
her grandmothers chair aunt augusta pushing behind aunt ellen
shielding the old lady with a greenlined umbrella they would wait on
themselves at luncheon probably there would be boiled mutton and a milk
pudding
there was in her present rebellious mood the sight of the plain
wholesome food was to stella as the proverbial last straw aunt augusta
carved the mutton a watery red stream issued from the joint mingling
with the caper sauce that surrounded it
none for me thank you said stella with suppressed fury
my dear why not it was grandmamma who made the inquiry and stella
thought the old lady looked like a seagull seated at the end of the
table in her close white cap her snowy hair looped on either side of
her curved nose
i hate boiled mutton beneath her rising defiance the girl was
conscious of amazement at her own temerity she pushed back her chair
and stood up quiveringa slim young beauty giving promise of fine
development though neither beauty nor promise had as yet been
recognised by herself or by her guardians
yes i do hate it she cried and her eyes the colour of burnt
sienna filled with rebellious tears and i hate milk puddings and
babyish clothes and getting up in the morning and going to bed at night
with nothing in betweenthe same every day how you could all stand up
and sing that hymn i dare not choose my lot she mocked i
would not if i might as if you meant it why for most of us it was
simply a lie
for a space there was a shocked silence augusta the carving knife
poised in her hand looked at her mother ellen stared at her plate and
extracted her saltsbottle with stealth from her pocket stella found
her own gaze drawn helplessly to the expressionless old countenance at
the end of the table and despite her newborn courage she quailed
my dear said grandmamma smoothly you had better go and lie down
the weather has upset you i think you require a powder
stella burst into something between laughter and tears she made a
childish dash for the door and ran noisily up the stairs
the meal in the diningroom continued as though nothing had happened
it was not a carrington custom to discuss unpleasant occurrences at
meals or indeed at any other time if such discussions could possibly
be avoided the carrington elders possessed a fine faculty for ignoring
difficult subjects it was a gift that had carried them apparently
unscathed through various trials when it became imperative to speak of
anything painful it was done as briefly and reservedly as possible it
was not until well on in the afternoon when mrs carrington had
awakened from her nap in the drawingroom that stellas outrageous
behaviour was mentioned
the drawingroom at the chestnuts was a long narrow room with three
french windows opening on a little paved terrace formerly the house had
been a farm dwelling the last remnant of a property acquired a century
ago by a carrington ancestor with a fortune made in the east and
dissipated in the west the court where the verralls now reigned had
once belonged to this magnificent carrington and the ladies of the
chestnuts never forgot the fact they regarded the verralls as
interlopers though by now the verralls had been lords of the manor for
several generations
but though the court and all its acres were lost to the carringtons
they had clung as a family to chestnut farm adding to it from time to
time as fluctuating fortunes permitted it was a haven for carrington
widows unmarried daughters retired oldsoldier carringtons a
jumpingoff place for sons as they started in life a holiday home for
successions of young carringtons while their parents were abroad and
there was still the family vault in the parish church where they could
be buried if india spared them to die in england stellas grandfather
whom she could not remember lay there with others of his name and it
had never entered grandmammas mind to live or die anywhere but at the
chestnuts
but to return to the drawingrooma room that breathed of a people long
connected with the easthere were sandalwood boxes caskets composed
of porcupine quills coloured clay models of indian servants brasses
and embroideries the warmth of the afternoon drew forth faint aromas
still stored in these relics mementoes of travel and service and
adventure the perfume that still hung in the folds of the handsome
cashmere shawl draped about old mrs carringtons shoulders
it was she who opened the debate failing her lead neither of her
daughters would have dreamed of alluding to their nieces outburst at
the luncheon table
what do you imagine is wrong with stella the old ladys sunken dark
eyes that yet were quick and bright turned from one daughter to the
other the rest of her muscles were perfectly still
she is growing up said augusta boldly she was the elder of the two
and more nearly resembled her mother physically and mentally than did
fainthearted ellen
she is still a child pronounced mrs carrington oblivious of the
fact that she herself had been married at the age of seventeen had
sailed to india and returned with three children before she was
twentyone
perhaps ventured ellen seeing maud verrall in church dressed as a
grownup young lady made her feel a littlewell i hardly know how to
express myselfrather kept back
ellen herself had been guiltily conscious of a vague feeling of envy
caused by the sight of the court people in all their prosperity and
finery
kept back from what demanded mrs carrington would you wish to see
stella trigged out like that forward monkey maud verrall
maud was always a most underbred child said augusta
ellen hastily took up the cue yes dont you remember the day she came
to tea and broke the vase and allowed stella to be blamed i saw her
break it myself but of course we could say nothing as maud was our
guest and dear little stella said nothing
but what has that to do with the way stella behaved today inquired
her sister ellen thought this rather unkind of augusta
oh nothing of course ellen admitted only it just shows
we are all aware that stella has spirit said grandmamma ignoring
this passage she is a true carrington but spirit in certain
circumstances is a danger and not to be encouraged just as in others it
may be admirable now if the child had been a boy
the old ladys gaze turned to a portrait that hung over the
mantelpiecethat of a gentleman in a blue velvet coat with lace and
silver buttons powdered hair and bold bright eyes that seemed to smile
on the little feminine conclave in amused toleration spirit in a man
was to be accepted and whatever its consequences condoned but in a
female particularly in a young girl it should be guarded against
suppressed ellen carringtons eyes turned also to the portrait long
years ago she had shown symptoms of spirit in connection with the
attentions of a dashing young cousin who had strongly resembled the
portrait mamma was antagonistic he had sailed for india just as had
all male carringtons one after the other and the ship had gone down
so that his vow to return with a fortune and claim his sweet ellen was
never fulfilled
augusta so far as anyone was aware had known no romance the family
spirit in augusta found outlet in a fierce devotion to her mother and
in the maintenance of a pathetically pretentious sort of state in the
household the very manner in which she would ring the bell might have
argued the existence of a host of retainers not for worlds would she
have answered the front door herself neither would she have permitted
ellen or stella to do so her attitude towards the domestic staff at the
chestnutsold betty with a daily slave from the village and the aged
badtempered factotum out of doorswas almost that of a royal
personage punctilious in the matter of good mornings and thank yous
yet carefully distant as became the upholding of class distinction
its a pity she was not a boy said augusta then she could have gone
to schoola little more discipline
yes stellas education interrupted mrs carrington and paused
thoughtfully her daughters listened augusta was responsible for
stellas arithmetic geography history ellen for her progress in
music needlework drawing was fault to be found with these educational
effortswhich in truth were not altogether congenial to the teachers
conscientiously though they pursued them stella was frequently
tiresome and she did such odd thingsfor example she had a trick
as they called it of rising at dawn and rambling about the woods and
commons and returning late for breakfast and then she would be listless
and inattentive for the rest of the day at times she was wild and
disobedient although at others disarmingly docile and quick and
affectionate on the whole the aunts were proud of their pupil what
was mamma about to say concerning stellas education
mamma said though unfortunately stella is not a boy i have lately
been thinking that if a suitable school can be found what was the
name of that friend of yours augusta who years ago started a school
for young ladies at torquay
jane ogle said augusta shortly in the opinion of augusta jane ogle
had lost caste when she opened a school as the daughter of an officer
jane should not have descended to such depths as the earning of her
living when she had plenty of relations with any of whom she could have
made her home in genteel idleness still if mamma had any serious
notion of a school for stella it was so far fortunate that miss ogle had
thus bemeaned herself seeing that none of them knew anything about
boarding schools for girls institutions which were to be regarded with
suspicion
then you really think mamma said augusta incredulously that stella
needs different tuition or at least different management
her behaviour today would point to it mamma replied perhaps you
would write to miss ogle my dear and make inquiries as to her methods
and terms i am inclined to think stella is getting a little beyond us
in every way
stella after rushing from the diningroom and up the stairs in such
unladylike fashion had thrown herself on her bed and wept until her
illhumour evaporated and she began to think more kindly of milk pudding
and boiled mutton then feeling hungry and rather ashamed she had
bathed her eyes and tidied her hair and for a while sat and gazed
from the low window of her bedroomgazed on the familiar lawn sloping
to a narrow stream that had been the cause of many punishments in her
childhood what with her attempts to jump it the catching of imaginary
fish the sailing of paper boats all of which had involved getting her
feet wet a crime in the view of grandmamma and the aunts the cedar
tree on the lawn had also been a source of trouble for stella had never
fought the temptation to climb it and the climbing of trees was
forbidden as not only hoydenish but disastrous to clothesthe same with
the high wall of the kitchen garden there seemed hardly a spot in the
limited domain that for stella was not associated with punishment yet
she adored the grounds as aunt augusta entitled the garden at all
seasons of the year and at this season she still found it heavenly to
dabble in the stream to climb the branches of the cedar tree even to
roll on the fragrant turf she loved the old house as well though
two of the rooms she had always avoided instinctivelygrandmammas
bedroom was one stella felt it held secrets there was something
mysterious and dead in its atmosphere the painted toy horse and the
wooden soldier the halffinished sampler and the shabby doll enshrined
on the chest of drawers seemed to her ghostly objects sad reminders as
they were of uncles and aunts who had never grown up when for any
reason she was obliged to enter the room it was as if these little dead
uncles and aunts still hovered about the big bed with its faded chintz
curtains as if they were listening watching hating her for her being
alive
aunt augustas room she also disliked it might have been a spare room
so cold so polished so neat and the enlarged photographs of bygone
carringtons framed and hung on the walls were hideousall crinolines
and strings of black beads and stovepipe hats and long whiskers
aunt ellens room was different it harboured an apologetic air of
frivolity imparted by gay little ornaments and a screen covered with
christmas cards and pictures cut from illustrated papers whenever
stella studied this screen she found something she had never noticed
before above all in one corner stood a cabinet containing drawers full
of birds eggs and butterflies collected by her father as a boy aunt
ellen was the only person who would answer stellas eager questions
about her father and even those answers told her too littleonly that
he had gone to india as a very young man like all the carringtons that
he was brave and handsome that he had died in battle when his little
daughter was about two years old
and concerning her mother stella had never succeeded in extracting
definite information
she is dead my dear was all aunt ellen would say with grave reserve
she died when you were bornin india was there a picture of her no
there was no picture what was she like we never saw her what was her
christian name it was stellaand clearly the name itself was not
approvedconsidered foolish fantastic
indeed the childs periodical questions on the subject of her mother
were torture to the three secretive oldfashioned women who shrank
from all remembrance of the shameless being who had bewitched their
poor charles and led him astray dragging the name of carrington
through the divorce court at the time of the scandal they had blamed
charles for marrying the abandoned creature and when she died a year
later they were glad though she left an unwelcome infant who was
promptly sent home by the widower to the chestnuts the child was of
course received but under protest a protest that vanished when poor
charles was killed in a frontier skirmish a death for his country
that in the eyes of his mother and sisters fully atoned for his
backslidings and the disgrace he had brought on a name that had ever
been associated with brave deeds in the east
indiathe very word held a magic fascination for the child of poor
charles stella loved the smell of the curios in the drawingroom and
her great treat on wet days was permission to open the camphorwood
chest on the landing fingering the contents she would feel almost
intoxicated with the sight and scent of fine muslin veils heavily
embroidered funny little caps tinselencrusted a packet of pictures
painted on talc of indian ladies blackhaired almondeyed smiling
wonderfully robed at the bottom of the chest were pistols and daggers
and swords all chased and inlaid with ivory and gold and there was a
carved box full of tiger claws and silver ornaments bracelets
anklets and necklaces that jingled in addition to the camphorwood
chest there was the lumber room a low attic that ran the length of the
roof here were stacks of other interesting relics horns and motheaten
skins of wild animals hogspears and clumsy old guns shaped like
trumpets also piles of old books and pamphlets packets of letters and
papers yellow crumbling tied up with string and thrown into cardboard
boxes
on this luckless sunday afternoon stellas mind turned to the lumber
room as yet she had not the courage to descend and face grandmamma and
the aunts after the scene she had made at the diningtable and
presently she stole into the passage that was lined with a wallpaper
depicting chinese scenes square bordered then ran up the ladderlike
stairs leading to the long attic in the roof
there poring over old papers and pamphlets and books she forgot maud
verrall and all that young persons advantages forgot grandmamma and
the aunts and boiled mutton and her rebellious outburst against her own
lotforgot everything but india the land of elephants and tigers
tents and palanquins rajahs and battles and marvels without end she
thrilled again as she read of carringtons who had fought at plassey and
paniput in the mahratta wars and before the walls of seringapatam a
carrington had perished in the black hole of calcutta a carrington had
been the friend of warren hastings in the mutiny a carrington had
performed noble deeds carrington women and children had been sacrificed
for the honour of their country
today stella realised for the first time that her father must have been
the last male carrington of the line no more carrington exploits would
be recorded in the history of british india the name of carrington in
the east belonged solely to the past why oh whyhad not she been
born a boy
chapter ii
maud verrall threw down her tennis racket she said she was tireda
polite excuse for the termination of a game that afforded her no
excitement stella carrington was not a stimulating opponent if she did
not miss the ball she sent it skyhigh or out of court
stella saw through and sympathised with the excuse you see she said
regretfully i have had so little chance of practice even if we had a
tennis court at the chestnuts there is no one for me to play with
lets go into the lovers walk and talk till teatime maud verrall
suggested if stella could not play tennis she might at least prove a
satisfactory recipient of confidences and maud had much to impart that
would surely astonish the unsophisticated girl from the chestnuts
arm in arm they strolled up and down the shady retreat arched over with
lilac laburnum syringa while maud discoursed on the charms of the
latest comic opera that had taken london by storm and sang snatches of
the songs to her envious companion from that she went on to tell of
boyandgirl dances and bicycling parties and this led to disclosures
concerning desperate adorers who were perfectly mad about miss
verrall there was one in particularhis name was fred glossop
poor dear he is awfully gone i feel sorry for him would you like to
see his photograph she drew a folding leather case from her pocket and
displayed to the others interested gaze the portrait of a handsome
youth with curly hair and a distinct shade on his upper lip
are you going to marry him inquired stella
oh i shant marry just yet explained maud i have told him so
frankly perhaps in a couple of years if i meet no one i like better
he might do he is quite good looking and hes going into the army i
let him write to memother never bothers about my letters but while i
was still at school he had to write as if he was my dearest
girlfriendsigned himself lilybecause all our correspondence that
was not in the handwriting of parents was opened im to come out when
we go back to london i shall make my people give a fancy dress ball
what do you think of a greek dresswhite with a key pattern in gold
and a big peacock feather fan
stella was ruefully silent she felt small and humble there were no
balls no young men no coming out on her dull horizon
and what about you asked maud with kindly if belated interest you
must have a deadly time in this hole all the year round im tired of it
already how can you stand it
i have to stand it said stella grimly resigned but im going to
schoolto a school at torquay
how awfula horrible place i went there once after i had measles and
school too at your age hasnt the term begun
i suppose so but it does not seem to matter anyway it will be a
change
it wont be so bad if they take you to concerts and lectures and you
go out riding our riding master was a picture lots of the girls were
mad about him but he liked me best because i didnt take too much
notice of him believe me my dear men think all the more of you if you
dont run after them there was a creature always at the lectures we
went to who gazed at me the whole time and used to follow us when we
went out trying to get near enough to speak to me the other girls were
frantic with jealousy once or twice i gave him the chance of slipping a
note into my hand its quite easyyou put your hand behind your back
like this and gaze in another direction and if a governess happens to
be too close you just speak to her and distract her attention i only
once got into a rowit was coming away from church
this line of conversation was pursued whenever stella was invited to the
court as company for maud and when maud visited her friend at the
chestnuts what oh what would have been the feelings of grandmamma and
the aunts could they have overheard such vulgar pernicious talk to
women of their type and upbringing this dawning of the most powerful of
all instincts would have seemed a matter for the severest censurenot a
natural symptom to be guided into safe and open channels but a danger
to be dealt with as sinful corrupt intuitively stella felt that mauds
enthralling confidences would be condemned with horror by her relations
and when aunt augusta vaguely suspicious inquired one day what the
two young people found to talk about selfpreservation prompted a
careless and misleading reply oh i dont know mauds school and all
that sort of thing
reassured aunt augusta considered this perfectly satisfactory and
natural seeing that stella was soon to begin schoollife herself
maud verralls egoistical communications innocent enough in themselves
though scarcely to be commended led indirectly after the manner of
trivial happenings to farreaching results one of the immediate
consequences of stellas newly awakened interest in the opposite sex was
her expulsion from miss ogles highprincipled establishment before her
first term was over
from the moment of her arrival at greystones stella was in constant hot
water according to the school standards she was backward and her
capabilities were hopelessly unequal she wasted hours that should have
resulted in progress over work she disliked whereas in the subjects
that attracted her she outstripped her class her talent for music was
undeniable but she shirked the drudgery of practice and her fatal
facility for playing by ear was ever in the way she was not popular
for she made no concealment of her contempt for sickly adorations and
fashionable fawnings on governesses and senior girls the life irked
her and her disappointment was keen to find that at greystones there
was no question of concerts and lectures that no finishing extras
figured on miss ogles programme such as might have afforded the sort
of excitement described by maud verrall as an antidote to the monotony
of school existence she hated the daily crocodile walk true there was
a tennis court but the game was a monopoly of the first class while
the rest of the school marched two and two along dusty roads and
uninteresting byways stella moped
then one fatal afternoon the daily procession passed through the town
a treat permitted once in the term and as they all tramped the pavement
of the principal thoroughfare past fascinating shops that held the
attention of governesses and girls a flashy looking youth loitering on
the kerb caught stellas eye she remembered maud verrall and that
daring young persons adventures what a triumph if she could tell maud
in the summer holidays that she had attracted the admiration of a real
live young man maud had advocated a swift sideglance especially if
one had long eyelashes stella tried the experiment in passing the
youth who wore a loud waistcoat and had an immature moustache she felt
rather alarmed at her success the young man responded with alacrity
and proceeded to follow the school at a discreet distance followed when
the crocodile turned to climb the hill and was still in attendance
when it reached the gate of the short drive
stella throbbed with excitement she wondered what he would do now
would he linger outside would he return tomorrow and be there when
they emerged for the walk just to obtain a glimpse of her as they
passed she thought his appearance rather dreadful but at any rate he
was a young man an admirer all that she regretted was that she could
not write now and tell maud verrall how he had followed the school on a
blazing hot day up a steep hill all on her stellas account
a game of tennis was in progress as the girls filed up the sloping drive
and scattered on the edge of the lawn and at this moment as it
happened a ball was sent over the privet hedge into the road below
stella saw her chance
all right she shouted to the players ill run and get it and she
raced back down the drive and through the open gate there was the
admirer lurking on the sidepath he darted forward an eager expression
on his countenance that even in her agitation stella remarked was
sallow and spotty also as he grinned she saw that his teeth were bad
what a pity but it flashed through her mind that such drawbacks need
not when the time came be cited to maud she would tell maud when
they met that he was a picture
affecting not to see him and with a fluttering heart stella pounced on
the tennis ball that lay in the middle of the road and the picture
murmuring something she could not catch pounced also and thrust a
piece of paper into her hand just at that moment by all the laws of
illluck miss ogle herself came in sight advancing along the road
with floating veil and fringed parasol returning from a private
constitutional
the letter that brought the appalling news to the chestnuts of stellas
disgrace was addressed to miss augusta carrington even the customary
ignoring of unpleasant facts was not proof against such a staggering
blow stella the granddaughter the niece the child they had cherished
and guarded and reared with such careto think that she should have
been detected in a vulgar intrigue and could no longer be harboured at
greystones lest she should contaminate her schoolfellows it was almost
too terrible to contemplate and for once the three ladies permitted
themselves the freedom of natural behaviour augusta very nearly
stormed ellen wept bitterly grandmamma said like mother like
daughter in an awful voice and whats bred in the bone will out in
the flesh the household was steeped in gloom they all regretted that
there was no male head of the family to whom they could turn for advice
in this distressing difficulty and it was augusta who at last suggested
that stellas godfather colonel crayfield should be consulted was he
not an old friend of poor charles and only a few days ago there had
come a letter from him saying that he was at home on short leave from
india asking for news of his little goddaughter
augusta had answered the letter how humiliating now in the light of
this subsequent catastrophe to recall the hopeful description she had
given of poor charless child the confession of stellas downfall
should they decide to consult colonel crayfield would be a painful
undertaking but he was such a worthy dependable character and who
could be more fitted as they all agreed to give counsel in such a
terrible predicament than the childs own sponsorthe trusted friend of
the dead father since there was no male member of the carrington
family to whom they could appeal
last time colonel crayfield came home ten years ago he had spent a
couple of days at the chestnutsrather a trial for hostesses who were
unaccustomed to the entertaining of gentlemen but on the whole the
visit was felt to have been a success mamma and augusta had even
suspected that he was attracted by ellen though according to
carrington custom neither had voiced the idea ellen however could
have given him no encouragement for nothing came of it suitable as
such an alliance would have seemed on both sides colonel crayfield was
that amphibious production of the indian servicesa military man in
civil employ holding responsible wellpaid office on the occasion of
his brief visit to the chestnuts he had not disagreed with miss augusta
when she expressed her admiration of missionary efforts in the east he
had only just tasted the wine that was offered him he had not smoked in
the house though the pantry was at his disposal for the purpose all
these good points were recalled during the discussion that ensued as to
whether he should be approached for advice concerning his goddaughters
future and such recollections went far towards shaping the final
decision of grandmamma and augusta tearfully supported by ellen the
whole dreadful truth should be written to colonel crayfield with an
urgent invitation to visit the chestnuts once more
meantime stella was on her way home shamefaced unhappy the fuss at
greystones had been frightful the whole affair bewilderingthe
condemnation the feeling of hopeless inability to defend herself then
the hasty packing the selfrighteous disparaging attitude of the
girls and the stares of the servants the humiliating departure
sentinelled to the last moment by miss ogle herself wrathful and stern
who put her into a compartment for ladies only in the care of the
guard
the time that elapsed between her return to the chestnuts and the day of
colonel crayfields arrival was to stella a species of purgatory
grandmamma and the aunts hardly spoke to her she was forbidden to go
beyond the garden no explanation of her conduct was invited though
indeed what explanation could she have given since it was perfectly
true that miss ogle had caught her receiving a note from a strange young
man and with it all she had not even had a chance to read the noteshe
would have given worlds to know what the young man had written
the culprit was sent to the station in the village wagonette to meet her
godfather and she welcomed the distraction awkward though it would be
to face colonel crayfield in the uncomfortable circumstances the
situation struck her as almost grotesque here she was driving through
the familiar lanes in the late july sunshine as an outcast and a
sinner to meet an old gentleman who had been summoned to sit in
judgment upon her and after all she had done nothing worse nothing
half so bad as maud verrall and maud had not been expelled from school
as a sort of leper she wished maud was at the court but that happy
young creature was disporting herself in london and stella had not the
spirit left to write to her
arrived at the little countryside station a sixmile drive from the
chestnuts she seated herself on a bench to await the train from london
and gazed vacantly at the white palings at the dazzling herbaceous
border butterflies floating above it she felt sorely oppressed but
more from a sense of misfortune than from shame or repentance how
unlucky she was the future held nothing enjoyable she saw herself
living on at the chestnuts indefinitely grandmamma might die some day
but she and the aunts would grow older and older and they would all
continue to sing in church that they dared not choose their lot and
would not if they might stella remembered the case of miss spurt the
only daughter of a clergyman in a neighbouring parish who two or three
years back had run away with her fathers groomgardener the scandal
had petrified the county whispers of it had reached stellas sharp
ears though the subject was never mentioned in her presence at the
chestnuts now she wondered what had become of miss spurt and she even
began to sympathise with the poor girls mad action
supposing she herself were driven to do the same sort of thing to
elope for example with the solitary porter who stood leaning against
the waitingroom wall should he suggest such a desperate step she
regarded him with idle attention feeling stupefied with the prevailing
somnolence of the station the heat of the shadeless empty platform he
was a freshlooking boy with a cap on the back of his head and a curl
of glistening hair plastered to his forehead suddenly he stood erect
stretched his arms gave a loud yawn and seized a handbell that he
rang with deafening clamour so here was the train at last thank
goodness
one or two people hurried perspiring breathless on to the platform a
few more ran over the rails from the opposite side there being no
footbridge the stationmaster emerged from his office and took up a
commanding position the train rumbled in
during the long hot journey from london colonel crayfield had been
repenting his goodnatured acquiescence to what seemed to him a rather
exacting inconsiderate request at first his fancy had been tickled by
the notion that he an elderly bachelor should present himself in this
semiparental rle also he was anxious to see the little girl his
godchild who apparently threatened to follow in her mothers footsteps
though from what he remembered of charles carrington she was more
likely to have inherited unstable tendencies from her father charles
had always been foolish and weak where affairs of the heart were
concerned but in his final affair with the young wife of a
singularly unsuitable husband he was certainly more to be pitied than
blamed that time he had really been done for and he had behaved well
in the circumstances he colonel crayfield had stood by the guilty
pair and helped charles to change his regiment had consented to be
sponsor to the unwelcome child but with the usual result of
goodnatured actions it seemed that his responsibilities were never to
end and partly for the sake of charles carringtons memory partly to
satisfy a newly aroused interest here he was on his way to give counsel
to three old prudes in the matter of a naughty girl who had got into a
scrape at school what form this counsel was to take he had not the
remotest idea he knew nothing about schoolgirls probably it was all a
storm in a teacup what on earth had persuaded him to waste his time in
such useless fashion
as he stepped out of the train in company with a few women bearing
market baskets and a sprinkling of farmers wearing breeches and gaiters
he wished again that he had not yielded to sentiment and curiosity
visits bored him he had been bored on the last occasion ten years ago
when he had gone on duty to the chestnuts he remembered the ordeal
well charless formal austere old mother his uninteresting sisters
the undrinkable wine charless child of six or seven years old who had
sniffed and fidgeted and refused to make friends and was no different
from other children of her age he even remembered that the village was
a long distance from the station and he hoped that neither of the
carrington spinsters had come to the station to meet him
stella standing expectant on the platform saw a powerfullooking man
clean shaven bluntfeatured inclined to stoutness who moved
ponderouslyrather like a big chinaman a mandarin as she stepped
forward he stared at her and the stare gave her an odd feeling of
shyness she would have to introduce herself he did not know that she
was to meet him at the station he was not at all what she had
expected she had pictured a fussy old person with a protruding
stomach a beard and spectacles
colonel crayfield was equally taken aback his experienced glance had
been instantly arrested by the vision of a remarkably goodlooking girl
tall and slim who though her skirt only reached to her ankles whose
hair was tied back with a large ribbon bow was clearly no child and he
had gazed at the vision as he would hardly have permitted himself to
gaze had he realised that the girl was his goddaughter all the same
the situation entertained him he no longer wished he had refused to
respond to miss carringtons appeal
colonel crayfield raised his hat then you are stellamy godchild how
dye do stella
the radiant brown eyes met his own what an unnecessarily pretty
creature no wonder there had been trouble connected with boys
yes they sent me to meet you and she flushed with the consciousness
that he knew of her misbehaviour
very kind of them to send you very kind of you to come he looked
around now for my bag he added briskly and then we can be off
stella sighed with mingled doubt and relief instinctively she felt that
to colonel crayfield she was no criminal yet the remembrance of his
glance when he first set eyes upon her not knowing who she was still
disturbed her strangely she abandoned all attempt to understand the
doubt and allowed her relief full play her spirits rose during the
drive to the chestnuts she chattered freely pointing out landmarks
telling stories of the people and the past and never once did her
godfather allude to the reason of his coming for which consideration
she was deeply grateful
on arrival at the chestnuts even the solemn faces of grandmamma and the
aunts could not depress her she sprang from the wagonette and ran into
the house with a gaiety most unbecoming in one who had been expelled
from school on a charge that was truly shocking
after tea she escaped went down to the stream at the bottom of the
garden and watched grandmamma pacing the terrace in front of the house
on colonel crayfields arm grandmamma wore her brown bonnet and her
cashmere shawl and carried her ebony walkingstick stella ached to
know what they were saying of course it was to do with herself and
how she should be punished if only that nice old fellow would devise
some means of escape for her from her deadly imprisonment
mrs carrington was saying stella is very irresponsible and does not
seem to realise how badly she has behaved i fear she has inherited her
mothers light nature and what we are to do with her is a problem it
is not as if we could hope for a suitable marriage in the future
situated as we are
it is a difficult question said colonel crayfield evasively his eyes
turned to the slim figure that flitted beside the stream he knew by the
weighty silence that followed that he was expected to make some useful
suggestion
at last he said desperately if i were not a bachelor and could offer
her a chance in india then he paused
grandmamma glanced at him furtively was he thinking of ellen what an
admirable solution of the difficulty were he to marry ellen and thereby
not only secure a most suitable wife for himself but provide an equally
suitable haven for stella till the child could be settled in life and
just at that moment as if in response to the old ladys thoughts ellen
herself came out of the house really mrs carrington reflected ellen
did not look anything like her age and she was dressed so
becominglynot too much in the present fashion which all three ladies
considered so ugly grandmamma suddenly discovered that she was
fatigued that she had taken sufficient exercise for today and would
step into the drawingroom for a rest before dinner oh dear noellen
and colonel crayfield must not trouble about her no need for them to
come indoors just yet on such a pleasant evening she would prefer to be
quiet and perhaps a short nap
so ellen and colonel crayfield took a little stroll in the garden and
the gentleman also took the opportunity to make a request connected with
his own comfort
i hope i shall not be giving too much trouble dear miss ellen he
said with diffidence but might a tray be put in my bedroom overnight
i am afraid i am a victim to old indian habits and one of them is that
i wake very early and long for a cup of tea i have my own kettle and
spirit standi never move without them in englandso that if a teapot
and some tea and a little milk
ellen eagerly assented of course it would be no trouble at all she
was so glad he should have mentioned it and i do hope you will ask
for exactly what you want i will tell betty and see that she arranges
the tray properly
if it might be a fairly big teapot and a breakfast cup  pursued
colonel crayfield what he had suffered in english households from
dainty little morning teasetsa teapot the size of an apple a cup
to match tea so thick and strong that it might have been jam
ellen wondered nervously if there would be enough milk left overnight
for the visitors tray betty was always so careful not to take more
than was actually required for the household i think i will just run
indoors she said apologetically and tell betty what to do so that
she will be sure not to forget anything
you are more than kind exclaimed colonel crayfield with fervour but
he did not add that he hoped she would speedily return and continue
their stroll and when ellen reappeared smiling and triumphant he was
nowhere to be seen neither was stella in sight and ellen finally
discovered the pair in the kitchen garden
stella had crawled beneath a net that protected the gooseberries from
the birds colonel crayfield was standing stolid and large on the path
and stella was handing him berries through the meshes of the net he was
not eating the fruit and ellen felt that this was compatible with his
dignity and his years she could not imagine colonel crayfield sucking
gooseberries and throwing the skins about it seemed he was collecting
them for stella who bent double was robbing the bushessuch an
ungainly attitude for a young lady
stella called aunt ellen in reproof you are tearing your frock
the child looked a disgraceful object as she emerged from the nets a
long rent in one of her sleeves disclosed a round white arm with a red
scratch in the flesh her face was crimson her hair in disorder she
was covered with twigs and bits and her mouth was sticky with
gooseberry juice laughing she held out her skirt like an apron for
the fruit that filled colonel crayfields large mahoganycoloured hands
ellen felt truly ashamed of her niece what would colonel crayfield be
thinking of his goddaughter and of the way in which she had been
brought up had ellen observed the look in colonel crayfields eyes at
the moment she would probably have mistaken it for astonished
disapproval as it was she only observed that he gazed at stella in
silence at the shining hair that fell over her forehead at the
wideopen brown eyes thickly lashed and full of mischief at the
flushed cheeks and parted lips that showed a row of faultless little
teeth and at the red scratch on the white forearm
stella unabashed proffered her skirt full of fruit to her aunt do
have some aunt ellen she cried joyously theyre ripping especially
the big hairy fellows
you will spoil your dinner said aunt ellen severely as you have
already spoilt your frock
like little miss jane and stella chanted
     greedy greedy little miss jane
     ill never give her a present again
     she spent her sixpence on raspberry rock
     and spoilt her dinner as well as her frock
colonel crayfield actually laughed moreover he accepted a gooseberry
from stellas grubby fingers and ate it fastidiously burying the skin
in the mould with the toe of his boot
that evening grandmammas hopes ran high augusta sent stella to bed
early and afterwards colonel crayfield listened apparently entranced
while ellen played the pianoplayed yorkshire bells and the village
blacksmith
chapter iii
very early next morning colonel crayfield was awakened by a crash his
bedroom was alight with the dawn the lemon scent of magnolia blossom
floated in at the open window what had aroused him involuntarily he
glanced at the teatray at the big teapot and breakfast cup for which
he had miss ellen to thank then he became aware of a curious sound and
sitting up he beheld the milkjug in fragments on the floor and a cat
complacently lapping the milk that had spread in a pool on the carpet
in a fury he sprang from the bed clapping his hands shouting at the
thief the cat ears back tail on end made for the window and
disappeared in a flash he could hear her scrambling down the magnolia
tree what about his tea he hated tea without milk and probably the
household would not be astir for hours he formed a bold projecthe
would go downstairs and forage for more milk no one need hear him he
could explain relate the disaster at breakfast slippers on his feet
and a coat over his sleepingsuit he crept into the long low passage
all was still but the stairs the stairs might have been actually alive
and the banisters too how they did creak it was a relief to arrive at
the foot of the staircase without having aroused the household now
there was a green baize door that evidently gave on to the kitchen
quarters it yielded silently to his push and he was confronted with a
short flight of stone steps at any rate they could not creak
quickly descending them he found himself in a large oldfashioned
kitchen stonepaved beyond surely was the larder where milk might be
found if the cat had not been there before him how different it all
was from indian establishments in india whether as a guest or in ones
own house one could demand tea at any hour of the night or day and it
was forthcoming as a matter of course in india
hallo
colonel crayfield jumped ingloriously and only just saved himself from
swearing aloud his goddaughter was standing in the larder doorway a
cup in one hand a crust of bread in the other she had the advantage of
him in the matter of toilet being fully dressed in a blue washing frock
that fell in straight lines from her neck to her ankles and a wide
straw hat bound with a ribbon of the same colour
they looked at each other amazed colonel crayfield drew his coat
closer about him and passed his hand mechanically over his hair
good gracious he said resentfully
did you hear me go down she inquired
no but i wonder you didnt hear me the stairs made such a
confounded noise
yes i know arent they awful i always expect aunt augusta to burst
from her room with a poker in her hand were you looking for something
to eat
i was looking for some milk he admitted a cat got into my room and
knocked down the milkjug i dont like tea without milk
i expect it was granny
granny repeated colonel crayfield mystified
stella laughed not my grandmother was it an old blackandwhite cat
with a very long tail
i really did not notice anyway the brute broke the jug and was
drinking the milk
here you are then she handed him a jug
he took it but have you all you want yourself he inquired politely
heaps she replied munching her crust have a piece of bread its
lovelyhome made i only wish i had an onion too dont you love
onions
i dont object to them he began then suddenly the unfitness of
the situation came home to him with something of a shock here was he
the ruler of a vast area in india accustomed to ceremony and
circumstance and state pilfering a larder with a chit of a
girldiscussing onions of all things and further than that he was not
dressed it might have been a silly dream
and what are you doing down here at this extraordinary hour he asked
of his goddaughter with what dignity was left to him
eating and drinking as you can see was her flippant reply then as
though conscious that she was perhaps not treating colonel crayfield
quite with the respect that was his due she added primly i often get
up very early and go for a ramble she hesitated and continued with
diffidence would you care to come for a walk instead of going to bed
again
well i cant come as i am but if you will wait till ive had my tea
and dressed
of course ill wait ill leave the side door open and youll find me
outside
later when he joined her his selfrespect as commissioner of rassih
restored he said indian life would suit you since you are so fond of
early rising in india i am nearly always out soon after daybreak
stella sighed oh indiahow i should love to go there
really what about the heat and the exile and the insectsand he
added playfullynot to speak of snakes and tigers
im not afraid of anything bragged stella and with the elimination
of grandmamma this was true enough if it comes to exile what could be
worse than life at the chestnutswhere nothing ever happens and
nothing will ever happen
now they were out of the garden out on a common that was ablaze with
gorsethe spongy turf was silvered with dew the air fragrant and
fresh birds voices the distant lowing of cattle echoed in the sweet
stillness
but some day you will marry prophesied colonel crayfield in a tone
of encouragement
marry derided stella who is there for me to marry she thought of
miss spurt and of the young porter at the railway station
he made no answer he was appraising the slim young form beside him
marking the grace of her limbs the poise of the little head on the
long round neck the clean turn of ankle and wristevery point was
good in a couple of years she must be a magnificent woman
what are you thinking about inquired stella here we are at the end
of the common and youve hardly spoken a word are you tired
tired certainly not it would take rather more than a walk across a
common to tire me he stepped out with vigour
what long strides you are taking hadnt we better have a race while we
are about it see that oak tree over thereat the edge of the wood i
bet you ill get there first one two threeoff
and the commissioner of rassih who could still hold his own at tennis
and rackets accepted the challenge the race ended in a dead heat
stella flung herself down beneath the oak tree and colonel crayfield
took a seat formed by the roots beside her the fact that he was
scarcely out of breath pleased him
anyway you can run pronounced stella
why not he demanded
oh i dont know she was politely evasive it would hardly do to
explain that such agility in anyone of his age and bulk had surprised
her and she hastened to change the subject now do let us talk about
indiashe looked up at him with eager bright eyesyou dont know
how i long to see india i suppose its in my blood all the carringtons
did things in india and if i had been a boy i should have gone out to
do things too i am the last young carrington leftand i am only a
girl
colonel crayfield took off his hat and ran his fingers through his
thick grey hair he was proud of its thickness most men of his age in
india were hopelessly bald
india isnt what it was the spirit of romance and adventure has gone
the pagoda tree is dead prices are rising and exchange is falling
but havent you lovely big houses interrupted stella and heaps of
servants and horses and the sun and gardens and fruit what is your
bungalow like in india
he checked his inclination to grumble it isnt a bungalow its part
of a moghul fort built on the walls of the old city the wall goes
right round the compound a compound is
yes i know what compound means i know compound and tiffin and
chuprassee and peg and lots of words i find them in all the old
family letters put away in the lumber room do go on
well i believe the city in the old days used to come close up to the
wall but it has gradually been moved farther away the back of the
house looks on to a desert that stretches for miles
is it a big station
no its a small civil station too small considering that its the
headquarters of a big charge
it must be ripping to feel you are ruling governing all the time
dont you love powerspelt with a capital p
who doesnt but there are definite drawbacks as well as compensations
in indian service
she sighed i shall never see the country never feel the indian sun
or smell an indian bazaar i shall never hear a tomtom or the frogs
chorus in the rains or even see a snake except in the zoo or in a
bottle
colonel crayfield gazed at the child in astonishment he guessed nothing
of the grip that the old letters and memoirs stored in the lumber room
had on her imagination he had no conception of the strength of
hereditary memory of the spell bequeathed by a long line of forbears
whose lives had been spent in the east whose hearts and minds and souls
had been bound up with indiatheir mighty relentless mistress he met
in puzzled silence the frank gaze of the lovely limpid eyes that
stirred his blood tempting him in all opposition to his reason and
foresight yet just as his activity in the race to the oak tree had
pleased him flattered his pride in his physical preservation so did
this amorous thrill
stella looked away disconcerted something in his expression reminded
her of his first glance on the platform the previous afternoon she did
not understand it and it made her vaguely uneasy she rose brushing
her skirt uttering hasty little remarksit was getting late they
ought to go back breakfast would be ready look at the sun
yes the sun by now was well up in the sky a hot summer sun that sucked
the dew from foliage and turf creating a mist like smoke dispensing
strong perfumes of earth promising great heat for the day to the man
whose youth lay behind him it strengthened his ardour tempting him to
take possession of this exquisite child by means of her mania for india
her boredom with her present life and surroundings then suddenly he
remembered that his mission to the chestnuts was to administer reproof
to give profitable advice as they restarted across the common he said
abruptly you know why i have come to the chestnuts
the girl flushed yes she said reluctantly here it was at last the
lecture the blame just when she had almost forgotten it was beastly
of her godfather need we talk about it now
we shall have to talk about it some time i suppose his tone
reassured her it sounded as if after all he was rather more on her
side than on that of grandmamma and the aunts still she felt
suspicious
what did you do exactly
well i made eyes at an awful young man when we were out for a walk in
the town she blushed deeper at the recollection it was just to see
what would happen more than anything elselike pulling a dogs tail
oh i cant explain nobody will ever understand
and what did happen
with difficulty she told him and awaited his censure to her astonished
relief he said bad luck you see the wicked dont always prosper
but was i so wicked she asked defensively a girl i know told me she
had done the same kind of thing often she didnt think it was so
dreadful it seems to me an awful fuss about very little and i dont
know why you should have been bothered even though you are my
godfather what shall you advise them to do
at present he said cryptically i am not quite sure
she glanced at him halfalarmed he laughed how would you like it if
i advised them to send you out to india
stella gasped oh would you but how as a missionary a companion a
governesswhat
again he laughed as a companion perhaps im afraid you would not be
much good as a missionary or a governess what do you think yourself
i shouldnt care id do anything to get to india
well we shall see dont be too hopeful he looked at his watch
what time is breakfast
halfpast eightprayers first
then step out enough had been said for the moment
oh dear complained stella what a bother things are you are as bad
as aunt augusta about being in time why dont you marry aunt augusta
she mightnt appreciate india he said with a grin
grandmamma seldom came down to breakfast augusta read prayers
fiercely glaring at her congregation as though to remind them of their
unworthiness ellen kept her eyes shut and responded with fervent
contrition neither sister was as yet aware of the guests early
expedition with their niece and as stella made no mention of it during
the meal colonel crayfield preserved a discreet silence on the subject
there was a letter for stella on the breakfast table the aunts eyed her
with suspicion as she read it and then hastily consigned it to her
pocket the letter was from maud verrall it contained wonderful news
     my dear what do you think i am engaged to be married in spite of
     all my resolutions not to commit myself in a hurry no it is not
     poor fred glossop who is wild with despair but a captain matthews
     in the indian cavalry he is a positive picture if you like
     rather in the style of the ridingmaster i told you about but
     much much handsomer my people arent pleased but that only
     adds to the excitement there is nothing they can object to
     definitely he has a little money of his own and isnt badly
     connected of course they expected me to choose a lord or a
     baronet at least but i am very unworldly i am awfully happy and
     frightfully in love i am sure i shall enjoy myself hugely in
     india dont you wish you were me
stella groaned over this letter in the privacy of her bedroom indeed
how she wished she were maudwho was going to india not as a
missionary or a governess nor in any other servile capacity but as
the wife of a cavalry officer colonel crayfield was wrong it was the
wicked who prospered as compared with herself maud had certainly been
wicked and now here was maud rewarded with all that stella would give
her ears to attain she wept with envy felt convinced that her
godfather had overrated his power to lighten her lot and in any case
grandmamma and the aunts would oppose whatever plan he might suggest
she was doomed to grow old at the chestnuts she was never to marry
never to enjoy herself never to reach indiathe mecca of her dreams
if only that beast maud had not been going to india stella felt
bitterly jealous it was all so cruel so hopeless
reluctant to appear with swollen eyelids she remained in her room for
the rest of the morning also because she wished to allow her godfather
every chance of imparting his advice however fruitless it might be to
her guardians she presented herself at luncheon but the atmosphere
seemed unchanged evidently nothing had happened for she was still
ignored by her relations and colonel crayfield purposely she
suspected though not with unkindly intention paid small heed to her
presence
after luncheon she was dispatched by aunt augusta on household errands
i am being got out of the way said stella to herself as she set off
with a can of soup for old mrs bly and an order for bacon and rice at
the post officethe postal department being a sort of incidental
appendage to the only shop of the village stamps and post cards were
also required then she was to call for eggs and butter at a farmhouse
quite a mile and a half away she made no haste the longer the palaver
concerning her future that she hoped was taking place during her
absence the better the farmers wife mrs capper made her welcome
gave her tea with honey and freshbaked bread told her what a fine
growed young lady she was getting all of which was pleasant and
consolatory for the time being especially when young capper came in
looking quite gentlemanlike in a tweed coat with leather patches on the
shoulders and breeches and gaiters he betrayed unmistakable admiration
for his mothers gueststella could hardly prevent him from escorting
her home to carry the basket not that she would have objected to his
company but somebody would be sure to espy them and tell old betty and
old betty would tell aunt augusta and it would all be attributed to her
own fast and unladylike tendencies and add to her present disfavour
the risk was not good enough young capper would keep till she knew the
result of colonel crayfields intercession on her behalf despite the
little distraction she strolled home listless and depressed
chapter iv
tea in the drawingroom was over mrs carrington sat erect motionless
as usual augusta and ellen were pretending to knit in reality their
whole attention was given to colonel crayfield who perambulated about
large and imposing his hands in his pockets a disturbance in the
oldworld atmosphere augusta noticed with irritation how he scuffled up
the edge of the persian rug spread in the centre of the room each time
he walked over it ellen suspected that he wanted to smoke but she
dared not suggest the permission the carrington ancestor gaily
indifferent gazed down at the little conclave that was concerned with
the misdeeds of his young descendant
it is a difficult question repeated colonel crayfield he had said
the same thing already several times
would you recommend another school asked augusta some stricter
establishment perhaps if one could be found that would receive a girl
under the painful circumstances
colonel crayfield halted beside a table he picked up a long narrow
scentbottle and appeared to examine it closely augusta hoped he would
not let it fall the bottle had come from delhi was said to have been
the property of a moghul princess and once to have contained attar of
roses
well on the whole no he said presently we dont want to break
the childs spirit
spirit echoed old mrs carrington she has the evil spirit of her
mother not the spirit of her fathers people which i foolishly
imagined might have counteracted failings inherited from the other
side
to augustas relief colonel crayfield replaced the precious
scentbottle and addressed himself to the three ladies if you will
pardon my plain speaking i think you are making too much of thisthis
indiscretion of stellas i had a talk with her this morning
this morning cried augusta and ellen together and the three pairs of
eyes were fixed on him in amazed curiosity
yes this morning before breakfast he confessed calmly and my
opinion is that stella meant no harm she is growing up is no longer a
child and she needs more outlet school is hardly the place for her
now
but what would you suggest came faintly from ellen
mrs carrington shot a quick glance at him she was recalling their
conversation on the terrace the previous afternoon he had said if i
were not a bachelor and could offer her a chance in india then he
had strolled in the garden with ellen and had enjoyed ellens music
after dinner was it in his mind to seek the hand and the heart of her
younger daughter
a plan has occurred to me he continued with caution but i am not
at all surein fact subject to your permission he bowed slightly to
the trio i should prefer to wait a little before saying anything
further
mrs carrington smiled and at the moment she resembled a hawk more than
a seagull with a gracious gesture of assent she rose augusta my
dear she said suavely will you assist me upstairs i feel rather
fatigued this discussion has been trying and i thinkagain she shot
a sharp glance at colonel crayfieldwe may leave the solution of our
unhappy difficulty with every confidence to our poor dear charless old
friend
augusta dutifully supported her mother from the room but to mrs
carringtons exasperation the tiresome ellen must needs come too
instead of allowing colonel crayfield this obvious opportunity of paying
his addresses
therefore colonel crayfield found himself alone in the drawingroom and
he was only too thankful for the relief now he could think connectedly
in no way had he committed himself so far to any suggestion should he
ultimately decide that to marry the girl was too serious a step to take
he could still advise something quite different from the idea that was
so strongly seductive he might suggest that stella should be sent to
some angloindian friends of his own in london as a paying guest he
being financially responsible or he could offer to find some family in
india when he returned there who would be willing to take charge of a
girl as a matter of business he as her godfather paying expenses the
money was nothing
as he roamed round the room doubtful undecided his eyes fell on the
group of coloured clay models of indian servants set out on a
papiermch bracket and he paused for they recalled the existence of
sher singh his hindu bearer who for the past twentyfive years had
been his right hand and chief of his domestic staff and who perhaps
knew more about robert crayfield than any other living being sher singh
would not welcome a memsahib at the same time the fellow would hardly
be such a fool as to jeopardise his own valuable position by making
trouble the almighty rupee would soon settle sher singhs objections
and stella must be made to understand that interference with the head
servants authority in the household could not be permitted thus the
commissioner of rassih endeavoured to exorcise the inopportune vision of
his confidential retainer who he was aware bore a faint fantastic
likeness to himself people would sometimes remark laughing like
master like man
he looked out of the window to see stella crossing the lawn a basket on
her arm and he noted afresh the splendid promise of her young form the
grace of her proportions the perfection of feature and colouring truly
she was well worth a drastic upheaval of his mode of life a price that
was hardly too high all things considered involuntarily as he watched
her he began to make plans for the future the big bedroom that
overlooked the gardens at rassih no it was not so cool in the hot
weather as the one he had hitherto occupied himself which gave on to
the vast desert area at the back of the house true his present room
held tragic associations his predecessor in the appointment had
committed suicide from the balcony throwing himself over the parapet
down on to the rubbish and scrub far below where in the night time
hyenas and jackals yelled and fought and made diabolical merriment
and then there was the bathroom door scarred with sabre cuts and bullet
holes hideous reminders of a mutiny massacre where women and
children but that all belonged to the past stella need never be
told of such horrors nor of the stories of footsteps and cries and
unaccountable noisesservants superstitious nonsense that of course
he scoffed at and suppressed though sometimes when the heat kept him
awake at night he had even imagined that he heard them himself the
drawingroom should be renovated he had never used it he would order a
piano from calcutta
stella disappeared round the corner of the house and colonel crayfield
realised with a sense of mingled triumph and incredulity that he had
actually made up his mind that he had done with all hesitation and
when robert crayfield once made up his mind he did not alter it
a timid cough in the doorway disturbed his reflections it was ellen
carrington driven back to the drawingroom by her mother under pretext
that good manners did not permit of a guest being left solitary
unentertained she fluttered to a seat prepared to make polite
impersonal conversation but colonel crayfield trampled on the
intention
well and what do you think of it all miss ellen he inquired
confidentially at any rate she seemed to him the most human of the
three females his tone gave her a nice little sense of importance
i expect you are right we may have taken things too seriously but
stellas conduct did seem veryrather
he broke in abruptly can you keep a secret and as his companion
looked up alarmed he added smiling only for a short time
ii hope i can she had so little experience of secrets and the very
word secret savoured of deceit
well its this i intend to take stella back with me to india i
intend to marry her
ellen gasped totally unprepared as she was for such a disclosure it
left her dumbfounded also vaguely shocked to her maidenly mind there
was something indelicate in the notion of stella who was little more
than a child married and to a man so very much her senior oh dear
in all her bewilderment colonel crayfields voice sounded oddly distant
im soso surprised she faltered
i admit that she is young enough to be my daughter but surely the
drawback goes for nothing if i am prepared to accept it consider the
advantage for stella
it was beyond ellens power to voice her feelings she was only aware of
a nebulous resentment that she could not define even to herself much
less aloud to the man who had caused it
as my wife he went on glad to give utterance to his arguments she
will have an assured position she will be suitably provided for and
she will be well looked afteri can promise you that
the last sentence sounded to ellen more like a threat than a promise
her silence puzzled colonel crayfield annoyed him he had anticipated
expressions of delight of gratitude he felt he had every reason to
expect them yet this limp bloodless old maid appeared totally
unimpressed by the benefits he proposed to shower upon her niece seemed
even to disapprove of the whole business he brushed from his mind the
impatience her odd behaviour had aroused
i am in no doubt as to stellas reception of my purpose he could not
resist telling her with pointed satisfaction and had miss ellen been
capable of such vulgarity she would have sworn that she saw him lick his
lips she shrank instinctively disgusted and gathered up her
knitting with trembling hands
will you excuse me she stammered even her mothers orders could keep
her no longer in the room she felt as if colonel crayfield had suddenly
turned into a sort of ogre ii have a letter to write that must catch
the post and with this one of the few lies she had ever told in her
life she sidled past him to the door
he looked after her in contemptuous wonderment then stepped out of the
window in search of his future bride probably she was eating
gooseberries and the kitchen garden had this advantage that it was
not overlooked by windows though it was hardly the spot he would have
chosen for lovemaking but stella was nowhere to be found and
returning at last to the house he had no better luck the place seemed
deserted where had they all hidden themselves
he could not know that stella was an unwilling prisoner upstairs
helping aunt augusta to sort household linen that mrs carrington
still resting believed him to be enjoying the society of ellen whereas
ellen had locked herself into her bedroom helplessly perturbed
only just before dinner did he have the chance of speaking to stella
without being overheard i saw you come back he said to her a tender
inflection in his voice were you tired was the basket heavy
oh no she replied mischievously i only felt overburdened with
virtue a handsome young man wanted to carry the basket for me and i
would not let him
thought you might be found out he suggested with a chuckle
that was about it she said recklessly candid oh do tell me was
anything settled this afternoon i know you were all talking me over am
i to stay here for the rest of my life
have a little patience he teased finding a subtle pleasure in her
obvious disappointment with his reply
that evening after dinner he discovered that stella had a voice she
sang a little song something about a star to aunt ellens
accompaniment and though stella herself was clearly bored by the words
of the song and despite lack of training and feeling her voice was
deep and sweetwell worth cultivation as he quickly decided she
should have singing lessons before they sailed for india
the song ended he found an opportunity to whisper that was
delightful stellaa star some day perhaps a star of india
but thats a decoration isnt it she asked pleased and eager and
not for women have you got it
he looked at her intently narrowing his eyes no i havent got my
staryet
but you will have itsoon
yes very soon
stella felt mystified had she said the wrong thing perhaps it was a
sore point with him that he had not received the distinction earlier
can you sing she inquired quickly to change the subject
well i used to he admitted
oh do let us see if we have any songs you know aunt ellen colonel
crayfield will sing if we can find something he knows
there followed much turning over of music but without success then
stella lifted the lid of the small ottoman that served as a pianostool
disclosing several bound books of music she dragged them forth beneath
them lay a number of songs in manuscript ellen intervened
you will find nothing among those they are so old she said hastily
as again her niece delved and produced wings adieu the arabs
farewell to his favourite steed
colonel crayfield shook his head at them all but he laid his hand on
the next sheet of music that in spite of aunt ellens unaccountable
obstruction was excavated by stella
that he exclaimed mingled recognition and reluctance in his tone
forthwith stella placed it on the stand and began to read the
accompaniment that might have been transcribed with a pin
now she looked up at her godfather gaily insistent
and colonel crayfield with an air of amused capitulation sang in a
good bass voice that was not so very rusty
     i gave my love a little rose
       a little rose of red and white
     because her colour comes and goes
       wheneer i dawn upon her sight
     i gave my love a little key
       a little key of yellow gold
     because she locks her sweets from me
       and will not her dear heart unfold
     i gave my love a little dove
       around its neck a feathery ring
     because a ring betokens love
       and love to my sweet love i bring
     and in return what gave my love
       of all the precious gifts that be
     no rose nor key nor ringnecked dove
       she gave but her sweet self to me
mrs carrington and augusta murmured polite applause though they
thoroughly disapproved of the words they said they had heard the song
before though they could not recall when or by whom it had been sung
ellen could have told them poor ellen the gay young cousin had sung
it sung it to her in those faroff days that now were as a faint
impossible dream she herself had copied the music and the words with an
etching pen and purposely had buried the manuscript at the bottom of
the ottoman where for so long she had guarded it jealously only on the
rare occasions when she was alone in the house did she take it out and
tinkle the accompaniment whispering the words it seemed a sort of
sacrilege to ellen that the song should have been exhumed by the
careless stella to be sung with zest in a loud voice that destroyed the
echo of the beautiful tenor the remembrance of which caused her heart
to ache and brought tears to her eyes
stella with girlish enthusiasm pronounced the song to be perfectly
sweet and proceeded to hunt through the rest of the pile colonel
crayfield watched her lithe movements he was well satisfied with his
own performance and he smiled to himself as he recollected the last
occasion on which he had sung this songto a pretty young married
woman with whom at that time he was pleasantly philandering the lady
had burst into tears at the piano an affecting scene had ensued and
the husband had all but surprised them it had been just touchandgo a
providential escape what on earth was her name he could only remember
that her hair was golden and her eyes like forgetmenots
never mind it did not matter all that mattered to him was this
exquisite child who was to learn the facts and the meaning of marriage
from him and from him alone if only the three tiresome old women
were out of the roomthe two spinsters scraggy and genteel the old
mother austere and cold and to add to his provocation when mrs
carrington beckoned stella to her side that she might kiss her
goodnight he heard the old lady forbid her to go out before breakfast
next morning no reason was given only the order what tyranny was it
any wonder that apart from everything else stella should yearn to
escape from the chestnuts stella glanced at him ruefully over her
grandmothers head he returned her a nod of sympathetic understanding
next day it should all be different he enjoyed the prospect of
astounding the old martinet
the following morning mrs carrington was not so easy to corner when
she appeared ellen was in close attendance and stella was on duty with
augusta occupied with household tasks that seemed to involve strenuous
attacks on cupboards and perpetual visits to the kitchen whence came
hot sweet whiffs of jammaking colonel crayfield wandered aimlessly
in the garden consoling himself with plans for the immediate future
the marriage must take place as soon as possiblehe supposed it would
have to be in the village churchbut a special licence would expedite
matters in little more than a couple of months his leave would be
upit would allow only just time for stella to have riding lessons
singing lessons to collect the right sort of outfit for which of
course he would be responsible no village dressmaker no readymade
garments for his wife his own particular star should shine in every
detail
at last there was the old lady alone on the terrace settled in a big
basket chair a mushroomshaped hat tied on with a broad ribbon her
ebony stick handy a small table at her side on which lay spectacles a
handkerchief and the paper which arrived at midday colonel crayfield
approached her formal greetings were exchanged then he took an
uncomfortable little garden chair from its restingplace against the
wall and applied himself to business
now he said briskly i am ready to tell you what i propose should be
done about stella
mrs carrington pouched her cheeks and intimated silently that she also
was readyto listen he trusted she would not have a stroke when she
heard what he was about to propose
it may seem a very sudden decision on my part mrs carrington he
began but i wish to take stella into my own keeping
at once mrs carrington was all gracious acquiescence ellen he had
spoken to ellen
perhaps i can guess the means by which you intend to bring about such
an excellent solution of our difficulties she remarked with an arch
expression that struck him as grotesque and before he could continue
she added i may tell you that i had my suspicions ten years ago
good heavens what could she mean i may also say that in my opinion
nothing could be more suitable
i am afraid we are at cross purposes said colonel crayfield
carefully from his own standpoint he felt that the marriage could
hardly be termed suitable though the gain for the girl was
undeniable
then will you kindly explain demanded mrs carrington
certainly it is my intention to marry your granddaughter
grandmamma stared at him then she grabbed her stick and struck it
sharply on the ground my good man are you in your senses she cried
do you realise that stella is not only a child but that she has bad
blood in her veins that such an unnatural union could only result in
disaster now if it had been ellen her aunt
the old ladys natural reserve had been blown as by a volcano sky
high
so that was the idea colonel crayfield only just saved himself from
laughing aloud
but you see he said lightly it is not miss ellenfortunately for
me since i fear she would hardly welcome me as a suitor
mrs carrington ignored this playful attitude it is a preposterous
idea you are not a young man have you considered the cost and the
risk her voice was severe
why he argued judicially should there be any risk as you call
it after all i am not such a methuselah and surely you can trust me
to safeguard my wifes honour and happiness as well as my own
in the present no doubt but what about the end of it all in ten
even twenty years time stella will still be a young woman while
you her pause was cruelly pointed
colonel crayfield glowered confound the old devil there must be an end
to this croaking these distasteful forebodings assuming indifference
he stretched out his legs the chair wobbled ominously and rising with
precautionary haste he began to pace backwards and forwards before his
aged adversary her opposition was so unexpected
it seems to me he said keeping his temper with an effort that
stella would be infinitely better off as my wife than if she stayed
here perhaps to marry beneath her perhaps never to marry at all i
cant take her to india as my ward or as my adopted daughter im not
quite old enough for that
how old are you inquired grandmamma spitefully
not much over fifty he told her with disarming readiness and i
flatter myself that i am young for my age i am well off i am willing
to make suitable provision for my widow what more can you want he
spoke now with truculence
well i suppose you must cut your own throat if you are so minded
said grandmamma but perhaps stella may not care to marry a man old
enough to be her fathereven to stretch a point her grandfather
we shall see was his confident answer
the old lady sat silent she was deeply disappointed so convinced had
she felt that it was ellen he was after and that stella would be going
to india beneath ellens safe wing it was so seldom her wishes were
thwarted so seldom her disapproval of anything bore no weight
presently she said and when do you suggest that this extraordinary
marriage should take place
just as soon as it can all be arranged i may say that i wish to be
responsible for stellas outfitindeed for all expenses
mrs carringtons expression became a little less disagreeable money
was not plentiful at the chestnuts after all no one could deny that in
a way it was a good enough chance for the child but settlements must be
certain if stella got into trouble there must be no returning her
penniless to her people disgraced into the bargain
i can only give my consent provided that stella will be perfectly
secure financially whatever happens in the future
colonel crayfield smiled it was as mrs carrington felt a smile that
was covertly insulting when i have spoken to stella he said slowly
i shall return to london and make proper arrangements with my lawyer
my intentions will be submitted to you and i hardly imagine you will
find fault with them
very well then there is no more to be said at present but do not
forget that i have warned you
i appreciate your concern on my behalf mrs carrington but believe
me i think you are unduly apprehensive
let us hope so said mrs carrington grimly and it was a relief to
them both when at this moment augusta stepped out of the drawingroom
to remind her mother that luncheon would soon be on the table to
suggest that the sun was rather powerful and would it not be wiser for
mamma to come indoors
chapter v
after all colonel crayfield was driven to proposing in the kitchen
garden stella was sent there when luncheon was over to pick more
fruit for jammaking that serious ceremony being now at its height not
even the presence of an important guest in the house could be permitted
to delay its progress colonel crayfield volunteered in public to help
his goddaughter ellens pale eyes flickered grandmamma was coldly
silent only augusta who as yet was ignorant of his intentions
uttered conventional protests why should he trouble it was so hot out
of doors stella was well used to the little task and required no
helpwould he not prefer to sit quiet with a book or the paper
colonel crayfield was equally punctiliousno trouble a pleasure
though unfortunately unversed in the business of fruit picking for
jam he would feel it a privilege to be allowed to contribute his share
of assistance and so on
at last the pair set off armed with huge baskets towards the
sunblistered door let into the old brick wall of the garden
i will join you as soon as i can augusta called after them kindly
i hope she wont said colonel crayfield to the malicious delight of
stella who promptly echoed the hope for the first time she felt
reconciled to the tedious duty for surely now was her chance to coax
colonel crayfield into giving her at least some sort of notion as to
what was to happen
as they opened the rickety door he contrived to touch her hand gently
again as they closed it behind them then rather to his discomposure
she suddenly slipped her hand confidingly into his
do tell me she urged i know youve got some plan up your sleeve
she found her hand tightly imprisoned you are sure you want to go to
india he asked her
you know ive told youits the dream of my life
as a governess or a missionary
oh dont be so tiresomeas anything
well he restrained himself still
go on she cried with impatience
how would you like to go to india with me
with you
yeshe dropped his basket snatched hers from her grasp and flung it
to the ground now he was holding both her hands yes with me
stellaas my wife
had the old redbrick walls of the garden fallen flat around her she
could hardly have felt more astounded involuntarily she wrenched her
hands free clasped them behind her backed away from him
he advanced upon her now now little girl what is the matter isnt
it all quite simple you told me yourself there was no one here you
could marry didnt you and now here is someone who wants you who
will take you to india and give you everything in the world you could
wish for
imim so surprised
it was just what silly ellen carrington had said damn it all couldnt
the child understand that she was being given the chance of her
lifetime
come comeisnt it a pleasant surprise
she grew white then red i never thought of such a thing she
exclaimed in agitated apology
of course not why should you i quite understand but its easy enough
to think of noweh
her hesitation inflamed him further he hungered to kiss her to hold
her in his armsthe first and as long as he lived the last man to do
so next moment his lips were on hers she was enfolded crushed to his
big body almost suffocated and to his intense satisfaction she made no
resistance
to stella it was like all she had heard about drowning when a multitude
of impressions and memories were said to invade the mind in a
miraculously short space of time maud verrall and her love adventures
and engagement the spotty youth outside the greystones gate young
capper the farmer the lumber room at the chestnuts and her thirst for
india and oddly above all the words of the familiar hymn that of a
sudden had exasperated her those many sundays ago seemed to beat time to
the recollections
     i dare not choose my lot
       i would not if i might
she was barely conscious of the present hardly even of the determined
embrace that held her fast only the past seemed real and it was the
past that won when he released her flushed and breathless she knew
she had dared to choose her lot once and for all she was in the grip of
a wild excitement she stella carrington was to be married like maud
verrall and she was going to india to india the doorway of life was
unlocked at last presenting a wondrous vista entrancing
irresistible then blocking the doorway she saw colonel crayfield
bulky triumphant a masterful smile on his face
well isnt it all right and again he drew her to him this time
gently protectively and with his arm about her they sauntered among
the vegetables and fruit bushes while he held forth concerning the
future stella hearkening as in a dream she knew he was speaking of his
position of horses and clothes of a piano and a pearl necklace but
it was of india she was thinking as she hung on his arm in childlike
gratitude was he not granting her the desire of her heart
you are a sort of fairy godfather she told him laughing perhaps
not exactly a fairymore of a santa claus i think i must call you
santasahib
call me what you like but doesnt it spell satan as well
that will come in useful when you are disagreeable cross with me
i shall never be cross with you my jewel my pet
oh it was all delightful almost too good to be true
but what about grandmamma he said that grandmamma knew
so you have made it all right with her she exclaimed with the kind
of sensation that is engendered by some lucky escape how clever of him
he was a wonder her saviour her deliverer true he was neither young
nor a picture but one could not have everything and stella told
herself she was going to be quite as happy as maud verrall very likely
far happier
just fancy she sighed ecstatically and if i had only known what was
coming when you found me in the larder isnt it a mercy that we both
like onions do tell me when did you think of your ripping plan
the first moment i set eyes on you at the station he declared
untruthfully
oh then now i know why you looked at me like that
like what
you didand then under the oak tree too i felt there was something
bright little star hiding a smile he raised her hand and kissed each
pink fingertip with deliberate enjoyment
chapter vi
i got your letter wrote stella to maud verrall and am awfully glad
about your news though at the time it made me feel simply green with
envy how little i thought i should have some news to tell you when i
answered it dont faint but your little friend is also engaged and
going to india i could turn head over heels with joy perhaps we shall
meet next as married ladies wouldnt it be fun if we went out in the
same ship my fianc is a big tall man much older than me but i dont
mind that a bit there is something rather romantic i think in the
idea of a husband a good deal older than oneself he hasnt got a beard
and is not at all bald i like him very much and he spoils me
frightfully before we sail i am to have singing lessons and learn to
ride and he says i can order what clothes i like he is giving me a
real pearl necklace his name is colonel crayfield so my initials will
still be the same old betty says that is unlucky but i dont believe
her nothing could be unlucky that gets me to india its all like a
heavenly dream only a dream that will go on no waking up to find
myself stuck at the chestnuts with nothing to hope for but deadliness
evermore i suppose i am an ungrateful pig i know grandmamma and the
aunts are fond of me and of course i am fond of them but i can think
of nothing but my own good luck they dont seem altogether pleased
about it i cant imagine why except that they never have wanted me to
enjoy myself i really believe they think its wicked to be pleased
about anything but the garden and sermons and the weather however i
dont care i am going to india and nothing else matters on this
earth
so the heavenly dream continued unmarred by the odd lack of sympathy
displayed by grandmamma and the aunts and if anything enhanced by the
departure of colonel crayfield for london his absence left stella more
free to indulge her fancies to lose herself in visions to revel
almost as though drugged in blissful imaginings her betrothed sent
presents and frequent letters that though short were fervent and
added to the glamour
thus time flew by till the day of the marriage which took place very
quietly in the little old church the ceremony was performed by canon
grass in a manner as stella afterwards declared that was more
befitting a funeral than a wedding she attributed his lugubrious voice
and demeanour to the fact that the unfortunate gentleman was so
illmated himself mrs grass attended the service in her invalid chair
and looked like a rag dollpoor thing and poor canon grass grandmamma
did not even have a new bonnet and might have been a graven image aunt
augusta behaved as if they were all doing something wrong and of
course aunt ellen wept
stella thought it really very horrid of them when she herself was
feeling so jubilant and dear old santasahib was so nice and so kind
and looked almost a picture in his new clothes he had grown a little
thinner which was a great improvement she wore the pearl necklace his
wedding giftit was lovely why did everybody but santasahib seem to
wish to damp her spirits to put a spoke in the wheel of her pleasure
of course there was no reception no fuss that she had not expected
all she would have liked and resented not having received was just a
little sympathy with her state of joya little acknowledgment of her
good fortune
they drove straight from the church to the station to catch the express
for london and from then onwards the dream became rather more
harassing than heavenly stella found herself in a sumptuous hotel
there was a ladys maid a smart person engaged by colonel crayfield
until the date of their sailing who embarrassed her she was confused
dismayed by revelations that it appeared were inseparable from
matrimony and therefore had to be accepted as a sort of tollbar on the
road to india the weeks were packed with ceaseless activities singing
lessons riding lessons dressmakers restaurants shops theatres
it was actually a relief to the overtaxed bride when they had sped
across the continent via brindisi to settle down on the big p  o
steamer that throbbed and smelt and was so strange yet proved a
paradise of rest and peace compared with london there were not so many
passengersit was early in the seasonbut everyone was interested in
young mrs crayfield they were all very kind and friendly her
deckchair was always surrounded her singing was a great success and
though santasahib was tiresome in forbidding her to dance or take part
in theatricals on board ship she had an extremely pleasant voyage
they landed at bombay and oh the rainbowcoloured crowds the
splendour the white shining buildings the spicy intoxicating warmth
it was all entrancing to stella oddly familiar and yet so novel how
quaint the contradictions of the queen of cities such a mixture of
dignity and squalor the best hotel was barracklike comfortless not
overclean insects dotted the walls there were flies in myriads
doubtful food yet at that period it was the only possible refuge for
european travellers coming and going
santasahib grumbled and scolded but stella said what on earth did
comfort and food and cleanliness matter were they not in india to
her all the sights and sounds the merciless sun the dust and the
clamour even the smells were thrilling roberts head servant was
there to meet them an elderly importantlooking native his name was
sher singh and he had secured an ayah for the memsahib a good class
mohammedan woman who knew her work and understood a little english
stella appreciated her quiet movements her deft attentions and was not
overawed by champa as she had been by the grand maid in london the
ayahs attitude towards the sahib entertained her it was full of such
humble and modest reverence she would warn her mistress of the sahibs
approach as though for the coming of an emperor turn aside bashfully
when he entered the room and draw her wrapper over her face but sher
singh to stella there was something vaguely sinister about the
bombastic figure that held a weird elusive reflection of his masters
bearing and outline the man seemed to watch her furtively and though
he anticipated her wishes obeyed her least sign she felt that beneath
his diligent obsequious care there lay a smouldering resentment
im sure sher singh is jealous of me she told her husband he looks
on me as an interloper its only natural i suppose after his long
service with you as a bachelor but it makes me uncomfortable
nonsense he said sharply sher singh is an invaluable servant
whatever you do dont quarrel with him its all your fancyyou dont
understand natives
some day i shall i mean to
well dont begin by misunderstanding sher singh i couldnt do without
him
there was a note of finality in his voice it sounded to stella almost
as though he would prefer to part with her than with sher singh she
determined to banish the little rasp from her mind after all what did
it matter it should not interfere with her enjoymentsher singh was
only a servant
they stayed long enough in bombay to dine at the yacht club to visit
the caves of elephanta so old so mysterious to spend a day with an
english merchant prince a friend of colonel crayfields in his palace
on malabar hill and then came the journey upcountry days and nights
in the train passing from tropical temperature to chilly dawns first
rushing through scenery grand and austere dorlike in its peaks and
valleys wondrous in the crimson sunset afterwards vast yellow plains
relieved by patches of cultivation villages grovesmightily
monotonous except for the time when she slept and when they alighted
at echoing stations for unpalatable meals stella did not cease to gaze
from the windows of their compartment the crowds on the platforms of
big junctions and wayside haltingplaces were fascinating the family
groups the varied clothing the halfnaked sellers of fruit and
sweetmeats the pushing the shouting the flurry
it was midnight when they reached rassih the branch line had but lately
been completed and the railway station was little more than a short
strip of unfinished platform the stationmaster a fat babu received
the travellers with elaborate civility and outside a curious
conveyance awaited themlike a broad low dogcart hooded drawn by a
pair of white bullocks all horns and humps and pendulous dewlaps
stella never forgot her first transit through the slumbering city the
little caves of shops some dimly illumined the occasional glimpses of
figures squatting muffled and shapeless or stretched on rude bedsteads
from upper storeys floated snatches of sleepy song and the faint twang
of stringed instruments pariah dogs nosed and snarled in the gutters
beneath the general somnolence lay a ceaseless subdued undercurrent of
sound that seemed to mingle with stale odours of spice and rancid oil
above it all the slateblue sky pressed low deeply clear besprinkled
with stars
the tonga skirted a high wall cutting through dust so deep that its
progress was hardly audible turned in through a gateless arch and
halted before a massive towering building stella weary yet excited
followed her husband up a steep flight of stone steps that terminated in
a vast whitewashed vestibule there were countless doors all open
screened with short portires it was cold gloomy dim none of the
lamps that hung on the walls had been turned up the silence was
oppressive cheerless
robert muttering angrily strode ahead and stumbled over a form that
lay swathed corpselike in one of the doorways a scene ensued that to
stella was horrifying the corpselike figure sprang up with a wild yell
of alarm and was cuffed and abused by the sahib the noise brought a
scampering of bare feet and a swarm of people hastily binding on
turbans adjusting garments it appeared that the servants had all been
asleep that preparations for the sahibs arrival were not even begun
the air shook with the wrath of the sahib he would listen to no
explanations the offenders ran hither and thither there was confusion
consternation
stella stood by silent trembling she was appalled by her husbands
exhibition of rage he might murder one of these defenceless people it
seemed even possible that at any moment he might turn upon her and kick
and beat and abuse her also what a ghastly arrival then all at
once there was peace sher singh had arrived with the luggage and in no
time refreshments were on the table the diningroom big as a ballroom
blazed with light the sahibs fury subsided
to stellas astonishment the servants conducted themselves as if nothing
extraordinary had happened and all went well robert made no excuse or
apology for his anger apparently he was unconscious of having behaved
as it seemed to her like a madman he ate and drank with complacence
asking questions quite amiably at intervals of the rotund attendant who
was evidently chief of the table staff while stella unable for very
fatigue to swallow food sipped her tea and looked about her with dazed
interest what high walls washed a pale brick colour how bare the
great room just a big table and clumsy wooden chairs with arms and cane
seats on the floor was a sort of thick drugget it felt hard beneath
her feet a wood fire had been lighted in a wide open grate it smelt
fragrant comforting stellas eyes drooped the whiteclad figures
of the servants grew blurred to her vision robert himself still eating
heartily seemed to recede in a mist then suddenly there arose from
somewhere outside a succession of bloodcurdling yells and she
started wide awake laid hold of roberts arm oh what is it she
cried in alarm someone is being killed
he laughed and patted her hand reassuringly its only hyenas and
jackals he told her youll hear it every nightsoon get used to
it
hyenas and jackals wild beasts she would have gazed at in a zoo with
wondering interest were here close by and no more to be heeded than if
they had been stray dogs she remembered that this was india the weird
noise fired her fancy and mingled with her dreams that night
she awoke next morning to a very different sound the cooing of doves
bright hard sunlight streamed through the long doorwindows she found
she had slept late champa bringing tea said the sahib had already
gone out had left orders that the memsahib was not to be disturbed
then she bathedin a bathroom that resembled a prison cell the tub was
of zinc and there was a row of red earthenware vessels for the cold
water stella thought them very artistic how mrs daw would love to
paint on them paint storks and sprays of appleblossom and fill them
with dried bulrushesthe very thing for a bazaar but there was
nothing that could by any possibility be considered artistic about the
bedroom the beds were just wooden frames not even enamelled or
painted two enormous cupboards stood against the walls the fireplace
was a cavern the dressingtable was more suited to a kitchen and there
were a few clumsy chairs matching those of the diningroom it was with
a slight feeling of desolation that she began to explore the house in
the drawingroom was a certain amount of wicker furniture with loose
cretonne covers of an ugly pattern a pair of handsome screens and two
or three richly carved tables the diningroom she avoided having
caught sight of servants laying the table she felt shy of encountering
them she peeped into other rooms all of them equally bare and
enormous comfortlesseven the one she supposed must be roberts study
since it had a businesslike table in the centre covered with papers
and yet there was something exhilarating in the airiness in the sense
of space the hard brilliance of the sunshine outside the unfamiliar
scents and sounds that seemed to float everywhere her spirits rose as
she wandered out on to a balcony almost wide enough for a dogcart and
gazed over a limitless landscape studded with low bushes and in the
foreground a few ruins of what might have been mosques or dwellings or
tombs the flat country stretching for miles to the dusty horizon was
impressive in its very persistence and sameness that was without
relief save for here and there a pillar of dust that swirled upwards
waltzing madly for a moment as though demonpossessed then she watched
a more steady dustcloud of a different form that was wending its way
slowly among the clumps of scrub and stunted bushes and presently there
came into view a string of camels led by a great beast hung with gaudy
trappings ridden by a figure swathed in white garments heavily
turbaned on they came a silent stately procession moving as though
to the rhythm of a funeral march men striding beside them in flowing
garments or seated between the great bales slung on either side of the
camels humps one or two baby camels shambled along by their
mothersawkward woolly creatures the size of colts with legs that
appeared too long for their bodies
fascinated stella watched the cavalcade till it vanished in a cloud of
dust then she walked to the end of the balcony and looked over the
parapet down a drop that made her feel giddy there was nothing below
but heaps of rough stones and bricks coarse grass and thorn trees
again she glanced over the waterless waste burning drab and drear in
the hot sunshine and suddenly she thought of the common at home of the
green turf the gorse and the bracken the blue distances she wondered
what grandmamma and the aunts were doing at that moment she remembered
the smooth lawn and the cedar tree the little stream the unwelcome
pang of homesickness was discomforting but it did not last long as
she turned away the realisation that she was in india that the life she
so desired had begun came back to her forcibly and soon she was
finding pleasure in the garden in watching the pair of small white
bullocks that drew water from a well in a big leather bucket like a
gigantic spongebag in strolling among the shrubs that flamed with
blossom scarlet yellow pink there was an orange grove too with
real fruit on the trees gleaming golden among glossy foliage flights of
green parrots flew screaming above her head gaycrested little birds
hopped and scuffled in the dust at her feet small grey squirrels
scampered in every direction was there anything at the chestnuts to
compare with it all
santasahib was in good humour when he returned they had a wonderful
breakfast at midday a curry of chicken with snowy rice boiled to
perfection and served separately not as a border round some rchauff
which was old bettys conception of a curry other dishes were numerous
and fruit was in abundanceoranges custard apples loquats also
delicious little scones afterwards robert took her into the
drawingroom and told her she could spend what she liked on it said he
had ordered a piano from calcutta it ought to arrive in a day or two
now he was sure she would wish to have pretty chintz and silk
cushions and new curtains when she asked him if it would not all cost
too much money he laughed and kissed her called her his baby sher
singh was summoned and was bidden to send for a silk merchant from the
bazaar and to engage a durzeya male person whose duty it would be
to sit in the veranda all day and make curtains and cushions and chair
covers and anything else the memsahib might desire stella felt like a
princess in a fairy tale
during the next few days the ladies of the station called on the
commissioners bride mrs cuthell wife of the deputy commissioner
came first she was a homely human being anxious to be kind but her
goodnatured intentions were leavened by a natural resentment that her
husbands superior in the service should have married anyone so junior
in years to herself she said she hoped mrs crayfield would not find
her position too difficult of course she would have much to learn
hitherto she remarked i have been the principal lady she forced a
smile now i shall be obliged to take a back seat we were all so
surprised when we heard that colonel crayfield was bringing out a wife
we had looked on him as a confirmed bachelor certainly we did not
expect a wife as youthful as yourself
its a fault i shall grow out of perhaps pleaded stella meekly and
afterwards mrs cuthell told mrs piggott the police officers wife
that she thought the new bride was rather a cheeky chit mrs piggott
made haste to ascertain the truth of this opinion for herself stella
found her a more entertaining visitor than mrs cuthell though perhaps
less likeable mrs cuthell she felt meant to be motherly whereas
mrs piggott who also seemed quite middleaged to stella assumed the
attitude of a contemporary she had sharp eyes a sharp tongue and
endless stories to tell of the other folk in the station how the paynes
post office brought up their children so badly talked nothing but
hindustani to them what a lot of money the taylors canals wasted
getting their stores from bombay and things out from homeif they ever
paid for them at all and had mrs crayfield seen the antoniosdr
antonio and his wife and daughter old antonio had been an apothecary at
the time of the mutiny and had somehow hung on to the position of civil
surgeon ever sincehe had been years and years at rassih the
government was only too glad to leave him there regardless of the
feelings of the rest of the station why they were practically natives
and it was believed they smoked hookahscertainly their house smelt
like it pussy the daughter no chicken had been doing her best to
marry young smithson the taylors assistant but she mrs piggott
had warned the young man with the result that just as the antonios were
expecting him to propose every moment he had fled into camp if only
the antonios could know they would never speak to her again
and no great loss added mrs piggott except that in such a small
station its a pity to have rows then there are the fosters railway
people they are inclined to give themselves airs because they have a
little money of their own which is unusual in india but you will see
them all for yourself my dear of course you will come to the club we
all play tennis there every evening and have tea and pegs and look at
the english papers
i suppose so said stella doubtfully but my husband hasnt said
anything about it
you must cure him of his dull habits hitherto he has only had some of
the men to play tennis with him on his own courts which of course are
firstrate but its rather unsociable of him he must not expect you
to hold yourself aloof from the rest of us now if he wont bring you
himself to the club just let me know and i can always pick you up on my
way
mrs piggott saw herself envied by the station as young mrs crayfields
bosom friend she took the first opportunity of telling mrs cuthell
whom she detested that mrs crayfield had been perfectly sweet to her
when she called had asked her advice on all kinds of points and had
taken her into her bedroom to show her the trousseau and the jewellery
etcall of which by the way was untrue but mrs piggott considered
the falsehoods worth while since it annoyed mrs cuthell and made her
jealous
stella thought she would like to belong to the club but to her
surprise when robert came to the drawingroom for tea and she
mentioned the subject he said he did not wish her to make herself
cheap he disapproved of the club gatheringsa lot of gossiping women
and silly young men once a weekwhichever day she liked to selectshe
could be at home to the whole station their own tennis courts were in
excellent order and there was no occasion to become intimate with
anyone
you will return their calls of course he continued and we must
give a couple of dinner parties and there will be your weekly
reception that will be quite enough now go and get on your habit and
well have a ride
stella obeyed feeling rather crestfallen the programme sounded dull
was she never to make any friends and what was roberts objection to
all these people surely she and robert were not so superior themselves
as to warrant such splendid isolation however for the moment she made
no protest the recollection of her husbands violence on the night of
their arrival was still with her she feared to provoke him but there
would seem to be drawbacks to the position of chief lady of the
station according to roberts idea of its fulfilment
she forgot her vexation in the delight of mounting the handsome chestnut
mare that was to be her own property and in the softening sunshine
they skirted the high wall of the city and trotted along the unmetalled
footway of the main road beneath splendid trees planted at equal
distances apart they passed a few compounds with thatched bungalows
standing well back from the dusty road these dwellings looked humble in
comparison with the palace on the old fort walls that commanded the
huddled bazaar and the scattered european habitations beyond they met
native vehicles packed with passengers and riders of miserable ponies
dismounted making obeisance as the commissioner sahib went by low
narrow carts crowded with women and children and merchandise creaked
along lazily in the middle of the road
then they turned from this main thoroughfare and galloped along a broad
grassgrown canal bank flanked on one side with luxuriant plantations
on the other dull green water flowed steadily silently bearing life
to the villages and crops below crossing a bridge they rode to a
village where colonel crayfield wished to make some inquiries connected
with his administration and stella watched keenly interested while
the headman a patriarch with a long hennadyed beard hurried forth to
make his report followed by a rabble of peasants who gathered at a
respectful distance to gape at the spectacle of an englishwoman on
horseback now and then a naked child would run boldly into the open
only to be hauled back shrieking by relations whose reproaches were as
piercing as the culprits lamentations
the memsahib gazed at it all absorbed she was sorry when her husband
raised his whip to his hat in farewell salutation to the headman and
they turned their backs on the village and the eager excited little
crowd their return was by a different route which to stellas secret
interest took them past the club gardens tennis was in progress and
the spectators were seated in chairs collected around a refreshment
table every head was turned in the direction of the riders the club
members seemed as eager to behold the lady on horseback as had been the
villagers it was pleasing to stella to find herself the object of so
much human curiosity
chapter vii
it was the day of mrs crayfields first garden party what struck
stella as an extraordinary form of invitation had gone forth by hand a
notice with mrs crayfield at home and the chosen date inscribed in
large copperplate by a clerk in the commissioners office below was
written please write seen and then came a column of names the whole
of the visitable community of rassih this document came back duly
initialled by all but one or two inaccessible bachelors who were out in
the district on duty stella expressed a nervous hope that everyone
would come and inquired what preparations she ought to make
trust them to come scoffed robert and dont worry yourself about
preparations the servants know what to do
and indeed the servants capabilities seemed miraculous tennis nets
were fixed the courts marked out correctly tables became covered with
cakes and sandwiches tea and coffee spirits and liqueurs multitudes
of sodawater bottles there was fresh lemonade and claretcup all far
more imposing than even the yearly flowershow at the vicarage at home
that was patronised by the whole county stella felt there ought to be a
band in attendance as well she dressed herself in a soft white gown
and a lace hat that had cost santasahib a fabulous sum in london then
she stood for a few moments on the raised plinth overlooking the garden
to watch sher singh giving orders and directions on the tennis ground
below nothing had been forgotten the row of cane chairs had little
strips of carpet in front of them and a group of small native boys
clothed in white with red caps and red belts stood ready till they
should be wanted to retrieve the balls and all this was to happen every
week
santasahib came out and stood beside her bulky cheerful in clean
flannels smoking a long cheroot
turn round little girl he commanded lets have a look at you
she turned and bobbed him a curtsey he regarded her from head to foot
with a proprietary air of satisfaction yet he was silent and stella
inquired anxiously if she would do
just as well perhaps that were not in a big station he exclaimed
half laughing half serious or it would take me all my time to look
after you
but shall we be here always she asked
the longer the better he answered shortly and no careering off to
the hills mind unless of course
unless what do tell me
unless your health makes it necessary
my health but im as strong as a horse what do you mean
what i say my good child thank goodness you are a fine healthy
young woman and that old antonios strong point is maternity cases
the blood flew to her face and down again to her toes such a
possibility at which she now understood he was hinting had never
presented itself to her mind she felt horrified frightened as though
caught in a trap did robert expect it of her how cruel of him to talk
like this just when she was so content and lighthearted looking forward
to her garden party to everything in the future a baby she knew
nothing about children and if she did have a child it would she felt
sure be exactly like santasahibplain and solid and red why on
earth couldnt one be married without all that sort of thing
she heard robert say why whats the matter and she looked up to
find his small hard eyes fixed on her with a quizzical expression that
disturbed her still further
nothing she replied uneasily turning from him to hide her distress
look theres somebody arriving hadnt we better go down
its beard the missionary and his wife and im hanged if they
havent brought their family with them
an odd little party was scrambling from an antiquated pony carriage mr
beard in a long black coat white trousers and a pith hat shaped like
a half of a football mrs beard in a voluminous gown of some green
material and three little girls who all wore sunhats as wellhats so
large that they appeared to rest on the childrens shoulders
stella hastened down the steps in front of her husband to greet the
guests who were now arriving in force to her relief mrs cuthell so
to speak took command and proceeded to make up the sets for tennis
explaining that she knew how everyone played which of course mrs
crayfield could not and soon the courts were filled with vigorous
people running and shouting tennis balls flew the little boys darted
after them nonplayers gathered in knots about the tables or settled
in the easy chairs and it was all very pleasant and cheerful stella
feeling excited and important set herself to do duty as hostess she
conversed with mrs beard and duly admired the three little girls who
hung round their mother two were twins the third was only a year
younger which accounted for their all looking about the same age and
size mrs beard said that the number of native christians in the rassih
district was on the increase she hoped mrs crayfield would visit the
school and distribute prizes stella then listened to mrs antonios
artless admiration of her daughter pussy who played tennis well and
was certainly a handsome creature with rich colouring and brilliant dark
eyes why mrs piggott should have branded the antonios as practically
natives stella could not quite understand though they seemed
different it was true from the rest of the official community and
they spoke with a curious accent dr antonio was a stumpy
goodhumoured person with a large stomach about which he had bandaged a
crimson silk sash he had long straggling whiskers obviously dyed and
a dark puffy face mrs antonio was sallow and thin and had regular
features inherited by her daughter whom she adored with the frankest
extravagance she was drawing mrs crayfields attention to pussys
perfect complexion when mrs piggott joined the group and remarked
pointedly that mrs fosters sister who was playing tennis in the same
set with pussy was to be envied her lovely white skin fair hair and
blue eyes
but how pastee objected mrs antonio she had a nice colour in her
cheeks when she came out last year from home now it is all gone while
my pussy she is like a rose
well you see said mrs piggott with the air of a kindly
instructress pussy is accustomed to the climate you must remember
that she has never been to england
stella glanced nervously at mrs antonio but pussys mother merely
nodded complacently and turned to her hostess my pussy she is so
healthy and strong it is luckee for this is a very hot place mrs
crayfield
so i understand returned stella politely and then mrs antonio began
to talk about punkah coolies and their perversities during the hot
season and alluded to something called tatties mrs piggott bemoaned
the difficulty of procuring ice when it was most needed mrs beard
said with selfrighteous resentment that mission people had to
endure the heat without such alleviations and mrs antonio confessed
that ice gave her pain at stomach but that pussy liked to suck lumps
which was bad for her prettee teeth
during this dull conversation among their elders the beard children
took courage and wandered afield they made for a big mango tree behind
which they appeared to find some attraction
as each set of tennis came to an end the players gathered about the
refreshment tables trays were handed round by the whiteclad servants
under the authoritative supervision of sher singh and suddenly mrs
antonio transferred her attention from pussy to colonel crayfields
bearer
that man how does he behave to you mrs crayfield dear she
inquired with genuine if inquisitive solicitude
stella resented the question conscious as she was of her subordination
to the rule of sher singh she felt sensitively suspicious that the
little gang of ladies were one and all aware of her humiliating
position
he seems to be a very good servant she replied evasively and he is
devoted to my husband
mrs cuthell joined in oh yes and colonel crayfield to him everyone
knows that but all the same bachelors old servants are invariably
antagonistic to a mistress its a mistake to keep them when you have
learnt something about indian housekeeping you will find out how he has
been feathering his nest all these years
it was mrs piggotts turn next how well i remember the bother i had
with my husbands old khansamah when first we were married he used to
commit endless atrocities and then declare he had only obeyed my
orders edward always believed him however i soon put my foot down and
got rid of him there was such a row
i go to the bazaar myself said mrs beard somewhat irrelevantly
and do my own marketing
ah but of course your servants are christians argued mrs piggott
covert contempt in her tone and we all know what that means
mrs beard reddened which shows how lamentably ignorant you all are
she retorted you think that because a native is a christian that he
must be a rogue i admit that he generally is a rogue to start with but
not because he is a christian it is because unfortunately our
converts are mostly drawn from a class that has nothing to lose by
embracing the true religion people who are outcasts by birth cut off
from all spiritual advantages oppressed and despised jungle folk
gypsies many of them thieves by profession and such like so far we
have hardly tapped the better born classes and whenever we do it is a
real triumph for they have everything to lose from a worldly point of
view but we know we must begin from the bottom and work upwards and
already great progress has been made though it is necessarily slow and
the fight is often disheartening
stella looked at the faded dowdy little woman with a new interest mrs
beard and her husband were working for india doing great work just as
great in its way as the carringtons had done in the past and as their
kind were doing in the present she wished she could help the beards by
engaging a whole staff of christian converts as servants but so far she
was powerless there was nothing she could do and as the atmosphere had
become slightly uncomfortable she was about to try and change the
subject when to her relief a diversion was caused by mrs beards
discovery that her offspring were disporting themselves behind the mango
tree with some native children though surely according to mission
theories mrs beard should have felt no displeasure
martha mary deborah she called sternly come here at once
this summons was not obeyed but apparently it caused an animated
argument between the padres children and their oriental playmates
again mrs beard raised a voice of command and presently martha and
mary and deborah emerged from the shelter of the tree escorting a small
brown boy attired in a red cotton garment and an embroidered skull cap
mother shouted the three little girls in chorus this dear boy wants
to come to our school we will make him a christian maynt we
to their mortified astonishment this praiseworthy plan did not meet with
the encouragement it deserved the commissioners head servant pounced
on the redcoated pagan and took him howling loudly from his friends
stella rose sher singh she called angrily let the child alone of
course the man heard her order must have known though perforce she
had spoken in english what she wished him to do but he paid no
attention just bore the child kicking and screaming towards the
servants quarters
martha and mary and deborah ran to their mother and buried their faces
in her skirt stella looked round for robert he was drinking a whisky
and soda regardless of the scene mrs cuthell laid a restraining hand
on her arm its quite right mrs crayfield she said with reassuring
inflection the servants children must be kept in the background
otherwise they would swarm all over the place
but stella felt she had been publicly flouted by sher singh and though
for the moment she was helpless she resolved to tell robert when the
party should be over that for the future she expected sher singh to
obey her meantime while mrs cuthell made up fresh sets of tennis she
apologised prettily to mrs beard
but when the guests had all departed with many gratifying assurances of
their enjoyment her courage dwindled since the night of her arrival at
rassih she had dreaded roberts anger the unpleasant memory remained
with her so vividlythe uproar the helpless alarm of the servants her
own fear and dismay never before in the whole course of her sheltered
existence had she seen anyone so angry and now were she to protest
against sher singhs behaviour what if he should rage at her in the
same manner as he passed into his dressingroom she recognised with a
sinking at her heart that she was afraid of her husband abjectly
afraid ten thousand times more afraid of him then she had ever been of
grandmamma she dared not risk a scene dared not stand up for herself
she would let the matter rest for the present wait till sher singh
disobeyed her again after all perhaps the man had not heard or had
not understood her this afternoon
however towards the end of dinner she happened to look up and catch
sher singh regarding her with an expression of such venomous hatred that
she barely checked an exclamation meeting her astonished gaze he
turned away abruptly to the sideboard and she drew in her breath
shivering when a little later he was pouring port into roberts
glass she observed that his hand shook that his eyes were heavy and
bloodshot there was something strange in his appearance
she tried to dismiss the incident from her mind turned her thoughts to
some advice mrs beard had given her as to studying hindustani at least
she might dare to attack robert on that point it was like being a deaf
person not to understand the words spoken around one and once she had
obtained some command of the language she would be in a position to give
her own orders to the other servants without sher singhs intervention
she waited until they were in the drawingroom and robert had flung
himself into an easy chair to examine some official document he worked
very hard and seemed to think of little else
robert she began softly he did not hear her she repeated his name
and he looked up abstractedly then he lowered the sheets of foolscap
and removed his pincenez
what is it now he inquired with indulgent resignation
can i have lessons in hindustani
why what good would that do you
i want to learn and i have nothing particular to do while you are at
work all day
youve got the piano and you can order what books you want from
bombay havent you any fancy work
she laughed fancy work i want to use my brains
dont talk nonsense what good will hindustani do your brains keep up
your french and music natives respect englishwomen far more if they
cant speak the language
oh robert what a thing to say im sure that cant be true
you know nothing about it you silly child come here
she had risen and was moving restlessly about the room as she passed he
put out his arm and pulled her down on to his knees with a strong
effort she controlled her reluctance realising suddenly aghast that
her distaste for roberts demonstrations of affection was on the
increase that it threatened to develop into actual aversion as he
pressed her face against his shoulder kissing her hair a sort of
desperation seized her she did not love robert had never loved him
and at this moment she almost hated him the question rose in her mind
was it because they had known she was not in love with robert that
grandmamma and the aunts had shown so little sympathy with her marriage
had behaved as if she were doing something reprehensible if so why
had they not warned her yet supposing they had gone so far as to put
probable consequences before her would she have heeded believed them
no she knew well enough that in her headstrong simplicity nothing would
then have turned her from her purpose if anyone was to blame in the
matter it was robert who had married her to please himself only
regardless of her ignorance of life and love even partly perhaps
because of it she recalled a sentence in the letter maud verrall had
written announcing her engagement i am very happy and awfully in
love if only she was in love with robert but she was not she never
could be did he know it not that she believed he would care one way or
the other as long as she submitted to his will in every detail but at
least she did not intend to submit with regard to learning hindustani
more than ever did she feel that congenial occupation of mind was a
necessity that if she could not satisfy her craving for knowledge of
the country she would rather have stayed on at the chestnuts how could
she hope to understand india as far as it was possible for an
englishwoman to do so till she was able to talk to the people she had
already discovered that india for its own sake did not interest robert
he worked hard because he liked work he had a clear hard brain the
mode of existence suited him he appreciated his big pay and the
importance of his position natives were afraid of him and he liked to
inspire fear he never talked to her of his work or of the people and
their histories and religions and now he did not want her to learn the
language beyond the smattering that would suffice for her daily
requirements
however learn it she would and a means though repugnant of gaining
her ends occurred to her bracing her will she slipped her arm about
his neck and laid her lips to his cheek you are satan sahib now
she murmured plaintively i dont like you at all
his grasp of her tightened why what have i done
the first little thing i have ever asked for you refuse me
what was it
good heavens were her wishes so trivial to him that they could pass
from his mind on the spot
she answered his question without betrayal of her resentment that i
should learn hindustani properly
what a little pest well if i say yes how much will you love
santasahib
ever and ever so much she cooed knowing that half measures would be
useless that she must pay and pay fully for what she wanted
all right then we must see about a respectable old munshi who wont
let you work too hard or teach you bad words after all if you must use
what you call your brains it may be better for you than french novels
but remember if youre going to pose as a clever woman ill divorce you
at once
i dont think youll get rid of me quite so easily she laughed the
victory elated her in future she would have no scruple as to this
method of conquest when the object she desired was worth it so she
sipped her first taste of the power of sex hypocrisy scented the
supreme value of feminine arts and wiles
chapter viii
stella was careful to conceal from robert the pleasure she found in her
lessons with the whitebearded hornspectacled patriarch appointed her
tutor having attained her desire through guile she did not intend to
risk deprivation through candour now and then as a precaution she
would allude jokingly to her studies sometimes feigned to be weary of
them implying that only a determination not to be baffled by a
selfimposed task caused her to persevere and robert who regarded the
matter as a whim that would pass made no further obstruction during
the hours while he was safely at office she worked zealously and the
progress she made surprised her unconscious as she was of her own
mental ability soon she could carry on simple conversations with the
old teacher and she forbade champa to speak to her in english greatly
to the disgust of that accomplished female who feared that her prestige
in the compound as interpreter to the memsahib might suffer
champa sulked and in some mysterious fashion seemed to join forces with
sher singh in creating an atmosphere of espionage that to stella was
intensely exasperating did she give an order on her own account it was
caught up at once and repeated elaborately by the ayah if she wandered
in the garden sher singh would follow and when she made objections
both servants professed to misunderstand what she said she felt she was
being harried and was unable to discover the reason never could she
succeed in exploring the servants quarters for sher singh was always
at hand and as robert had bidden her keep away from the low line of
dwellings that swarmed with people like a species of human antheap
disobedience might be reported by sher singh to his master either with
or without intentional spite sometimes mrs cuthell came to see her
also mrs piggott and mrs antonio and during their visits champa
lurked and peeped or sher singh hung about the doorways
these ladies invited mrs crayfield informally to tea or to tiffin but
robert discouraged acceptance said it was better not to start
intimacies as if he were jealous of her possible friendships and
although no real sacrifice was entailed stella made capital out of her
refusalspretended she was foregoing a pleasure for the sole reason
that she wished to follow santasahibs will she told herself she was
growing sinfully deceitful but her apprehension lest her study of the
language should be stopped if she opposed roberts prejudices in any
other direction was stronger than her conscience anything to keep him
amiable sometimes she wondered if she had any conscience left
therefore crayfield remained complacently convinced of his young wifes
devotion she gave him no trouble was apparently content to leave the
household control to sher singh always looked lovely and fresh and
sweettempered and he desired no more wit and wisdom intelligent
conversation on her part would merely have bored him rendered him
vaguely suspicious in his opinion women were better without education
which all the same was not to be confounded with what he regarded as
accomplishments he liked her to sing pretty ballads and play waltzes
he enjoyed singing to her sympathetic accompaniment and when she
attempted to paint flowers and kingfishers and storks or embroider
strips of crash with intricate patterns in coloured cottons on the
lines of mrs daws remembered achievements he criticised the results
with patronising encouragement
thus the days passed smoothly rides in the late afternoon a few formal
dinners to the station the weekly at homes music in the evenings
until shortly before christmas they went into camp on a tour of
inspection this meant double sets of tents quantities of folding
furniture camels and carts and followers innumerable it was a kind of
royal progress they passed from district to district joining camps
with various officials who came within the commissioners jurisdiction
friendly people to be entertained by their chief entertaining him and
his pretty wife in return stella revelled in the long marches on
horseback in the brilliant cold weather the small game shooting
parties in the evenings when work was over and the ever interesting
background of villages crops and cattle she felt that such
compensations made it worth while to be santasahibs plaything
especially as her lessons could be continued with the old munshi who
had somehow provided himself with a tent like a candle extinguisher and
a small cowhocked pony at government expense from him stella gathered
much local lore curious stories of native village life he expounded to
her the system of selfgovernment old as the east she caught glimpses
of an ingrained faith in the power of spells and charms that all went
back to the worship of nature though their origins had long been lost
sight of obscured by time
it was with genuine regret that she returned to the station to settle
down according to robert for the hot weather months rassih looked
dusty and drear after the groves and cultivation of the district the
house felt more vast and oppressive the outlook over the desert was one
endless yellow haze preparations proceeded for the fierce heat that was
at hand punkahs were hung from the ceilings clumsy machines called
thermantidotes made their appearance for the purpose of pumping cooled
air into the rooms when the moment should arrive screens of
sweetscented grass lay piled in the verandas to be erected in the
doorways and kept damp when the west wind should sweep and swirl over
the land by day and often by night as well
the only change that threatened the social community was the coming
departure of the cuthells the transfer took place shortly after the
crayfields return to the station and mrs cuthell paid her farewell
respects to the commissioners wife bursting with satisfaction her
broad face one beam of rejoicing and excitement
i cant describe to you how thankful we are to be leaving this dreadful
place mrs crayfield especially just as the hot weather is beginning
only wait till it is in full blast my dear and then wont you wish you
were out of it too rassih is one of the hottest stations in india and
this house for all its height and space can be a veritable oven its
such luck that we are going to the hills on duty you must ask your
husband to let you come up to us for a visit you will lose your bright
complexion and good spirits and get fever and prickly heat and all the
rest of it if you stay here too long
it is very kind of you rejoined stella unperturbed by these awful
forebodings but im really rather looking forward to the experience
mrs cuthell glanced round the great drawingroom that certainly of
late had undergone much improvement but all the same she gave a little
shudder
well of course you can but try it she croaked but in addition to
definite drawbacks i always feel that this house is so creepy i
suppose on account of its historyall those poor women and children
being murdered here at the time of the mutiny it seems so horrible to
think of the officers cut down on parade and then their families hiding
here on the roof they say the mutineers did not think of looking for
them on the roof and were just leaving the compound when one woman
peeped over the parapet and they saw her of course it was all up with
the poor creatures they were dragged down and murdered it is difficult
to realise that it all happened less than forty years ago
she paused abruptly at the sight of stellas white face and
horrorstricken eyes oh didnt you know she inquired with remorse
im so sorry i spoke of it but i never dreamt
stella gulped down her horror but for the moment all her enthusiasm for
india turned to revulsion that dark page of history had hitherto seemed
so remote so unreal like some tragedy of the middle ages long since
forgotten and forgiven now the fact of its comparative recency the
vision of those defenceless women and children dragged down from the
actual roof that was above her head to be butchered without mercy in
these very rooms affected her acutely how could she exist month after
month in a dwelling that must be saturated with such agonising memories
now if anyone tells you that extraordinary noises are sometimes heard
during the hot weather continued mrs cuthell with the best
intentions dont take any notice i have never believed in ghosts
myself and probably if there are noises they come from the
underground ruinsfalling of masonry and so on
the underground ruins repeated stella what was she to hear next
yes you know one of the old moghul emperorsi forget his namewas
supposed to have dug himself a subterranean livingplace because he was
blindophthalmia no doubt like so many natives anyway all
underneath the house and compound there are said to be tunnels and
chambers and an oil tank and treasure and goodness knows what the
emperor went to war with some neighbouring enemy and got killed so
that he and his followers never came back and what they left
underground nobody knows
and has nobody ever tried to find out asked stella her curiosity
aflame
i believe your husbands predecessor in the appointment got leave to
dig he used the prisoners from the jail but so many accidents
happenedmen fell into holes and broke their limbs or died from the
bad air and were bitten by snakes and in the middle of it all the
commissioner went mad and committed suicide by jumping over the parapet
at the back of the house of course the natives said the digging had
brought bad luck again mrs cuthell feared she had been indiscreet
but you mustnt think of these things she added cheerfully there is
hardly an old house in india that hasnt some unpleasant story and im
sure you are far too sensible to let your mind dwell on anything that
may have happened in the past
it had been far from mrs cuthells intention to leave a legacy of
apprehension and disquietude to the commissioners young wife though
she had never quite forgiven the usurpation of her throne as chief
memsahib of the station by one so much her junior with all her shallow
outlook mrs cuthell owned a wellmeaning disposition and now she
sincerely regretted that in her selfish elation and glee she should have
alarmed and depressed the poor girl however unwittingly as she could
not fail to perceive had been the result of her chatter
now do remember she said with an affectionately repentant farewell
if you find you cant stand the heat you have only to write and say you
are coming to us and we shall be truly delighted to put you up for as
long as you like i mean it
stella murmured her gratitude she divined mrs cuthells selfreproach
and realised the wisdom of her advice not to allow her mind to dwell on
the information so thoughtlessly imparted after all if mrs cuthell
had not divulged the history of the house someone else would have done
so sooner or later it was only a wonder she had not heard it all before
now she freely forgave mrs cuthell and was sorry to see the last of
her had robert allowed her to make a friend she would have chosen mrs
cuthell who at least was simple and true stella did not trust mrs
piggott mrs antonio and pussy were out of the question as intimates
she had nothing in common with mrs beard and she had seen little of
the other ladies none of them had made friendly advances beyond their
first calls and a selfinterested attendance at mrs crayfields weekly
at homes when they were assured of good tennis and refreshments and
an enjoyable afternoon
nevertheless stella had mrs cuthell to thank for a sleepless night
that was followed at intervals by many others she lay awake visualising
horrors listening with dread for extraordinary sounds though she
heard nothing more startling than the usual chorus of jackals and hyenas
outside the snores of a servant in one of the verandas and the
coughing and murmuring of the night guard she made no confession of her
fears to robert for one thing she suspected that his silence
concerning the stories and associations of the place had been due not so
much to consideration for her peace of mind as for his own convenience
and she could well understand his motive a wife with nerves
despondent anxious to escape would not be at all to his taste but her
efforts to conceal her apprehensions and her antipathy to the house only
added to the strain
chapter ix
the cuthells successor was reported to be a bachelor of course mrs
piggott professed to have knowledge of his history even before he
arrived in the station she told mrs crayfield he was a very rising
civilian who was considered far too brilliant to be wasted on ordinary
district administration and therefore it was intended that he should
merely mark time at rassih pending his elevation to some important
appointment
and one can just fancy she added spitefully what a conceited prig
he must be what airs he will give himself and how he will despise us
all i havent a doubt hes about five foot high with short sight and a
head too big for his body cant ride or shoot and is probably the son
of a shopkeeper at tooting or some equally refined locality the sort of
creature who gets into the civil service by cramming to the last ounce
theyll be the ruin of india because the right kind of natives know
they arent sahibs and hate them accordingly while the wrong sort
take advantage of their weak points i hope youll sit on him well mrs
crayfield
stella felt a faint curiosity to view a sample of the competitive system
so condemned by mrs piggott she had also heard her husband deplore the
modern measures that permitted messrs brown jones and robinson to
help govern the most aristocratic country in the world but one morning
within the orthodox and inconvenient hours decreed for first calls in
the east one of the few relics of old john company customs when the
visiting card of mr philip ferguson flint was brought to her it was
followed by no undersized topheavy specimen such as mrs piggott had
described but by a goodlooking fellow not much over thirty with
friendly blue eyes and no trace of airs in his bearing unless a
certain wellbred selfconfidence could be imputed to conceit
philip flint was taken aback in his turn if he had thought about his
chiefs wife at all save as a personage to be called upon without delay
as in duty bound he had certainly foreseen an amiable middleaged
memsahib who would perhaps rescue him goodnaturedly from the
discomforts of the government rest house until he could find suitable
quarters for himself here instead was one of the prettiest girls he
had ever beheld incredibly young unless indeed she was the daughter
not the wife of the commissioner
as he entered she was standing in the centre of the big room a slim
whitegowned figure beneath the slowswaying punkah and its movement
stirred gently the bright little curls on her foreheadadorable curls
and what eyes with thick feathery lashes upcurved at the tips great
csar what luck after all that rassih should have been his portion
and to think how he had grumbled at the prospect of such exile even for
a few months
miss crayfield he said tentatively and at the same moment he caught
sight of her wedding ring the only ring she was wearing i
meancorrecting himself hastily with a sense of acute
disappointmentmrs crayfield solemnly they shook hands then their
eyes met and they both laughed that mutual spontaneous laughter sealed
an instinctive friendship stella waved him to a chair and took one
herself previous to his arrival she had been feeling so languid so
dull now everything was different the very atmosphere became cheerful
the heat less oppressive
you must forgive my mistake he said and his blue eyes twinkled but
it was your fault you dont look quite like a mrs commissioner at
least not the kind i am accustomed to
oh youre not the first person to reproach me for being young stella
told him thinking of mrs cuthell i really shall have to do something
if the hot weather refuses to turn my hair grey
what did the other people say he inquired lightly though in truth he
felt curious to know if these same other people had been men who like
himself were nonplussed by the sight of her beauty and youth
nothing at all nice so perhaps wed better talk about something else
tell me what do you think of rassih
until this morning i thought it a godforsaken hole
she blushed divining the bold insinuation he watched the bright
colour creep into her cheeks delighting in her moment of embarrassment
then he came to her aid with commonplace remarks as to the climate the
surroundings the new railway line
it doesnt strike a newcomer as a tempting spot but it must be
interesting for anyone with a weakness for indian history
oh dont begin about the mutiny and this dreadful old house
protested stella
he glanced at her puzzled but i wasnt thinking so much of the
mutiny did you never hear of george thomas
george thomas who was he
one of the old military adventurers who paved the way for the british
occupation of india he very nearly conquered the punjab and
established himself in this district coining his own rupees and
manufacturing his own arms and ammunition and he was always for his
king and country but he failed beaten by the french under perron and
through treachery among his native followers also partly im afraid
because at critical moments he was generally drunk
oh poor dear stellas eyes shone with interest and what happened
to him
he died on his way down country with his wife and family
brokenhearted more or less a fugitive but still it is said having
certain possessions in the shape of money and jewels and shawls his
tomb has never been found nor is it known what became of his
descendants i often wonder if any of them are living today there is
a story that on one occasion when he was looking at a map of india in
which british territory was then as now coloured red he ran his hand
over the whole of the map and said all this ought to be red that was
the real spirit of his ambitions ill lend you a book about him if you
like
like please let me have it todaytomorrow
he laughed at her enthusiasm very well directly my things are
unpacked his career would make a fine subject for a romance
why dont you write it
he paused reflectively
are you writing it do tell me urged stella
no but i should like to try will you help me
how on earth could i help you
by allowing me to read you my efforts as they go along there is
nothing so stimulating to a wouldbe author as a longsuffering
listener
wily philip ferguson flint mentally he congratulated himself on having
hit on a subtle device whereby he might secure a delightful intimacy
with this captivating young person he pictured long hours alone in her
company countenanced by a reasonable excuse the romance should be
started immediately blessings on the memory of poor stouthearted
tipsy george thomas
i should be only too delighted there would be nothing longsuffering
about it then doubt crept into her mind as to how robert would regard
such a plan probably he would grudge her this pleasure as he grudged
her all others with the exception of riding and petty occupations
well if he did she must contrive to hoodwink him somehow for this
morning at least she could enjoy mr flints society he seemed in no
hurry to go and she told him all about the carringtons and her regret
that being a girl she could not follow in their footsteps confided to
him how she had craved to reach india disclosed perhaps unconsciously
the vague dissatisfaction she felt with her daily life now that her wish
was accomplished
why did you choose to come to india she asked him with frank
curiosity and was thrilled sympathetically when he told her that he too
had been born with an hereditary call in his blood for the east
i come of an old angloindian stock myself im the fifth generation of
my family to serve the indian government it seemed somehow inevitable
that i should come out here i passed high enough for the english civil
but i chose india without hesitation apart from family links with the
country i didnt fancy being mewed up in an office from morning till
night with little prospect of getting to the top of the ladder and not
enough money for sport and the kind of amusements i like dances and
dinners and teaparties are not in my line out here i can afford a good
horse and unlimited cartridges and i know i can be useful to india in
my small way i mean to end up with a lieutenantgovernorship at least
you are very ambitious exclaimed stella but it was as if she cried
hear hear
call it a passion for success he said smiling and stella felt that
deep determination lay beneath the smile and in his nature and with her
whole being she applauded his aspirations
you will get the star of india she said hardly knowing why the
particular reward should suddenly have recurred to her
a star worth striving for he said seriously even if it should burn
ones wings
oh how i envy you tears rose to her eyes and i who love india
too can do nothingcan never be useful
who knows your chance may come
if it does you may be sure i shall take it just then stella looked
up to see sher singh standing in the doorway and she realised that for
the last few moments the man had been coughing gently to attract her
attention was she never to be free from this perpetual spying and
watching
what is it she asked impatiently in hindustani
your highnesswith a low salaamthe sahib has sent a message will
ferlint sahib go to the office the commissionersahib desires his
presence
mr flint rose well goodbye mrs crayfield needs must when
official devildom drives i will tell you when the george thomas romance
is well started
dont forget the book about him you promised to lend me said stella
eagerly but when he had gone she gave herself over to a frenzy of
suspicion had sher singh told robert that she was laughing and talking
with ferlint sahib and had the message been sent with a purpose she
dreaded yet looked for roberts return so that she might know where she
stood in regard to mr flints visit perhaps it was all her
imagination the summons might have been perfectly free from intrigue on
the part of sher singh yet she was uneasy and she wandered from room
to room a victim to apprehension her condition aggravated by the
knowledge that she had found such pleasure in this new friendship
fearful as she was that it might be denied her
to her astonished relief when robert appeared for the midday breakfast
he was accompanied by mr flint and the two seemed already to be on
excellent terms
ive persuaded mr flint to join us at breakfast robert explained to
her pompously but after this he took no notice of his wife talking
shop persistently with his new subordinateall about revenue and
boundaries and agricultural prospects of the danger of famine should
the monsoon fail or be fatally late stella listened with interest
though perforce she was excluded from the conversation and
instinctively she understood why mr flint made no attempt to draw her
into it mr flint was setting himself to please his superior for which
intention she felt thankful to him also she was dimly aware that his
object was twofold that he meant to make friends with robert in order
that he might the more easily be permitted to make friends with her she
effaced herself purposely and welcomed the sudden intrusion of an
excited fox terrier who rushed into the room wildly in quest of his
master
i must apologise for jacob said mr flint as the dog leapt upon him
with yelps of joy i thought i had left him safely tied up
robert endured the interruption with good enough grace he did not like
dogs would not keep any himselfto stellas disappointment but the
disturbance was trivial he made no comment when his wife enticed jacob
to her side with succulent scraps from her plate and soon had him
seated contentedly on her lap lolling a red tongue casting
affectionate glances at his master across the table to philip this
seemed a good omen jacob as a rule was not fond of ladies except of
his own species and his wholesale acceptance of mrs crayfields
attentions was somewhat surprising flint was careful to ignore jacob
much as colonel crayfield ignored his wife and he was secretly
entertained when the meal over and mrs crayfield rose from the table
jacob trotted after her into the drawingroom leaving his master to
smoke and continue his talk with the commissioner master jacob was no
fool he knew when he had found an entrancing companion
the morning had been a success but philip took his dog back to the rest
house that afternoon with feelings divided to him the situation in
regard to the crayfields was now clear enoughan elderly man married
to a young and beautiful wife whose heart was still whole the husband
loftily secure in his authority his ownership there was danger in
prospect unless he could be certain of keeping his head and as he
thought of the girls beauty her youth her attractions and her
obvious interest in himself he feared for his own strength of mind it
might be more than wise to abandon all schemes for meetings that were
not inevitable but the temptation was strong and he knew very well
that to a certain extent he should yield to it all the same he would
have to walk warily an entanglement at this stage of his career might
be fatal to his advancement colonel crayfield was hardly the type of a
complacent husband and he had known cases during his service when
appearances only had brought about irrevocable disaster to foolish
flirtatious couples who in deed as well as in purpose were innocent of
actual harm
after all with the cynicism of circumstances it was colonel crayfield
himself who made matters easy he had taken a fancy to his new
assistant invited him frequently to singles at tennis and never
suspected that flint let him win or beat him by such a small margin
that the defeat had a stimulating effect stella sat by and watched
these games jacob reposing on the edge of her skirt or more often on
her lap robert bore with the presence of jacob unless he ran after the
balls or barked piercingly at squirrels then the commissioner shouted
abuse at that damned dog and flint administered chastisement
ostensibly severe in reality mild that caused jacob to retire
affronted beneath stellas chair
when the swift indian dusk descended robert who perspired abnormally
under exertion would hasten indoors for a bath and a change with sher
singh in attendance unwitting of the fact that his wife and young flint
invariably sat on side by side in the hot scented darkness as happy
companions their fellowship ripening dangerously with each hour they
could compass alone one with the other skilfully flint had brought the
george thomas romance into play he talked of it openly before colonel
crayfield and one night when he was dining with the crayfields he
confessed he had brought one or two chapters with him that he proposed
with their consent to inflict after dinner on his host and hostess
robert grunted contemptuously stella had the acumen to agree with
polite indifference and when the reading began robert at once went to
sleep and snored the chapters were short and truth to tell of little
literary value though written in easy style with a talented pen
costing the author no effort but stella was deeply impressed and
interested she longed to hear more of the hero the young man of high
birth who had got into such a scrape at home that he was forced to flee
the country and found himself in the service of a treacherous old
native lady the begum somru whose commanderinchief at the time was
an irish adventurer one george thomas and while robert slept and
snored philip read and stella listened then the manuscript laid
aside they talked india in subdued voices to their hearts content
this programme was repeated more than once until robert turned restive
bother the boy he said why does he want to write all this
rubbishwasting his time
its his way of amusing himself stella suggested carelessly like me
with my painting and fancy work
well it doesnt amuse me to hear it or you either i should imagine
i confess im rather interested in the story i feel i want to know
what happens next
then let him spout it at some other time when im not present i
suppose therell be no peace till its finished give him a gentle
hint
ill try but wont it hurt his feelings
not any more than my going to sleep directly he starts reading i
should think
therefore on the next occasion before the manuscript could be
unfolded stella went to the piano
no reading tonight mr flint were going to have some music i want
you to hear how my husband can sing come along robert her fingers
rippled lightly over the keys and robert sang readily lustily song
after song much to his own enjoyment and presumably to that of the
guest who applauded with tact and requested encores till the
performer in high good humour declared he was hoarse and could sing no
more then mrs crayfield continued the concert and philip sat gazing
his fill at the vision she presented the light from the walllamp
behind her gilding her hair her voice sweet and true causing his heart
to ache with ominous yearning he felt confident she found pleasure in
his friendship yet tonight he was puzzled by her attitude until the
music put away and the piano closed she said with an assumption of
matronly indulgence im afraid we havent considered poor george
thomas how is he getting on
oh pretty well thank you
has the slave girl escaped
not yet its rather difficult but i mustnt bore you any more with my
attempts at fiction purposely he spoke in a tone of humble
discouragement he was feeling his way
bring the stuff over tomorrow before we play tennis suggested robert
magnanimously and the memsahib will listen stories amuse her
oh may i but turning to stella wont it interfere with your
afternoon siesta
not a bit mrs crayfield assured him i never can sleep in the
daytime but robert must have a rest i tell him he works far too hard
young bully arent you was colonel crayfields playful retort
laying his hand on his wifes shoulder take my advice flint and when
you marry dont choose a wife from the schoolroom
judging by your example sir chaffed philip one might do worse
well all things considered i suppose ive been lucky good night i
shall expect to lick you tomorrow at tennis after youve exhausted
yourself and my wife with your intellectual exertions
not if i can help it said philip diplomatically defiant
chapter x
when mrs antonio pronounced rassih to be a very hot place her words
at the time had conveyed little to stella of what to expect the heat
grew fiercer than she could have believed possible the blazing sun the
scorching wind the nights that seemed equally long and hot as the days
without variation of temperature save for the worse there was no
escape no deliverance and the rains tarried despite her youth and her
health she flagged lost her appetite lived chiefly on tea and iced
mangofool with all the shortsightedness of the young in matters of
nourishment robert on the contrary appeared to thrive he ate well
slept soundly rode and played tennis as usual his very vigour was
exhausting to his wife
now the only ladies left in the station besides herself were mrs beard
and mrs antonio martha and mary and deborah were dispatched at the
mission expense to cooler climes pussy antonio was on a long visit up
hill to relations mrs piggott had fled like the rest to the
himalayas therefore mrs crayfields at homes were for the present in
abeyance and had it not been for philip flint the monotony of her days
would have become wellnigh intolerable stella lived for the sight of
his face and the sound of his voice whether she might have welcomed his
society with equal delight had he been mrs or miss flint possessing
the same tastes and interests had not occurred to her one source of
annoyance during his visits ceased suddenlychampa and sher singh no
longer peeped and peered from the doorways on the other hand champa
began to behave as if she recognised and was ready to abet an intrigue
that must be kept from the commissioners knowledge early one morning
she sidled into the bedroom with a note that had arrived from mr flint
for mrs crayfield hiding it beneath her wrapper looking unutterable
warnings since the sahib was half awake she handed it covertly to her
mistress in a flash stella recognised what lay in the womans mind and
she made haste to rouse robert as she took the note and opened it
mr flint has got fever she told him he wont be able to play
tennis this evening
say salaam she added severely to champa who retired snubbed to
give the messenger the orthodox message of acknowledgment
this episode worried stella she was not yet so conversant with oriental
outlook as to comprehend that to the native mind there could be but one
interpretation of her intimacy with a sahib who was not her husband nor
in any way related to her she felt enraged humiliated by champas
assumption that she must wish to conceal the note from robert and in
consequence she passed a restless morning after a long hot ride that
drained her energy it was the old munshis day with his pupil but
when he presented himself with his penbox and sheaf of yellow papers
she could not settle down to the lesson was unable to fix her
attention and pleading a headache she dismissed him politely then
she tried writing her weekly letter to the chestnuts but her hand clung
damp to the paper and she had not the strength of will to persevere
the keys of the piano stuck to her fingers it was useless attempting to
paint or to embroider finally she sat idle in the darkened room
permitting her thoughts to wander without aim backwards and forwards in
chaos now in one direction then in another till they collided with
the solid fact that her disturbance of mind was now not so much
connected with champas insulting behaviour as with her disappointment
that she was not to see philip flint that afternoon a vexation
aggravated by anxiety concerning his condition had he got all he
needed he was still in the rest house and she pictured him lying sick
and helpless in the hot and hideous little building had he plenty of
ice she knew the supply was limited she would have liked to order soup
or jelly to be prepared for him but the order would have to go through
sher singh the day wore on as usual the heavy midday breakfast
roberts rest afterwards her own efforts to read while he slept by
teatime her head ached definitely and badly robert suggested that
another ride would do it good she might like to try the grey studbred
he had bought the other day since her own mare had already been out in
the morning
i cant ride again today she declared fretfully i dont feel up to
it you had better try the grey yourself
at once he became significantly solicitous and the meaning in his
questions and concern annoyed her still further
oh do go she cried exasperated at last and leave me alone i want
to be quiet my head aches thats all
he grumbled a little that flint should be ailing and therefore
unavailable for tennis he could not decide whether to try the grey or
to send for one of the public works assistants to play with him on
inquiry it was ascertained that the young man in question was still out
in the district and finally to his wifes relief he ordered the grey
to be saddled and set off for a solitary ride
stella repaired to the front balcony to see him mount and to wave him a
friendly farewell in apology for her illhumour the grey was a
satisfactory purchase a handsome animal well up to weight but
evidently hottempered and gave trouble at the start certainly
santasahib looked his best on a horse he was a good rider and for a
moment stella repented her peevish refusal to ride with him then
erratically the question occurred to her supposing there was an
accident supposing robert were killed how would she feel
it was as if she awaited an answer from beyond her own brain and for
answer there came to her the sudden vision of philip flint he seemed to
be standing before her she saw his blue eyes heard his slow pleasant
voice what did it mean aghast at her thoughts shadowy and indefinite
though they were she rushed back to the drawingroom shaking
unstrung with the feeling that she had committed murder in her heart
she was a wicked creature oh why had she married robert why had she
not stayed at the chestnuts with grandmamma and the aunts ignorant
safe however dull nothing but evil had come of her yearnings for
india and there was no one to whom she could turn for help for advice
for sympathy
in trembling haste but without purpose she put on a hat and went out
into the compound involuntarily she glanced around for sher singh but
for a wonder he was nowhere to be seen and impulsively she decided to
call on mrs antonioanything to escape from the harassing fancies that
beset her
the house occupied by the antonios was no distance built as it was on a
further portion of the fort walls it stood prominent against the
coppercoloured sky encouraging the venture
mrs antonio was at home as stella sat in the drawingroom awaiting her
appearance she noticed a curious smell it recalled to her mind mrs
piggotts belief that the doctor if not his wife as well indulged in
the hookah and why not queried stella if they liked it though the
taste was not easy to understand judging by the acrid odour the room
felt fusty was crammed with a strange assortment of cheap bricabrac
overlaid with dust and the heat was insufferable
when mrs antonio appeared she presented what stellas former
schoolfellows at greystones would have described as a sight for the
blind clad as she was in a terrible yellow dressinggown a bath
towel bound turbanwise about her head
please excuse mrs crayfield dear she apologised i have been
washing my hair i did not wish to keep you waiting does your ayah
prepare you arecanut wash it is best thing
i will remember said stella who had brought a bountiful supply of
shampoopowders with her from england champa has not told me about
it
oh my that ayah of yours that champa she is a lazy continued
mrs antonio she unwound the towel and rubbed her grey locks as she
talked where did you get her
she was engaged by sher singh our head servant
yes and that sher singh mrs antonio peered at her visitor through a
screen of wet hair he is a badmash
there was no need for translation stella knew the word well enoughit
meant rascal i detest sher singh she admitted finding comfort in
the expression of her feelings and i know he hates me
of course what else so many years with colonel crayfield and knowing
too many secrets he is jealous tell your husband let him go give a
pension he is opiumeater all say in the bazaar
an opiumeater
yes but do not say to colonel crayfield that i hinted you see you are
so young mrs crayfield dear that is why i warn if he stays that man
will do harmmake mischief
stella shrank from exposing her helplessness in the matter felt
ashamed also of her inclination to let things slide rather than provoke
roberts wrath she said
thank you for putting me on my guard mrs antonio it is friendly and
kind of you now will you tell me about the arecanut wash for the hair
i am sure it must be excellent
mrs antonio followed the drag and plunged into directions presented
mrs crayfield with a handful of the beneficial nut then talked of
pussys hair and other perfections until stella made an opportunity for
escape
as she strolled home she felt further depressed her mind was full of
mrs antonios warning it served to strengthen her feeling of
repugnance towards sher singh she tried to argue with herself that
there might be excellent reasons for roberts attachment to sher singh
apart from the value of the mans services gratitude might be involved
possibly sher singh had nursed his master through a dangerous illness
or in some way saved roberts life robert would never have told her he
was so secretive he seldom spoke of the past and she knew little or
nothing of his former life she had never induced him even to talk of
his friendship with her father and mother she hated the feeling that
she was not in her husbands confidence though she was guiltily alive
to the truth that she did not exactly admit him to her own bother sher
singh he was a perpetual thorn in her flesh she had never disliked the
man more than when this evening she beheld him standing sentinel at the
foot of the steep steps that led up to the dwelling rooms on the fort
walls there he stood pompous important clothed in immaculate white
with a smart blue belt and roberts crest fashioned in silver fastening
a band to match the belt across his big turban she longed to get even
with him and when he started almost imperceptibly at sight of her she
felt a vindictive satisfaction that for once she had eluded his
vigilance clearly he had been ignorant of her excursion had believed
her to be sitting solitary above during the sahibs absence he salaamed
low with what seemed to her mocking humility as she passed him and with
equally mocking disdain she ignored the salutation not pausing to
observe the effect of her insult she went on up the steps miserably
conscious that she had made a mistake
mrs antonios assertion that sher singh ate opium did not disturb her
unduly she remembered vaguely to have heard that all natives took opium
to a certain extent just as most europeans took alcohol in moderation
she knew nothing about it and therefore mrs antonios caution not to
mention the matter to her husband seemed to her sound but once in her
bedroom the rest of the warning swung through her brain if he stays
that man will do harmmake mischief and panic possessed her
it was useless to assure herself that she was making a mountain out of a
molehill beneath all her defensive reasoning lay a dread apprehension
that she was powerless to control it was all so intangible so
exasperating this heavyhearted sense of foreboding without actual
foundation despairingly she sought refuge in making the worst of her
headache that at least was definite enough she summoned champa and
prepared for bed so that when robert returned from his ride she might
plead indisposition as an excuse for absenting herself from the dinner
table
robert accepted the excuse in all good faith he prescribed a dose of
quinine and a glass of iced champagne both of which she swallowed to
please him and when later he came to her room she lay still with
closed eyes till he was safely asleep then she stole from her bed and
went out on to the balcony yellow and parched the landscape lay before
her bathed in the strong eastern moonlight the little heaps of ruins
in the foreground picked out with black shadowsrelics of past power
dead echoes of ancient strife on this spot where she stood on the
ramparts of the old moghul fort perhaps emperors had stood also
unwitting of the future of the coming downfall of their dynasty
from philip flint she had learnt how the fort had been built by the
great akbar in the reign of his greater western contemporary elizabeth
how it had lain with his descendants to uphold moghul might and
dominion and how they had failedfailed before a power that was
stronger in its spirit of selfsacrifice and honest purpose midst all
her unease of mind she felt the magic and the marvel of the past
remembered george thomas and his wide ambitionsa voice crying in the
wilderness of turmoil and chaos and oppression of the helpless a
pioneer of the peace and protection to follow for this gorgeous old
country yet was the present order and prosperity doomed to pass in its
turn leaving even less traces of its influence than just ruins and
remains and reminders would india seethe again with tyranny murder
persecution general insecurity of property and person creed up against
creed custom against custom avarice stalking the land to block and
destroy all progress flint she knew feared for indias future owing
to the western system of education that was being pursued without
forethought without judicious provision for employment that would guard
against disaster sooner or later he had said there would come into
power a faction that for the sake of unpractical theories and socalled
ideals totally unsuited to the east would liberate forces dangerous
forces already at work beneath the surface for personal gain that would
seek to oppress and intimidate the masses render just administration
impossible degrade british rule into a farce and then well then it
would devolve into a choice between the withdrawal of british authority
leaving the country open to conquest from some stronger foreign nation
or a reversion to sane government and the drastic suppression of
sedition conspiracy and rebellion
in face of these reflections stellas own troubles seemed to fade into
space she felt lifted above them indifferent to petty considerations
to the jealousy of sher singh roberts propensities and the limitations
he sought to impose upon her now boldly and without scruple she
permitted her imagination to run riot supposing she were philip flints
wifehow she would strive to help and encourage him how she would
fling herself into his work and his aspirations each of them doing
their utmost hand in hand for the welfare of the country they both
loved heart and brain afire she paced the broad balcony in a maze of
fictitious delight tonight there was little sound no howling of
beasts save in the far distance where jackals hunted in packs and near
at hand only the soft murmur of the city beyond the walls spellbound
as in a dream she loitered the heat was intense in the quiet the
desolation the hard yellow light of the moon but it seemed merely to
caress her limbs to encourage the intoxication of her fancies
a sudden sound shattered the reverie a dull thud as if something had
fallen within the building from the roof to the foundations
againthis time it was less loud less definite rumbling away into
silence she listened alert her heart beating quickly then came
reassurance with the recollection of mrs cuthells conviction that
strange echoes were caused by the occasional fall of masonry below in
the underground ruins wrenched back to reality she returned to the
darkened bedroom once more a prey to restless depression robert lay
sleeping profoundly his deep regular breathing and the monotonous
flap of the punkah frill were the only sounds she could discern as she
lay wide awake her senses sharpened her nerves overwrought but just
as a hint of drowsiness gave hope of repose for body and mind again she
heard something that this time could not be attributed to the falling of
bricks or stones since of a certainty it was within the room a
light patter on the matting a pause hesitation a faint whimper
in sheer terror stella leapt from her bed could it be a ghostthe
spirit of a helpless little child massacred with other victims of the
great tragedy in this hateful house only by the strongest effort she
refrained from shrieking aloud as a soft touch fell on her ankle it was
the warm wet lick of a tongue she was thankful she had raised no
disturbance when by the dim radiance of the moon through the open
doorways she saw no ghost no child but only jacobjacob with a
broken strip of cord hanging to his collar apologetic unhappy
squirming at her feet in his dumb pathetic attempts to explain his
desertion of his master
stella consoled the little dog let him lie by her side on the bed his
company brought a sense of comfort and security philips servants must
have imprisoned jacob in some outhouse so that his wellmeant
attentions should not disturb the sick man she hoped it argued healing
sleep for philipdid not mean that he was worse meanwhile she must
await daylight to ascertain the truth
at last she fell asleep jacobs nose cuddled in the crook of her elbow
regardless of roberts indignation when he should awake and discover the
presence of that damned dog
chapter xi
the sun poured upon the flat roof of the baking little resthouse
though the hour was yet early philip flint lay limp and exhausted on a
long chair in the veranda the sharp go of fever had worn itself out
for the time being worn out its victim also through the night he had
tossed and talked nonsense shivered and burned by turns with aching
limbs and bursting head now the reaction seemed equally bad if not
worse since while the malady raged he had at least been but vaguely
aware of bodily distress and though harassed with hideous dreams
there had come interludes when he felt as if wafted to regions of bliss
his companion a being half goddess half mortal one moment she floated
beyond his reach in limitless space remote as a star he had heard
his own voice calling entreating with a delirious confusion of words on
his lips stellaa starstar of india again she was close to
him held to his heart
blurred memories of these transports lingered in his mind as he lay
gasping with the heat and then came devastating doubts and warnings
sweeping the glamour away he dared not shut his eyes to the danger in
truth he stood on the brink of a moral precipice unless he could
manoeuvre a transfer from rassih unless in the meantime he could keep
clear of the commissioners house he was bound to find himself
desperately in love with the commissioners wife and without vanity
he foresaw that the situation must become equally perilous for her what
a fool he had beenensnared by the girls beauty by the tempting
circumstance of her alliance with a man so much her senior for whom it
was obvious she had no real affection a man who was blind to the
budding of her intellect who merely valued her bright innocence as a
whet to his senses yet apart from these odious reflections apart from
selfish perspective philip felt it was up to him now to call halt for
her sake so far they had exchanged no words that might not have been
shouted from the housetops but what price words when came mute
understanding when just a little more and they would find themselves in
the grip of that eternal immutable force called love and then how
should he bring himself to leave her desolate unhappy to face a future
without hope because his own target in life was success fulfilment of
ambition
from the outset of his career one aim had possessed philip flintto
arrive to reach the topmost rung of his particular ladder and already
his future was brilliant with promise his progress sure unless
through his own folly he loosed his hold and fell back well he knew
the power of mother grundy in indian official circles the need for
avoidance of serious scandal in a country where moral standards and
example must count for promotion among a community that officially
speaking was composed of one class in england it was possible for a
man to hold high public office while his domestic belongings socially
could not be recognised in india such a state of affairs would be
wholly unworkable imagine a chief commissioner a lieutenant governor
any representative of the crown not to mention a viceroy with a wife
who could not be received no open scandal in india spelt failure
therefore it was a choice for philip flint between heart and head and
now he asked himself grimly which was to prove the stronger
the beat of a horses hoofs outside scattered his thoughts he raised
himself on his elbow to see colonel crayfield dismounting and a couple
of peons ran forth with salaams to receive the important visitor
colonel crayfield stumped up the veranda steps hallo flint sorry to
hear you are sick he threw his hat and whip on to a camp table
dragged a chair into convenient position and seated himself weightily
had a sharp bout of malaria you look pretty well washed out
sharp and short sir i hope i think im about over it now all right
poof the heat of this place the commissioner looked about him with
disgust not fit for a dog talking of dogs your terrier strayed up to
our house last night it worried the memsahib because she took it into
her head it must mean you were at the last gasp i promised to come and
find out if you were still alive
very kind murmured philip as usual i must apologise for jacob and
im afraid he hasnt come back yet
oh thats all right never mind the dog the question is how you can
ward off another attack rassih has a bad reputation for intermittent
fever once it gets hold and stopping in this infernal little bungalow
wont help you what do you say to coming to us for a bit plenty of
room and no lack of ice and good milk well soon have you fit ill
send the tonga to bring you up and your man can follow with your
things
in philips present enfeebled condition of body and spirit the
temptation was severe setting aside the pleasant prospect of creature
comforts food properly prepared his own cook was woefully careless
there would bestella he strove to hold on to the arguments that at
the moment of colonel crayfields arrival were in process of bracing his
will and his judgment now they were slipping awayif only time could
be gained in which he might call them to heel summon strength to refuse
with firmness
he stirred uneasily its exceedingly kind of you sir but i couldnt
think of giving you and mrs crayfield the trouble im not really ill
tomorrow i shall be as fit as ever again its nothing but an ordinary
go of malaria
he felt he was gabbling what his chief would regard as merely
conventional protests even to himself they sounded futile unreal
rubbish the ejaculation was no more than he might have anticipated
dont be an ass give me a bit of paper and a pencil and ill send word
to my wife the tonga can be here in two shakes and ill wait and go
back with you myself
he began to shout orders the groom was to return with his horse and
the note philips personal servant was bidden to produce paper and a
pencil moreover to pack a portmanteau with his masters requirements
in a few moments the whole matter had passed from philips control and
he resigned himself to fate but what irony that stellas husband of
all people should be the means of forcing him into a position that
unless fate proved unnaturally considerate might lead right and left to
disaster
chapter xii
oh do go ondont stop i shall be miserable till i know what john
holland and anne decided
but i dont know myself thats as far as ive written i was going to
ask you what you thought they should do what do you think
flint laid the sheets of manuscript the george thomas romance on the
wicker table that stood between himself and his hostess the two were
seated on the balcony though it was late in the morning rain had
fallen overnight and the temperature was lowered for the presentnot
that the monsoon had actually broken upcountry but reports were
hopeful and for the past few days there had been a welcome gathering of
clouds culminating in a heavy downpour still the fear remained that the
clouds might yet disperse to leave the district parched and arid as
before
the desert steamed like a gigantic hotbed the atmosphere was
reminiscent of an orchid house but at least there was temporary respite
from imprisonment in closed and darkened rooms and the air wafted from
a handpunkah wielded with vigour by a youthful coolie was
comparatively cool and refreshing philip flint set free from the
tortures of the rest house had quickly recovered condition despite a
recurrence of feverjust a sufficient recurrence to justify
prolongation of his stay with the crayfields a short extension of
idleness encouraged by his unsuspecting chief tomorrow he intended to
return to his uncomfortable quarters work must be resumed meanwhile he
had lived in a golden dream oblivious of the future that now loomed
before him like a grey empty tomb compared with the rapturous present
as he gazed unceasingly at stella nothing seemed to matter if only he
could hear from her lips that she cared for him beloved how perfect
she was from the sheen of her pretty head as she bent over some trifling
needlework to the tips of her little arched feet and her nature was as
sweet and tender and white as her slim body
well what do you think he persisted recklessly and in repeating the
question he knew he was heading for danger as a rider might put a
runaway horse to an impossible fence that the inevitable crash should
come quickly prove neck or nothing
she hesitated sighed oh i dont know to begin with you see anne
was married and her husband though she hated him was fighting like
john under george thomas would it have meant trouble disgrace for
john if
if they had bolted perhaps though in those days it might have been
different but apart from thatwhat about the marriage question if you
had been anne
i should have done what was best for john
even if it meant parting from him for ever
of course she said stoutly
not simply because you were married
she raised her eyes from the foolish strip of embroidery engaging her
fingers
stella
there the fence was taken the crash had come now they must both face
the truth outwardly selfcontrolled becausewhat bathos because of
the punkah coolie and the open doors philip cursed the fact that
privacy in india was next to impossible he saw that stellas eyes were
brimming with tears how her hands trembled yet he did not dare give
her comfort by taking her in his arms as in his dream she was far from
him inapproachable as her namesake a star
the silence that fell between them was tense the swish of the punkah
went steadily on the heat grew heavier more saturating in the hazy
sky a vulture alternately sailed and dipped hung motionless as though
suspended by an invisible wire on the outlook for some carrion prize
below
then philip found himself speaking rapidly in a low voice his hands
gripped the edge of the table so tightly that his knuckles showed white
and hard through the skin he scarcely knew what he was saying
selfmastery was gone and in the flood of his passionate declaration
stella shivered and blanched he saw love in her eyes but fear
alsofear and helpless despair he paused drew in his breath sharply
but so far he felt no penitence no remorse for having let himself go
he was conscious only of a wild exultation for he knew that in heart
and in soul she was his he craved to hear from her lips that she loved
him she must tell himnot with her eyes alone that it was cruel to
force the admission he did not in his madness consider
speak to me stellajust say it say it once tell me
her lips moved he bent forward but before he could catch the whisper
she had risen abruptly to pass with swift steps into the house he rose
in his turn to stay her flight and was confronted on the threshold of
the open doorway by sher singh
disconcerting as was the mans unexpected appearance it was to philip
merely an accidental if enraging check to his intention it accounted
for stellas sudden retreatfrom where she had sat she must have caught
sight of sher singhs approach but relief quickly followed exasperation
as he realised how narrow had been their escape from an equivocal
situation for next moment colonel crayfield was in the room sher
singhs unwelcome intrusion had after all been timely and thanks to
the numerous exits of an indian habitation stella had vanished just a
second or two before the entry of her husband
the rest of the morning was charged for them both with repressed
emotion they sat at the breakfast table outwardly composed inwardly
fearful of meeting each others gaze stellas mental disturbance was
increased by the conviction that sher singh was on the watch he must
have observed that she and philip were engaged in no ordinary
conversation when he surprised them on the balcony must have noted her
confusion as she passed him in her flight now she realised her folly in
not having held her ground she should have remained in her seat and
given warning to philip by speaking promptly to sher singh since of
course the man shared champas belief that a guilty understanding was
afoot between herself and ferlint sahib no doubt it was he who in
the first place had suggested the idea to champa her fears in
connection with mrs antonios warnings had dwindled during the days of
philips visit but now mental torment returned with the feeling that
sher singh was but biding his time for mischief with the deadly patience
of the oriental dread lest he should lead robert to scent the situation
that had arisen between herself and philip turned her sick
deeming it more prudent to avoid philip for the immediate present she
sat in her room while robert rested her mind in confusion as she
pretended to read to ignore philips outpouring to continue as if
nothing disturbing had occurred was clearly impossible philip must be
warned but how to contrive that warning without risk of being spied
upon was a problem even could she accomplish it safely she shrank from
facing the days to come with this secret between them she contemplated
appealing to robert to allow her to take advantage of mrs cuthells
invitation on the score that she could endure the heat no longer but
should he refuse as was more than probable could philip be induced to
apply for leave however short on the plea of health something must be
done and without delay that she might gain time to set her mind in
order free from continual trepidation if only she could secure the
chance of a long private talk with philip
wearily she sat in the drawingroom before the teatable that afternoon
awaiting the two men robert when he went to his dressingroom had
said that if the courts were not too damp for tennis and if flint felt
up to it they might try a game he was the first to appear and
evidently he was not in a good humour stellas heart sank at sight of
his frown but bounded next moment with relief when she heard the cause
it seemed that sher singh as well as herself desired leave of
absence
confound the fellow robert grumbled hes just had a telegram and
says he must go off at once to see to the funeral of some near
relation
how long does he want
he says only two or three days but with natives that may mean
anything
stella trusted privately that in this case it might mean two or three
weeks
he suggested that if flint were staying on with us for the present his
man could look after me for the time
but mr flint has arranged to go back to the rest house tomorrow
then hed better alter his arrangements hes no trouble and its far
more comfortable for him here dont you want him to stay
i dont care particularly one way or the other but on the whole id
rather we were alone
oh shades of conscience stella bent over the tea things ashamed of
her hypocrisy
roberts face cleared he beamed complacently we cant always expect
to be alone little selfish one
when does sher singh want to go
by this time hes gone i imagine he intended to catch the afternoon
train
well it cant be helped said stella and of course if you wish it
ill press mr flint to stay now he can be at work again i shant have
to entertain him
or listen to his eternal novel
i dont mind that but its a bore making conversation
yes i understand well anyway its a charity to put him up for a bit
longer and he can sing for his supper by trying to beat me at tennis
every day here he comes
stella looked up there was philip in flannels his expression was sad
dispirited as though he too had been ground in the mill of mental
perplexity during the last two or three hours there came a singing in
her ears a mist clouded her vision how horrible for them both to be
forced to play a parta part so ignoble opposed to her whole nature
and she felt assured to his also
enter mr flint declaimed robert with jovial intonation the
memsahib and i were just talking about you my son
what were you saying nothing nasty i hope he avoided stellas eyes
as he seated himself and took the cup she held out to him
quite the contrary puffed robert we were planning to persuade you
to stay on with us especially as my bearer has demanded short leave
and yours with your permission might fill the gap for the time being
stella noted a slight flicker of philips eyelids and her ear caught
the echo of selfcontrol in his voice as he answered you are very
kindand of course if my man can be of the slightest use
very well then thats settled robert attacked the eatables talking
the while of rain and crops and the uncertainty of the outlook unless
things improve pretty soon there is a difficult time ahead he
predicted
and stella repeated the foreboding in her heart though from a very
different standpoint
tennis after all proved impossible the courts were a swamp and as
robert clamoured for exercise the three set off eventually for a late
and to stella a tedious ride she was too troubled even to find
pleasure in the aftereffect of the rain upon the scenery though she
could not but observe the wondrous vermilion and purple of the sky the
great clouds massed on the horizon like some angry army awaiting the
word to press forward or to retire the colour reflections on the long
streaks of water that still lay upon the earths hard surface the rows
of birds gathered on the edges of the miniature lakes suggesting in
the distance broken borders of white stones the trees were washed of
their drab veiling of dust and foliage shone in the light of the
sinking sun an odour of earth refreshed rose in the thick hot air
but the mighty magnificence above the glow flung over the flat
interminable landscape served but to increase her sense of helpless
despondence
there seemed so little hope of safe conference with philip and though
the strain of his presence held for her as much happiness as fear it
was imperative that some plan of separation should be devised unless
they were to embark on a course of intrigue and deception that even
apart from any question of conscience must involve risk of disaster
bewildered unbalanced as she rode between her husband and the man she
loved she felt that her life was broken and stained already
next day the two men were out in the district on duty from morning to
evening stella passed the period of their absence in a state bordering
on stupefaction each hour that went by devoid of an opportunity for
clear understanding with philip seemed to widen the zone of danger
that night as she dressed for dinner the reflection of her face in the
mirror appalled herwhat a scarecrow how white and haggard and
hideous limp though she felt from the moist heat oppressed as she was
with her tribulation of mind she made a brave effort to amend her
appearancerearranged her hair bade champa get out a becoming pink
frock stockings and shoes to go with it opened her jewelbox meaning
to wear her pearl necklace
the pearl necklace was not in its case at first unperturbed stella
searched among her trinkets only gradually to realise that the necklace
was undoubtedly gone champa when questioned of course knew nothing
about it she might almost have been unaware that her mistress possessed
any jewels at all then she suggested that the memsahib might have lost
the necklace out riding and in response to stellas derisive rejection
of such an absurd idea she dissolved into tears protesting that she at
least was no thief however wicked the rest of the servantpeople might
be
go and tell the sahib i wish to speak to him commanded stella
severely it was not that she suspected champa for one moment of having
stolen the necklace but the womans cowardly attitude incensed her she
understood nothing of the prevalent fear among native servants of false
accusation contrived by some colleague intent upon personal purpose
whether vengeful or in the hope of advancement no matter at whose
expense champa sidled muttering from the room and presently robert
came in half dressed his face shone with perspiration his neck minus
a collar reminded his wife of a chunk of raw meat and suddenly she
felt indifferent as to whether the necklace he had given her was lost
irretrievably or not she wished she had not summoned him
whats the matter youre not ill he inquired
my pearl necklace has gone she said much as she might have announced
the disappearance of some trivial article
good god robert pounced upon the jewelbox turning the contents over
with ruthless hands
its not there stella told him
then where the devil is it when did you wear it last
i cant remember
nonsense you often wear it in the daytime as well as in the
eveningyou must have missed it before now if it had been gone any
time its worth hundreds where have you looked it may be among your
clothes
i always put it back in the case i havent looked anywhere else
good heavens then do so at once wheres the ayah what has she got to
say
she doesnt know any more than i do what has happened to it i suppose
i ought to have kept the box locked
and if you had youd have left the key lying about youre so
infernally careless
robert raved and stormed while stella and champa ransacked drawers and
wardrobes without result the necklace was not forthcoming dinner was
postponed every servant in the establishment was called up and the
whole staff was threatened with dismissal imprisonment punishment
unless the pearls were produced
chapter xiii
the disappearance of the pearls caused general commotion throughout the
commissioners establishment perforce the police were called in to make
investigations and mr piggott being absent from the station on duty
the chief native subordinate took command of the compound and set up a
species of martial law the servants in terror of secret extortion
under threat of false proof or suspicion seemed to lose their wits and
either blundered idiotically over their duties or forgot them
altogether champa collapsed distraught with agitation and refused to
stir from her quarters
robert talked of little else but the loss
such a thing has never happened before in my household he kept
repeating as they sat at an uncomfortable meal next midday you are
perfectly certain stella that you havent mislaid the necklace or
dropped it anywhere
and each time he asked the question stella replied wearily i am
perfectly certain until she felt tempted at last to declare that she
had thrown away the pearls of deliberate intention her nerves were on
edge and she found it hard to control her temper mercifully breakfast
was now practically over
what about that man of yours flint how long have you had him
five years and hes certainly not the thief if thats what you mean
hes a respectable simpleminded old fellow with a long record of good
service to his credit
robert grunted incredulously and lit a cheroot that ayah knows
something he suggested to his wife or why hasnt she turned up this
morning
shes ill said stella ill with fright i should think
a guilty conscience more likely
im quite sure she had nothing to do with it
annoying as champa had been stella was convinced of the womans
honesty
how can you be sure dont talk nonsense
well wasnt she engaged by sher singh she felt she had scored and
emboldened by the advantage added recklessly if it comes to that i
would sooner believe that sher singh
sher singh interrupted robert angrily on the contrary if he had
been here the thing wouldnt have happened some rascal took the
opportunity of his absence
then unless it was all prearranged the thief must have acted pretty
promptly argued stella who had arrived at a pitch of provocation that
rendered her indifferent to roberts displeasure perhaps the telegram
was bogus she continued ironically sent to lure the unsuspecting
sher singh from his post and with an effort she quelled a ridiculous
impulse to add that possibly sher singh had borrowed the necklace in
order that some member of his family might wear it at the relatives
funeral she came dangerously near to laughter in picturing the scene
that such a suggestion would evoke as it was her sly attack on the
good name of sher singh led to mixed consequences
robert rose impatiently sher singh must come back if a wire goes at
once he ought to be here tonight
stella repented her imprudence on the other hand as robert strode from
the room to fulfil his intention there was comfort in the fact that at
last she and philip were safely alone for a space the table servants
at work in the pantry were well out of hearing the punkah coolie at
his post could not see them
philip said breathlessly stella what are we to do
the moments were precious she answered with haste though her voice was
calm one of us must go away its the only thing to do sher
singh
what has sher singh to do with it
he knows he has been watching us he would do anything to harm me
anyway we couldnt go on like this
its all my fault he said wretchedly what a selfish beast i have
been i ought to have held my tongue
what difference would it have made we both knew
he was amazed at her fortitude no longer was she the helpless unhappy
child weighed down by relentless fate but a woman determined to grapple
with the future the carrington spirit of pluck and endurance still
lived in the last of the line
a little cloud of masculine grievance gathered in his mind rose
between them his was the blame for the whole situation and he was
prepared to sacrifice all for her sake to take her away that they might
live for themselves alone since his outburst on the balcony wild
schemes had invaded his brain though as yet without practical plan
now it chafed him to feel that she might not be ready to follow his lead
in joyful appreciation of his purpose the realisation fanned his
passion strong as it was already
are you thinking of yourself or of me he asked bitterly
oh how can you she cried pained beyond further expression of
reproach yet she understood that his cruelty arose from the very
strength of his feelings and while with feminine instinct she divined
his loveselfishness she cared for him none the less
look here she said firmly i belong to robert you belong to india
and weve both got to remember
oh i know what youre going to sayremember our duty duty be
damned he retorted beside himself you cant love me as i love you
or you wouldnt talk like this what do i matter to indiaim only a
fly on the wheel what do you matter to crayfield any more than if you
werewell a pearl necklace for instance
i know my value to robert exactly she told him with a wry little
smile but i married him for what he could give me and he has given
it i dont agree with you as to your value to india india depends on
men like you and if you are flies on the wheel the wheel wouldnt go
round without you
it was true and he knew it all the same he felt that stella meant
more to him now than his duty to india and all his ambition
we belong to each other and to no one and nothing else he maintained
doggedly you cant go on living with one man when you know you love
another its not right
perhaps not from one point of view but i dont take that view we
cant think of ourselves i shall ask robert to let me go to the
cuthells even if i have to pretend to be ill if he wont let me go
then you must apply for leave or get away somehow from rassih
stella are you made of stone he drew his chair nearer to hers laid
his hand on her arm rejoiced as he felt how her pulses responded to his
touch think what the separation would mean we could go to england
he urged i would work for you slave for you darling
and that would mean your giving up india
not necessarily i can take leave on urgent private affairs for six
months furlough is due to me too but that takes time to arrange i
could get it tacked on afterwards and thenthen we could be married
and come out together it would all have blown over
but even as he spoke there came visions strive as he would to ignore
them of obscure little stations promotion tardy other men passing
over his head for the rest of his service
and suppose robert wouldntsupposing we couldnt be married
this possibility had not entered his mind he hesitated then added
quickly he couldnt be such a brute if he was id retire we would
live quietly somewhere out of the world just for each other dont you
care for me enough to take the risk
she did not answer because she feared if she spoke at the moment she
might burst into tears he misunderstood her silence
i tell you he went on impetuously i tell you again as i told you
yesterday morning that nothing matters to me in the world but your
love it means more to me than my work and my aims my life itself
without you success in the service would simply be dust and ashes id
sooner live on a desert island with you than be viceroy of india are
you afraid to trust yourself to me
she struggled for selfcontrol his eyes were pleading his face looked
drawn she longed to give in to tell him she asked nothing better than
to be with him for always at whatever the price or the punishment yet
surrender at best must mean greater sacrifice for philip than she on her
side could offer and she meant to hold out even should it all end in a
parting that left philip with the impression that she valued her worldly
wellbeing beyond his love her thoughts were simple direct but she
felt if she tried to explain urged the fact that she cared too much for
him to become a drag on his life would find compensation in knowing he
was free to go forward untrammelled she might only appear to be
setting herself up on a pedestal of selfrighteousness at his expense
she temporised
let us think it over she entreated let us give ourselves time by
one of us going away at any rate for the present
time would make no difference as far as i am concerned it would only
be the same thing all over again but if you think it would help you to
forget then of course i must agree
oh it isnt that she protested tortured beyond endurance she cast
about in her mind for further argument do you remember one day when i
told you how i regretted i wasnt a man to do what little i could for
india and you said my chance might come
oh you sweet silly child he scoffed do you honestly imagine that
india would crumble to pieces without me he laughed as he seized her
in his arms kissing her madly she wrenched herself free stood
swaying confused overcome with the force of his passion the thrill of
his embrace then came the sound of roberts returning footsteps and
she held up a warning hand bent over the bowl of flowers on the table
as though to rearrange them philip moved his chair back to its original
position and busied himself with his cigarette case but he could have
wished that crayfield had surprised them then there would have been an
end to all subterfuge of all stellas doubts and scruples he felt a
cur because he did not stand up and proclaim the truth there and then
so setting her free from the onus of decision
thats done said robert now when sher singh comes back perhaps
we shall get to the bottom of this pearl business are you ready flint
we ought to be off again if were to see to that farther chain of
villages it looks like more rain thank goodness stella youd better
go and lie down you look like a ghost
i feel like one too she answered and as he turned to leave the room
she followed him quickly robert wait a moment she caught his elbow
come into my room i want to speak to you
he acquiesced though with impatience well what is it
i must have a change she began volubly i cant stand the heat any
longer i believe i shall die if i dont get away from it you cant
think how awful i feel
he looked at her in astonishment with which concern vexation and a
shade of indefinite suspicion were mingled
you want to go away you know perfectly well i cant ask for leave with
all this distress in the district even if the rains break freely in the
next few days
but i could go alone she pleaded mrs cuthell would have me i know
she would id come down again directly i felt better it isnt gaiety i
want only to feel better
antonio must come and have a look at you perhaps
no no cried stella its not that she almost wished it were that
she might have stronger excuse for flight the idea even crossed her
mind to feign doubt in order to gain her purpose and though she
dismissed it with horror she clung ignominiously to the straw that
floated detached from definite deception
if i could only get strong she hinted shamefacedly it might make a
difference i feel such a wreck robert im so sorry but i cant help
it
it was all true she told herself wildly she did feel a wreck she was
sure she would be seriously ill if she stayed on at rassih
unlessunless philip would go instead
well wait till this evening said robert and well see i must be
off now flint is waiting and weve a long afternoons work to get
through he advised her to rest and kissed her in kindly if
perfunctory farewell
when he had gone philip with him a hot muggy silence descended upon
the premises the servants went off to their quarters in the compound
for the customary midday meal and sleep save for a couple of peons on
duty who snoozed in the front veranda and the ever present shift of
punkah pullers since the downpour of rain the west wind had ceased to
roar and rage over the land nature seemed motionless as though waiting
in patient expectance for the swollen clouds to discharge their burden
of water
stella torn with emotion wandered from room to room unable to rest
jacob pattering at her heels she found herself longing for the peace
and security of the chestnuts for the home of her childhood that in her
young arrogance she had despised rebelling against its restrictions
now she visualised the old house and garden bathed in serene summer
sunlight the village the common the cornfields remembered with
regret the small vexations her ignorant stupid little grievances that
were as grains of sand compared with the mountain of trouble before her
she wept with selfpity with terror of the future the word disgrace
rang in her ears disgrace for herself and for philip unless she had
strength to resist him and yet if she remained steadfast what of the
long empty years that lay ahead like a limitless desert even to face
them with couragefor philip that philip might go forward unshackled
by fetters riveted in shameseemed more than she had power to
undertake could she tell robert the truth entreat him to help her to
let her leave rassih for a time no such a scheme was unworkable she
knew him well enough to feel sure she might as well throw in her lot
with philip at once robert would never forgive understand and could
she think that he might she herself had rendered such a course
impossible by her way of deceptionallowing him to believe that she
loved him leading him to assume that she but tolerated philips
companionship even from philip there was no hope for such help as would
support her in her struggle
the room grew dark at first she fancied that the gloom must be of her
own mental making then came a dull roll of thunder followed by a
close threatening pause full of portent a little breeze rose and
whispered through the house stirring the curtains like a scout feeling
its way in advance of the attack to come she went out on the balcony
to see huge purple clouds rent with forked lightning rolling up
rapidly from the horizon the air was full of dust birds were wheeling
and crying against the sinister background jacob cowered trembling at
her feet a drop of rain fell like a bullet on the balustrade another
and another in a few seconds a rush of wind drove her indoors and
with a mighty tumult of sound the rain fell in one solid relentless
sheet as if giant buckets were being emptied from above
stella threw herself on a sofa in the drawingroom jacob cuddled at her
side she ceased to think was conscious only of the noise and the
darkness that seemed to continue for hours until exhausted body and
soul she fell asleep
robert and philip returned late in the evening drenched robert
despite his wetting was cheerful over the fact that to all
appearances the rains had arrived to stay though he grumbled because
there was no further news of the necklace and because sher singh had
not yet arrived philip looked white and ill as they sat down to a
belated dinner once or twice he shivered and he ate little or nothing
stella watched him in anxious concern a return of malaria was only to
be expected after his long ride in wet clothes by this time the
downpour had slackened and from without came the clamour of
frogscroak croak coax coaxin regular rhythmical chorus the
temperature had fallen punkahs were almost unwelcome the reaction was
depressing a damp mist crept into the great room little black insects
gathered in multitudes around the lamps on the walls lizards darted
among them enjoying the feast they provided stella could have cried
with dejection and to add to it all as they passed from the
diningroom they encountered sher singh salaaming full of important
concern he had heard of the robbery understood why he had been
recalled though he explained humbly that in any case it had been his
intention to return next morning the sahibs telegram had of course
hastened his departure the matter of the necklace he added miserably
was to him terrible a disgrace to the household he the slave of the
sahib and memsahib would neither sleep nor eat till the thief was
discovered the pearls restored until then his face as chief servant
was blackened he showed signs of prostrating himself at his masters
feet and robert to escape a scene bade him go and do his best to
clear up the mystery thus tactfully dismissing him
philip with stellas warning in his mind had regarded the man closely
during this interview stella was right he felt certain sher singh was
up to no good that his leave had been part of some treacherous scheme
and he made up his mind to remain in the house till he knew what it was
if sher singh meant to make mischief to arouse his masters suspicions
in regard to his mistress he philip must be at hand to see stella
through it might even bring matters to a crisis help to decide for
them both he had a presentiment that whatever sher singhs intention
something would happen that night and ill as he felt he assumed
liveliness made conversation with crayfield discussing results should
the rain prove to be merely local the effect that severe distress would
have on the various areas under their control robert lured from the
subject of the pearls talked freely held forth on his experiences in a
famine that had occurred early in his own service and how abominably he
had been treated his efforts ignored by the government
its always been the same he complained the fellows who do the real
work may die in harness literally driven to death and get no credit
while those who have done nothing but talk and write are smothered in
decorations and shoved up to the top of the tree thank goodness i could
retire tomorrow if i felt so inclined and snap my fingers at the lot
of them
he cited instances of his contemporaries in the service who without a
quarter of his own claim to distinction had been given the cie and
the kcie the csi and the kcsi until stella felt that the
alphabet as well as the government must be to blame for failing to
recognise roberts meritorious achievements and her memory turned to
the evening at the chestnuts when she had wondered if he were sore
because no order had yet been bestowed upon him since then she had not
thought of it but now she suspected that the omission rankled in his
mind and her sympathy with his possible disappointment went out to him
she knew how he worked and even if he worked without enthusiasm surely
that was even more to his credit than if he were spurred by romantic
inspiration she wished he had confided in her allowed her to share his
feelings but she knew that to him she was of small account
intellectually the disparity of years stood between them and even had
he admitted her to his confidence what could she have done save
endeavour to console him with understanding it was not as if he were
young like philip with the world of india before him
but the very fact of this disadvantage helped her determination to fight
against her love for philip for roberts sake in the present she could
only refrain from adding to his sense of failure in life for philips
sake in the future she must stick to her post and for her own
sakewell at least she could feel she was doing right whatever
philip in his desperation might argue peace of mind would come
though at best a dull empty peace with the knowledge that she had
nothing to fear that she had brought trouble to no one then again
round and round swung the question on which hung her chief difficulty
if robert refused to let her go to the cuthellsif philip could not or
would not get leave or a transfer from rassih what was she to do in
such a situation she saw little chance of true peace of mind it would
mean one continual effort to avoid philip by every manoeuvre in her
power to pretend pretend pretend both to him and to robert
she sank into a sort of lethargy her brain felt numbed and the voices
of the two men sounded hardly nearer than the ceaseless song of the
frogs outside a figure came into the room stood for a moment by
robert it was sher singhalways sher singh how she loathed the
creature robert rose and went away sher singh too she roused herself
with an effort philip was asking her something
did you hear what he said were you asleep
no i dont think so i dont know she sat upright passed her hand
over her eyes what did he say
he said the pearls had been found
so the tiresome pearls had been found it seemed to stella that the news
had barely reached her understanding before robert was back he crossed
the room reflectively with measured tread the pearls gleaming white in
his big hand the contrast struck philip as painfully symbolical just
as pure and as perfect was his dear love in the mans coarse keeping
crayfield paused dandling the pearls when he spoke he addressed
himself to flint in a voice that was devoid of all expression he said
my wifes necklace was found in your room
for a moment philip gazed at him dumbfounded then as with the shock of
a flashlight he understood sher singh sher singh had either put the
necklace in his room or pretended to find it there not with the object
of fastening false suspicion of theft upon anyone but in order to
compromise the mistress he so hated what a fool as well as a devil the
fellow must be how could he imagine that such an obvious piece of spite
was likely to succeed yet what was the meaning of colonel crayfields
curious attitude was it possible that he believed swiftly flints
mind pounced on the opportunity he might refrain from defence allow
the find to speak for itself but what about stella would she realise
the situation already she had risen trembling and white with
indignation
robert what do you mean surely you dontyou cant suggest that
mr flint took the pearls
philip glanced at her hopelessly her simplicity was almost
unbelievable her innocence all too obvious had lost them their chance
of freedom
philip she cried involuntarily and made a quick movement towards
him crayfield moved also just a couple of interceptory steps he
laughed and put the pearls in his pocket
thats all i wanted to know he said coolly an ugly glint in his
eyes out you go my boy you didnt steal the pearls of course but
youve been doing your damnedest to steal something else and you
havent succeeded
you may think what you like interposed philip hotly but he felt he
was blustering that colonel crayfield his senior in years and
authority had the whip hand of him perceiving the truth the trap had
been cleverly laid
thank you then i like to think this you have been making love to my
wife under my roof taking advantage of her youth and inexperience but
mercifully youve been caught in time now go and pack your belongings
and clear out consider yourself on leave i want no scandal slink
offquick you young hound
stella had sunk into a chair her husband stood before her philip
could not see her face he was racked with humiliation with helpless
rage his pride his selfrespect lay in the dust since he could not
but recognise the fundamental justice of his chiefs accusation must
he leave stella without comfort without reassurance of his fealty and
love driven to desperation he tried to push crayfield aside he might
as well have endeavoured to move a mountain
stella he called hoarsely but for answer to his cry came only the
sound of stifled terrified sobbing
chapter xiv
colonel crayfield stood silent motionless until all sound of philip
flints exit had ceased when with a dazed effort stella looked up at
her husband his face reminded her dimly of some monster depicted on a
chinese screen she held her breath half expecting him to kill her
there and then instead to her amazement he merely spoke to her as he
might have spoken to an unruly child caught in some act of mischief
ordered her to her room watched her grimly as she rose in dumb
obedience
passing through the hall she encountered philips old servant he
looked harassed bewildered as he salaamed it is the sahibs order
he said in querulous resentment that his belongings be taken back to
the rest house at once even but now hath he departed there himself and
on foot yacoubdog also clearly the old man expected some
explanation what could she say only that she supposed the sahibs
orders must be obeyed she left him standing puzzled indignant in the
doorway of the bedroom his master had occupied
for days afterwards stella felt as it were put into the corner by
robert this attitude on his part humiliating to her though it was
came as a partial relief it gave her time to revive in a sense from the
shock she had suffered the interval of disgrace despite its ignominy
rested her nerves and helped her to face roberts forgiveness which
when it pleased him to extend it was far more unbearable than his
displeasure she dared make no further appeal for permission to join
mrs cuthell she knew well enough if she did so what robert would
say that she was not to be trusted her very pride gave her strength to
conceal often to overcome her physical distress during the unhealthy
wearisome months that followed before the cold season set in
the monsoon weakened failed the heat was diabolical mosquitoes were a
torment the days and nights seemed endless and there was always sher
singh watchful malignant champa had begged leave to resign from the
memsahibs service once the disturbance caused by the episode of the
pearls had subsided in the compound she did so with crocodile tears and
feeble excuses the truth was that having been frightened out of her
senses she felt unable to recover her pretentious position in the
rassih establishment so champa departed without great loss of dignity
and her place was taken by a humble person whose name her new mistress
did not even trouble to inquire since the word ayah seemed to be the
beginning and the end of her obtuse personality
stellas spirit supported her but nothing could deaden the heartache
there was nothing to relieve the burden of her time nothing to ease the
struggle to control her evergrowing abhorrence of robert and his
demands on her outward docility
all that winter they toured in tents the scarcity though not so
severe in the rassih division as in other adjacent areas meant much
extra work for the commissioner and occasionally stella would be left
in the camp for two or three days while robert and his satellites went
off on side inspections by rail at such times robert would commandeer
some lady whose husband happened to be on duty with him to keep mrs
crayfield company stella would have preferred to be alone it seemed to
her that she had lost the capacity for making friends but at least
robert was absent at least she was freed from the strain of his
presence and for that she gave thanks while enduring the companionship
of an unwelcome visitor who she knew was an unconscious watchdog
only these little periods of peace the tonic of the coldweather
climate the frequent change of locality kept her going but when they
returned to rassih her vitality sank the effort to keep up appearances
became harder and she felt that the fight could not continue much
longer constant attacks of low fever laid hold of her and robert was
annoyed because she could not eat could not sleep because he
declared she would make no attempt to exert herself because the
medicines prescribed by dr antonio did her no good
gradually his impatience changed to indifference he ceased to scold and
advise or to insist on her company paid little attention to her she
knew he was bored with her sickliness her altered appearance she only
prayed that he might send her home
relief came from quite an unexpected quarter the english mail arrived
one evening while robert was out riding the usual consignment of papers
for himhe seldom received anything else beyond business
communicationsa letter for stella from aunt augusta and one with an
indian postmark the handwriting on this envelope stirred her memory
but she laid it aside till she had read aunt augustas letter the
little chronicles from the chestnuts were precious to her now she read
greedily of small happenings how old betty had been so troubled with
rheumatism that further help was needed from the village how grandmamma
had dropped her handkerchief in church last sunday and little isaac
orchard the blacksmiths son had picked it up and run after them and
grandmamma had given him a penny stella could see her bestowing the
reward with the air of a potentate doubtless they had talked of the
incident all through luncheon the potatoes were disappointing so many
of them were diseased this year canon and mrs grass had been to tea
poor mrs grasss health did not improve but she had been none the
worse for the outing aunt ellen had embroidered such a very pretty
cushion cover as a birthday present for grandmamma and so on the
letter concluded with the usual messages from all at the chestnuts to
dear stella and robert and the hope that they were both keeping fairly
well
stella then opened the other envelope maud matthews what a surprise
only once had maud written since her arrival in india as a bride and
stella had long since assumed that she had dropped out of mauds
thoughts the letter was like a refreshing little breeze to its dejected
recipient
     my dear stella
     i know im a pigandadevil thats dicks word not to have written
     all this time but unless i make myself answer a letter the moment
     it comes i somehow get so that i simply cant answer it at all
     anyway youll have to answer this because i want to know if i
     can break my journey up country at rassih with you and your good
     man dont you hate that expression in most cases im sure bad
     man would be nearer the mark ive got a babysuch a grand excuse
     for going to the hills and ive taken a small house at surima a
     long journey from here but its such a jolly place and no one
     bothers what you do my old dick will be as right as rain by
     himself and hell come up on leave later on rassih isnt much out
     of my way and i must stop somewhere to take breath it would be
     such fun to meet again and have a talk and a laugh are you going
     away for the hot weather or are you one of those saintly wives who
     never desert their husbands have you got a baby if not dont
     they are a scourge though i admit mine might be worse now hes
     here and i refrain from infanticide because he does me such
     credit hes not a bit like dick now may we come send me a wire
     because we must start in a few days and anyway wiring is easier
     than writing a letter
     ever yours
     maud matthews
stella dropped the letter in her lap and sighed with mingled hope and
foreboding would robert consent to her friends visit what a blessed
break it would make in the monotony of her days her courage rose she
decided to send the telegram now before roberts return he could
hardly insist that she should cancel it once it had gone whereas if
she waited to ask his permission he might raise objections though what
reason could he advance for refusing to receive mrs matthews and her
baby for a few days on their way to the hills
hastily she wrote out a telegram called a peon and dispatched him with
it to the post office mercifully sher singh was not lurking about
else the message would certainly have been withheld until his masters
return such was her bondage to the servant who ruled
nervously she told her husband when he came back what she had done
handed him mauds letter her heart beating fast
what a flibbertigibbet he exclaimed contemptuously i suppose we
must put up with the infliction as you say you have wired already
i thought you wouldnt mind said stella apologetically shes an old
friend of mine and i should like to see her again
very well then let her come perhaps it will be an incentive to you to
pull yourself together and behave a little less like a wet rag
maud arrived with mountains of luggage the baby and a retinue of
servants and from that moment the house seemed transformed robert
succumbed reluctantly to the gay company of his guest who took it for
granted that he was overjoyed to receive her she chattered and chaffed
and looked charmingsuch a contrast to her frail hostess
it was not until the morning after her arrival when robert was safely
at work that maud started a confidential conversation with stella who
hitherto had avoided a ttette she shrank from any admission of her
unhappiness and illhealth but maud with all her fortunate lot in
life had spotted at once that something was wrong and by degrees she
succeeded in worming the truth from the unwilling stella who proved as
wax in her ruthless hands very soon she knew all concerning the
unsuitable marriage the trouble with sher singh the affair with philip
flint and the incident of the pearls stellas pitiful condition of body
and mind the two sat talking in low voices throughout the morning
while it pleased young richard as his mother called him to sleep
soundly
something must be done pronounced maud youll snuff out if you go
on like this
i shouldnt care said stella hopelessly
nonsense what you want is a good rousing change away from this beastly
house and every one in it that bearer alone would give me the creeps if
i stayed here much longer once you were away from it all youd get over
this business with philip flint i should have forgotten dick if i
hadnt married him now ill tell you what i mean to make up to your
old robertthedevil and canoodle him into letting you come to surima
with me
stella gave an incredulous laugh you dont know him he will never
let me go
i know men pretty well my dear and after all he is a man as well
as a brutevery often the same thing but not always you can pretend
to be jealous if you like it might help matters on
i cant pretend any more about anything stella had small hope that
maud would succeed in her project if she did it would be little short
of a miracle
very well then lie low and leave it all to me here he comes my lord
the elephant how the time has flown without him
she turned to greet robert as he came into the room well here you are
at last just in time to save us from dying of dullness have you been
working very hard if so how do you manage to look as if you had just
come out of a bandbox you ought to be made to give up the secret
robert regarded her with amused indulgence how do you manage to talk
such nonsense and look so fetching he retorted
do i look fetching she rose and shook her skirts oh ive lost my
shoe she hopped and held forth a slim little foot in an openwork
stocking there it is under that chair
with a grunt robert stooped and retrieved the shoe what an
absurdity he exclaimed balancing it on the palm of his hand
she clutched his arm to steady herself dont make my shoe look silly
i darent put my foot down i might tread on a pin or something and get
mortificationsetin or whatever it is
he pushed her into a chair now then hold up and be shod he
pressed her ankle with his finger and thumb quite clean no splint
not a windgall he took his time fitting on the truant shoe
stella observed the scene with excited wonder robert was flirting she
could hardly credit her senses his small eyes twinkled wickedly maud
looked like a mischievous sprite was it possible that by this means
maud might really succeed in her object as long as she did succeed
stella did not care what means she employed
they went in to breakfast maud sparkled and bantered and talked
tactfully of food praised the curry and the cutlets exchanged
reminiscences with her host concerning the cooking at various
restaurants in london besought colonel crayfield to take her for a ride
that evening and to stellas secret entertainment robert agreed at
once though she knew he had arranged to play tennis for her part she
had planned a drive alone with maud instead she found herself placed
in charge of young richard later on she and the baby with his ayah
watched the pair ride away maud mounted on the grey studbred that by
now had become a sober and tractable member of the stable
geegee quoth the ayah importantly to the bundle in her arms and
young richard aged eight or nine months leapt and squealed with
delight he was a handsome goodtempered child to stella he appeared
singularly intelligent and she felt almost happy that afternoon
wandering about the garden with him and his attendants the ayah
garrulous and consequential swinging her voluminous skirts a staid
bearer carrying a white umbrella and a rattle yet stella did not
envy maud her motherhood no thrill of maternal longing possessed her as
she took the child in her arms to show him the birds and the squirrels
she was only thankful there was no young robert to bind her more
closely to the man she had come to loathe she wondered how maud was
progressing with her subtle scheme wondered with a gleam of hope if
after all robert might not be glad rather than otherwise to get rid of
her glad to take advantage of mauds persuasions while pretending to
grant his engaging guest the favour she asked of him had maud already
broached the subject during their ride
could she have known it maud was making headway craftily with robert
while stella was amusing young richard
isnt it funny said mrs matthews as she and colonel crayfield walked
their horses along the canal bank after a brisk canter i feel as if i
had known you for years i think stella is very much to be envied
do you he grinned complacently tell me why you think so
maud sighed it must be so nice to have a husband one can lean on who
doesnt expect his wife to do all the planning and thinking now with me
and dick i have to take all the responsibility about everything i
daresay i seem very frivolous and featherheaded but i flatter myself i
have my share of common sense it was dreadful having to decide about
leaving dick for the hot weather of course i was torn in twoduty
you know and all thatbut there was the child to be considered as well
as my own health i am sure if you thought stella ought to go to the
hills instead of saying like dick do as you think best you would
settle it offhand not leave the decision to her wouldnt you
stella has no common sense he said evasively frowning
mrs matthews gazed thoughtfully ahead i know what you mean some
people take a long time to grow up of course stella is awfully good and
sweet but as a companion for a man of the world
he glanced at her in quick suspicion and she divined that he was
questioning how much if anything stella had confided to her
i cant quite make her out maud continued confidentially she seems
to me so listless not interested in anything i tried my utmost to get
her to talk this morning but it was no use what is the matter with
her colonel crayfield
shes not well and she will make no sort of effort to rouse herself
he paused then added violently shes just a little fool
well when you think of her upbringing what can you expect but it
seems rather hard on you i wonder if i could help in any way
what could you do if a man of my age is weak enough to marry a child
he must put up with the consequences
perhaps if she could have a change is there no one you could send her
to
only a woman who wouldnt know how to look after her shed very soon
get into mischief
oh surely stella would never do that
his silence was significant for the moment mrs matthews accepted it
she appeared plunged in reflection presently she said couldnt you
get leave yourself and take her away
just now its quite impossible
i understand later on do you think you could manage it
perhaps but ive no use for hill stations
rotten places said maud i know i shall be bored to death at
surima
not likely scoffed robert you
mrs matthews felt she had perhaps made a false step oh ive no doubt
i shall have a good time after a fashion i always make the most of
circumstances and luckily i have a head if i havent much heart i can
take care of myself anywhere look here she went on boldly would you
think of entrusting stella to me i should like a companion and theres
plenty of room in the house i have taken directly you can get leave you
could join us for a bit and that would be ripping
he hesitated gnawed his lip said grumpily its rather a tall order
why it would do stella all the good in the world im certain shed
come back a different creature youd never repent it what could be
worse for you than the silly state she has got into
thats true he admitted and she played on his vanity and his
selfcommiseration until he had promised to think over her proposal
maud returned from the ride in the sure and certain hope that she had
triumphed
part ii
chapter i
a weak monsoon following on scarcity already serious consequent
failure of autumn and spring crops and famine dread word echoed over
the half of india
now the hot weather had set in unusually as it were malevolently
early areas none too fertile at the best of times reverted to parched
deserts wells and riverbeds dried canals shrank strained to the
limit of inadequate supply people and beasts were dying of disease and
starvation and officials both european and indian fought one of
natures remedies for overpopulation with every ounce of human energy
philip flint sat in his officetent weary overtaxed writing with a
sort of dogged persistence his papers were powdered with dust the ink
evaporated thickened in the pot his eyes smarted and his bones ached
for months he had been touring through stricken districts his camp a
kind of flying column inspecting and organising relief works famine
camps poorhouses hospitals out at dawn often not home till dusk he
would have to sit up half the night to wrestle with reports and returns
accounts and statistics so sparing neither body nor brain on behalf of
the miserable multitude that crawled and craved hungersmitten
homeless his heart sore with the sight of skeleton children exhausted
mothers piteous old people
early yesterday he had arrived at a remote point far from town or
railway where earthworks had lately been started for the relief of an
area comprising numerous scattered villages never prosperous now on
the verge of absolute ruin transport was the chief difficulty it must
be some time before the light railway that was being laid from the
nearest junction could be completed cartage and bullocks were scarce
and though a certain stock of food and necessaries were already to hand
there were many to be fed clothed accommodated and the numbers
increased day and night the hospital sheds in charge of a native
doctor were filling rapidly further medical help would be needed
flint had been thankful to hear from his senior subordinate that
recently a zenana mission lady had arrived with a fair supply of
comforts he was familiar with the invaluable work of such women it was
beyond all praise as yet he had not had the time to visit the little
encampment pointed out to him on the far side of the works all day he
had been too busy superintending transport checking stores of grain
considering applications for financial assistance while it was his
duty as well to detect and guard against imposition to sift demands
even to appear callous that the ready cunning of those who sought to
benefit by help intended for their suffering brethren might be
frustrated only this afternoon he had been nearly outdone by an old
fellow who presented himself among a gang of emaciated villagers
clamouring that he had no ploughbullocks no seed nothingthat he and
his descendants were ruined at first flint had listened with
sympathy until something in the demeanour of the bystanders aroused his
suspicions a few of the less distressed members of the crowd were
covertly smiling as though in amused admiration of the patriarchs
powers of persuasion and a little adroit inquiry disclosed the fact
that the supplicant was none other than the moneylender of the village
whence they had all come
in contrast with this example of rascality a man of low caste in obvious
need had stoutly refused assistance other than in the form of a loan
from the government to be repaid with reasonable interest when times
should improve so it had gone on from the firstpatience and pride
heroic endurance a fine sense of fair play in company with avarice
fraud evil intention ignorance stupidity superstition had to be
reckoned with as well allowed for the problems were endless for
while the people must be tended and fed money could not be wasted or
misapplied
at last flint laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair to relax
muscles and mind had he been called upon to define his condition he
would have summed it up simply in the one word cooked he lit a
cigarette and allowed his thoughts liberty it was seldom he permitted
them to dwell upon the past but tonight he was too tired for
selfdiscipline on leaving rassih he had volunteered for famine work as
a desperate antidote to his sickness of heart and spirit this in face
of the knowledge that the decision had probably cost him a chance of
important advancement but the future for him had been shorn of
attraction and the sight of wretchedness and want his passionate pity
for the helpless the strain and the stress of the work had he knew
preserved him from despair as no official promotion could have preserved
him at the time
all the same stella had never been far from his memory and tonight she
seemed to him painfully near again he went over that last scene in the
commissioners house saw crayfield standing grim and contemptuous in
the big drawingroom stella weeping and helpless himself worsted
ashamed without honest claim to defence slink you young hound
the sentence forced itself backwards and forwards through his brain
hitting his pride each time like a shameful blow in his weak
selfishness what misery he had brought upon himself and the woman he
loved would never cease to love where was she now what was she doing
he pictured her at the piano accompanying the selfsatisfied vocal
performance of her husband he visioned the light on her hair the
delicate outline of her neck and he writhed as the memory tortured his
heart what devilish fate had taken him to rassih yet he had a feeling
that in any case he and stella must ultimately have met and that some
day somehow they must meet again the refrain of a cheaply sentimental
little ballad he had heard her sing came back to him some day some
day some day i shall meet youhe could almost hear the clear
choristerlike voice of a certainty the day would come and then he
smiled with a sweet bitterness as he recalled her faith in his work in
his usefulness to india she had said without men like you the wheel
would not go round well he was doing his best in his own way to act
up to her trust and for her sake he would stick to the wheel humbly
unswervingly though the zest and the savour of ambition had gone wiped
out by unlawful love
a cold muzzle crept into his hand that hung listless at his sidejacob
diffident sensitive asking attention jacob had loved her too with
all his tender dogheart on that terrible evening jacob had sat
shivering on the edge of her skirt conscious of trouble until he
followed his miserable master from the room
suddenly he became aware that someone was speaking he looked up to see
an apologetic peon standing at his elbow
sahib there is a memsahib without
for one wild second he fancied it might be stella his mind was so full
of her had she fled to him sure of his love and protection willing to
give herself into his care he felt as though aroused from a distressing
dream perhaps to find that all the pain and the longing had passed
a memsahib is without repeated the peon resentfully she will not
depart though this slave hath told her that the sahib is busy
flint rose mechanically his reason flouting the fancy that stella could
be the memsahib without a tall figure was framed in the doorway of
the tent
yes he said with tentative politeness
i wont keep you long the voice was brisk and high ive come from
the zenana mission camp where im helping miss abigail on behalf of the
charitable relief fund committee
indeed murmured philip inwardly apprehensive the charitable relief
fund committee sometimes added heavily to his work and responsibilities
admirable though its purpose welcome though its help
yes ive been hoping all day to get hold of you but you were always
somewhere else
please come in he glanced around dubiously for the interior of the
tent seemed hardly fit for the reception of a lady files and papers
heaped on the table on the chairs even on the floor dust cigarette
ends everywhere camp equipage boxes books and boots in a hopeless
jumble
im afraid its all very untidy he added as he cleared a seat
the brisk high voice responded what does it matter who can hope to
be tidy in these horrible circumstances i feel very untidy myself
she did not look it whatever she felt here was no typical zenana
mission female but a longlimbed wellbuilt girl garbed in a neat
holland frock brown shoes washleather gloves and an obviously
english felt hat bound with a blue puggaree that proclaimed itself
indispensable for travel in the east all very plain and serviceable
but to an experienced eye undoubtedly expensive
to flints astonishment she took off her hat carelessly as any man
might have done and dropped it beside her chair he saw that her hair
was cropped short a thick mop of curling foxcoloured hair that her
eyes clear and shining were grey and truculent that her freckled
irregular nose and rather large mouth had a certain charm he felt
faintly scandalised when she proceeded to help herself calmly to a
cigarette from his box lighting it with an accustomed air smoking
among ladies was not general in india at that period seated she
crossed her legs showing slim ankles and neatlyturned calves in brown
stockings
well she began i thought someone ought to come and tell you that a
lot of people have bolted from the relief works
yes i know
and you dont care i suppose she interrupted
he stared at her puzzled why this unprovoked attack we shall get
them back perhaps you dont realise the reason
again she broke in its because you officials inspire no trust
what on earth was the matter with the girlwas she a lunatic
im afraid superstition is more to blame he told her patiently some
mischiefmaker among them has probably started the report that they are
all to be murdered in order to extract oil from their bodies for
medicinal purposes
what nonsense
he wondered if she meant the report or his explanation
of course its nonsense but that kind of thing will happen even
nowadays superstition dies hard in india coolies often bolt wholesale
when some important work has to be started because in old times before
our occupation of the country a human victim was nearly always buried
beneath the foundations of any big building as a sop to the gods
he could see she did not believe him his anger rose how long have you
been out here he inquired
quite long enough to discover how little the people are considered i
think the government ought to be hanged not a penny will you spendon
this famine for examplewithout exacting the uttermost farthing in
return you make these wretched creatures work for a mere pittance you
force them into poorhouses when you know it lowers their selfrespect
and many of them die because they would rather die than accept relief in
the way you administer it she paused breathless
and how do you propose it should be administeredindiscriminately and
no questions asked that would be rather hard on the taxpayers and bad
for the people themselves i think even the charitable relief fund
committee would hardly work on those lines
she ignored his argument its appalling she went on heatedly to
find how badly private charity is needed i came out a few weeks ago to
see what i could do to help and im horrified where would all these
unfortunate people be without the charitable relief fund
if it comes to that he retorted where would they be without all the
government machinery that is kept ready to be set going directly
scarcity becomes seriousthe means of transport the linking up with
unaffected provinces the loans for seed and cattle good heavens you
can have no conception of the work
she opened her mouth to speak but he stopped her with a peremptory
gesture and continued quickly private charity is of the utmost value
in a calamity of this kind and we are only too thankful for it
especially in remote regions but personal sacrifice and hard work isnt
entirely confined to the nonofficial the help would be simply a drop
in the ocean if the way hadnt been prepared try to be just miss
he waited interrogatively
bakerdorothy bakershe waved her cigarette you may have heard of
my father lord redgate
so here was the solution of the girls extraordinary antagonism she was
the daughter of a newmade nobleman whose apparent object in life to
judge by his speeches was to disparage british administration in india
to discount the long years of effort and experience to undermine
confidence in honest rule no doubt such an undertaking engendered a
nice sense of superiority and importance that blinded its owner to the
truth if his eyes were not shut deliberately this obtrusive young
woman was clearly imbued with her parents particular form of conceit
he would not trouble to wrangle with her further
oh yes he said indifferently we have all heard of your father did
he object to your coming out here alone
object of course not he believes in the freedom of the individual
and if he had objected i should be here all the same i always do as i
please
and it pleased you to come out and do famine work how kind of you
she shot him a glance of contemptuous suspicion he understood all that
the glance implied as a british official in india he was an enemy of
the people a bureaucrat battening on the revenue wrung from a
povertystricken land one of the guilty gang that kept indians from the
possession of their country yet she seemed in no hurry to quit the
presence of such a tyrant and oppressor evidently she found his chair
comfortable was enjoying his cigarettes and perhaps she was not
altogether averse to a little change of companionship it was
conceivable that the privilege of constant intercourse with her zenana
colleague might have become a bit of a strain for himself her young
presence despite her antagonism was in a measure welcome after his fit
of depression physically she was an attractive creature and her nave
selfimportance her impulsive opinions suited her vigorous
personality jacob the little traitor was already making advances to
the visitor she snapped her finger and thumb in response
i like dogs she said as though it were a form of weakness that
redounded to her credit and they always love me
and horses
oh yes rather i wanted to buy a pony but miss abigail seemed to
think it would not be quite in keeping with the work we are doing and
that the money had better be spent in some other direction we get
about in a bullock shigram not a very comfortable or rapid mode of
progression but comfort and convenience dont count of course
personally im not sure that we oughtnt to walk everywhere
it would perhaps be a waste of energy and time suggested philip
but think of the example you i suppose ride or drive everywhere
i couldnt get through my work if i didnt it would entail endless
delay in the administration of relief im practically singlehanded in
this circle for example tomorrow morning i have to cover roughly
speaking about fifteen miles before breakfast how would you like to
come with me have you a saddlei could mount you
obviously the offer tempted her yes i brought out my saddle perhaps
it wouldnt be a bad thing
it would give you a further opportunity of condemning our iniquitous
methods said philip meekly
she let the thrust pass all right what time do you start
about six is that too early for you
dont talk rot send the gee to our camp and ill be ready
good now can i offer you any refreshmentwill you have a cup of tea
or coffee or he ventured in view of the cigarettes a peg
nothing thank you she rose a little reluctantly now i must get
back
have you a lantern he inquired for the sudden indian dusk had
descended
she looked out of the tent no i never thought of it but i can find
my way all right
ill come with you
she protested he paid no attention and presently they were stumbling
along side by side in the wake of a peon who marched ahead swinging a
hurricane lantern and banging a staff on the ground to scare possible
snakes that at this season waking from their winter sleep were apt to
lie curled in the warm dust a danger to pedestrians
are you married she asked him suddenly
no i am a lone being and i think it is just as well
why
if i had a wife and children it would only mean separation sooner or
later children must be sent home after a certain age not only on
account of health and education but because the moral atmosphere is bad
for them and to my mind the children should be considered before the
husband
how do you meanthe moral atmosphere she asked argumentatively i
have always understood that natives were excellent with children kind
and patient and faithful
they are all that bless them he said but their ideas of discipline
are not quite the same as our own to tell lies is merely a matter of
selfprotection and all wrong as it may seem they knuckle under to
english children let them have their own way and encourage them
indirectly to be arrogant and selfindulgent taking a sort of pride in
their faults at least that is what my married friends tell me
then the parents are to blame declared miss baker severely for
leaving their children to the care of servants while they amuse
themselves flirting and dancing and playing games you dont accuse this
mr kipling everybody talks about of writing what is not true i
conclude
have you never read a preface to one of his books in which he
particularly warns his readers not to judge of the dirt of a room by the
sweepings in a corner parents in india are much the same as parents in
england and parents in england havent to contend with exile and
climate and long separationshe paused feeling he was wasting his
breath and was ashamed of a spiteful little sense of satisfaction when
at that moment she tripped and clung to him to save herself a fall
now if i hadnt been with youhe could not help reminding her
i should have come a cropper and probably been none the worse she
replied ungratefully what were we saying oh about parents in india
why do you go into the indian services at all then you know what to
expect
why do we go into the army and the navythe worst paid professions on
earth its an instinct thank goodness and with it goes the love of
justice and fair play towards the weak and unprotected its the keynote
of our power all the world over
oh you are hopeless cried miss baker i call it love of conquest
and position and power
call it what you like dont you shut your eyes to the resultsanyway
out here
the results poverty and famine and a refusal to allow the people to
govern themselves refusal to mix with them socially
wait a moment he interrupted angry with himself because he could not
keep silence which in your opinion should governthe hindus or the
mohammedans
of course the hindus india is their country
the mohammedans would have something to say to that or rather it
would be deeds not words and how about other nations who would all like
to exploit india we could hardly be expected to keep up an army and a
navy to prevent them from doing so if we had no stake in the country
go on she urged sarcastically i am listening
when india is in a position to protect herself from internal quarrels
and foreign invasion it will be time enough for us to clear out and as
far as social questions go i can assure you they are not at all anxious
to mix with us their customs and traditions are all opposed to ours
but it would take weeks to give you even the most superficial idea of
the difficulties and at the end i suppose you wouldnt believe me
oh ive heard it all over and over again from hidebound old generals
and retired civilians at home the same timeworn arguments that really
mean nothing however i am quite ready to believe that you personally
are well disposed towards the people and that you do your best for them
in spite of the trammels of red tape
he refrained from an amused expression of gratitude after all the
girl was actuated by benevolent intention however befogged and she was
enduring discomforts almost hardship in her selfimposed philanthropy
as he realised when they arrived at the zenana mission encampment what
wretched little tents badly pitched illlighted with a clamouring
throng of distressful humanity pressing up to the very flaps from the
tent in the centre came the sound of singing a familiar hymn tune
there now exclaimed miss baker in vexation im late for evening
prayers im an atheist myself but i try to fit in with my chiefs
customs
i hope for her sake that you spare her argument on the subject of
religion at least said flint with a magnanimous laugh as he held her
hand in farewell we shall meet again tomorrow morning
he watched her disappear into the principal tent and turned his steps
back to his camp his feelings ajar why would these good folk from home
interfere in what they knew nothing about what mischief they made all
unwittingly for the most part adding to the difficulties already so
great for those who were working under conditions but dimly understood
even by the faction who trusted their own countrymen and did not regard
the english official as a thief and a bully and a time server
in spite of miss bakers tiresome attitude he looked forward to seeing
her the following morning she was a stimulating companion and engaging
in her way with her boyish figure her eager grey eyes her expressive
irregular features in time if they met often enough they might
become friendsan armed friendship perhaps but none the less
interesting for that what would stella have thought of her stella
with her passionate perception of the work that england had done in the
past was doing in the present would continue to do as long as she was
permitted with honest endeavour for india he was conscious of a
revival of his old ambitions as he plodded over the uneven track and
far into the night he sat writing reading spurred refreshed as well
by the unexpected diversion of miss bakers visit and her violent
opinions
chapter ii
miss baker could ride not a doubt about that thought philip she sat
squarely in her saddle hands down right shoulder well back her habit
skirt was very short she wore a stiff white shirt and collar and a
linen coat the whole effect was neat and smart and pleasing how she
chattered as they rode over the bare dusty plain some of her theories
rather startled her cavalier for example she considered it immoral of
people to have large families unless they could afford to educate the
children highlythis with reference to some friends of miss abigails
who had spent the previous day in the zenana mission camp on their way
to the nearest station a missionary with his spouse and offspring
did you tell them so asked flint with amused curiosity
yes of course i did and i asked them how they were going to provide
for three boys and two girls in the future
what did they say
they said the lord would provide and that the mission granted an extra
allowance for each child
then you can hardly blame them i suppose
i think that clergymen and doctors and schoolmasters ought all to be
celibates they should be able to give their whole attention to their
work unhampered by domestic affairs
that is expecting a good deal surely
i dont see it marriage isnt everything now if i were a man i should
never marry
and not being a man
oh i dare say i shall marry some day but my husband would have to
share my views on all the important questions of the day and believe
absolutely in the equality of the sexes at present i hate men
oh dear
yes that is partly why i came out to india to escapeshe checked
herself as though she had been on the brink of a confidence then
addedto escape worrying attentions
then it was not entirely devotion to the downtrodden masses of this
miserable country he asked slyly
she flushed and said with lofty evasion i felt india needed me i
wanted to help india i dont mean to stay out here permanently of
course only till i have collected enough information and proof to open
the eyes of the electors at home i shall write a book i think i shall
call it what i saw in india
why not the evil english in the east he suggested amiably an
alliterative title is always arresting the one you have thought of
might be regarded as almost too uncommon
she laughed as though unable to help herself at least it seemed she
had some saving sense of humour
how silly you are you dont take life seriously at all
perhaps not he spoke carelessly but he felt he could have shaken
miss bakerconceited selfsatisfied monkeypuffed up with her
superficial views untouched as she was by trouble or experience so
ready to blame and condemn where she did not understand of what avail
to argue with her why should he bother about what she thought if she
ever really thought at all help india indeed who was she to help or
even hinder the great machinery of eastern administration and as to her
independence of sexsome day she would learn that she was but flying in
the face of nature and he hoped she would suffer for it
we must get on he said and as they put their horses into a gallop he
found himself admiring the way in which she handled the mount he had
lent her a highspirited young chestnut unaccustomed to a sidesaddle
yet aware that liberties could not be taken with his present rider
flint noted the strong turn of her wrist the firmness of her long slim
foot in the stirrup the poise of her straight young figure it crossed
his mind but for her wild ideas what a wife she would make for a man
whose life was all action ready for emergencies and discomforts
willing to rough it daring unafraid she ought to marry a colonial go
with him to canada australia his equal in physical endurance and
disregard of convention yet mastered by his manhood the mother of a
string of strong children whether they could be educated highly or not
an unworthy temptation assailed him as they arrived at an outstanding
relief camp he helped her from her saddle with a bold tenderness that
held an element of revenge held her hand a little longer than was
strictly necessary looked into her fine grey eyes of purpose intently
he could not tell if she recognised the unspoken signal if she did she
ignored it and presently they were deep in the object of their
expedition tramping over hot hard ground watching the slow movements
of the ragged crowdwomen and children breaking up dry clumps of soil
carrying it on their heads in baskets men and boys digging scraping
it was like an ants nest without the energy and diligence of those
insects for the workers were weak and apathetic only looking forward
as was natural to the distribution of food and money that was to
follow
flint was on the look out for bullying among the overseers for petty
pilfering on the part of the distributors of supplies he listened
patiently to complaints investigated grievances and entirely forgot
miss baker except when she asked questions or got in his way she
followed him for the most part silently unobtrusively and the morning
was well advanced before it suddenly struck him that his companion must
be feeling the need of refreshment they were a long way from
headquarters far from any place of accommodation the sun was
overpowering he noted that she looked tired and hot he himself felt
fagged his inspection was not yet completed never mind he could
return this evening and finish it at the price of a little extra
pressure and exertion
he took out his watch look here he said penitently you must be
pretty well done let us get back as quick as we can and have a good
breakfast in my camp
she hesitated if he could have seen into her mind she was thinking of
the kind of meal she might expect on her return to miss abigails tents
boiled rice and pulse and perhaps a stew that had seen service
already she was despising herself because the temptation was strong to
accept the invitation and not altogether on account of the better fare
wouldnt it be proper for you to breakfast with me alone he asked
provocatively
i wasnt thinking of that she exclaimed with scorn and added not
quite honestly i was only wondering if miss abigail would be keeping
breakfast waiting for me she knew perfectly well that miss abigail
would not
she knows you are with me i suppose
oh yes
then why worry come along
on their way back she asked him you do this kind of thing every day
certainly its my job
but you are paid for it she remarked vindictively
one must live though perhaps in my case you dont see the necessity
anyway i get no extra pay so its not for pure love of gain
how do you mean werent you ordered to do the work
as it happens no i volunteered
then where would you have been if you hadnt
at simla perhaps or somewhere away from the famine area in my own
province
then you dont belong to this part
no ive been lent
at your own request
havent i just said so
for a space she was silent then she said grudgingly after all its
nothing so very wonderful
i quite agree i lay no claim to doing anything wonderful now you
on the other hand have left a comfortable home and quite a different
kind of life at i am sure an enormous sacrifice to come out and help
india
she winced obviously and he enjoyed her discomfiture yet his
conscience smote him for he queried inwardly if he would have been here
at all but for the fateful happenings at rassih at the same time he did
not intend to enlighten miss baker on that point for the sake of other
englishmen who had given their services in this terrible affliction
without reserve better let her believe that he had been actuated solely
by a stern sense of duty the result of his work was the same he had
foregone advancement was out of the running overworking himself
without hope of reward in the future if he were not on the spot someone
else would be the whole thing was general not individual england was
doing her duty by india comprehensively he was but a fly on the wheel
and he neither desired nor expected special recognition but he felt
entitled to exact just approbation on these grounds from this
arrogant girl who in her way represented a certain section of public
opinion at home
save for a few desultory remarks on the scenery she said little more as
they urged their horses onward but he noted a new diffidence in her
attitude she was less aggressive a little softer and despite his
contempt for her outlook on indian affairs he could not forbear to take
advantage of her weakening he talked seriously earnestly of the
problems and peoples of the country set forth their helpless dependence
on disinterested rule defended british enterprise and to his
satisfaction she listened through it all he watched her clever
expressive face how she showed her feelingsan undisciplined nature
one moment he saw hesitation doubt of her own judgment the next
incredulity impatience of his arguments again a little light of
enthusiasm in her eyes albeit reluctant as he spoke of the long line
of heroes who had made india what she wasprosperous peaceful secure
in so far as such a vast and complex country could be secure unless
danger was fostered from within she had a good heart if her brain
was illtrained falsely developed he wondered what her childhood had
been like how she had been brought up and later as they were seated
at breakfast in his tent he asked her if she had ever been at school
oh yes the ordinary thing a rotten place at brightonall music and
french and dancing you see we are very rich people my father is a big
manufacturer he began life with the proverbial halfcrown in his
pocket we are not blueblooded at all i can assure you my mother was
the daughter of a small artisan to the day of her death a few years
ago she hated late dinner and was afraid of the servants i firmly
believe she died poor dear because she had to live in an atmosphere
that was too much for her she couldnt stand the strain when my father
bought a place in the country and a house in london and she was obliged
to entertain and meet people she had never been accustomed to she was a
victim to the intermediate stage in time of course all the big places
will be in the hands of goahead men like the pater who have made their
own fortunes and the idle rich will disappear
what about the descendants of the goahead men put in philip have
you any brothers
yes two
and are they working for their livings
well she moved uneasily one is in the guards and the other is still
at oxford
and you were sent to an expensive school for young ladies at brighton
in a few generations i suppose you will be ousted from your big place
in your turn
but we know how to take care of our money it wont be squandered in
racing and cards and dissolute living
how do you know doesnt it depend on the individual there are plenty
of pedigree landlords who are models of stewardship and right thinking
doing their duty by the country and their responsibilities just as
there are selfmade men who are selfish and hard and tyrannical it
isnt entirely a question of birth and heredity i am of opinion that if
a man with an inherited position and property is false to his trust he
should be deprived of it by law but when he does his best he should be
protected from attacks that are prompted more often by jealousy than by
concern for the poor what do the majority of selfmade men go for once
they are made titles and places isnt it true
the girl crumbled the toast on her plate with restless fingers
everything is all wrong she burst out presently my father wont see
that we ought to keep only just enough for ourselves and share the rest
with the people who have helped him to make his money why should we
have an estate in the country and a sort of palace in london while our
workmen are living in slums its abominable i admit we are as bad in
our way as the families that can trace their descent for hundreds of
years and look upon their lands and their tenants as just mediums of
supply for their luxuries and amusements it will always be the same i
suppose
it has been the same since the beginning of the world said flint
each man for himself its human nature have some more coffee
yes please its delicious miss abigail seems to think its wrong to
have decent food why she and her kind arent all dead from poisoning i
cant imagine
the survival of the fittest perhaps
their hearts and their souls are bound up in the work and their
stomachs dont seem to matter i feel i am horribly material and
greedy perhaps i havent a soul or a heart only a stomach
in that case you wouldnt be out here he suggested for her comfort
giving your time and your money in a good cause
i dont want to take credit for that i am beginning to see that i may
have come out with a mistaken motive not so much to do my little bit
over the famine as to find fault with what seemed to me an autocratic
mode of government if all indian officials were like you
like me philip gave a bitter little laugh i may also have had my
motive in doing famine work apart from the welfare of the people we are
all actuated by motives principally selfish and private
she finished her coffee anyway she said rising i am glad we have
met though you have upset my ideas and made me feel horrid when i
thought i was such an angel of mercy and reform i am afraid i am very
conceited but it is so nice to feel superior and generous
he saw tears in her eyes and he took her outstretched hand in true
comradeship ashamed of his attempt that morning to play upon her
natural instincts dont bother about motives he said in friendly
understanding go on with your blessed work we are all doing what we
can for the people of this great old country and believe me they arent
insensible to our efforts they know in their hearts some day they will
stand by us and give all they can in recognition of what we have done in
the past for them the test is bound to come and whoever gets the
credit doesnt matter the result will be our reward the only fear is
that all the drudgery and the sacrifice may be undone go for nothing
wrecked by a clique composed of selfseekers encouraged by those who
have quite other ends to gain
they left the tent together he helped her into her saddle and watched
her ride off attended by the syce who would bring back the chestnut the
honourable dorothy bakerborn of the people reared as an aristocrat
who had set out to patronise those among whom such an anomaly was
impossible unthinkable how invaluable might be the zeal of her kind
rightly inspired and directed in the cause of india could they only
divest themselves of the very arrogance they were so anxious to impute
to the men who were guarding the safety of the brightest jewel in the
crown of england
for the next few hours flint buried himself in papers the heat and the
dust and the flies were distracting he found it hard to fix his mind on
his work and his thoughts wandered perversely he remembered he had not
yet written his weekly letter to his mother it had been so difficult to
write naturally after the upheaval at rassih he had felt such a
hypocriteallowing his parents to infer that in volunteering for famine
work he had been prompted solely by a sense of duty yet to tell them
the truth was beyond him he pictured the old people in their
comfortable south kensington home his father always busy over local
charities and municipal boards and councils majorgeneral sir philip
flint had not shed his energy and public spirit with his retirement from
indian service dear old chapwhite haired courtly ever ready to
listen when people came to him with grievances real or imaginary and
the mater with her large circle of old indian friends her bazaars and
her tea parties and the never ending stream of visitors she was always
so ready to put up people just arrived from india old friends
settled in the country who were intent on a weeks shopping hospitality
was in her bones she would have loved to harbour grandchildren philip
knew how she regretted that his sister was not the wife of an indian
civilian or an indian army man though her marriage to a prominent
specialist in harley street had been highly satisfactory as lady flint
admitted of course she would say it was a comfort to feel that grace
was so well provided for but grace lived in such a different world from
their owna world composed of public people people connected with the
stage and literature and art politics the law no dull old generals
or members of the indian council and so on for grace and there were no
babies to come and spend the day with granny to be taken to the
seaside to be fussed over and spoiled her great hope now as she
told him in her letters was that philip would marry some dear girl
whose family like his own had served the indian government for
generations so that they would all understand each other and carry on
the old traditions comfortably friends in every sense graces friends
and inlaws were a sort of nervous terror to poor lady flint what
would be her feelings questioned her son as he sat dreaming of his
mother in his tent so far away from her could she know the truth
could she realise that her hopes of such a daughterinlaw would never
be fulfilled so long as stella crayfield claimed his heart and that
would be for alwaystill he died
the pen dropped from his fingers he leaned back in his chair drowsy
inert jacob was snoring in a corner from without came the ceaseless
murmur of the concourse awaiting his decisions and on his table lay
such piles of papers still to be examined from sheer weariness he fell
asleep and dreamed of stella of their hopeless love and mingled with
it all was the memory of dorothy baker vigorous purposeful arresting
he seemed to be standing between the two girls at the base of a long
flight of steps they were urging him upward but he felt tired
slacklimbed heavyhearted he wanted to rest the steps were so steep
high as a pyramid of egypt he could not see the top it was lost in a
haze of luminous light go on go on they were saying they were
holding each others hands as it seemed to him conspiring to urge him
forward go on they have all gone up in their turnlook some are
already at the top some have died on the way some have lost
everything but never mindgo on go on
and he struggled lifting his feet to the steps that were rough and
burning to find himself in the midst of a ghostly pageant near him was
a little old man with dim tragic eyes dressed in a blue coat and knee
breeches where had he seen him before there was a world of sorrow of
bitter disappointment in the small bowed figure so pathetic yet
breathing a spirit of wisdom and untiring tenacity who are you little
old man tell me who you are philip heard himself asking and faintly
as though borne on the hot west wind came the whisper of a namewas it
warren hastings a wrinkled yellow hand was raised pointing upward
a few more steps now he was pushing through a motley host all strangely
garbed some of them held up a cross and a book some displayed tokens
of trade there were women with empty arms weeping for the husbands and
the children they had lost yet glorying in the sacrifice and a band of
people half english half indian who had given their lives in the cause
of their great two parents they were lining the ladder the stiff
steep ladder someone stepped out from the crowd and laid an
encouraging hand on his arm go on my boy fight there is nothing
like fighting and to his horror philip saw that the speakers throat
was cut that he held in his hand a little penknife and a pen just a
quill pen who was it who was it had ended his life in a moment of
mad impulse the fine brain snapping with the strain and the fervour of
work and responsibility ah now he remembered it was clive great
clive so noble so strong in his influence and judgment in his making
of indian history always a fighter even from his schoolboy days
what a pitiful end to a brave career and yet what matter when the task
had been accomplished victories won at least he had but sought peace
and repose in his own way and at his own time the hand that held the
fatal little knife was also waving him upward pointing to the top
with him were others ghosts from the past whispering names magical
names that lived not only in the memories of those of their own race
and colour but in the hearts of the people they had served and fought
for and saved also great fighters with dusky faces and flashing eyes
faithful supporters fearless and fierce without whose allegiance all
the strife and the sacrifice might have been useless one in spirit with
their leaders east and west bound together by one high aimthat of
justice and right dont fail us they chorused keep going give
of your best as we did before you and they waved their swords and
their scimitars and the cross driving him upward till at the summit
he saw a speck of light that as he climbed grew in brilliance took
shape and formed itself into letters of fire star of india
he cried what can i do i am only one of a crowd a fly on the wheel
the sound of his own voice wakened him he stood up still dazed
haunted by the fantastic dream jacob was snoring in the corner hoarse
voices murmured outside a swirl of hot dust and wind shook the tent
mechanically flint sorted his papers put on his hat and went forth
into the hot stillness of the evening
chapter iii
as was only to be expected miss baker had brought a photographic outfit
with her to the zenana mission camp flint came across her next evening
endeavouring to snap a little bevy of famine wallahs new arrivals
squatting with their cooking vessels till their turn for attention
should come there seemed to be no extreme cases among them and though
all were obviously weary in need of food none were too exhausted to
exhibit lively alarm at sight of the feringhee woman who waved her hands
and pointed her black box at them they hid their faces turned their
backs jabbered expostulations finally rose and scattered like so many
frightened fowls leaving their utensils behind them
philip halted just for a moment he was in a hurry on his way to take
over a large consignment of incoming supplies
illustrations for a book i suppose he said smiling at her annoyance
with the fleeing little crowd of course she was ignorant of the belief
among the rustic population that when a picture is taken a portion of
the spirit goes with it causing calamity take photographs when
theyre not looking he advised
she turned the camera on to him let me take you at any rate you can
stand still i imagine i must take something i dont know how many
plates i havent wasted over these people what on earth is the matter
with them
i cant stop to explain or to stand still at present a lot of stuff is
arriving and i must go and receive it
come and have tea with us tomorrow and ill take you then miss
abigail told me to ask you if you came along shes over there
miss baker indicated a temporary enclosure in the near distance where
he could see a short substantial figure trundling about amidst a
gathering of women and children
thanks id like to come i ought to have paid my respects before now
he cantered off leaving miss baker preparing to photograph the
abandoned pots and pans
when the time came for him to fulfil the engagement for the following
afternoon he was surprised to realise how eagerly he had looked forward
to it work and anxiety had slackened a little with the arrival of fresh
supplies and he felt almost lighthearted as he bathed and got into
clean flannels for the first time since he had left rassih he caught
himself singing in his bath he walked the good halfmile that lay
between his own encampment and that of the zenana mission lady jacob at
his heels well groomed like his master they were a goodlooking
english pair
miss baker was outside the living tent photographing laban the native
bible teacher who posed in mingled pride and uneasinessproud to be
taken in his black alpaca coat and porkpie cap a shinybound testament
in one hand a bulging umbrella in the other uneasy because deep down
in his mind for all his enlightenment there lurked the same fear that
had brought about the flight of the famine wallahs
one minute miss baker called out to the approaching visitor a click
and she raised her head triumphantly thank you mr laban that ought
to be very good you shall have some copies to send to your home and
ill put your picture in my book
mr laban salaamed and withdrew hurriedly then it was flints turn
he submitted while miss baker took him seated standing with jacob
without jacob she fetched a larger camera from her own tent and talked
of headandshoulders profile full and threequarter face portraits
she commanded him to take off his hat
but i shall get sunstroke and you would have to nurse me he
quibbled rather bored with the performance though miss bakers
engrossment amused him and she was a pleasant vision in her blue linen
frock a bright flush on her cheeks her ruddy hair curling about her
neck and ears and forehead beneath what might have been a boys straw
hat
oh miss abigail would do that she assured him i hate nursing i
know nothing about it come into the shade of the trees behind the
tents
the little camp was pitched close to a couple of mango trees probably
the sole survivors of a once flourishing grove but as the space
surrounding their trunks had been appropriated by the servants as an
openair kitchen shared by the shigram bullocks a goat and her kids a
collection of fowls and a few sprawling children flint hesitated
compromised
why not the big peepul tree further back he suggested
the tree in question stood solitary and majestic between the camp and
the adjacent village a landmark in the wide flatness mightier far
more ancient than the mango trees no doubt it had once shaded a temple
long since ruined and decayed
but its such a way off objected miss baker wed better have tea
first the light will be better afterwards too
miss abigail settled the question for the moment she emerged from the
living tent a stout ungainly body greyhaired middleaged browned
by exposure and innumerable hot weathers but there was character in the
blunt homely features courage in the small light eyes a woman to be
trusted and esteemed in spite of her unfortunate appearance philip
liked her instinctively she reminded him of a cottage loaf rather
overbaked all knobs and crusty protuberances spreading and wholesome
miss baker introduced them with a proprietary air that included them
both and they entered the tent where tea was laid carelessly on an
unsteady camp table the spout of the teapot was broken the plates were
all chips and cracks there was a pat of danish butter goats milk
some slabs of thick toast and a tin of jam roughly opened with some
blunt implement
he glanced at miss baker saw her nose wrinkle ever so slightly as
though in suppressed distaste was she contrasting the spectacle with
afternoon tea in the sort of palace in london and the place in the
country
nevertheless it was a cheerful little meal they laughed and talked
flint described to miss abigail the scene he had witnessed the previous
evening when the famine wallahs had refused to be photographed he
explained the reason to miss baker who said it was of course the
fault of the government that such silly ideas should still be general
the people should have been educated out of them by this time
what about the freedom of the individual he inquired why should
they be photographed if they dislike it for whatever reason
thats a smack at me i suppose said miss baker huffily
not a very hard smack any way he looked at her with a friendly
smile and mollified she smiled back at him it turned out that miss
abigail knew the beards at rassih though she had seen nothing of them
for years she asked many questions about them and their work few of
which flint was able to answer indeed he could hardly remember what the
beards were like they talked shop discussed the works and the
shelters and the hospital agreed how lucky it was that the well in the
village was holding out satisfactorily so far miss abigail was certain
she had seen a small cloud in the distance that morning and was
confident that if they all prayed hard enough rain would fall within a
reasonable time flint said politely that he hoped so indeed miss baker
tried not to look scornful
between them they emptied the teapot and finished the toast and miss
baker observed that if mr flint insisted on being photographed under
the peepul tree they had better be up and doing miss abigail was
persuaded to accompany them though she openly grudged the time and
they plodded through the dust of the rough road that led past the camp
and the great tree on to the village beyond
i hate peepul trees said miss abigail with an odd little shudder
the leaves never seem to be still even when there is hardly a breath
of wind to stir them look at them hark at them now
the flat spadeshaped leaves trembled in the sultry evening heat the
faint continuous rustle sounded like whispering voices no wonder
philip reflected that spirits were believed by the people to dwell in
the branches miss abigail glanced disgustedly at the rough timeworn
stones scattered about its roots some bore traces of carving
unmistakable figures of idols others showed sacred symbols defaced
indistinct all remnants of a former shrine or temple bits of rag had
been hung by some passing worshipper to the lower twigs of the tree it
looked as miss baker remarked as though someone had flown through the
branches leaving scraps of their clothing behind them
the rags are hung there as a protection against evil spirits said
flint all the superstitions connected with the peepul tree would fill
a goodsized volume look at that bit of thread wound round the trunk
somebody has lately been propitiating the tree by walking round it and
winding the thread as they went the peepul is the home of the hindu
trinity as well as of mischievous devils
theres a nasty atmosphere of idolatry that doesnt suit me at all
proclaimed miss abigail its high time a christian was buried here to
counteract all the wickedness this horrid old tree must have witnessed
in its time she smiled at her own little pleasantry
philip laughed and then the grave would become a sort of shrine in its
turn and the people would make offerings to it and hang more rags than
ever in the branches above it
miss baker turned to miss abigail but you wouldnt like to be buried
here would you she inquired aghast
i dont care where i am buried when my time comes but here for choice
if i thought it would do any good miss abigail dived into a capacious
pocket pulled out a pair of folding scissors and calmly proceeded to
cut the thread that encircled the tree trunk there thats my protest
against the devil and all his bad works
to the embarrassment of her companions she then knelt down on the roots
and in a loud voice said a vigorous prayer what a curious contrast she
presented to her surroundingsan almost grotesque figure in an attitude
of supplication with her dustcoloured gown flowing about her and an
unlovely sun hat on the back of her head jacob sniffed at the soles of
her boots that protruded from beneath her skirts the prayer finished
she rose without a trace of selfconsciousness brushed the dust from
her knees and requested miss baker to make haste over the photography
as her help would soon be needed in the camp with the evening work
then she stumped off towards the tents
did you ever exclaimed miss baker looking after the retreating
figure now i suppose something awful will happen to us all i feel
quite nervous hark at the leaves there really might be something
moving about in the branches
shall we hang up a piece of rag suggested philip chaffingly
half in earnest she took out her handkerchief a white wisp with a
pretty coloured border
its a pity to tear that said philip
a sacrifice she replied and before he could stop her she had torn it
in two now you hang up one bit and ill hang up the other what would
miss abigail say for goodness sake dont tell her
laughing they hitched the bits of cambric to the twigs above their
heads and miss baker picked up her camera
now then take off your hat and lets hope the spirits wont spoil my
pictures
chapter iv
three days later cholera broke out on the relief works
during the afternoon a woman had arrived with a dead monkeylike infant
in her arms and a dilapidated little family clinging to her skirts only
herself to curl up and die in the heartbreaking fashion common to the
stricken native haplessly silently without struggle or protest
before dawn the demon let loose among a weakened multitude had begun to
pick off victims here in a triangle there in a semicircle again in a
neat zigzag as if with mathematical malice and caprice
flint roused at daybreak by the fatal news worked for hours in
conjunction with the medical officer dosing segregating attending to
the removal of the dead striving to stem the panic that might drive the
people to scatter over the countryside spreading the disease then
after a hasty breakfast he rode off to miss abigails camp with the
intention of urging miss baker to seek some other field of activity in
view of the present danger he encountered laban the bible teacher
nervous and voluble outside the principal tent and was informed by him
that the two ladies had gone forth the previous morning to visit a small
outpost in connection with the mission some few miles distant having
arranged to remain there for the night they had not yet returned
this is a very bad sickness added laban how shall we all escape
with our livesand my grandmother dying in cawnpur calling and
calling for my presence
meantime suggested philip left cold in regard to the grandmother
hadnt you better go and help with the children whose parents are dying
or dead theres a good supply of tinned milk and its got to be served
out quickly
the teachers flabby brown face paled to a sickly hue he swallowed
hard and his lips moved philip fancied he caught the word
photograph probably the wretched laban unable to divest himself of
the fear that a portion of his spirit had already gone from him with the
taking of his picture felt he was doomed unless he could flee to his
home
look here old chap went on flint prompted by sympathetic
understanding arent you a soldier of christ ready to fight for your
own people
he asked the question with a certain grim amusement at his own recourse
to missionary diction but presently the amusement turned to respectful
admiration as laban shivered hesitated then without further ado or
explanation marched off in the direction of the camp
inwardly flint salaamed to the shambling figure of this soldier of
christ he said to himself by jove thats a feather in the
missionary cap
he had turned his horses head when the sight of a little cloud of dust
in the distance caused him to halt and out of the dustcloud appeared a
hooded bullock cart crawling bumping over the rough ground at a
snails pace he waited wondering how the energetic miss baker could
bear with such leisurely travel since patience was hardly one of her
gifts the bullocks must have taken hours covering the distance when at
last the vehicle pulled up at the camp a flushed and fuming young person
scrambled from beneath the hood
thank goodness exclaimed miss baker shaking the dust from her
clothes and stretching her cramped limbs hullo mr flint her face
brightened at sight of him what do you want
good morning had a nice drive he smiled at the grimace that was her
answer and dismounted
i want to speak to miss abigail it had occurred to him that miss
abigails powers of persuasion might prove more effective than his own
in the matter of counselling change of air for miss baker the girl
being more or less under her authority truth to tell he rather shrank
with masculine cowardice from a task that he anticipated would involve
something of a scene
here she is thenwhats left of her after that awful journey there
was plenty of miss abigail left the stout square figure clambered
backwards from the cart and he took comfort from the fat kindly face
and brave little eyes he drew her aside
bad news he said weve got cholera in the works
ah so it has come i dont know which i have been dreading most that
or smallpox well we must all turn to and do our best
but what about miss baker she oughtnt to be allowed to stay
why not she has put her hand to the plough and surely you dont
expect her to turn back
he felt annoyed disconcerted its all right for us he deprecated
but miss baker should go
well then you had better tell her to do so frankly i shant be sorry
if she takes your advice amateurs are more bother than they are worth
in my line of work but i cant urge her to bolt
dont you feel responsible for her safety a girl out here alone
she came of her own free will as far as i know and was handed over to
me by the charitable relief fund committee i didnt ask for her but
now shes here i consider she should take the rough with the smooth like
the rest of us i will leave you to settle the question
with a nod and an exasperating smile of unsympathetic comprehension miss
abigail stumped off to her tent
miss baker approached what has happened she asked you look
peevish dont cry
ive been telling miss abigail she ought to send you away at once
and are you so miserable because she has refused or consented why
should i be sent away what have i done
cholera has started among the people he told her bluntly and you
must pack up and be off unless you want to add to our anxieties
could he believe his eyes instead of the torrent of lofty expostulation
he had expected and hoped successfully to combat the girl simply
showed him the tip of her tongue there she added defiantly after
this vulgar exhibition
do for heavens sake listen to reason he began irately
dont waste time she interrupted i know what you want me to hear
but i cant wait for your words of wisdom i must make haste to pack and
run away as fast as i can
she darted towards miss abigails tent throwing him a glance of
derisive revolt over her shoulder he was helpless anyway he had but
done what seemed to him his duty and he had been given no chance of
emphasising the fact that in leaving the camp she would be sparing him
and miss abigail additional responsibility yet he doubted if any
argument under the sun would prevail with her now to remain and risk
death would of course enhance the feeling of superiority and
benevolence that on her own admission she found so pleasant
he rode back to the works determined to put her out of his mind he had
more to think of he told himself than a tiresome pigheaded girl but
later in the day when he caught sight of her with miss abigail and the
bibleteacher herding a flock of women and children into a newmade
enclosure his conscience murmured reproaches at least dorothy bakers
pluck was undeniable even though it might be the pluck of ignorance and
selfwill
that was a dreadful night at times the hot still air rang with the
weeping and wailing of mourners piteous cries that rose and fell the
silences that intervened seemed even worsewhile the fight with death
went on now and then it appeared as if the fatal scourge had been
checked in its merciless progress then again as though leaping the
barriers it would break out in some quarter hitherto free luckily
remedies held out and more were expected in answer to urgent telegrams
by dawn further medical help had arrived and as the sun rose fierce
and cruel flint felt justified in snatching a rest he was roused from
heavy sleep by a message a message scribbled in obvious haste and
agitation by miss baker from the mission camp
please come quickly its miss abigail
an ominous summons fearing its import he obeyed it without delay
ordered a horse to be saddled threw on his clothes and rode rapidly
arrived he found within a sagging little sleeping tent miss baker
seated beside a narrow campbed on which as he perceived at first
glance lay a dying woman the once round tanned face of the lady
missionary was wet and grey so strangely altered the sturdy form was
twisted and shrunken a horrible odour pervaded the atmosphere mingled
with the smell of drugs and straw and canvas at the foot of the bed a
dishevelled ayah crouched terrified weeping on the rough uneven
drugget was scattered a confusion of clothes a couple of tin basins a
shabby bible a notebook the solitary camp table was covered with
bottles and coarse crockery
dorothy baker turned to philip flint she was pale trembling a little
yet wonderfully selfcontrolled
it was so sudden she faltered biting her white lips this morning
she was quite well full of energy and plans we had come back for some
breakfast and she was taken ill laban fetched the doctor he stayed as
long as he could and she got better he said he thought she would pull
through i did everything he told me but now see i have sent for him
again
flint laid his finger on a cold wrist clearly it was a case of sudden
collapse beyond hope even as he felt the faint racing pulse it grew
feebler fluttered spasmodically he heard the girls voice in his
ear a choking whisper is she going is it the end
he nodded and the whisper went on just before you came she spoke she
said she knew and she wanted to be buried under the tree under the
peepul tree
he nodded again she poured something into a glass and held it out to
him try she urged perhaps she could take it
to please her he tried though he knew it was useless what a pitiful
death scenethe cramped untidy little tent the coarse bedclothes the
scanty furniture the only ornament if so it could be called a text
printed in large black letters on a piece of cardboard hung to a nail
on the yellow tentpole thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
yet philip felt it was all ennobled by the sound faith the unswerving
purpose of the strong simple soul whose work on earth was over for a
few moments there was silence even the stifled convulsive sobbing of
the ayah crouched at the foot of the bed had ceased the woman hid her
face in her wrapper then presently with a longdrawn sigh a gallant
spirit passed to rest for ann abigail ardent christian brave worker
in the cause of alien souls and bodies no more weary hot weathers no
more disappointment discomfort sacrifice and as philip gazed down on
the blunt features that already were almost beautiful in their repose he
found himself picturing miss abigail heading a band of helpless
bewildered ghosts leading them from the camp and the works to regions
where suffering fear and want were unknown
he remembered dorothy baker and looked round she was still standing
close beside him silent her eyes fixed on the dead face now she
swayed put her hand to her throat i have neveri have never seen
anyone die then aware of his concern for her she added
reassuringly im all right im not going to faint
come into the other tent wheres your hat
she did not seem to know he looked about found his own and held it
umbrellawise over her head as he guided her quickly through the
burning midday glare to the living tent that was hardly bigger than the
one they had left she made no resistance sat down at his bidding and
drank the brandy he gave her from his flask then he stood watching her
anxiously as the colour came slowly back to her lips and cheeks his
mind was working swiftly somehow he must get the girl away she had had
a severe shock her vitality was lowered he dreaded the
consequences
footsteps and voices outside drew him to the door of the tent and for
the next few hours he and the doctor were busy over such arrangements as
were possible for the funeral the work finished flint sent off a
messenger mounted on a camel to the railway junction with a couple of
telegrams one was to the headquarters of the mission in the nearest
station the other was to the wife of the magistrate whom he happened
to know slightly he had evolved a plan for the benefit of miss baker
and he only trusted she would fall in with it all the time she had
remained in her tent effaced herself for which he was grateful to her
perhaps she would be equally sensible when he told her what he had
done
by sundown a rough coffin was ready composed of packingcases a grave
had been dug beneath the big peepul tree and a melancholy little
procession started headed by the bullock shigram that bore miss abigail
on her final journey flint had fetched miss baker at the last moment
he had promised her he would do so and they walked together behind the
shigram laban crying bitterly the native doctor one or two
subordinates followed and the dead womans servants behind them again
came a straggling crowd of people from the works and the camp
flint read the burial service dorothy baker stood by his side now and
then she shivered despite the heavy heat of the evening he saw her
glance furtively at the scraps of her handkerchief that hung conspicuous
from the branches above their heads he knew she must be picturing as
he was the scene of but a few evenings back when miss abigail had
knelt praying among the roots of the tree the air was thick and
sultry perhaps miss abigail was right perhaps rain was not so far
off the setting sun threw a red glow over the land already the
fireflies danced in the branches the leaves whispered and rustled two
or three bats flew from the foliage skimming over the open grave and
the heap of sulphurcoloured soil at the side now the last words had
been read now the coffin wrapped in a blanket was lowered into the
shallow trench the dry earth was shovelled over it by the scavenger
coolies of the village and the gathering all but philip flint and the
english girl and laban departed at a sign from flint the coolies
collected some of the stones that lay about and piled them upon the
grave
oh she would hate that cried the girl impulsively the idols the
carvings
there must be some protection flint told her reluctantly you see
jackals and other animals
i understand she turned away gazing sadly over the misty red plain
and we have to leave her here by herself oh i cant bear itindia is
horrible horrible
for the first time she broke down leaned weeping against the trunk
of the tree that maybe had seen other human sacrifices offered at its
foot flint waited for a moment then he went to her took her hand
gently protectively
dont grieve too much he said she is all right she would have
asked nothing better than to give her life for her work we are not
leaving her here remember
i wish i could thinkshe paused flung out her hands passionately i
cant believe anything i always wondered how she could and here am i
alive and useless and she has gone it seems so unfair
i expect she was very tired said flint simply and is glad to rest
come back to the camp laban will see that it is all finished properly
and i want to talk to you
they started it was now almost dark and he set himself as they went to
tell her what he had arrangedthat she should take miss abigails
personal belongings back to the mission headquarters
the things are all ready he confessed i told the ayah to pack them
there were very few just a writingcase and a little locked box and
some papers and notebooks one or two photographs her bible and prayer
book the camp things can all follow later of course the clothes she
was wearing and the bed and so on have had to be burnt that was
necessary the mission people will understand
at first she said nothing he went on hurriedly i can drive you to
the junction theres a train
you want me to go she asked below her breath to go now tonight
his heart sank did she mean to refuse its only right she would have
wished you to go you know she would
but do you wish it she bent towards him trying to see his face in
the gathering dusk
only because i know i ought to send you away
silence again for a space i telegraphed to the magistrates wife as
well she is a kind woman she will take you in if you would prefer it
to the mission house i am sure
there was a pathetic little catch in her voice as she answered drearily
yes i suppose i must go oh how everything has altered just in a few
hours
thats india
i feel so horribly alone
it will be different when you get into the station i wish i could go
with you all the way but i must stick here till this epidemic is over
and things are working properly then i go on to another district where
i hear matters are pretty bad goodness knows when all the trouble will
end
i wonder if we shall ever meet again
i hope so youll write wont you and let me know your plans
yes of course andshall i go on writing
would you i should like it sometimes i feel horribly alone too
you arent happy
no i am more alone than you are they had reached the camp his trap
which he had ordered beforehand to meet them was waiting
just pack what you will want for the next day or two he advised i
will see that everything else is sent after you at once you must come
and have some dinner with me and then well start for the junction
its a long drive the train goes about midnight
she obeyed him with a touching docility for the rest of that curious
evening she might have been a child leaning on his judgment listening
to his directions trusting him utterly he knew she ate the food that
was set before her because he urged her to do so accepted his brandy
flask and the escort of his old bearer for the journey got into the
trap without a word when the moment came for their departure jacob
leapt at the wheels in an agony of apprehension that he was to be left
behind
cant he come too she asked and the panting whimpering jacob was
hoisted on to her lap the moon was rising as they set off a swollen
red moon whose light irradiated the veil of dust that hung over the
spreading irregular earthworks the lines of sheds the outlying groups
of tents here and there a few spidery thorn trees showed black and
scantyit was as if a fire had swept the locality and was still
smouldering a hum of voices the thin wailing of women and children
rose and hung in the hot mist
the trap rocked over the uneven ground now sinking into soft powdery
soil now jerking against clods of earth hard as iron they left the
works and the camps behind them and headed for the grand trunk road
marked by an avenue of great trees in the distance passed through a
village that was silent deserted most of the inhabitants had sought
refuge on the relief works on the outskirts they encountered an
ashsmeared figure practically naked with long matted hair and
upraised arms who called after themcursings or blessings what matter
which
the comparatively smooth surface of the grand trunk road came as a
blessed relief and they spun along swiftly between the rows of giant
trees avoiding sleepy carts that crawled in the middle of the highway
passing silent plodding little bands of foot travellers neither of
them felt inclined for conversation the hot still air through which
they clove the rhythmical beat of the ponys hoofs lulled their
senses even jacob had long since ceased to fidget and demand
attention as in a dream they arrived at the junction that with its
satellites of ugly square buildings appeared to have been dropped
without purpose on to a barren plain and found themselves in the midst
of a clamouring throng of humanity every caste seemed to be
represented from the shaven highfeatured brahmin priest to the
humblest uncleanest outsider a proof so often quoted by the
inexperienced observer of the power of progress yet while the
twiceborn would journey cheek by jowl with the pariah making use of
the railway for his own convenience in reality it brought them no
nearer to bridging the gulf a few oblations ceremonial ablutions a
liberal religious offering and the highcaste traveller would feel
cleansed soul and body from the evil effect of such contamination
the interior of the station was suffocating philip shouldered a way for
his companion through the crowd to a waitingroom reserved for
europeans only where they found a family of eurasians already
installed bundles innumerable a pack of fretful children a litter of
domestic belongings spread over the floor
philip backed hastily from the entrance this wont do he said we
must try the refreshmentroom
it was scarcely more inviting but at least they had the place to
themselves save for a couple of slovenlylooking servants who were
flicking crumbs and dead flies from the table laid with dirty
appointments a dingy punkah began to wave jerkily moving the
illsmelling air nauseated weary miserable because she was about to
part from the only man who had ever appealed to her heart as well as to
her mind dorothy baker sat staring at the pretentious electroplated
epergne set in the middle of the table coloured tissue paper ruffled
about its base
how sordid it all was she dared not look at philip flint for fear she
should lose her selfcontrol the lump in her throat was almost
strangling
to philip her silence her depression merely indicated that she was
pitifully tired worn out with the trying events of the day and no
wonder poor girl he felt helpless at his wits end to know what more
he could do for her
it wont be long now he said in hopeful desperation looking at his
watch the train ought to be here in a few moments
in a few moments she echoed mechanically
then from outside came the clangour of metal striking a suspended
length of rail the indian equivalent of the station bell announcing
the trains arrival
here she is philip rose half relieved half reluctant they plunged
into the yelling throng on the platform flints old bearer spread the
misssahibs bedding on an empty seat in the ladies compartment that
had only one other occupant a mummylike form fast asleep
now youre all right philip looked into the carriage youd better
get in and settle yourself for the night
she held out her hand please dont wait she said formally avoiding
his gaze goodbyes are so horrid and they say its unlucky to see the
last of a traveller
unlucky for me to see the last of you i shall miss you
oh no you wont she said sharply goodbye and very many thanks
for all your kindness
she got into the train through the window he saw her busying herself
with her bag she did not even look up as the train passed out of the
station chilled and puzzled he turned away what an odd girl her
curious behaviour her grey eyes and freckled eager face filled his
thoughts as he drove back to his camp in the hot moonlight
chapter v
slowly monotonously for philip the months dragged on unmarked by any
special events of a personal character at intervals he heard from miss
baker first she reported her safe arrival at the mission headquarters
having considered it only right to go there rather than take advantage
of the more comfortable hospitality offered by the magistrate and his
wife but apparently this meritorious attitude was not fully understood
or appreciated by her hardworking hosts for miss baker complained that
though the mission people were always desperately busy themselves they
made no real use of the services she was so ready to render one of them
had actually advocated her joining the station club that she might
obtain some distraction the next letter came from the magistrates
bungalow where miss baker was being nursed over an attack her first
attack of malarial fever at the mission house it seemed no one had
time to look after a white patient the magistrates wife had most
opportunely come to the rescue as soon as a passage could be secured
miss baker intended to go home on the whole she confessed she felt
that her visit to india had not been quite the success she had
anticipated wherever she went she seemed only to get in the wayand
she had meant to be so useful english people in india wasted their
energies over things that did not greatly matter and in consequence
had no time for more vital questions later on perhaps she might come
back and with better results in any case she had gathered ample
material for her book which she would begin on the voyage she wrote
to philip from board ship and again from her fathers house in mayfair
the letters still contained criticisms aimed at british administration
in india but through them all there ran a pathetic little undercurrent
of selfdistrust that reached philips sympathy and her neverfailing
remembrance of their brief companionship touched himalways her love to
jacob and how was the chestnut pony and the old bearer and did he
recollect this that and the other also when was he coming home a few
mails later great excitement she had met lady lanejohnson his
sister at a big literary gathering quite by accident they had begun
to talk about india and then of course had discovered etc etc
these letters though philip sometimes felt it an effort to answer them
were welcome during the dreary routine of duty as inspection followed
inspection journey upon journey by road or by rail from one
faminesmitten area to another the battle with death and want continued
through the long hot days and nights until as though with belated
compassion nature at last stepped in and a strong monsoon swept up
from the coast allaying epidemics washing away disease and dirt
reviving energy and hope and if the work was still as strenuous in its
way it was at least work that was spurred by relief and thankfulness in
place of dread and despair
with the cessation of the rains flint felt free to take a
breathingspace his leave granted for september he sought a popular
station that not being the headquarters of a provincial government
was in a measure exempt from official etiquette and certain irksome
observances that prevailed in the more important health resorts surima
its dwellings perched like a flock of white birds on the slopes of the
high hills was notorious for its gaiety and its gregarious gatherings
here assembled merchants from the great ports lonely ladies whose
health and spirits suffered from the heat and the dullness of the
plains subalterns intent on a good time holidaymakers of every
service and calling and an abundance of pretty girls
philip selected surima for his leave because he felt it might be
possible to lose his identity for the time being in such a motley crowd
he need make no calls government house with a visitors book and
commands to social functions was nonexistent his presence would not be
noted he intended to loaf to spend long hours in the lifegiving air
on the hillsides perhaps do a little shootingjungle fowl a bear or
two possibly a leopard he would have ease and leisure in which to make
up his mind whether to sink back to the level of humdrum district
administration until his first pension was due and he could leave india
altogether or set himself to regain his position in the front ranks of
competitors for high office he realised that he was overworked that
his mental outlook was hardly to be trusted at present deranged as it
had been by the distressing affair at rassih given time and rest he
might manage in a measure to make a fresh start and to put the past
behind him
to his disgust the club chambers at surima were full and he was forced
to find temporary quarters in a fashionable hotel that occupied a
central position it was close on the dinner hour when he arrived and
as he changed into evening clothes he found it difficult to realise that
for a full month he would be master of his time able to follow his own
inclinations with a sense of personal freedom he strolled into the
diningroom only to be confronted by a scene that at first glance made
him querywas he by any chance in a lunatic asylum instead of a
hotel
the tables were crowded with a chattering throng garbed in a variety of
fantastic costumes a host of masqueraders he beheld a devil complete
with horns and tail a red indian an aerial being all wings and
gossamer figures enveloped in dominoes others painted patched
bewiggedall laughing and talking and eating he felt like a sparrow
that had strayed into an aviary of tropical birds humbly he slipped
into an empty seat beside a stout youth draped in a leopard skin with a
wreath on his brow bacchus or whatever mythological character this
individual imagined he represented made way for the stranger
goodnaturedly
got up just in time for the ball he shouted as though it were a
matter for the heartiest congratulation
is there a ball inquired philip dismayed what a superfluous
question
rather the fancy ball of the season every soul in the place will
be at it know many people up here
nobodythat i am aware of
soon cure that complaint keen on dancing
not particularly and dancing hasnt been exactly encouraged where i
come from he thought grimly of desolate camps of relief works bare
plains and stricken villages of all the stress and the strain of the
last year what could be farther from festivity
some beastly little station i suppose assumed his companion
sympathetically if it wasnt for places like surima we should all rot
and die i come from a hole sixty miles off the railway only seven of
us all told including the women just a small hell upon earth i put in
for three months urgent private affairs my only chance he grinned
luckily they asked no awkward questions next week my leaves up worse
luck
he fell to eating dejectedly but soon added in a hopeful tone anyway
im going to enjoy my last hours now if you want introductions
remember im your man no doginthemanger about j d horniblow he
looked round the room plenty to choose from if youre not over
particular
thanks dont bother about me said philip indifferently bed is more
in my line than a ball tonight
oh but you must see what we can produce in the way of beauty even
if you dont want to dance all this lot here are nothing compared
with he began to reel off names with impudent comments on each
philip paid small attention till he became aware that the chatterbox
was describing with enthusiasm the charms of a particular lady over
whom he asserted the whole place was crazy the name came to his ears
with the effect of a pistol shot
he stammered out whowho did you saymrsmrs crayfield
yes mrs crayfield shes the rage absolutely divine she and her
friend mrs matthews carry everything before them not that mrs m can
compare with mrs c though little mrs m is fetching enough in her
own way i might manage to introduce you ill try if you like but
theyre in the generals set and thats rather a close preserve the
old boy fancies himself no end with mrs c and young nash his
aidedecamp poodles for mrs matthews so its very convenient all
round
flint writhed in silence was there another mrs crayfield soon he
would know and he tried to be deaf to the rattle of this jackanapes
joining the tail of the crowd that surged into the ballroom after
dinner he took up a position against the whitewashed wall that was
decorated with flimsy festoons of pink and blue muslin and watched the
revellers filling their programmes chaffing laughing what fools they
looked how could grownup people be so idiotic yet in justice he
reminded himself that the majority of them must have endured the
hardships inseparable from exile trials of climate and sickness and
separation even actual danger to life and person that they would go
back to these conditions grumbling no doubt but refreshed and
strengthened to endure them again by such frivolities this pathetic
aping of smart society that would be regarded with contemptuous
amusement by its superior prototype at home how dorothy baker would
have censured the scene simply because it was laid in india where of
course none of her compatriots deserved or should desire frivolous
recreation not one of these merrymakers but would face death without
hesitation should the necessity arise and in a community all more or
less of one class there was bound to be scandal with far less reason
very often than in their own country where wickedness could be hidden
successfully he almost forgave the harmless enough gossip he had
heard at the dinner table even endeavoured to tolerate his wouldbe
friend who buzzed round him so important as one in the know still
offering introductions
little miss green nowthat girl over there dressed as a butterfly
not much to look at i grant you with her figure she ought to have gone
as a bluebottle but she can dance and first gooff in a place like
this you have to take what you can get she and her sisters rely on the
newcomers thankful for any kind of partners sensible girls easy
enough to drop them when you get into the swim or theres mrs bray
only her husbands jealous of course theyre known as the donkeys he
wont let her dance with anyone more than once there was a row at the
last cinderella
flint bestirred himself please dont trouble i dont want to dance
ill just look on for a bit he nodded a polite but determined
dismissal and was turning away when his tormentor exclaimed
ah here we are now look here she comes the general in tow of
course and half a dozen other adorers shes a fine hand at driving a
team
flint held his breath his heart seemed to rise in his throat as the
crowd parted slightly and a group came through one of the doorways to
the swing of a waltz he saw stellayes stellaadvancing down the
long shining floor of the ballroom radiant lighthearted attended by
a little court of men mostly in uniform he could not have told how she
was dressed he merely had an impression of floating pink drapery
gleams of silver she looked to him taller less girlish in a way
changed her bearing held a gay confidence how different from his
last sight of hera wan despairing figure huddled weeping in a chair
she had forgotten him their love had been but an episode in her young
life while for his part how he had sufferedsacrificed so much he
ought to have expected it should have realised that child as she was
her heart must heal quickly from a wound that though painful enough no
doubt at the time had not gone deep youth had asserted its claim
pleasure social success admiration had consoled her successfully he
strove for her sake to feel glad to stem the storm of rage and
selfpity that seized him devil take the handsome elderly satyr who
was speaking in her ear she was smiling at him it was unbearable
now she was hidden by the whirling throng he waited morose and
miserable planning to leave the bright scene before she should
discover his presence to clear out of surima at dawn and go where he
could assert his claim to advancement pick up the threads of ambition
push and trample and fight his way fiercely to the top it was not too
late the way was still open
yet unable to tear himself away he stood a stiff black figure
against the wall his eyes scanning the dancers until presently she
passed him in the arms of her distinguishedlooking partner the scarlet
of whose coat clashed harshly with the rosecolour of her gown as they
danced they were talking and laughing in his mind philip called to her
stella stella he felt as if the whole room must hear him the
pair halted at the opposite side of the room the man was bending his
irongrey head towards her there was force personality in the well
setup figure and the bold features that but just escaped coarseness he
was taking stellas fan from her hand with a familiar proprietary air
that to philip was maddening he lost hold of his high intentions and
crossed the room deliberately making his way among the dancers
regardless of their indignant protests the collisions he caused as far
as he was concerned they might all have been phantomshe simply walked
through them
then he stood before stella before the woman he loved bowed like any
casual acquaintance and heard himself saying
mrs crayfield have you forgotten me my name is flint
startled she looked up and he saw the colour drain from her lips and
cheeks the general stiffened clearly resenting the intrusion
ive just got up from the plains continued philip pleasantly though
he found it hard to steady his voice i had no idea you were at surima
its a long time since we last met isnt it
yes she said faintly not looking at him a long time
he knew that for the moment at any rate he was being a killjoy a
ghost at the feast calling up the past spoiling her pleasure yet the
consciousness was mingled with a sense of revengeful satisfaction that
he could not control her passing vexation of spirit was as nothing
compared with the tortures of his own
come along mrs crayfield the general was moving his feet impatient
to be off again we shall miss the last part of the waltz he made as
if to place his arm about her waist
philip turned aside not waiting for her to look at or speak to him
further blindly he made his way from the ballroom his thoughts his
sensations in confusion only to find himself in the midst of a babbling
concourse of natives outside bearers of the canoeshaped conveyances in
which ladies and even a few men were borne to the dance neighing
ponies were clustered by the railings it was all jostle and noise he
walked round to the side of the hotel and discovered an empty veranda a
quiet refuge where he could smoke and attempt to think calmly as he
leaned on the railing his racked nerves welcomed the cold night air the
starlit peace the scent and the faint stir of the pine trees beneath
the ramshackle building sloped the wooded hillside far far below lay
the wide plains dark and boundless as an ocean right and left in
endless majesty stretched the mountains and back in everrising ranges
to the snow peaks the home of the gods his thoughts went loosely
adrift that little crowd of human beings dancing philandering in the
ballroom intent on their enjoyment their fleeting loves and hates
whose lives were less than infinitesimal fractions of seconds compared
with the ages who could grudge them their little day while it lasted
nature had no pity no sympathy for the struggles the temptations the
sorrows the pleasures of the everpassing multitude of human insects
loving and dancing and fighting through their short moments of darkness
or sunshine what was love what was sin what difference could it
make whether any of them failed or succeeded did what seemed to them
right or wrong nothing really mattered should the human race be
swept from the face of the earth the hills and the plains the seas and
the sun the moon and the stars would go on to the end of time
footsteps and voices broke in on flints wild if hardly original
reflections he recognised that a couple intent on privacy were groping
their way into the dark retreat he heard the grating of chairs on the
stone floor caught snatches of talk as he hid himself instinctively in
the shadow of a pillar
all right the mans tone was full of tender concern you wont feel
cold now listengive me your hand your dear little hand i must tell
you i cant wait any longer you know dont you darling
there came a tearful agitated response yes but there will be such a
row mother and father will never understand
oh they will when they see were determined dont be frightened
weve only got to stick to it hold on you do love me sweetheart
dont you
philip slunk round the pillar and left the lovers to themselves how he
envied the two young creaturestheir path clear before them save for
the frail barrier of parental prudence which of course in the end
would break down it was all so idyllic so natural what a contrast to
his own dark outlook where love was concerned in bitter envy he
loitered on the pathway outside beset by a longing to return to the
ballroom that he might catch just one more glimpse of stella whatever
the cost before turning his back on surima at dawn
in a few moments he was standing among a group of spectators in one of
the doorways his eyes anxiously searching the crowd of dancers but in
vain she was not in the ballroom
hullo this is luck thought youd gone byebye his importunate
acquaintance of the dinnertable was pushing a way to his side flint
is your name isnt it
philip nodded absently
well mrs matthews would like me to introduce you she says she knows
all about you dark horse you are you never let on when i mentioned
her at dinner it was only when she got hold of me just now and said
mr horniblow you know everybody can you point me out a new arrival
whose name is mr flint that i smelt a rat and of course i made
straight for you there she is come on now quick or we shall miss
her
he grabbed philips coat sleeve and dragged him forward before he could
resist he was being presented to a livelylooking little lady all
sequins and red and gold tissue and a tambourine
that was very clever of you mr horniblow she said brightly to the
triumphant gobetween thank you so much
she turned in pretty apology to philip dont think me too bold she
seemed to be pitching her voice high of intention perhaps youve
forgotten me but i remember you she shot him a meaning glance
and he could not but take the hint
he feigned pleasure this is a surprise but when we last met you
werent a gypsy oror a spanish dancerwhich must be my excuse for
not recognising you at once he offered her his arm
with a charming smile she waved away her late partner a diffident young
soldier easily shelved for the moment and talking gaily of the dance
of the dresses of anything she guided philip to the platform of which
the front seats were filled with chaperones and partnerless girls well
at the back screened by this rampart of female forms stood a sofa
safe from listening ears they took possession of it
neatly done exclaimed mrs matthews sinking to her seat
very returned philip but i dont quite understand
you are mr flint mr philip flint
certainly that is my name
well mrs crayfield has gone home
oh wasnt she feeling fit he inquired apparently unmoved
she glanced at him in rather resentful surprise now dont be
tiresome she said quickly i know all about it and we havent much
time to talk i cant throw over any more partners stella was worried
upset at seeing you so unexpectedly i said id find you and explain
shes staying with me we were girls together you know i dare say
stella has told you about me maud verrall
yes of course of course he knew about maud verrall and the court
and the chestnuts and grandmamma and the aunts had any detail of
stellas childhood imparted to him by her faded from his mind
we only got into touch with each other again at the beginning of this
hot weather somehow wed stopped writing but when i settled to come up
here i wrote and asked if i could break my journey with the crayfields
for a few days what an awful hole rassih is i found stella half dead
that old brute colonel crayfield ought to be shot and his horrible
servant too between them they had nearly killed the poor girl
philip moved uneasily and drew in his breath do you he began
but he was not allowed to finish his question mrs matthews took it up
do i know everything of course stella told me and the silly row
about the pearls that gave the show away she had a perfectly poisonous
time after you left i dont know how she got through it and im sure
she doesnt know either when i turned up old crayfield was getting
rather sick of her always being seedy and i diddled him into letting
her come with me he took a fancy to me and i let himany port in a
storm weve lived in terror that he would come up on leave but luckily
he hasnt been able to get away stella was awfully ill for the first
few weeks after we arrived
she looks very well now said philip coldly and happy he added
his companion smote him sharply on the knee with her fan
my good man you ought to be thankful both for your own sake and for
hers
i am and for that reason dont you think id better go without seeing
her again
mrs matthews hesitated and philip waited hoping for some crumb of
comfort for the smallest encouragement to stay
the answer came slowly i think you ought to go you seeyou see
stella has found out the power of her beauty and her charm and its a
sort of consolation to her shell never get into mischief not
seriously i mean with anyone else and as you and she cant come
together again without the risk of a lot of bother and trouble youd
much better let her alone you cant blame her if she takes what she can
get out of life under the circumstances
i dont he said shortly if she can put the past behind her i can
but try to do the same
wise man oh look at this creature making for me i shall have to go
the dance has begun
a cowboy had climbed the das in pursuit of mrs matthews and further
hope of confidential conversation was blocked philip rose and held out
his hand
goodbye thenand thank you for your advice i will take it i
recognise that you are right
as they parted he saw sympathy in her bright eyes and was grudgingly
miserably grateful
chapter vi
oh how slack i feel dances are the devil maud matthews yawned and
stretched amid a nest of cushions in a long chair im sure i must look
about sixty do i stella
she appealed to her friend who at that moment joined her in the veranda
of the swiss chaletlike habitation perched on the hillside clear
midday sunshine blazed over the terraced garden thick with dahlias
crimson and purple orangered yellow a wild luxuriant growth pots
of chrysanthemums fringed the veranda steps an autumn odour pervaded
the atmosphere a smell of ferns and moss and pungent evaporation the
sky was like pale blue glass and far far away beyond valleys and
rising ranges glittered and sparkled the everlasting snows
outside on the narrow pathway young richard was asserting himself in a
perambulator attended by the longsuffering ayah who every few minutes
retrieved a woolly toy handing it back to the small tyrant with
indulgent remonstrance haiyai what is to be done with such a
malefactor must not throw it is forbidden
beat him his mother advised lazily beat him with a big stick
dost harken warned the ayah one more throw and see what will
befall
instantly the woolly toy was again hurtled down among the dahlias and
the child shrieked with mischievous glee
aree narty the ayah picked up her petticoats and plunged into the
foliage
unperturbed by her sons misdemeanours mrs matthews turned once more
to her guest and began to patter nonsense truth to tell she was
nervously delaying the moment when stellas questions must be answered
if possible dear thing you look even more dreadful than i do though
you went home so early last night i got back at some disreputable hour
and peeped into your room but you were asleep really to look at you
one would imagine your husband was coming up on leave next week
instead of mine what on earth shall i do with dick hell hate all my
men friends and be rude to them and expect me to break all my
engagements i suppose we shall go to bed early and have long walks
before breakfast and devote ourselves to young richard with intervals
for arguments over domestic affairs
oh to hear you interrupted stella with exasperation one would
think you didnt care one snap for dick or that imp in the perambulator
why humbug with me of all people
yes i know in hasty apology i know i am lucky yet you have your
compensations you are ever so much better looking than i am and your
looks are of the sort that will last your nose for example its a
nose for a lifetime you can amuse yourself with a clear conscience
without feeling a pig as i do when i flirt till alls blue how i am to
suppress bobbie nash when dick appears on the scene is a problem and i
cant give the young owl a hint beforehand that would be a bit too low
now you and your old playboyeven dick couldnt make a fuss if it was
the general instead of bobbie nash
oh maud do stop cried stella at the end of her endurance mauds
little excitements and intrigues were so trivial no misery no
heartache lay beneath the surface of her frivolity stella knew well
enough that maud loved her husband and that once he was on the spot she
would be happy in his company though in his absence the attentions of a
herd of irresponsible young men was as the breath of her nostrils how
can you go on gabbling like this when you know what i am longing to
hear
last night she had fled from the ballroom distraught by the sudden
unexpected meeting with philip it had been beyond her to remain as if
nothing had happened she was at a loss to interpret his demeanour so
distant so formal did he intend her to understand that his feelings
had changed she had relied upon maud to find out for hours she had
lain awake listening for mauds return till from sheer exhaustion she
had fallen asleep and after all maud had not awakened her both of
them had slept late into the morning and now maud would only drivel
about her own silly affairs the suspense was intolerable she could
bear it no longer
arent you going to tell me anything she demanded furiously
wait a moment mrs matthews rose from her long chair and went to kiss
her obstreperous offspring in the perambulator gave some directions to
the ayah and banished the pair to another quarter of the garden out of
sight and hearing then she returned to her seat and faced stella with
reluctance
its rather difficult to tell you she began that was why i was
putting it off he has gone
stella flushed and paled gone gone away from surimafromfrom me
maud nodded now dear thing be sensible i assure you he hopes you
may have got over that unfortunate business between you he wants to get
over it too i dont say he has any more than you have altogether but
you both will given the chance isnt it best you cant deny it
stella
oh maud what have you done stellas voice rang sharp with pain and
reproach her disappointment was poignant she had expected some
message she hardly knew what but something of solace and reassurance
at the least that philip wanted to see her alone she had never dreamed
that he would not wish to see her
i havent done anything declared maud defensively he saw for
himself that you werent exactly pining away without him and if you do
still care about him you ought to be thankful that he has gone off like
this without making further trouble for you or for himself after all
you wouldnt bolt with him when you had the chance and quite right too
and now you shouldnt want him to be a martyr any more than he wants you
to mope for the rest of your life
stella gazed at her blankly staunch friend though maud was how little
she understood oh why had she not stayed on at the ball she might
have got at the truth for herself instead she had behaved like a fool
like a coward and so philip had gone
she burst out tell me what he said what you said tell me exactly
dont dare to keep anything from me
my dear girl keep calm you cant expect me to remember every single
word we uttered im not trying to make mischief and muddles like
people in stories i simply told him how i had got you away from rassih
and how ill you were and he simply said that as you looked very happy
and well he thought the best thing he could do was to clear out and i
agreed with him i pointed out that you had learnt to enjoy yourself
and that he couldnt blame you he said he didnt i must say i dont
wonder you fell in love with him especially at rassih he is an awfully
good sort but you know if he had stayed here now the whole thing would
have begun all over again and been worse than ever buck up stella
you had a lucky escape i dare say i might have persuaded him to stay
but i knew it was best not to when you have thought it all over youll
say i was right and be grateful instead of looking as if you would like
to poke my eyes out
stella sat miserably silent there was nothing further to be said it
would hardly be fair to accuse maud of having done her an ill turn but
at present she certainly could not bring herself to feel grateful sore
and wretched she rose
im going for a walk before tiffin she said abruptly
keep out of the sun then advised maud or youll have a headache
remember its the generals garden party this afternoon and the club
dinner and theatricals tonight just put out the not at home box
will you im not fit to be seen this morning and cant be bothered
with callers
a little later stella strolled along the pathway she hung the
protective cardbox on the trunk of the pine tree that guarded the small
domain then she wandered up the steep incline towards an upper road
little frequented by the english community it led to the back of the
hill where as yet no bungalows had been erected dwindling eventually
to a mere bridle path used by the hill people from far distant villages
once away from all sound of the station she seated herself on a
mosscovered boulder and gazed gloomily over the blue valleys and the
opposite mountains that in the rarefied atmosphere looked so unnaturally
near jungle fowl were calling crickets sang lustily among the ferns
that fringed the tree branches a family of black monkeys crossed the
path and went crashing and chattering down the wooded precipice below
round the shoulder of the hill trudged a stalwart hillwoman a load of
charcoal on her back in a conicalshaped basket she had a flat
mongolian countenance red colour in her brown cheeks and her eyes were
like green agates a heavy turquoise necklace hung round her neck she
grinned a friendly greeting as she passed the forlorn figure seated by
the wayside and stella envied her how contented and independent she
looked though probably she had two or three husbands and led a hard
life of toil at any rate she was neither desolate nor oppressed the
sound of her stately tramping died away and at last influenced
unconsciously by the solitude the grand beauty of the landscape the
purity of the air stella began to think more coherently to think of
all she would have told philip had he been beside her asking for her
confidence anxious to know all that had befallen her since their
parting at rassih then though she had thought he was going out of her
life the distress and the terror had been leavened by the conviction
that he loved her this time he had gone of his own free will ready to
forget her wishing to forget her it seemed years since he had called
to her that night in the big drawingroom she seemed to hear his voice
now charged with love and despair and the memory of the time
intervening until mauds arrival was like a long nightmare followed at
surima by a blank that ill as she was came as a dreamless refreshing
sleep from which she had awakened to a world of diversion
with returning health and the stimulation of mauds company she had
begun to find solace in her freedom in the power of her beauty which
slowly she had learn to value at first the attention she attracted came
to her as a genuine surprise and all the dances the parties the
lighthearted gatherings proved a welcome refuge from depressing
thought finally she had plunged into the gay whirl with a will
encouraged by maud living solely in the agreeable intoxicating
present banishing as far as possible the past from her mind refusing
to look forward
and in one second all the false ramparts she had erected around her had
crumbled to dust one moment she had been laughing free from care the
next she had looked up in the midst of some careless banter to see
philipbut what a different philip cold and callous and hard stella
did not doubt mauds version of the conversation that had passed between
the two it seemed clear enough that philip shrank from renewal of the
past and was it any wonder she tried to be just to him yet a feeling
of bitter resentment fought with her sense of fair play why when she
had discovered that given the opportunity life could be enjoyed
should he have come to disturb and distress her where all this time
had he been what had he been doing no word concerning him had reached
her of course she understood that he had not known she was at surima
yet why if he did not wish to meet her again had he come up to her in
the ballroom surely it would have been simple enough to leave surima
without allowing her to know he had been there at all was it partly for
her sake that he had to quote maud cleared out or was it entirely
because he feared she might expect him to lay his heart at her feet once
more whatever the reason the result was the same he had gone without a
word or a message that would have left her in possession of the truth
passionately she wished she had the power to wipe the whole incident
from her mind maud was right she had her compensations but of what
value would they be to her once she was back at rassih in another month
or less she must return to robert to the horrible old house to sher
singh and the loneliness the dull round of petty happenings repeated
day after day a fierce defiance seized her at least she had this
month before her she could but make the best of it her heart hardened
she looked up at the clear blue sky watched an eagle soaring over the
valley became conscious of the vast sunny peace around her drew in
long breaths of the wonderful air after all she was young she was
well and when she returned to rassih she would endeavour to recover her
influence with robert once reassured of her loyalty he might allow her
to invite friends to stay with her friends she had made at surima
might permit her to pay visits in return next year she would manoeuvre
to take a house of her own at surima for the hotweather months with
such a prospect the coming winter could be endured she realised that
robert on his part had a grievance against her undoubtedly she had
been a disappointment to him she owed him some consideration in his
way he had not been ungenerous all this time at surima he had kept her
well supplied with money and if he had been glad to get rid of her was
it not only natural
well she would continue to enjoy herself now and then she would go
back and wheedle and coax and work upon roberts weaknesses until she
could induce him to grant her liberty when occasion should arise let
philip go hang if he wished to forget her let him do so she could play
the same game and play it she would resolutely she turned her mind to
coming dissipations the generals garden party this afternoonshe was
fully aware that the station regarded her as the special favourite of
sir george rolt subalterns made up to her with the idea that she held
the ear of the chief not only subalterns either but more senior
aspirants to favour and promotion the sense of prestige and power fed
the worst side of her nature and in addition she liked sir george
rolt whose free admiration raised her to a pinnacle of importance
rendered her an object of envy among all the other women of a certain
type in the place who possessed any claim to attractions tonight there
would be the club dinner with theatricals to follow at both gatherings
she knew she would be the best looking best dressed woman of the
throng and her sore spirit took comfort in the conviction
stella wandered back to the little bungalow on the side of the hill
feeling as though she had drunk deep of some draught that stilled
trouble and pain for the time however pernicious its aftereffects
chapter vii
the swan song of the surima season took the form of a picnica truly
ambitious entertainment given by a moneyed merchant from calcutta whose
ideas of hospitality had apparently no boundaries a banquet was
prepared in the vicinity of a famous waterfall some two miles below the
station champagne vied with the waterfall itself in its volume and
flow there was a band badminton nets had been erected on a convenient
plateau and covetable prizes had been provided for the winners of an
improvised tournament of two a side in addition every lady present was
to receive a giftchocolates scent pretty expensive trifles high
spirits prevailed and amid the gay welldressed assemblage of women
mrs crayfield was preeminent
stella had won the first prize in the tournament a jewelled bangle
animated flushed she stood the centre of attention receiving
congratulations protesting that her success was due only to her
handicap and to the exertions of her partner in the game you all know
i cant play a bit she said laughing radiant the bangle was lovely
everyone was so nice nobody seemed to grudge her the little triumph it
was all delightful
never mindyou have won no matter how chaffed the general now
arent you tired he added lowering his voice come for a stroll to
get an appetite for tea
adroitly he detached her from the crowd that had already begun to
disperse in groups and pairs as stella and sir george moved off
together maud and her husband went by dick matthews had arrived at
surima the previous evening and bobbie nash as some wag had remarked
was nursing his nose in the background for the time being the only
individual perhaps who was not altogether enjoying the picnic
dont attempt to follow us called maud as she passed stella and the
general and she looked back at them over her shoulder pulled down her
mouth cast up her eyes then tucked her arm into dicks and stepped out
beside him with an air of exaggerated virtue
little cat exclaimed the general highly entertained with her antics
as if we should want to follow them he glanced about scanning
various directions in which they might hope to find privacy and
presently they were climbing the slope of the mountain above the
waterfall to seat themselves on the trunk of a fallen tree screened by a
tangle of ferns saplings feathery bamboos beneath the shade of the
oaks that rose densely behind them
sir george took out his cigarette case well he said with a resigned
sigh its sad to think we shall all be scattered during the next ten
days i wonder when and where you and i will meet again
goodness knows privately stella did not particularly care dont let
us look forward
yet his words gave her a sense of depression after all the gaiety and
the glamour of the picnic luncheon and the surface excitement of the
tournament she was tired conscious of reaction her spirits fell she
would have preferred to sit silent listening to the music of the
waterfall the cheerful chirrup of the crickets to be soothed by the
scenery and the soft evening sunshine the peace and the remoteness of
the surroundings
not look forward to our meeting again reproachful astonishment was in
the generals tone as he leaned forward to look into her eyes do you
mean to forget me little girl
she was aware of a certain magic in his bold strong face in his
maturity and experience of women and of the world stella felt
helpless ensnared yet the ensnarement was enticing held a baleful
fascination so often during these months at surima she had felt it
felt at the same time that it meant nothing serious it was just a game
but a game that sir george knew so much better than she did how to play
without fear of disastrous result more than once had he led her as it
were to the edge of the volcano just a peep over and a timely
withdrawal into safety
why dont you answer he laid his hand on hers she moved her hand
quickly yet as before not altogether unwilling to dally with the
moment that held a little thrill of excitement
of course she said demurely i dont want to forget you why should
i
well then give me something to rememberthat we can both remember to
the end of our days
his arm went round her his face his hard handsome face was close to
hers he meant to kiss her meant business this timebecause it was
the last opportunity and of a sudden stella thought of philip of how
philip had held her in his arms had pressed his lips to hers
dont she cried desperately dont you cant understandits
impossible
why he inquired intrigued is there someone else
she let herself go turned to him in her distress with an instinct that
he would comprehend if he had but an inkling of her plight yes she
said tremulously there is there was someone else and its all so
hopeless and miserable
he held out his hand this time with friendly almost fatherly
intention there poor child how was i to know forgive me i dare say
ive been a beast but i meant no real harm tell me all about it eh
sir george felt as much curiosity as interest to hear the little story
surely she was too young too inexperienced to have had any serious
love affair he was prepared to be secretly amused as well as to show
adequate sympathy probably it was just some boy and girl romance and
her parents had married her suitably to put an end to it
i cant talk about it said stella
did it happen before or after you were married he persisted
she did not answer
then it was after
she nodded reluctantly
and shall you see him again clearly it was no one at surima since
he himself had been the favoured one of all her adorers
no never said stella vehemently
well then listen to my words of wisdom dont imagine at your age that
you wont fall in love again but when you do remember to keep your head
if you cant keep your heart the world is never well lost for any mans
sake whatever the poets may say if im not mistaken you have plenty of
grit so dont allow circumstances to get the better of you take what
you can get out of life without losing your place in the ranks of the
righteous or youll be trampled into the dust love as much as you
like but love wisely bide your time stella my child youll forget
this lover whoever he is and therell be plenty more break hearts all
over the place theyll mend soon enough and youll have had your
amusement without paying for it but dont make false steps and imagine
you cant suffer for them at the hands of the world its not good
enough believe me
from one point of view stella felt he was right from another and a
higher point that his advocations were false had he told her to
remember her marriage vows to be faithful in thought as well as in deed
to her husband to shrink with shame from all thought of extracting
consolation by devious methods she almost laughed as she imagined
sir george preaching such practice yet in substance his counsel was not
far removed from the course she had mapped out for herself that morning
on the hill side after her meeting with philip in the ballroom and
maud had often said much the same thing though not quite so plainly
perhaps truly she was between the devil and the deep sea but which was
which to do her duty by robert honestly squarely meant a sort of
death in lifethe deep sea to play a part while seeking underhand
compensationsthe devil
look here went on sir george kindly come and stay with me for the
race meeting at my headquarters this november you shall have the time
of your life a big party all the prettiest women in the province and
youll be the prettiest you shall do hostess if you like people might
talk no doubt they do now but that doesnt matter as long as theyve
nothing to lay hold of is it a bargain
it was an alluring invitation but could she accept it with any hope of
fulfilment perhapsif she carried out her programme of false
conciliation where robert was concerned
im not sure if i could get away she said doubtfully
the husband queried sir george smiling arent you clever enough to
get round him
stella felt reckless anyway ill try she declared and she
determined if humanly possible to succeed
very well leave it at that and let us hope for the best count on me
to send you the right kind of letter and well pull it off somehow
cheer up my dear never say die he patted her hand and lit his
cigarette persuaded her to take one too and stella felt comforted
almost convinced that he and maud were rightthat in time she might
forget philip she had all her life before her in which to do so
someone was shouting below them it was the summons to tea figures
emerged from all quarters the valley resounded with voices privacy was
at an end stella rose readily we must go she said glad of the
interruption and they scrambled and slipped their way back to the
meeting place at sunset a procession started toward the stationa
phalanx of dandies and ponies and more spartan pedestrians who felt
equal to the climb it was almost dark when stella and her friends
reached their perch on the hill side tired yet cheerful ready for a
rest if hardly for dinner after the superabundance of fare they had
lately enjoyed maud rushed to the nursery dick hung about smoking in
the veranda stella was making for her bedroom when one of the servants
accosted her with a salver in his hand on which lay a yellow envelope
telegram memsahib he said stolidly she opened it with a qualm of
foreboding it was signed antonio and she read
     come down colonel crayfield ill
chapter viii
diagnosis difficult said dr antonio pompously professional yet
clearly puzzled and disturbed
stella stood with him in the big drawingroom that looked dusty and
neglected in the dim lamplight trying to gather what had happened what
was likely to happen from across the hall came a monotonous sound a
loud delirious voice repeating some sentence over and over again on
her arrival soon after midnight she had scarcely been able to realise
that it was indeed robert who lay on his bed so strangely altered
talking incoherently paying no heed to her presence mrs antonio was
there as well as the doctor apparently the good couple had not left the
house for the past twentyfour hours
is it typhoid do you think stella asked helplessly
no not typhoid some kind of poison
something he had eaten
how can i say one day quite well playing tennis then feeling ill
sending for me and all at once very high fever delirious as yet not
yielding to treatment typhoid smallpox cholera malaria he ticked
off the diseases on his fingers none of them i have grave suspicion
mrs crayfield
you mean you think someone has tried to poison my husband
yes that is what i think
but who could it be the servants have all been with him for
years
that is so but where is that bearer that sher singh
mystified stella stared at the old man isnt sher singh here in all
the distraction of her arrival she had not noted sher singhs absence
had not thought of him
not here he has dr antonio paused as though searching for a
word he has bunked
but surely
he shrugged his shoulders spread out his hands afimwallah you
know he said significantly
afimwallah
yes opiumeater
i dont understand dr antonio do speak plainly is it your opinion
that sher singh has been trying to poison my husband but sher singh was
so devoted to him
that is just it jealousy and you coming as bride and the woman his
relation sent away now brain upset with opium and you coming back
again soon
sher singhs relation what relation she thought impatiently that the
old doctors imagination had run away with him then from the back of
her mind called up by the mention of opium in conjunction with sher
singh came the recollection of all mrs antonio had said that hot
afternoon long ago in her stuffy hookahsmelling drawingroom she
visualised the untidy form clad in a grotesque dressinggown the bath
towel tied over the grey hair the mysterious nods and knowing too
many secrets what was behind it all the idea that sher singh had
tried to poison robert seemed to her too melodramatic and impossible to
be accepted whatever his provocation or mental condition yet
according to dr antonio sher singh had disappeared bunked why
what relation she repeated
dr antonio puffed and fidgeted his feet oh no use going over old
stories all done with he said evasively only putting two and two
together it is my suspicion that sher singh has done harm but these
things are not easy to bring home at present we have just to think of
curing
he took out a large gold watch for the clock in the room had stopped
will you rest now mrs crayfield not much change likely just yet my
wife she must go home and get sleep but i will remain
i am not tired declared stella though she ached all over after the
long journey it is you who ought to rest and indeed the old mans
fatigue was patent let me sit with my husband while you lie down
there is a bed in the dressingroom and i would call you at once if
necessary
just then mrs antonio joined them she also looked well nigh worn out
he is dozing now she said hopefully and stella became aware that the
sound in the bedroom had ceased
a little later she was seated by roberts bedside and from the
dressingroom came longdrawn regular snores which told her that dr
antonio was already enjoying his welldeserved rest
robert lay quiet save for his quick uneven breathing and now and then
a moaning sigh the punkah had been stopped by dr antonios orders
because as he had explained to her it had seemed to worry the patient
it was hardly needed now that the nights were growing cooler except to
keep off mosquitoes and stella could do that with the palmleaf fan
mrs antonio had handed over to her before her departure
for an hour she sat fanning the mottled swollen face on the pillow the
lights were turned low and the long doorwindows stood open it was a
bright starlit night except for the cry of some restless bird and the
intermittent squabbling of animals at the base of the fort walls there
was little sound stella tried not to think she did not want to
think and to keep her mind quiescent she repeated to herself verses
songs anything she could recall mechanically but always with
irritating persistency the words of the hymn that seemed to have been
the starting point of her real life kept recurring ousting all else
     i dare not choose my lot
     i would not if i might
strive as she would she could not get away from the refrain the very
movements of the fan beat time to the words and the tune
     not mine not mine the choice
but she had chosen she had dared and what had been the result
     in things or great or small
supposing she had made a different choice for exampleon that other
occasion when philip would so gladly have taken her away to live if
need be as he had said just for each other at that time she had
honestly put her own longing aside that his future his work his
ambitions might not suffer supposing she had yielded failed to walk
aright according to her own conception how soon would philip have
discovered his mistake he owed her much and she had done her little
bit for indianot that india counted any longer with her now india was
to blame for everything she told herself petulantly illogically she
did not care what happened to india suddenly robert began to talk
and her whole attention became concentrated upon him gradually his
voice grew clearer though it was a curious unnatural voice as if some
stranger were speaking through his lips now and then he laughed a hard
selfsatisfied little laugh
there they all go he waved his hand in a mocking welcome what a
pretty procession not a bad record no trouble with a little
precaution ah susie you young devilran off with that fellow to
spite me did you what was his name now couldnt have done anything
to suit me better not a patch on the little eurasian girl look at
her cost a pretty penny to get her married to that black railway boy
a fortune for him anyway good child run along youre all right
how many more where are you all goingto hell he sang hoarsely
     no rose nor key nor ringnecked dove
     she gave but her sweet self to me
yes eyes like forgetmenots that was a lesson a near shave nearly
gave me away too as well as herself well out of that something
safer easier to shunt sher singh knows which side his breads buttered
 faithful fellow sher singh the voice dropped again to an
indistinct mutter
stella sat aghast was it all true or just the delusions of a
disordered brain she felt in her bones that it was all true yet what
did it matter roberts past life was nothing to her only when he got
well could she forget these revelations would it not be harder still
to face life with him however she might contrive to go her own way by
means of subterfugeand precaution all shred of consideration and
pity for robert fell away from her as she sat patiently waving the fan
she also seemed to vision the pretty procession of his victims they
mocked her with their eyes as one of themselves a nausea seized her of
his cruelty his pitiless sensuality she felt she could almost applaud
sher singh if indeed the man had actually tried to poison his master
then without warning robert sat upright words came tumbling in
confusion from his lips something about the balcony about someone who
had thrown himself from the balcony he was getting out of bed she
tried to push him back called loudly for dr antonio but the long
snores from the dressingroom went on now clinging to roberts arm
she was being dragged by the great bulky figure towards the open door
that gave on to the balcony and all the time she called and screamed
not daring to let go they were out on the balcony the stars had
disappeared and a faint yellow light was stealing over the sky like the
reflection of some vast conflagration unseen in the distance from below
rose a sudden clamour beasts fighting among themselves over carrion
robert moved on unconscious of her frantic efforts to stop him she was
powerless as she felt herself being drawn to the balustrade still
calling clinging his hands were on the stonework he was climbing up
raising her with him then all at once he paused turned his head
looked down on her his face was terrible next moment he had taken her
by the shoulders and flung her violently from him and as she reeled
giddily she saw something leap into the dawnlight something that was
like a gigantic bird with wings outstretched she fell forward striking
her head heavily against the balustrade
stella lay semiconscious weakly pondering what a queer smell she
knew the smell yet could put no name to it the room seemed unfamiliar
and she found she could see only a portion of it as if the rest were in
darkness what had happened where was she not that it signifiedshe
felt too ill to care when she tried to raise her hand it was heavy as
leadhow funny when she tried to speak she could not remember what she
wanted to say her hat was too tight it hurt her head and she could
not take it off why was she lying in bed with her hat on that was
funny too she heard a little feeble laughwho had laughed she was
very thirsty ah that was nice and cold
thank you she managed to say politely as some iced liquid trickled
down her throat then as her senses slowly awoke she found herself
looking into mrs antonios homely brown face kind mrs antonio who
was giving her a delicious drink mrs antonio would take off the hat
that was hurting her forehead now she knew the name of the smell that
pervaded the room it was hookah the successful recollection brought a
sense of triumph she smiled sweetly at mrs antonio
it was some days before stellas memory grew clear before she could
recall what had happened up to the moment when she had fallen against
the stone balustrade now she knew that she was in the antonios house
that she had been there for nearly three weeks hovering at deaths door
she knew that robert had been buried in the little european cemetery
and that a new commissioner had arrived who according to mrs antonio
was a very kind man and attending to all business until mrs crayfield
should have recovered sufficiently to do her share everybody in the
station had been helping and good there was no hurry about anything
no need to bother stella knew also that there was injury to one side
of her head but to what extent she had not yet thought to ask her mind
had been too exercised with the realisation of roberts tragic end with
mingled compassion for him and she could not pretend to deny it relief
for herself any effort to look forward was as yet almost beyond her
strength
one morning later when the bandages had been finally removed and she
found she could see with both eyes she asked mrs antonio to bring her
a hand mirror she said lightly i want to see what i look like i
expect im an awful fright but im well enough now to bear any shock
better go through your letters suggested mrs antonio laying a
little heap of accumulated correspondence on the table beside the bed
i have to run away just now and see to the fowls and the goats
she left the room hastily and stella fingered the envelopes with
reluctance dreading the condolences and the sympathy she might find
within them first she skimmed the english letters apprehensively it
was possible that the news had been telegraphed home to the papers no
evidently when last they wrote grandmamma and the aunts had known
nothing there was a letter of course from maud one from sir george
rolt others from friends she had made at surima mrs cuthell had
written all contained stereotyped phrases difficult letters to write
she hardly read them because there was one she had put aside as yet
unopenedone from philip flint she knew the clear small handwriting
from seeing the manuscript of the george thomas romance how curious
that she should receive her first letter from him in such circumstances
what had he written just deep sympathy no doubt like all the
others her hand went out to the letter she felt faint as at last she
forced herself to tear it open for a few moments the words danced
before her eyes there were very few words no formal beginningonly
this
     i have seen what has happened and i write to tell you that i am
     the same always the same if you want me i will come anywhere and
     at any time but if you do not write i shall understandphilip
she sank back on her pillows philip was the same always the same she
must have known it all along in her heart how could she ever have
doubted him philip she breathed philip
the stuffy hookahsmelling room was glorified full of a celestial
light how quickly she would get well she was well alreadyall the
dark days were over happiness lay ahead such happiness she would send
him just one little line to tell him she had his letter that she would
write she composed it in her mind or should she telegraph do both
when and where they would meet did not trouble her time was nothing
whatever interval was necessary would pass like a dream
mrs antonio returning from her ministrations to the goats and the
fowls found the patient sitting up in bed a pencil in her hand
writing on halfsheets of paper
now now scolded mrs antonio shaking her forefinger doing too
much
i am quite well said stella i feel i could get up and do anything
tomorrow perhaps out of bed on the sofa and pussy will read to you
such a nice book she has got called wide wide world shall she come
just now
not today dear mrs antonio i have had some good news in my letters
and i cant think of anything else i should like to do my hair when i
have finished writing and then have some of your nice tea and will you
send my letter and a telegram for me to the post office presently
doing hair writing letters sending telegrams exclaimed mrs
antonio you are wanting to run before walking
well do let me run i promise not to fall down there my letter is
ready and the telegram now do give me a lookingglass and a brush and
comb theres a good soul i feel i want to smarten myself up
i think the doctor will be coming in just now better to wait and ask
what he says listen she cocked her ears that is him coming back
from the bazaar dispensary i hear the trap wait a moment mrs
crayfield dear
she was gone and stella elated defiant rose from her bed and
tottered across the room she was determined to see herself in the glass
before mrs antonio came back if she was a scarecrow she would know how
long to postpone her meeting with philip she must be looking all right
when she met philip again clinging to the furniture she made her
way to the dressingtable had she any legs or hadnt she if she felt
she was walking on air was it any wonder after philips letter now she
had reached her goal she bent forward and in the mirror she beheld a
sight that froze her blood the whole of one side of her face was
disfigured hideous grotesque a great puckered red scar ran from her
forehead to her chin shortening the contour lifting the edge of her
mouth she was revolting that was why mrs antonio had evaded her
request for a hand glass clutching the edge of the table she stood
gazing at the wreck of her beauty everything was gone she could never
let philip see her and she was so young so young
a few minutes later she had groped her way blindly back to the bed she
tore up the letter and the telegram she had written tore up philips
letter also if you do not write i shall understand she could never
write roberts legacy of punishment was complete
chapter ix
lady lanejohnson looked about her handsome drawingroom with critical
gaze she moved a bowl of roses to a more effective position loosened a
sheaf of madonna lilies in a crystal vase the atmosphere was fragrant
with the perfume of costly flowers the whole room betokened prosperity
combined with good taste from the excellent examples of modern art on
the brocadehung walls to the aubusson carpet and the silk curtains that
subdued the sound of traffic through the open windows and philip
flints sister harmonised with her surroundings an elegant wellbred
looking woman in a paris gown diamonds in her hair round her neck at
her breast
she consulted her list of expected guests the pairing for this dinner
party had entailed an unusual amount of consideration in such
undertakings john was of no use whatever he would rush in at the last
moment and unless she took care would probably seize absentmindedly on
the first lady he saw and hurry her down to dinner even now he had not
returned if she heard him on the stairs before the arrivals began she
must catch him and remind him that he was to take in old lady bawe
though he always declared her name ought to be spelt bore she herself
must put up with lord redgate disagreeable creature but the laws of
etiquette forbade any other arrangement anyway she would have carmine
lake the fashionable portrait painter on her other side and he was
good company her own parents were rather on her mind her father never
considered the political feelings of his neighbours and invariably
suspected her literary and artistic friends of being radicals
concerning lord redgates opinions there could be no question of
anything so mild as suspicion and she had therefore placed the two
gentlemen as far apart at the dinner table as possible she knew her
mother felt out of it among actors and painters and authors and
johns distinguished professional colleagues with their wives who were
always busy over public meetings and charity entertainments patronised
by royalty
as a rule she did not invite her oldfashioned parents to her dinner
parties they preferred to come quietly when she had an evening to
spare but tonight their presence was unavoidable because philip had
just arrived from india she had not even seen him yet and she
particularly wanted him and the old people to meet lord redgate and
his daughter dorothy who had known philip in india two years ago and
if she grace were not greatly mistaken the young lady would like to
meet him again as often as possible lord redgate would not have said
thank you had she bidden him to a quiet family gathering that would
have to come later if matters shaped as she hoped they might it would
be such an excellent marriage for philip lord redgate had so much
influence his soninlaw would be pushed on regardless of obstacles
however glaring the job his one weakness was his selfwilled
impulsive daughter who publicly boasted that she could turn her father
round her little finger
grace knew from dorothy that she and philip had kept up a desultory
correspondence since their parting in india she wondered if she would
have time to pump philip in the matter of his feelings towards the girl
if he and the old people arrived early as she had told them to do she
hoped philip would not look too indian his clothes were sure to be
all wrong seeing that he had arrived only three days ago during her
absence in the country for a weekend visit the dinner party had been
hastily convened with apologies and explanations for the short notice
directly his telegram came from marseilles
was that john on the stairs she flew to the door and saw her husband
ascending leisurely
make haste darling she called and remember you are to take in lady
bawe
why is there a dinner party he blinked at her dreamily his scanty
hair was ruffled he looked tried overstrained that afternoon he had
been engaged on a stupendous operation and the reaction of success was
still upon him
yes yes i told you go along quickly and dress
you look wonderful he said smiling at her
she knew he was proud of her that he grudged her nothing in the world
that the money he made gave him pleasure principally for her sake yet
sometimes he provoked her almost past bearing his forgetfulness his
blindness to the value of her social triumphs that were undoubtedly an
indirect asset to him in his calling his calling came first with him
she came second and there were no children nothing to fill her life
beyond the eternal round of engagements and social successes which
during the last ten years had become a sort of second nature to her now
she looked forward to matchmaking on her brothers behalf
the front door bell rang there she waved her husband up the stairs
dont be longer than you can help and whatever you do remember lady
bawe
lady bawe he repeated and quickened his steps obediently
presently sir philip and lady flint and mr flint were announced
well motherwell father grace kissed her parents then turned to
embrace her brother philip she cried how you have altered is it
really you
she could hardly believe that this sunbaked middleaged man growing
rather bald with the set face and grave eyes was philip her
remembrance of him last time he was on furlough was so different then
he had looked almost boyish full of spirits enjoying every moment of
his leave yet enthusiastic over his prospects when he should return to
his work now he looked as if nothing would ever arouse his enthusiasm
or high spirits again he even showed little pleasure at seeing her and
they had been such pals in the old days grace supposed it was the want
of rest and change that ailed him he ought to have come home two years
ago after all his hard work over the famine instead of being tempted
to stay on in a responsible position that whatever it might lead to
could hardly be worth the sacrifice of health she thought he looked far
from well as she drew him aside and whispered
who do you think is coming tonight on purpose to meet you again
tell me he said indifferently
dorothy baker
it was a relief to see his face light up with a certain amount of
interest dorothy baker just fancy and when i last saw her
his memory turned to an indian junction and a nativecrowded platform a
dimly lit railway carriage and dorothy baker with all her wild ideas
her conceit and her flashes of humility her freckled face and slim
long figure then she knows i am at home im afraid i didnt write and
tell her i was coming
yes she knows and presently she and her father will be here this
party is in your honour dear old boy
very kind of you there was no more than politeness in his tone but
his sister observed that he looked towards the door as though watching
for the arrival of dorothy baker
mr carmine lake was announced and lady lanejohnson welcomed him with
effusion sir philip flint glared disapproval of the celebrated artists
abundant locks and soft tucked shirt glared more fiercely still on the
couple that followed whose name was well known in liberal circles
though the gentleman present was only a relative of the real culprit
the room filled quickly lord redgate and his daughter were the last to
arrive
dorothy entered swiftly eager animated dressed as usual simply but
expensively her gown was of a soft shade of green that suited her tawny
colouring lady lanejohnson thought she had never seen the girl look
betterquite pretty in spite of her strong resemblance to her
father whose irregular features and ruddy complexion she had inherited
in a refined and more kindly form lord redgate was an ugly man but no
one could say that his daughter was ugly or even plain
as lady lanejohnson greeted the pair philip came forward he was glad
to see miss baker again and miss baker made no concealment of her own
delight her evident pleasure though it could hardly fail to flatter
his vanity caused philip a slight feeling of embarrassment he had
never realised that the girl liked him to such an extent in fact he
remembered that at the time of their parting she had appeared almost
indifferent to him her heart must have grown fonder with absence
pater she said turning to her father this is mr flint who was so
kind to me in india you remember
lord redgate shook hands without speaking philip encountered a
searching gaze from beneath the shaggy red eyebrows he felt he was
being sized up
you will take miss baker down to dinner grace told her brother and
you must put up with me lord redgate thoughwith an engaging
smilei cant talk about labour troubles and back to the land or
anything of that kind you know
he grunted certainly lord redgates strong point was not manners
now we are all here went on lady lanejohnson not at all
disconcertedshe had expected nothing else from her distinguished
guest peer of the realm with unlimited riches though he wasexcept
john of course consulting her list she went in and out among the
company allotting partners while miss baker chattered with a sort of
nervous excitement to philip
and how is india it seems more like twenty years to me instead of only
two since i was out there i shall never rest till i can get back how
long are you home for
six months unless i take an extension
good you will come and see us ive such heaps to talk about and you
must stay with us in the country your sister has told me how splendidly
you have got onsimla and calcutta and no end of importance the next
thing will be the star of course
just then sir john hurried in and the little disturbance that ensued as
he went round shaking hands to be successfully anchored by his wife to
lady bawe parted them for the moment but when with dorothy on his
arm philip found himself descending the staircase carefully avoiding
the train of the lady in front of them it was of stella crayfield that
he was thinking miss baker had innocently started the aching
regretful memory the one star he really desired was not for him would
never be his where was stella at this moment what had become of her
the letter he had written to her after her husbands death was never
answered and true to his promise he had understood had accepted
and respected her silence with bitter resignation extracting what
solace he could from his work and his rapid advancement though his
success brought him little solid satisfaction
now they were all seated at the dinner table with slices of musky melon
before them and fantastically the notion struck him that miss baker was
rather like a slice of melon herselfall curves and rich golden hues
delectable but just as unsatisfying
what about the book he inquired with an interest that was not wholly
simulated if it has appeared why didnt you send me a copy
her face fell oh that was a dreadful blow she looked up at him with
a pathetic demand for sympathy in her fine eyes no one would publish
the book unless all expenses were guaranteed by the author and though
of course there would have been no difficulty about that
you wanted it to come out on its own merits
yes that was how i felt pater said it was very stupid of me
i think it was very honest of you
do you really i often wanted to ask you but it seemed such a
confession of failure and you know you always made me feel a failure
when i was with you in india
did i i assure you it was quite unintentional
she laughed a little selfconsciously oh im sure it was very good
for me and perhaps it helped me to realise that my object in writing a
book at all was not so much to give my experiences and opinions to the
public as to impress my friends with my cleverness and superiority
really you are to blame for the nonappearance of the book
what an unkind accusation
not quite so unkind perhaps as it might appear she said softly then
as though to edge away from a too intimate topic she began to ask
questions about his last appointment about his voyage home what had he
done with jacob had he sold the chestnut pony and they talked and
talked as course succeeded course until the wine and the wonderfully
cooked food and the girls unaffected interest in himself and his
doings chased the cloud from philips spirit lifted his depression and
he felt as the women streamed from the diningroom at the conclusion of
the meal that perchance life need not be quite so dreary so empty
after all
someone plumped down in the vacant chair beside him it was dorothys
parent a glass of port in his hand purpose in his bearing philip
prepared himself for an argument as to the claims of india to home rule
he felt ready to go farther than his own convictions in order to confute
the ignorant and arrogant assertions he anticipated from this man who
seemed to him a traitor to his own class and equally a traitor to the
class into which he had shoved himself by means of his tongue and his
wealth
instead equally to his annoyance he found himself being catechised as
to his pay and prospects in the indian service when would his pension
be due what would it amount to did he expect any special recognition
for his work during the famine philip scowled and answered shortly
said in conclusion that he expected no recognition of his famine
services it was all in the days work he endeavoured to change the
subject but his inquisitor for some reason of his own if he had any
as philip queried beyond vulgar curiosity was not to be snubbed let
me see what are the indian decorations cies one of them
philip interposed flippantly which means ass very often but the
pleasantry was lost on lord redgate who either ignored or did not
perceive it
now i recollect he continued and csi the star of india but im
blessed if i know which is the more important
the star of course snapped philip why in the world should he be
haunted this evening by the word that was so closely associated with all
that had gone wrong in his life
lord redgate produced a gold pencilcase and made a note on his shirt
cuff philip watched him wondering moodily what he was writing then
lord redgate looked up and the eyes of the two men met
you were very good to my girl in india he said unexpectedly and the
rugged face softened
philip flushed repenting his antagonism but he could not bring
himself to like lord redgate any better i did nothing he protested
awkwardly
she told me how you looked after her my girl and i understand each
other there are no secrets between us
there was very little to tell i was glad to be of use
a pause followed and philip rose if you will excuse me i want to
have a few words with my brotherinlaw and he made his way round the
table to where sir john was sitting silent not attempting to make
conversation his wife was perhaps right when she declared that john was
the worst host in the world but his wine was excellent if his company
was not and his guests were contented with the former
meanwhile in the drawingroom miss baker had attached herself to the
guileless lady flint who was willingly drawn into confidences
respecting her sons boyhood here was a nice unaffected girl it was
no effort to talk to her especially as she was anxious to talk about
philip and had seen philip in india had seen how he lived and how hard
he worked
it must be so lovely for you to have him at home again said this
charming young lady
yes my dear it is a great comfort and pleasure but i dont feel
quite happy about him he has changed a good deal
well its a long time since you last saw him isnt it
i dont think he looks well
neither do i but he will soon be all the better for the change to
england
he was a delicate child though he grew up quite strong you see he was
born in india and i couldnt bring him home till he was nearly seven
years old the old lady prattled on and miss baker listened with such
encouraging interest that lady flint plunged deep into the subject of
philips childish ailments the difficulties over his education the
agonies of parting with him just when she felt he most needed her care
we indian mothers have always that trial to meetseparation from
either husband or children and it never seems to be taken into account
by those at home who dont have to face it personally we were lucky in
finding a nice place for philip and grace till they were old enough to
go to school but then the holidays were always on my mind relations
are sometimes so injudicious fortunately the children had character
both of them and as my husband rose in the service i was able to come
home more frequently to see them dear philip was such a clever boy
he is a very clever man quoth miss baker emphatically and how well
he has got on
he was always ambitious he mapped out his own career from the very
firstgot a scholarship for his public school and again at oxford and
passed very high for the civil service he could have stayed at home
but he preferred to take india and his father and i were very glad
life in an office would not have suited him he was a sportsman at heart
as well as a student
no wonder you are proud of him
lady flint dropped her fan miss baker picked it up deferentially and
as she restored it lady flint thought the girls hair very pretty
though it was a pity in her opinion that she wore it cut short a
possibility crept into her mind that was not altogether distasteful was
there likely to be anything between miss baker and her beloved son
though miss baker had no connection with india beyond her brief visit to
the country she seemed a warmhearted sensible child and certainly
she appreciated philip lady flint was aware that lord redgate was a
very rich man which might be a barrier if not of course it would be
nice to feel that philip and his wife need never be worried over money
matters in the case of graces marriage that had been a satisfactory
element who could deny itthough she would not have had either of her
children influenced in the least degree by worldly advantages
she felt her way gently how would you like to live in india she
inquired and she saw the girl flush as she answered decidedly i
should simply love it
perhaps your father will take you there again for a visit some day
i went alone you knowthat time and if i ever go again it will not
be on a visit i shall go to stay
lady flint looked a little puzzled but what would your father say to
that
my father never interferes with anything i want to do
dear me said lady flint
the door opened and the men came into the room philip made straight for
his mother and miss baker who whispered hurriedly lady flint may i
come and see you
do my dear i am always at home on sundays i shall be very pleased to
see you come next sunday if you can and she made a mental note to
keep philip at home next sunday afternoon if the two young people were
mutually attracted she would help on the courtship to the best of her
powers but she rather wished miss baker were not a rich mans daughter
and not an honourableit would mean that philip like grace might be
absorbed into a world she did not understand
i have been hearing all about you exclaimed dorothy looking up at
philip as he stood beside them how tiresome and naughty you were and
how you wouldnt work and gave such a lot of trouble after you grew
up
they all laughed and philip glanced affectionately at his mother a
glance that endeared him the more to the longlimbed girl in the green
gown
then a wellknown pianist who was of the party consented to play and
silence was enforced on the audience once at the piano the musician
continued to give unlimited samples of his own compositions and philip
though he thought the fellow made an unconscionable noise welcomed the
respite from conversation again he felt depressed inert unreasonably
impatient with the wellfed welldressed throng that had met together
merely to eat and drink and to impress each other with their own
importance they were all so selfsatisfied in their several ways he
made up his mind that he would get away from london as soon as he could
do so without hurting his parents feelings go somewhere to fish by
himself he had no use for crowds like this
you will come and see us repeated miss baker when at last farewells
became general come and dine quite quietly just ourselves when will
you come
he could hardly plead a press of engagements yet he was seized with the
reluctance to tie himself that so often attacks the newly returned
angloindian everyone was in such a hurry at home he wanted to feel
free but evasion was impossible and a near date was decided upon
going home with his father and mother in the hired brougham he said i
wonder how grace can stick that kind of life
so do i agreed the general
but her friends are all so clever protested lady flint she had never
before felt so well disposed towards graces world and most of them do
something
nothing that really matters except the doctor lot growled sir
philip puffing at one of his soninlaws excellent cigars upon my
word i felt thankful i was a bit deaf when that music master or
whatever he calls himself began hammering on the piano and as for that
fellow redgateall i can say is that if he made himself as he boasts
he made a mistake
well dear his daughter seems a very nice girl you think she is
nice dont you philip
philip answered casually oh shes all right as long as she gets her
own way
lady flint ventured to announce that miss baker was probably coming to
tea on sunday and sir philip said he hoped her father was not coming
too if he is he added truculently i shall go out
how tiresome they both were thought poor lady flint perhaps the dinner
had something to do with it certainly it had been very rich and far
too much of it the general was sure to have eaten all the things that
he knew disagreed with him and of course philip was not accustomed to
such elaborate feasts
chapter x
philip did not carry out his intention of leaving london as soon as
escape could be accomplished without hurt to his parents feelings he
felt as though helpless in the grip of some mysterious conspiracy that
from day to day left him with hardly an hour that he could call his own
london is an awful place he complained to his mother the smallest
errand runs away with the best part of a day buying socks and shirts
for example not to speak of boots and the tailor tradespeople seem to
take a delight in obstructing one at every turn if you wish to buy a
pair of gloves in comfort you have to be prepared to spend hours over
it what with going and coming and hunting about for what you really
want
dearest boy how you do exaggerate argued lady flint fondly but i
know what you mean i always felt the same for the first month after i
got home from india life is so different out there plenty of space and
no trouble over trifles though one hardly calls setting oneself up in
necessaries exactly a trifle anywhere you ought to go to the dentist
too and see a doctor and have your eyes tested dont leave all that
to the end of your leave or the last month will be worse than the
first and your father thinks you ought to attend a levee
my teeth are all right im not ill and i can see perfectly well
also i am not going to attend a levee he assured her firmly he could
not have explained his condition of mind to his mother even had he
desired to do so he could hardly account for it to himself he felt
restless and listless at the same time he hated the crowds in the
streets and the shops the appointments to see relations that his mother
cajoled him into making the little luncheons and teas with aunts and
cousins who were all so much more delighted to see him than he was to
see them and grace was a nuisance she dragged him hither and thither
tied him down to engagements without his permission told him when he
protested that he wanted waking up miss baker to his surprise was
ever ready to aid and abet grace in making up theatre and supper
partiesalways somethingsandown ranelagh the park endless
tamashas miss baker appeared to have forgotten all her unworldly
theories and to be as keen on gaiety as the rest of them and wherever
they went he found himself at her side philip began to suspect his
sister of matchmaking the suspicion became a certainty one evening
when he had accompanied her unwillingly to a great crush in carlton
house terrace which to him was just a kaleidoscope of colour and
jewels and a pushing chattering throng
the blaze of light the crowd and the scents and the closeness of the
atmosphere despite blocks of ice and electric fans confused and
depressed him he stood moody and resentful as grace greeted her
friends kept introducing him my brother from india and he had to
listen and reply to vapid remarks about heat and snakes and how
interesting it must be to live in india and so on till at length in
desperation he interrupted a conversation his sister was holding with a
being whose coatfront was bespattered with orders to tell her he meant
to go home
this is more than i can stand he said with suppressed impatience
im off
oh philip do wait dorothy is sure to be here presently and then
youll be all right her eyes roved round the brilliant scene she was
to meet us here you know you cant disappoint her
she wont be disappointed
of course she will be philip she added with serious intention
dont be a fool
what do you mean he began hotly but just then they were swept
asunder by new arrivals and as he turned to flee he encountered miss
baker at the head of the stairs he felt that a web was being woven
around him now he understood what they were all driving atgrace and
his mother and yes dorothy herselffor as he met her eyes shining
with welcome he realised that she with everyone else awaited but one
outcome of their friendship how blind he had been he cursed his own
denseness
as a matter of course she attached herself to him where shall we go
its too early for supper and i dont feel inclined to sit and listen
to music lets find some comfortable corner where we can talk in
peace
i am making for a comfortable corner farther away he said
petulantly im going home
oh her dismay was patent and when ive only just come ive got
something to tell you something thrilling look here i know this house
well come along follow me
what else could he do morosely he followed her feeling rather as if he
were walking in his sleep through a door along a passage up a few
steps and they were alone in a pretty boudoir that was cool and quiet
fragrant with flowers away from the crowd and the noise
now we are safe give me a cigarette dorothy settled herself in a
deep chair the gleam of her hair against a pile of purple cushions her
long white arms and slender outline presented a striking picture as
philip could not but note as he stood before her on the hearthrug had
it not been for the disturbing idea that had taken definite shape in his
mind this evening he would have felt soothed contented very much at
home with her as it was he began to distrust his own powers of
resistance either he must get out of london at once or he would be
forced seriously to consider the question of asking lord redgates
daughter to be his wife if as he could not help assuming she expected
him to propose to her sooner or later opposition from her father was
not to be anticipated dorothy would have her own waygiven the chance
the fact that he was now actually contemplating the possibility startled
him what a mean brute he must be he could never love the girl as a man
should love the woman he married if it became necessary he must tell
her the truth and put an end to all thought of anything but
friendship
you are very glum tonight she remarked gazing at him through a
cloud of smoke what is the matter
probably the usual curse of the angloindianliver he replied with
an effort to speak lightly ive been eating and drinking too much ever
since i got home its time i went in for the simple life somewhere out
of all this it doesnt suit my peculiar constitution
it doesnt suit me either she said reflectively
you seem to thrive on it anyway
oh i am one of those chameleon people who can adapt themselves to any
surroundings i could be happy anywhere on a desert island in the
indian junglemore particularly in the indian jungle provided
she paused and flicked some cigarette ash on to the carpet
he took a little china saucer from the mantelpiece and placed it on a
table beside her you must learn to be tidy wherever you are he said
with mock severity and added what was it you had to tell me
a secret such a nice one though soon it will be a secret no longer
oh are you going to be married in spite of your contempt for my sex
she drew in her breath sharply as though something had hurt her why
do you remind me of my silly ideas dont you think i have the sense to
see when i have been wrong
he evaded reply to the question well out with this wonderful secret
dont keep me in suspense
its thisyou are to have the csi she told him triumphantly the
star of india doesnt it sound splendidglittering glorious grand
he stared at her stupidly stammered howhow do you know
pater told me tonight just as i was starting to come here and she
added navely to come and meet you good old pater he is arranging
it all now what do you say to that for a piece of news
it is extremely kind of him but i dont want it i dont deserve it
he cried in desperation you must tell himit must be stopped
what on earth are you talking about if you dont deserve it who does
anyway its to be yours whether you feel you deserve it or not and i
cant tell you how proud i feel that in a kind of way you will have got
it through me
through her and through her if he chose to say the word he could have
all that to the world would appear to make life well worth the living
for the moment the temptation was strong almost overwhelming here for
the asking was the devotion of a clever capable girl who had the
makings of a true comrade who would revive his ambitions enter
wholeheartedly into his career he saw himself honoured successful
beyond his dreams a power in the country that he loved to serve with
every advantage officially and socially in his grasp why should he
hesitate here was his chance he stood at the turningpoint of his
existence that meant fortune without struggle or delay if he went
boldly forward
then all at once sweeping aside the temptation the brilliant outlook
came the thought of stella the true star of his life and his heart and
dimly he felt that to barter the memory of that other star however far
from his reach for tangible gain would be infamous contemptible the
shadow was more to him than the substance he could not do this thing
and feel that his purpose was clean
i suppose you will think i am mad he said slowly with difficulty
but there is somethingsomething that stands in the way
the girl paled dropped the end of her cigarette into the saucer and he
saw her hands grip the arms of the chair is itis it because she
lost her selfcontrol oh dont look at me like that cant you
seewhat does anything matter dont be so proud nothing can be too
good for youphilip
she rose held her hands out to him firm square hands he took them
gently reverently and she swayed as she recognised the lack of passion
in his touch
haltingly as best he could he tried to tell her the truth but it all
sounded so elusive so unsubstantial he felt he could hardly expect her
to comprehend silence fell between them he turned from her in painful
regret
she laid her hand on his shoulder philip dont you trust me do you
think i cant know how you feel if i cant help you in one way i can in
another perhaps by giving you all my sympathy and understanding i hope
if i had been placed as you are that i should have done exactly the
same i seei realise she faltered pitifully that as things are
you cant take the star you cant owe it to me in the least degree i
will explain somehow to my father leave it to me it isnt too late
and some day you will have itearn it yourself entirelyandit may be
the other one too i hope so i do indeed if she is worthy of you but
oh how could she how could she leave your letter unanswered there may
have been some mistake it may come all right dont give up hope the
most wonderful things happen and ii shall always be your friend
she stopped breathing fast she had spoken so rapidly under such
stress of emotion as he met her strained wideopen eyes she looked
almost unreal a mist clouded his vision he felt choked as he tried to
answer to thank her speech seemed so futile for him the whole thing
was beyond words he knew he was failing hopelessly to express himself
she gave a tremulous laugh that was half a sob its all right dont
say anything dont try we both know lets get back to the crowd
and moving to the door she turned out the lights quickly she went
before him down the steps and along the narrow passage he saw her
mingle with the throng her head held high talking and laughing a
bright conspicuous figure a brave noblehearted girl he wished
honestly that he could have loved her wished it quite apart from the
solid advantages she could have brought him as his wife
chapter xi
a day or two later when philip preparatory to his departure from
london was choosing a fishingrod in a wellknown shop devoted to the
requirements of anglers a little lady dressed in the height of fashion
rustled over to him from the farther end of the showroom where she had
been standing in company with an elderly distinguishedlooking man
is it mr flint she inquired gaily and as he looked at her in
puzzled politeness a vague memory returned to him of someone trigged out
in sequins and tinsel with a tambourine
you dont remember me this time im not pretending we really have met
before my name is matthewsmaud verrall you know stella crayfields
friend how history repeats itself fancy my having to introduce myself
again and all among fishingrods and tackle and things instead of in a
ballroom full of dressedup idiots in india
why of courseof course how are you he said gathering his wits
together battling with an impulse to attack her on the spot as to
stellas whereabouts to ask her all about her if anyone knew it would
be this wonderfully garbed little person who now proceeded to beckon to
her deserted companion
heres another old friend of stellas sir george rolt you saw him at
that horrible ball if you remember
the shop assistant stood by in patient resentment as the male customers
neglected their object and the lady chattered of everything but
fishingrods
im taking sir george down with me to my old home in the country
tomorrow for a visit she told mr flint he and my husband are going
to fish from morning till night so dull for me but i shall have stella
to talk to and she will be thankful shes at the chestnuts you know
grandmamma and the aunts she added with a mischievous moue then
she sighed poor stella and she looked at him searchingly that was a
terrible business wasnt it
philip composed himself with an effort her husbands death you mean
yes i suppose it was i have heard nothing of her since it happened i
hope she is well have you seen her lately
quite lately ive only been in town for a flying visit just to get
clothes
there was an awkward pause philip became aware that sir george was
regarding him with particular attention was the man stellas future
husband the possibility filled him with helpless rage
mrs matthews coughed artificially and glanced from one man to the
other sir george dear she said sweetly youd better go back to
that kind gentleman who was giving you such good advice about
fishingrods or someone else will snap him up i want to talk secrets
with mr flint if hes not in too great a hurry
sir george smiled and moved away compliantly mrs matthews apologised
to philips assistant im so sorry to interrupt but i havent seen
this friend of mine for such ages presently he will buy heaps of
things dont wait for him now if you are busy i will see that he
doesnt run away
the young man succumbed to her blandishments and mrs matthews piloted
philip to a corner of the shop where she annexed a couple of chairs
this is a funny place for a private conversation she remarked but
im not going to lose such a chance now ive got it fancy our meeting
like this what a piece of luck now listen to me and answer my
questions she scrutinised him closely you look struck all of a
heap
i feel it said philip briefly
why because you want to hear news of stella or because you dont
because its the one thing in the world i wish for he answered his
heart beating fast
her face cleared thats all right one step forward now tell medo
you know why stella never answered your letter
there could be only one reason i told her in my letter that if i did
not hear from her i should understand he fixed his eyes on a stuffed
salmon in a glass case he could not bring himself to meet mrs
matthews inquisitive gaze
you silly fool said stellas friend vigorously couldnt you have
guessed that she must have had some desperate reason
i thought
you thought everything that was wrong of course men always do sir
george rolt thinks he is devoted to me at present dear old thing and
that i am equally gone on him but hes mistaken though its great
fun for us both while it lasts can you stand a shock mr philip
flint
i can stand anything said philip doggedly except
i know what you were going to sayexcept to hear that stella never
wants to see you again
exactly
would it make any difference if you found her altered in another way
how do you mean he asked mystified
then mrs matthews set to as she would herself have expressed it and
for the space of five minutes she talked breathlessly uninterrupted by
philip who listened to her in greedy silence
there she concluded at last now do you see
not altogether i must confess i dont see why stella should have
concluded that her appearance would have made the smallest difference to
me after my letter it was very unfair to me
dont talk such trash it was perfectly natural she was too hideous
for words until she got home we came home together and i made her put
herself into the hands of an expert massage and treatment did wonders
but all the same poor dear she will never be beautiful again
good heavens as if that would matter to me whatever she looks
like he paused overcome by his feelings
well i will believe you though one never knows anyway shes not so
bad its only one side of her face
mrs matthews for goodness sake dont talk like this i cant bear
it just tell me once for alldoes stella care for me still
yes darling she does and the best thing you can do is to come down
with me and sir george tomorrow fishingrods and all to the court
and make her tell you so herself will you
will i he scoffed ecstatically mrs matthews you are an angel
not yet she assured him i dont mean to die young
                                          
philip flint walked up the short drive to the chestnuts the air was
filled with the peace and the scent of the summers evening and as he
viewed the old house with its little paved terrace the lawn sloping
down to the stream the cedar tree the red wall of the kitchen garden
he felt that it was all familiar to him
an old lady was seated on the terrace flagsthat would be grandmamma
and an austerelooking female emerged from one of the french windows to
speak to the old ladywas that aunt augusta or aunt ellen his heart
warmed towards them and as he hesitated hardly daring to go forward
he caught sight of a form stretched on a long chair beneath the cedar
tree
boldly he took a short cut through the shrubs at the sound of his
footsteps she looked up gave a little cry hid her dear maimed face in
her hands stellahis beloved his star his star of india
