the 184inch synchrocyclotron
his success with the 60inch cyclotron in 1939 led dr e o lawrence to
propose a much more powerful accelerator one which could produce new
types of nuclear rearrangements and even create particles grants
totaling 1225000 permitted work to start on the 184inch cyclotron in
august 19401 it was designed to accelerate atomic particles to an
energy of 100 million electron volts mev five times that possible
with the 60inch machine
illustration fig 1 the electromagnet under construction during the
period 1940 to 1942
before the new cyclotron could be finished world war ii began
construction on the cyclotron was therefore halted however because of
interest in separating the isotopes of uranium by the electromagnetic
method work on the giant magnet continued at an even faster pace this
magnet would contain 3700 tons of steel in its yoke and pole pieces and
300 tons of copper in its exciting coils fig 1 by may 1942 the
magnet was completed during that summer it was used in a pilot plant to
separate the first significant amounts of u235 ever obtained the
184inch magnet remained in use in a research and development program at
berkeley until the end of the war supplying information to oak ridge
tennessee where a large separation plant had been erected
construction on the rest of the cyclotron was resumed in 1945 by that
time a new principle had been discovered which made it possible to
obtain ion beams of much higher energy than originally hoped for yet a
considerably lower accelerating voltage could be used this important
discovery was made independently by dr v veksler in russia and by
dr edwin m mcmillan present director of the lawrence radiation
laboratory before attempting to discuss this principle we should first
review the operation of a conventional cyclotron
principle of operation of a conventional cyclotron
illustration fig 2 basic parts of a cyclotron
the main parts of a cyclotron are represented in fig 2 charged
particles ions are accelerated inside an evacuated tank this is to
prevent the beam from colliding with air molecules and being scattered
the vacuum tank is placed between the poles of an electromagnet whose
field bends the ion beam into a circular orbit
the operation begins when the ions are introduced into the region
between two accelerating electrodes or dees2 because the ions
carry a positive electric charge they are attracted toward that dee
which is electrically negative at the moment were it not for the
magnetic field the ions would be accelerated in a straight line
instead they are deflected into a circular path back toward the dee gap
by the time the ions again reach the dee gap the sign of the electric
potential on the dees is reversed so that now the ions are attracted
toward the opposite dee
as this process of alternating the electric potential is repeated the
ions gain speed and energy with each revolution this causes them to
spiral outward finally they strike a target inserted into their path or
are extracted from the cyclotron for use as an external beam
the time required for an ion to complete one loop remains constant as it
spirals outward this is because its velocity increases sufficiently to
make up for the increased distance it travels during each turn this
means that the electric potential applied to the dees must alternate at
a constant frequency called the resonant frequency
the resonant frequency f is given by the relationship
            he
    f                                         1
         2pimc
where h e pi c and m are constants h is the strength of the
magnetic field of the cyclotron e is the electric charge carried by the
ion pi equals 314 c is a conversion factor and m is the mass of
the ion for example the resonant frequency for protons accelerated in
a 15000gauss magnetic field is 237 megacycles mc3 we call such a
rapidly alternating potential a radiofrequency voltage and the
electronic circuit for producing it a radiofrequency oscillator
the energy e of an ion emerging from the cyclotron is given by
        h2 r2   e2
    e                                       2
           2     mc2
where h e and m are as defined above and r is the radius at which the
beam is extracted from this equation we see that for a given type of
ion where e and m are constant the energy depends on the diameter and
strength of the magnet but not directly upon the voltage applied to the
dees
the number of revolutions that an ion can make in a conventional
cyclotron is limited to about 70 to 100 this is due to a very curious
effect as an ion is accelerated its mass increases this phenomenon
is explained by einsteins special theory of relativity see fig 3
referring back to eq 1 we see that if the ion mass m does not
remain constant but rather increases then the resonant frequency f
decreases but since the dee potential continues alternating at a
constant frequency an ion soon begins to arrive late at the dee gap
by the time it has made about 70 to 100 turns an ion is so badly out of
phase that it is no longer accelerated
suppose now that we want to obtain an energy of 10 mev because an ion
can make a maximum of about 100 turns the accelerating potential would
have to be about 100000 volts however professor lawrence hoped to
reach 100 mev with the new 184inch cyclotron this meant that the
accelerating voltage would have to be about 1000000 volts preventing
such a high voltage from sparking promised to be one of many formidable
engineering problems

as its velocity approaches that of light

the principle of phase stability
fortunately drs veksler and mcmillan showed that relatively low dee
voltages can be used to accelerate ions to very high energies this is
possible if the oscillator frequency is continuously decreased to keep
it in synchronism with the decreasing rotational frequency of the ions
this would allow an ion to make many revolutions without becoming out of
phase this principle of phase stability was experimentally verified
with the 37inch cyclotron before being incorporated into the design of
the 184inch machine because it utilizes this principle this machine
has usually been referred to as a synchrocyclotron or
frequencymodulated cyclotron however it is sometimes called simply
a cyclotron
the 184inch synchrocyclotron was first operated in november 1946 with
a maximum dee voltage of only 20000 volts it accelerated deuterons to
190 mev and alpha particles to 380 mev4 in 1949 it was modified to
permit production of 350mev protons also
between 1955 and 1957 the synchrocyclotron was rebuilt so that now the
following energies can be obtained
    protons  deuterons  alpha particles  helium3 nuclei5
          
    730 mev   460 mev       910 mev         1140 mev
in reaching an energy of 730 mev a proton for example makes 75000
revolutions in just 6 milliseconds msec it travels a distance of 450
miles and attains a velocity of 152000 miles per second or 82 of the
speed of light during this brief journey its mass increases 75 giving
very convincing evidence for the validity of einsteins theory similar
data for other ions may be found in the appendix
footnotes
4 a deuteron is the nucleus of an atom of heavy hydrogen and contains
one proton and one neutron it carries a single positive electric
charge an alpha particle is the nucleus of a helium atom and is made up
of two protons and two neutrons it carries two positive charges
5 the machine is equipped for helium3 operation but to date it has
not been used for that purpose
design and construction of the 184inch synchrocyclotron
magnet
during the rebuilding of the cyclotron the diameter of the magnet pole
pieces was increased from 184 to 18834 inches also the pole gap at
the center was reduced from 21 to 14 inches these changes increased the
weight of steel in the magnet from 3700 to 4000 tons
the main exciting coils which contain 1300 turns of copperbar
conductor each were not altered two auxiliary coils containing 425
turns each were added this brought the total weight of copper from 300
to 340 tons the coils are layerwound around the pole pieces close to
the pole gap other data about the coils are given in the appendix
the effect of these modifications was to increase the field strength at
the center of the pole gap from 15000 to 23400 gauss this increase
made it possible to obtain the higherenergy ions
power is supplied to the coils by two motor generator sets which
produce the direct current required for a steady magnetic field the
direct current from the motor generators is regulated so that the
magneticfield fluctuation is less than one part in 10000 this is
necessary if one wants an external beam of nearly uniform energy
in order to prevent the beam from becoming unstable and striking the
dee the magnetic field must be strongest at the center and decrease
radially fig 4a with flat pole faces the field does not decrease
uniformly to give the desired rate of decrease the pole faces are
shimmed with concentric steel rings of varying thickness as shown in
fig 4b in a radially decreasing magnetic field the lines of magnetic
flux bow outward as represented in fig 4b ions moving in a magnetic
field are deflected at right angles to these flux lines ions above the
midplane of the cyclotron are directed downward those below the
midplane are directed upward in this way an ion oscillates about the
midplane and vertical focusing is achieved
illustration fig 4
a plot of magneticfield strength vs radius the field strength
decreases gradually out to a radius of about 83in after which it
falls off sharply this point marks the maximum usable radius for
particle orbits further out they are unstable
b magnetic flux lines are represented as broken arrows and focusing
forces as solid arrows an ion above the midplane is directed downward
while an ion below the midplane is directed upward
radial focusing is accomplished in a somewhat analogous manner if the
magnetic field decreases with radius radial restoring forces are
established an ion at too large a radius is directed inward and an ion
at too small a radius is directed outward in this fashion the ion
oscillates about the synchronous orbit thus radial focusing is
achieved
vacuum system
the vacuum tank acceleration chamber is a steel box 20  25 ft and 4 ft
high it is evacuated to a pressure of 105 millimeter of mercury
about one 100millionth of atmospheric pressure the pumping equipment
consists of six oildiffusion pumps and four mechanical vacuum pumps
the pumping speed of the six 20in oildiffusion pumps is a total of
20000 literssec
ion source
the ion source is a simple arctype hydrogen gas is allowed to leak
into the ionsource enclosure near a tungsten filament which is heated
to incandescence electrons emitted by the filament knock off electrons
from hydrogen atoms leaving free protons the protons then escape into
the acceleration chamber through a hole in the ionsource housing once
inside the protons are accelerated by the dee potential
deuterons or alpha particles are obtained in a similar fashion using
deuterium or helium gas in place of hydrogen
radiofrequency system
the 184inch synchrocyclotron has a single dee instead of the doubledee
arrangement described above for illustrative purposes the accelerating
electric field is developed between the dee and a dummy dee which is
grounded to the vacuum tank using a single dee does not change the
principle of operation yet it offers the advantage of allowing more
space for auxiliary equipment inside the vacuum tank also the
construction is much simpler the dummy dee is not essential for
operation but it does improve performance
illustration fig 5 radiofrequency cycle for accelerating protons
sixtyfour such cycles are repeated each second
radiofrequency power is supplied to the dee by a vacuumtube
oscillator the frequency of oscillation must decrease during the
acceleration cycle as indicated above for protons the frequency at
the start of acceleration is 36 megacycles mc at the end of
acceleration the frequency is only 18 mc see fig 5 this change in
frequency is achieved by varying the electrical capacitance in the tuned
circuit of the oscillator this is what you do when you dial a
different station on a radio this tuned circuit which is called the
cyclotron resonator is shown in fig 6
illustration fig 6 cyclotron resonator
because the frequency must change over such a wide range from 36 to 18
mc the electrical capacitance must be varied by a factor of 20 to 1
this is done by a variable capacitor of unique design it resembles two
giant tuning forks as the blades of the tuning forks vibrate the
capacitance is alternately increased and decreased by the required
amount
these two tuning forks must be kept in step with great precision this
is to prevent the oscillator from exciting lateral rf resonances with a
cyclotron of this size this is a problem these resonances if excited
would cause loss of beam the method for keeping the blades moving
together is as follows the blades are made to vibrate at their resonant
frequency which is approximately 64 cycles per second one set of
blades operates at its natural frequency as a tuningfork oscillator
the second set of blades is driven from an amplified sample of the
signal from the first its natural period is adjusted automatically to
equal that of the first the amplitude of each set is regulated to
within 0003 in the phase angle between the blades is regulated to
within 1 deg
ions are accelerated only when the radiofrequency is decreasing fig 5
the remaining portion of the cycle is dead time thus 64 pulses each
of about 500 microseconds duration are obtained every second the
average ion current of a pulsed beam is much less than for a continuous
beam such as that obtained from a conventional cyclotron see table i
this is part of the price paid for higher energies
internal targets and beam extractor
the simplest target is one placed inside the vacuum tank where the
circulating beam will strike it the target may be any substance that
the physicist or chemist wants to irradiate the target material is
attached to a movable probe if the experimenter wants to use the
fullenergy beam he places the target at the maximum usable radius of
the circulating beam 82 inches however if he desires to use ions
having less than the maximum energy he inserts the target further into
the cyclotron so that it is intercepted sooner

illustration fig 7 plan view of the cyclotron showing the method
for obtaining an external beam of protons deuterons or alpha
particles
some experiments require an external beam of protons deuterons or
alpha particles a beam of this type can be brought out of the machine
by means of a lecouteur regenerator fig 7 the construction of the
regenerator is very simple it is made of a number of steel laminations
of various sizes what the regenerator does is perturb the magnetic
field of the cyclotron at one radial position each time the beam passes
through the regenerator it receives a kick with each kick the beam
builds up its radial amplitude until finally it enters a magnetic
channel this channel focuses the beam and steers it outside the main
magnetic field once outside the beam travels through an evacuated
tube which is integral with the main vacuum tank by means of a
steering magnet the beam can be sent into either the physics cave or
the medical cave these experimental areas are called caves because
they are rooms inside the massive concrete shielding wall
other experiments may require an external beam of mesons7 a meson
beam is obtained in the following way fig 8 a movable target such as
a block of carbon is placed inside the cyclotron near the end of the
outwardspiraling proton beam when the proton beam hits this target a
shower of mesons is produced these mesons are bent in various
directions by the main magnetic field some of them pass through a thin
metal window in the vacuumtank wall and are focused by a magnetic lens
into a beam this meson beam then travels through a hole in the concrete
shielding wall into the meson cave the maximum intensity of this
extracted meson beam depends on both the charge and energy desired
beams of more than 100000 mesons per second have been obtained through
an aperture 4  4 in in the shielding wall
cyclotron experiments
nuclear physics
about 86 of the operating time of the 184inch synchrocyclotron is
devoted to experiments in nuclear physics most of the experiments study
the production and interaction of pi mesons these particles are
considered to be essential factors in the intense but shortrange forces
that bind the nucleus together the three types of pi mesons are
designated according to their electric charge as pi pi0 and
pi8 these mesons materialize only in highenergy nuclear
collisions
illustration fig 8 method for obtaining external meson beam
of great importance are those experiments that determine the
probability of producing each of the three types of mesons in a nuclear
collision this type of experiment is repeated for different beam
energies and target elements other experiments measure the energy and
direction of emission of pi mesons from a target
illustration fig 9 a typical experiment scintillation counters at
a b c d and e record the passage of charged particles
a typical pimeson experiment is represented in fig 9 the purpose
of this experiment was to detect the spin directions of protons as they
are knocked out of a liquid hydrogen target by a pimeson beam like
the earth a proton spins on its axis an extracted proton beam from
the cyclotron enters the physics cave from the left striking a
polyethylene target and producing pi mesons a beam of these mesons is
formed by a series of two bending magnets and three focusing magnets
this beam passes through a carbon absorber to remove unwanted particles
the meson beam then strikes the liquid hydrogen target a few of the
incoming mesons scatter knocking protons out of the liquid hydrogen
scintillation counters at a and b record the passage of a proton thus
defining its direction the scattered mesons are counted by a
scintillation counter at c a few of the protons scatter off the carbon
target and are detected by counters at e and d from the detection of
such events the spin directions polarization of the recoil protons
can be analyzed in this way more is learned about the fundamental
piproton interaction
further studies of the interactions of pi mesons are made in the meson
cave other experiments performed there are concerned with mu mesons
the mu meson muon is a particle created in the decay of a pi meson
and is the principal constituent of cosmic rays striking the surface of
the earth the muon is unstable eventually undergoing a radioactive
decay into an electron although the muon does not experience nuclear
forces it can interact weakly with nuclei the behavior of the muon is
well understood but its role as one of the elementary particles is
unknown that is if the muon did not exist what effect would this have
on the structure of matter the answer to this question among others
is being sought by physicists using the 184inch cyclotron
biophysics
experiments in biophysics are conducted in the medical cave in these
the interest lies not in nuclear interactions but in the effect of
ionizing radiation on living tissue highenergy beams of particles can
be used for selective destruction of specific areas of the brain this
permits physiological mapping of the functions of the brain in
experimental animals it further offers a therapeutic approach to the
treatment of brain tumors one of the important investigational programs
is concerned with the relationship of the pituitary gland to the growth
rate of certain cancers and to some endocrine disorders
nuclear chemistry
for techniques of radiochemistry to be employed successfully high
interaction rates and therefore high beam intensities are needed for
this reason chemistry targets are usually inserted right into the
cyclotron so that they can be bombarded directly by the circulating
beam after the bombardment is completed the target is removed from the
cyclotron it is then taken to a chemistry laboratory and subjected to
detailed chemical procedures individual elements are removed and the
radioactive isotopes of each element are identified by quantitative
counting techniques in some cases a mass spectrometer is used to
analyze the products many deductions about the nature of the breakup of
the target nucleus can be drawn from the pattern of the observed
radioactive products sometimes the nucleus splits almost in half this
is called fission more frequently smaller parts of the nucleus are
split off two general types of reactions known as spallation and
fragmentation are distinguished one of the goals of this research is
to learn more about the constitution of the nucleus and of the forces
which bind the particles in the interior of the nucleus
footnotes
7 mesons are elementary particles intermediate in mass between the
electron and proton
8 it may be interesting to note that the pi0 meson was discovered
with this cyclotron in 1950 this was the first particle to be
discovered with an accelerator all particles that had been previously
discovered were observed first in cosmic rays or some other form of
natural radiation
