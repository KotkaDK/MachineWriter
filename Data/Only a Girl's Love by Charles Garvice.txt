in order that there may be no confusion we desire to say that the
books listed above will be issued during the respective months in new
york city and vicinity they may not reach the readers at a distance
promptly on account of delays in transportation
the eagle series
principally copyrights      elegant colored covers
the right books at the right price
while the books in the new eagle series are undoubtedly better value
being bigger books the stories offered to the public in this line
must not be underestimated there are over four hundred copyrighted
books by famous authors which cannot be had in any other line no
other publisher in the world has a line that contains so many different
titles nor can any publisher ever hope to secure books that will match
those in the eagle series in quality
this is the pioneer line of copyrighted novels and that it has struck
popular fancy just right is proven by the fact that for fifteen years
it has been the first choice of american readers the only reason
that we can afford to give such excellent reading at such a low
price is that our unlimited capital and great organization enable us
to manufacture books more cheaply and to sell more of them without
expensive advertising than any other publishers
 all titles always in print
 to the publicthese books are sold by news dealers everywhere if
 your dealer does not keep them and will not get them for you send
 direct to the publishers in which case four cents must be added to
 the price per copy to cover postage

our experience with the american reading public has taught us that
it expects better reading than readers of any other nationality
why because americans as a rule are better educated and more
intelligent we make it a point to cater to all classes of readers
with our papercovered novels if a man likes adventure or detective
stories he can find more and better ones in the s  s novel list
than he can among the cloth books if a woman wants love society or
mystery stories the s  s catalogue again contains just what she
wants at the lowest possible price if a boy wants uptodate baseball
athletic or treasurehunt stories he cannot get anything that will
please him so much as the books in the medal and new medal libraries
no matter how much he has to spend for his reading matter
here are a few suggestions
books for men
the nick carter stories in the new magnet library
the howard w erwin stories in the far west library
the william wallace cook stories in the new fiction library
the dumas stories in the select library
books for women

why take a chance
most everybody thinks that the public library is a mighty fine
institutionteaches people to read and all that well so it does
but does any one ever think of the great risk that a person who takes
a book out of a public library runs of catching some contagious
disease
every time a bacteriological examination is made of the publiclibrary
book germs of every known disease are found among its pages probably
from your own experience you know that lots of people never think of
taking a book from the public library until some one in their family
is sick and wants something to read
as records prove that ninety per cent of the demand for books at the
public libraries is for works of fiction it strikes us that the
reading public would do better to patronize the s  s novel list
which contains hundreds of books to be found in the public libraries
and many hundreds of others just as good and interesting
the price of the s  s novels is a low one indeed to pay for
protection from diseaseladen literature why run the risk then when
you can get a fresh clean book for little money and thus insure your
health

the s  s novels have no rivals
our books have a field entirely their own they are the only novels to
which new firstclass titles are being added every week
no news dealers stock is complete without them thats why every
uptodate dealer carries a good assortment of them on his shelves

only a girls love
chapter i
it is a warm evening in early summer the sun is setting behind a long
range of fir and yewclad hills at the feet of which twists in and
out as it follows their curves a placid peaceful river opposite
these hills and running beside the river are longstretching meadows
brilliantly green with freshspringing grass and gorgeously yellow
with newlyopened buttercups above the sunset sky gleams and glows
with fiery red and rich deep chromes and london is almost within sight
it is a beautiful scene such as one sees only in this england of
oursa scene that defies poet and painter at this very moment it
is defying one of the latter genus for in a room of a lowbrowed
thatchedroofed cottage which stood on the margin of the meadow james
etheridge sat beside his easel his eyes fixed on the picture framed in
the open window his brush and mahlstick drooping in his idle hand
unconsciously he the painter made a picture worthy of study tall
thin delicately made with pale face crowned and set in softlyflowing
white hair with gentle dreamy eyes ever seeking the infinite and
unknown he looked like one of those figures which the old florentine
artists used to love to put upon their canvases and which when one
sees even now makes one strangely sad and thoughtful
the room was a fitting frame for the human subject it was a true
painters studiountidy disordered and picturesque finished and
unfinished pictures hung or leant against the walls suits of armor
antique weapons strange costumes littered the floor or hung limply
over medival chairs books some in bindings which would have made the
mouth of a connoisseur water lay open upon the table or were piled in
a distant corner and over all silenceunbroken save by the sound of
the water rushing over the weir or the birds which flitted by the open
windowreigned supreme
the old man sat for some time listening to natures music and lost in
dreamy admiration of her loveliness until the striking of the church
clock floated from the village behind the house then with a start
he rose took up his brushes and turned again to the easel an hour
passed and still he worked the picture growing beneath the thin
skillful hand the birds sank into silence the red faded slowly from
the sky and night unfolded its dark mantle ready to let it fall upon
the workaday world
silence so profound took to itself the likeness of loneliness perhaps
the old man felt it so for as he glanced at the waning light and lay
his brush down he put his hand to his brow and sighed then he turned
the picture on the easel made his way with some little difficulty
owing to the litter across the room found and lit an old briarwood
pipe and dropping into the chair again fixed his eyes upon the scene
and fell into the dreamy state which was habitual with him
so lost in purposeless memory was he that the opening of the door
failed to rouse him
it was opened very gently and slowly and as slowly and noiselessly a
young girl after pausing a moment at the threshold stepped into the
room and stood looking round her and at the motionless figure in the
chair by the window
she stood for full a minute her hand still holding the handle of the
door as if she were not certain of her welcomeas if the room were
strange to her then with a little hurried pressure of her hand to her
bosom she moved toward the window
as she did so her foot struck against a piece of armor and the noise
aroused the old man and caused him to look round
with a start he gazed at the girl as if impressed with the idea that
she must be something unsubstantial and visionarysome embodiment of
his evening dreams and so he sat looking at her his artist eye taking
in the lithe graceful figure the beautiful face with its dark eyes
and long sweeping lashes its clearly penciled brows and soft mobile
lips in rapt absorption
it is possible that if she had turned and left him never to have
crossed into his life again he would have sunk back into dreamland
and to the end of his days have regarded her as unreal and visionary
but with a subtle graceful movement the girl threaded the maze of
litter and disorder and stood beside him
he still looking up saw that the beautiful eyes were dim that the
exquisitely curved lips were quivering with some intense emotion and
suddenly there broke upon the silence a low sweet voice
are you james etheridge
the artist started it was not the words but the tonethe voice that
startled him and for a brief second he was still dumb then he rose
and looking at her with faint trembling questioning he answered
yes that is my name i am james etheridge
her lips quivered again but still quietly and simply she said
you do not know me i am stellayour niece stella
the old man threw up his head and stared at her and she saw that he
trembled
stellamy nieceharolds child
yes she said in a low voice i am stella
but merciful heaven he exclaimed with agitation how did
you come here whyi thought you were at the school there in
florencewhyhave you come here alone
her eyes wandered from his face to the exquisite scene beyond and at
that moment her look was strangely like his own
yes i came alone uncle she said
merciful heaven he murmured again sinking into his chair but
whywhy
the question is not unkindly put full rather of a troubled
perplexity and bewilderment
stellas eyes returned to his face
i was unhappy uncle she said simply
unhappy he echoed gentlyunhappy my child you are too young to
know what the word means tell meand he put his long white hand on
her arm
the touch was the one thing needed to draw them together with a
sudden yet not abrupt movement she slid down at his side and leant
her head on his arm
yes i was very unhappy uncle they were hard and unkind they meant
well perhaps but it was not to be borne and thenthen after papa
died it was so lonely so lonely there was no oneno one to care for
meto care whether one lived or died uncle i bore it as long as i
could and then icame
the old mans eyes grew dim and his hand rose gently to her head and
smoothed the rich silky hair
poor child poor child he murmured dreamily looking not at her
but at the gloaming outside
as long as i could uncle until i felt that i must run away or
go mad or die then i remembered you i had never seen you but i
remembered that you were papas brother and that being of the same
blood you must be good and kind and true and so i resolved to come
to you
his hand trembled on her head but he was silent for a moment then he
said in a low voice
why did you not write
a smile crossed the girls face
because they would not permit us to write excepting under their
dictation
he started and a fiery light flashed from the gentle dreamy eyes
no letters were allowed to leave the school unless the principals had
read them we were never out alone or i would have posted a letter
unknown to them no i could not write or i would have done so
andandwaited
you would not have waited long my child he murmured
she threw back her head and kissed his hand it was a strange gesture
more foreign than english full of the impulsive gracefulness of the
passionate south in which she had been born and bred it moved the old
man strangely and he drew her still closer to him as he whispered
go ongo on
well i made up my mind to run away she continued it was a dreadful
thing to do because if i had been caught and brought back they would
have
stop stop he broke in with passionate dread why did i not know
of this how did harold come to send you there great heaven a young
tender girl can heaven permit it
heaven permits strange things uncle said the girl gravely papa
did not know just as you did not know it was an english school and
all was fair and pleasant outsideoutside well the night just after i
had received the money you used to send me each quarter i bribed one
of the servants to leave the door open and ran away i knew the road to
the coast and knew what day and time the boat started i caught it and
reached london there was just enough money to pay the fare down here
and iithat is all uncle
all he murmured a young tender child
and are you not angry she asked looking up into his face you will
not send me back
angry send you back my child do you think if i had known if i
could have imagined that you were not well treated that you were not
happy that i would have permitted you to remain a day an hour longer
than i could have helped your letters always spoke of your contentment
and happiness
she smiled
remember they were written with someone looking over my shoulder
something like an imprecation surely the first that he had uttered for
many a long year was smothered on the gentle lips
i could not know thati could not know that stella your father
thought it besti have his last letter my child do not cry
she raised her face
i am not crying i never cry when i think of papa uncle why should
i i loved him too well to wish him back from heaven
the old man looked down at her with a touch of awe in his eyes
yes yes he murmured it was his wish that you should remain there
at school he knew what i was an aimless dreamer a man living out of
the world and no fit guardian for a young girl oh yes harold knew
he acted for the best and i was content my life was too lonely and
quiet and lifeless for a young girl and i thought that all was right
while those fiends
she put her hand on his arm
do not let us speak of them or think of them any more uncle you
will let me stay with you will you not i shall not think your life
lonely it will be a paradise after that which i have leftparadise
and see i will strive to make it less lonely butand she turned
suddenly with a look of troubled fearbut perhaps i shall be in your
way and she looked round
no no he said and he put his hand to his brow it is strange i
never felt my loneliness till now and i would not have you go for all
the world
she wound her arms round him and nestled closer and there was silence
for a space then he said
how old are you stella
she thought a moment
nineteen uncle
nineteena child he murmured then he looked at her and his lips
moved inaudibly as he thought beautiful as an angel but she heard
him and her face flushed but the next moment she looked up frankly
and simply
you would not say that much if you had seen my mamma she was
beautiful as an angel papa used to say that he wished you could
have seen her that you would have liked to paint her yes she was
beautiful
the artist nodded
poor motherless child he murmured
yes she was beautiful continued the girl softly i can just
remember her uncle papa never recovered from her death he always
said that he counted the days till he should meet her again he loved
her so you see
there was silence again then the artist spoke
you speak english with scarcely an accent stella
the girl laughed it was the first time she had laughed and it caused
the uncle to start it was not only because it was unexpected but
because of its exquisite music it was like the trill of a bird in an
instant he felt that her childish sorrow had not imbittered her life or
broken her spirit he found himself almost unconsciously laughing in
harmony
what a strange observation uncle she said when the laugh had died
away why i am english right to the backbone as papa used to say
often and often he used to look at me and say italy has no part and
parcel in you beyond your birth stella you belong to that little
island which floats on the atlantic and rules the world oh yes i am
english i should be sorry to be anything else notwithstanding mamma
was an italian
he nodded
yes i remember haroldyour fatheralways said you were an english
girl i am glad of that
so am i said the girl naively
then he relapsed into one of his dreamy silences and she waited silent
and motionless suddenly he felt her quiver under his arm and heave a
long deep sigh
with a start he looked down her face had gone wofully pale to the very
lips
stella he cried what is it are you ill great heaven
she smiled up at him
no no only a little tired and with naive simplicity i think i
am a little hungry you see i only had enough for the fare
heaven forgive me he cried starting up so suddenly as almost to
upset her here have i been dreaming and mooning while the child was
starving what a brainless idiot i am
and in his excitement he hurried up and down the room knocking over a
painting here and a lay figure there and looking aimlessly about as if
he expected to see something in the shape of food floating in the air
at last with his hand to his brow he bethought him of the bell and
rang it until the little cottage resounded as if it were a fireengine
station there was a hurried patter of footsteps outside the door was
suddenly opened and a middleaged woman ran in with a cap very much
awry and a face startled and flushed
gracious me sir whats the matter she exclaimed
mr etheridge dropped the bell and without a word of explanation
exclaimedbring something to eat at once mrs penfold and some
wine at once please the poor child is starving
the woman looked at him with amazement that increased as glancing
round the room she failed to see any poor child stella being hidden
behind the antique highbacked chair
poor child what poor child youve been dreaming mr etheridge
no no he said meekly its all true mrs penfold she has come
all the way from florence without a morsel to eat
stella rose from her ambush
not all the way from florence uncle she said
mrs penfold started and stared at the visitor
good gracious me she exclaimed who is it
mr etheridge rubbed his brow
did i not tell you it is my niecemy niece stella she has come
from italy andi wish youd bring some food bring a bottle of the
old wine sit down and rest stella this is mrs penfoldshe is my
housekeeper and a good woman buthe added without lowering his
tone in the slightest though he was evidently under the idea that he
was inaudiblebut rather slow in comprehension
mrs penfold came forward still flushed and excited and with a smile
your niece sir not mr harolds daughter that you so often have
spoken of why how did you come in miss
i found the door open said stella
good gracious me and dropped from the clouds and that must have
been an hour ago and you sir looking at the bewildered artist
reproachfully you let the dear young thing sit here with her hat and
jacket on all that time after coming all that way without sending for
me
we didnt want you said the old man calmly
want me no but the dear child wanted something to eat and to rest
and to take her things off oh come with me miss all the way from
florence and mr harolds daughter
go with her stella said the old man andand he added gently
dont let her keep you long
the infinite tenderness of the last words caused stella to stop on her
way to the door she came back and putting her arms around his neck
kissed him
then she followed mrs penfold upstairs to her room the good woman
talking the whole while in exclamatory sentences of astonishment
and you are mr harolds daughter did you see his portrait over the
mantelshelf miss i should have known you by that now i come to look
at you and she looked with affectionate interest into the beautiful
face as she helped stella to take off her hat yes i should have
known you miss in a moment and you have come all the way from italy
dear me it is wonderful and im very glad you have it wont be so
lonely for mr etheridge and is there anything else you want miss
you must excuse me for bringing you into my own room ill have a room
ready for you tonight your own room and the luggage miss
stella smiled and blushed faintly
i have none mrs penfold i rani left quite suddenly
dearie me murmured mrs penfold puzzled and sympathetic well
now it doesnt matter so long as you are here safe and sound and
now ill go and get you something to eat you can find your way down
yes stella said she could find her way down she stood for a moment
looking through the window her long hair falling in a silky stream
down her white shoulders and the soft dreamy look came into her eyes
is it true she murmured am i really here at home with someone to
love mesomeone whom i can love or is it only a dream and shall i
wake in the cold bare room and find that i have still to endure the old
life no it is no dream it is true
she wound up the long hair and went down to find that mrs penfold had
already prepared the table her uncle standing beside and waiting with
gentle impatience for her appearance
he started as she entered with a distinct feeling of renewed surprise
the relief from uncertainty as to her welcome the kindness of her
reception had already refreshed her and her beauty shone out unclouded
by doubt or nervousness
the old mans eyes wandered with artistic approval over the graceful
form and lovely face and he was almost in the land of dreams again
when mrs penfold roused him by setting a chair at the table and
handing him a cobwebbed bottle and a corkscrew
miss stella must be starving sir she said suggestively
yes yes he assented and both of them set to work exhorting
and encouraging her to eat as if they feared she might drop under
the table with exhaustion unless she could be persuaded to eat of
everything on the table
mr etheridge seemed to place great faith in the old port as a
restorative and had some difficulty in concealing his disappointment
when stella after sipping the first glass declined any more on the
score that it was strong
at last but with visible reluctance he accepted her assertion that
she was rescued from any chance of starvation and mrs penfold cleared
the table and left them alone
a lamp stood on the table but the moonbeams poured in through the
window and instinctively stella drew near the window
what a lovely place it is uncle she said
he did not answer he was watching her musingly as she leant against
the edge of the wall
you must be very happy here
yes he murmured dreamily yes and you think you will be stella
ah yes she answered in a low voice and with a low sigh happier
than i can say
you will not feel it lonely shut up with an old man a dreamer who
has parted with the world and almost forgotten it
no no a thousand times no was the reply
he wandered to the fireplace and took up his pipe but with a sudden
glance at her laid it down again slight as was the action she saw it
and with the graceful lithe movement which he had noticed she glided
across the room and took up the pipe
you were going to smoke uncle
no no he said eagerly no a mere habit
she interrupted him with a smile and filled the pipe for him with her
taper little fingers and gave it to him
you do not want me to wish that i had not come to you uncle
heaven forbid he said simply
then you must not alter anything in your life you must go on as if i
had never dropped from the clouds to be a burden upon you
my child he murmured reproachfully
or to make you uncomfortable i could not bear that uncle
no no he said i will alter nothing stella we will be happy you
and i
very happy she murmured softly
he wandered to the window and stood looking out and unseen by him
she drew a chair up and cleared it of the litter and unconsciously he
sat down
then she glided to and fro wandering round the room noiselessly
looking at the curious lumber and instinctively picking up the books
and putting them in something like order on the almost empty shelves
every now and then she took up one of the pictures which stood with
their faces to the wall and her gaze would wander from it to the
painter sitting in the moonlight his white hair falling on his
shoulders his thin nervous hands clasped on his knee
she who had spent her life in the most artistic city of the world
knew that he was a great painter and childwoman as she was wondered
why the world permitted him to remain unknown and unnoticed she had
yet to learn that he cared as little for fame as he did for wealth
and to be allowed to live for his art and dream in peace was all he
asked from the world in which he lived but in which he took no part
presently she came back to the window and stood beside him he started
slightly and put out his hand and she put her thin white one into it
the moon rose higher in the heavens and the old man raised his other
hand and pointed to it in silence
as he did so stella saw glide into the sceneas it was touched by
the moonbeamsa large white building rearing above the trees on the
hilltop and she uttered an exclamation of surprise
what house is that uncle i had no idea one was there until this
moment
that is wyndward hall stella he replied dreamily it was hidden
by the shadow and the clouds
what a grand place she murmured who lives there uncle
the wyndwards he answered in the same musing tone the wyndwards
they have lived there for hundreds of years stella yes it is a grand
place
we should call it a palace in italy uncle
it is a palace in england but we are more modest they are contented
to call it the hall an old place and an old race
tell me about them she said quietly do you know themare they
friends of yours
i know them yes they are friends as far as there be any friendship
between a poor painter and the lord of wyndward yes we are friends
they call them proud but they are not too proud to ask james
etheridge to dinner occasionally and they accuse him of pride because
he declines to break the stillness of his life by accepting their
hospitality look to the left there stella as far as you can see
stretch the lands of wyndwardthey run for miles between the hills
there
they have some reason to be proud she murmured with a smile but i
like them because they are kind to you
he nodded
yes the earl would be more than kind i think
the earl
yes lord wyndward the head of the family the lord of wyndward they
call him they have all been called lords of wyndward by the people
here who look up to them as if they were something more than human
and does he live there alone she asked gazing at the gray stone
mansion glistening in the moonlight
no there is a lady wyndward and a daughterpoor girl
why do you say poor girl asked stella
because all the wealth of the race would not make her otherwise than
an object of tender pity she is an invalid you see that windowthe
one with the light in it
yes stella said
that is the window of her room she lies there on a sofa looking down
the valley all the day
chapter ii
poor girl murmured stella there was silence for a moment and
those three live there all alone she said
not always he replied musingly sometimes not often the son
leycester comes down he is viscount trevor
the son said stella and what is he like
the question seemed to set some train of thought in action the old man
relapsed into silence for a few minutes then suddenly but gently he
rose and going to the other end of the room fetched a picture from
amongst several standing against the wall and held it toward her
that is lord leycester he said
stella took the canvas in her hand and held it to the light and an
exclamation broke involuntarily from her lips
how beautiful he is
the old man took the picture from her and resting it on his knees
gazed at it musingly
yes he said it is a grand face one does not see such a face
often
stella leant over the chair and looked at it with a strange feeling of
interest and curiosity such as no simply beautiful picture would have
aroused
it was not the regularity of the face with its clearcut features
and its rippling chestnut hair that had it been worn by a wyndward
of a hundred years ago would have fallen in rich curls upon the
square wellformed shoulders it was not the beauty of the face but a
something indefinable in the carriage of the head and the expression of
the full dark eyes that attracted almost fascinated her
it was in a voice almost hushed by the indescribable effect produced by
the face that she said
and he is like that
it is lifelike he answered i who painted it should not say it
but it is like him neverthelessthat is leycester wyndward why did
you ask
stella hesitated
becausei scarcely know it is such a strange face uncle the
eyeswhat is it in the eyes that makes me almost unable to look away
from them
the reflection of a mans soul stella he said
it was a strange answer and the girl looked down at the strange face
interrogatively
the reflection of a mans soul stella the wyndwards have always
been a wild reckless passionate race here in this village they
have innumerable legends of the daring deeds of the lords of wyndward
murder rapine and highhanded tyranny in the olden times wild
license and desperate profligacy in these modern ones but of all the
race this leycester wyndward is the wildest and most heedless look
at him stella you see him here in his loose shootingjacket built
by poole with the diamond pin in his irreproachable scarf with
his hair cut to the regulation length i see him in armor with his
sword upraised to watch the passionate fire of his eyes there is a
picture in the great gallery up yonder of one of the wyndwards clad
just so in armor of glittering steel with one foot on the body of a
prostrate foe one hand upraised to strike the deathdealing blow of
his battleax yes leycester wyndward should have lived four centuries
back
stella smiled
has he committed many murders uncle burnt down many villages
the old man started and looked up at the exquisite face with its arch
smile beaming in the dark eyes and curving the red ripe lips and
smiled in response
i was dreaming stella an odd trick of mine no men of his stamp
are sadly circumscribed nowadays we have left them no vent for their
natures now excepting the gamblingtable the turf and he roused
suddenly yes its a beautiful face stella but it belongs to a man
who has done more harm in his day than all his forefathers did before
him it is rather a good thing that wyndward hall stands so firmly or
else leycester would have melted it at ecarte and baccarat long ago
is he so bad then murmured stella
her uncle smiled
bad is a mild word stella and yetlook at the face again i have
seen it softened by a smile such as might have been worn by an innocent
child i have heard those lips laugh asas women are supposed to laugh
before this world has driven all laughter out of them and when those
eyes smile there is no resisting them for man or woman
he stopped suddenly and looked up
i am wandering on like an old mill put the picture away stella
she took it from him and carried it across the room but stood for
a moment silently regarding it by the lamp light as she did so a
strange fancy made her start and set the picture on the table suddenly
it seemed to her as if the dark eyes had suddenly softened in their
intense fixed gaze and smiled at her
it was the trick of a warm imaginative temperament and it took
possession of her so completely that with a swift gesture she laid her
hand over the dark eyes and so hid them
then with a laugh at her own folly she put the picture against the
wall and went back to the window and sat beside the old man
tell me about your past life stella he said in a low voice
it seems to me as if you had always been here you have a quiet way of
speaking and moving about child
i learnt that while papa was ill she said simply sometimes he
would sit for hours playing softly and i did not wish to disturb him
i remember i remember he murmured stella the world should have
known something of him he was a born musician
he used to say the same of you uncle you should have been a famous
artist
the old man looked up with a smile
my child there are many men whom the world knows nothing ofluckily
for them your father and i were dreamers both the world likes men of
action can you play
she rose and stood for a moment hesitating in the corner of the room
there was a small chamber organone of those wonderful instruments
which in a small space combine the grand tones of a cathedral organ
with the melodious softness of a flute it was one of the few luxuries
which the artist had permitted himself and he was in the habit of
playing snatches of verdi and rossini of schubert and mozart when the
fading light compelled him to lay the brush aside
stella went up to it softly and seated herself and presently began to
play she attempted no difficult fugue or brilliant march but played
a simple florentine vesper hymn which she had heard floating from the
devout lips of the women kneeling before the altar of the great church
in florence and presently began to sing it
the old man started as the first clear birdlike notes rose softly
upon the evening air and then covering his face with his hands went
straight to dreamland
the vesper hymn died softly slowly out and she rose but with a
gesture of his hand he motioned her to remain at the organ
you have your fathers voice stella sing again
she sang a pleasant ditty this time with a touch of pathos in the
refrain and hearing a slight noise as she finished looked round and
saw the old man rise and with quivering lips turn toward the door
the young girls sweet voice had brought back the past and its dead too
plainly and he had gone out lest she should see his emotion
stella rose and went to the window and stood looking into the night
the moonlight was glinting the river in the distance and falling
in great masses upon the lawn at her feet half unconsciously she
opened the window and stepping out found herself in a small garden
beautifully kept and fragrant with violets her love for flowers was
a passion and she stepped on to the path in search of them the path
led in zigzag fashion to a little wooden gate by which the garden was
entered from the lane stella found some violets and looking about in
search of further treasure store saw a bunch of lilac blossom growing
in the lane side
to open the gate and run lightly up the side of the bank was the
impulse of the moment and she obeyed it there were still deeper
masses of flowers a little further down and she was walking toward
them when she heard the sound of a horse galloping toward her
for a moment she was so startled by the unexpected sound that she
stood looking toward the direction whence it came and in that moment
a horse and rider turned the corner and made full pelt for the spot
where she was standing stella glanced back toward the little white
gate to discover that it was not in sight and that she had gone
further than she intended it was of no use to attempt to get back
before the horseman reached her there was only time to get out of the
way lightly springing up the bank she stood under the lilac tree and
waited
as she did so the horse and man came out of the shadow into the
moonlight to stella both looked tremendously big and tall in the
deceptive light but it was not the size but the attitude of the rider
which struck her and chained her attention
she could not see his face but the figure was that of a young man
tall and stalwart and full of a strange masterful grace which
displayed itself in the easy reckless way in which he sat the great
animal and in the poise of the head which slightly thrown back
seemed in its very attitude eloquent of pride and defiance there was
something strange and unusual about the whole bearing that struck
stella unused as she was to meeting horsemen in an english country
lane
as he came a little nearer she noticed that he was dressed in evening
dress excepting his coat which was of velvet and sat loosely yet
gracefully upon the stalwart frame in simple truth the rider had
thrown off his dress coat for a smoking jacket and still wore his
dress boots stella saw the moonlight shining upon them and upon a
ruby which blazed sullenly upon the white hand which held the whip
as if rider and horse were one they came up the lane and were abreast
of her the man all unconscious of her presence but not so the horse
his quick restless eye had caught sight of the shimmer of stellas
dress and with a toss of the head he swerved aside and stood still
the rider brought his eyes from the sky and raising his whip cut the
horse across the flank with a gesture of impatient anger but the
horsea splendid hugeboned irish mare as fiery and obstinate as a
lionrose on its hind legs instantly and the whip came down again
confound you what is the matter exclaimed its master go on you
idiot
the horse pricked its ears at the sound of the familiar voice but
stood stock still quivering in every limb
stella saw the whip raised again and instinctively before she was
aware of it her womanly protest sprang from her lips
no no
at the sound of the eager imploring voice the rider kept his whip
poised in the air then let his arm fall and dragging rather than
guiding the horse forced it near the hedge
who is it who are you he demanded angrily what the
then he stopped suddenly and stared speechlessly motionless and
transfixedhorse and rider as it were turned to stone
tall and graceful with that grace which belongs to the girlhood which
stands on the threshold of womanhood with her exquisite face fixed in
an expression of mingled fear and pity and a shyness struggling with
maidenly pride she made a picture which was lovely enough to satisfy
the requirements of the most critical and artistic minda picture
which he who looked upon it carried with him till the day he died
for a moment he sat motionless and as he sat the moon fell full upon
his face and stella saw the face of the portrait whose eyes she had
but a few minutes since hidden from her sight
a lifetime of emotion may pass in a minute a lifes fate hangs upon
the balance of a stroke of time it was only for a moment that they
looked into each others eyes in silence but that moment meant so much
to each of them it was the horse that broke the spell by attempting
to rise again with a slight movement of the hand leycester wyndward
forced him down and then slid from the saddle and stood at stellas
feet hat in hand
even then he paused as if afraid lest a word should cause the vision
to vanish into thin air but at last he opened his lips
i beg your pardon
that was all four words only and words that one hears daily words
that have almost lost their import from too familiar commonplace
and yet as he said them they sounded so entirely so earnestly so
intensely significant and full of meaning that all the commonplace
drifted from them and they conveyed to the listeners ear a real and
eager prayer for forgiveness so real and earnest that to have passed
them by with the conventional smile and bow would have been an insult
and impossible
but it was not only the words and the tone but the voice that thrilled
through stellas soul and seemed to wake an echoing chord the picture
which had so awed her had been dumb and voiceless but now it seemed
as if it had spoken even as it had smiled and for a moment she felt a
womans desire to shut out the sound as she had shut out the smiling
eyes
it was the maidenly impulse of selfprotection against what evil she
did not know or dream
i beg your pardon he said again his voice deep and musical his
eyes raised to hers i am afraid i frightened you i thought i was
alone here will you forgive me
stella looked down at him and a faint color stole into her cheeks
it is i who should beg pardon i am not frightened but your horse
wasand by me
he half glanced at the horse standing quiet enough now with its bridle
over his arm
he is an idiot he said quickly an obstinate idiot and incapable
of fear it was mere pretense
for which you punished him said stella with a quick smile
he looked up at her and slowly there came into his eyes and his lips
that smile of which mr etheridge had spoken and which stella had
foreseen
you are afraid i am going to whip him again
yes she said with simple directness
he looked at her with a curious smile
you are right he said i was there are times when he requires a
little correction tonight is one of them we have not seen each other
for some little time and he has forgotten who is master but i shall
not forget your no and will spare the whip are you satisfied
it was a strange speech closing with a strangely abrupt question it
was characteristic of the speaker who never in all his life probably
had known for a moment what nervousness or embarrassment meant judging
by his tone the easy flow of the musical voice the frank open
manner one would have imagined that this meeting with a strange and
beautiful girl was the most matteroffact affair
are you satisfied he repeated as stella remained silent trying
to fight against the charm of his simple and direct manner if not
perhaps that will do it and taking the whip a strong hunters crop
in both his white hands he broke it in two as easily as if it were a
reed and flung it over his shoulder
stella flushed but she laughed and her dark eyes beamed down upon him
with serious archness
does not that look as if you were afraid you should not keep your
promise
he smiled up at her
it does he saidyou are right i may have been tempted beyond my
strength he is a badtempered beast and i am another why do you
laugh
he broke off his voice changing as subtly as some musical instrument
stella hesitated a moment
i beg you will tell mei shall not be offended
she laughed and clung with one hand to the lilac looking down on him
i was thinking how fortunate it was that he could not whip you it is
not fair as you are both so badtempered that one only should get
punished
he did not laugh as another man would have done but there came into
the dark eyes a flash of surprised amusement such as might have shone
in those of the giant gulliver when some liliputian struck him with a
pinsized stick and his lips parted with a smile
it was a natural reflection he said after a pause will you let me
help you down
stella shook her head somehow she felt safe up there above him where
but the dark eyes could reach her
thank you no i am gathering some lilac do not trouble
and she turned slightly from him and stretched up her hand for a
branch above her head the next moment he sprang up the bank lightly
and stood beside her
permit me he said and with one sweep he drew the fragrant branch
within her reach
and now will you come down he asked as if she were some willful
child stella smiled and he held out his hand she put hers into it
and his fingers closed over it with a grasp firm as steel but as
smooth as a womans as the warm fingers closed over hers which were
cold with her long grasp of the branch above her head a thrill ran
through her and caused her to shudder slightly
you are cold he said instantly the spring evenings are
treacherous have you far to go
i am not cold thanks she said with quick alarm for there was
a look in his eyes and a movement of his hand which seemed to give
warning that he was about to take his coat off
i am not at all cold
have you far to go he repeated with the air gentle as it was of a
man who was accustomed to have his questions answered
not far to the little white gate there she answered
the little white gateto etheridges the artists he said gently
with a tone of surprise
stella bent her head his eyes scanned her face
you live thereare staying there
yes
i never saw you in wyndward before
no i was never here till tonight
till tonight he echoed i knew that i had not seen you before
there was something in the tone wholly unlike commonplace flattery
that brought the color to stellas face
they had reached the gate by this time he walking by her side the
bridle thrown over his arm the great horse pacing quiet and lamblike
and stella stopped
goodnight she said
he stopped short and looked at her his head thrown back as she had
seen it as he rode toward her his eyes fixed intently on her face and
seeming to sink through her downcast eyes into her soul
goodnight he replied wait
it was a word of command for all its musical gentleness and stella
womanlike stopped
i am going away he said not abruptly but with calm directness if
you have only come tonight i shall not be able to learn your name
before i go will you tell it me
stella smiled
why not he said as she hesitated
my name is stella etheridge i am mr etheridges niece
stella he repeated stella thank you i shall not forget my
name and he raised his hat with a simple gesture of proud humility
is wyndwardleycester wyndward
i know it said stella and the next moment she could have called the
impulsive words back again
you know it he said and came here only tonight how is that
stellas brows contracted dark and full they met across her brow in
true southern fashion and lent a significant eloquence to her face
she would have given much to avoid answering
how is that he asked his eyes fixed on hers
it is very simple she said as if vexed at her hesitation i saw
your portrait andknew you
he smiled a curious smile
knew me before we met i wonder he paused and his eyes seemed to
read her thoughts i wonder whether you were prejudiced by what you
saw by that forshadowing of me is that a fair question
it is a strange one said stella
is it i will not press it goodnight and he raised his hat
goodnight and goodbye she said and impulsively again she held
out her hand
his eyes showed no surprise whatever he may have felt as he took her
hand and held it
no he said as he let her draw it away not goodbye i have
changed my mind i shall not go it is only goodnight and with a
smile flashing out of his eyes he leapt upon his horse and was gone
chapter iii
stella stood watching until the big chestnut had borne its master out
of sight and down the lane across the meadow she caught one more
glimpse of them as he rode through the ford the water dashing up a
silver shower of spray as high as the horses head then they vanished
in the shadow of the woods which engirdled wyndward hall
but she still stood lost in a dreamy reverie that was not thought
until her uncles voice came floating down the garden and with a start
she ran up the path and stood breathless before him
the old mans placid face wore a slight look of anxiety which faded
instantly as he said
where have you been stella i thought you had changed your mind
and flown back to italy again mrs penfold is searching the meadows
wildly
stella laughed as she put her arm round his neck
you will not get rid of me so easily uncle no i have only been down
the pretty lane at the end of the garden see here are some flowers
are they not sweet you shall have them for your table and they shall
stand within sight while you are at work and she filled a vase with
water and arranged them but the flowers are not all the fruits of my
wandering uncle she went on i have had an adventure
he was strolling up and down with his pipe in his mouth his hands
folded behind him
an adventure
yes she nodded i have metcan you guess whom
he smiled
mr fielding the clergyman it is his usual evening stroll
no
perhaps an old lady in a lace shawl with a fat pug by her side if
so you have made an acquaintance with the great mrs hamilton the
doctors wife
no it was not anybodys wife uncleit was a man you shant guess
any more but what do you say to lord leycester
lord leycester said mr etheridge i did not even know he was at
home lord leycester and does my picture do him justice he asked
turning to her with a smile
she bent over the flowers ashamed of the meaningless blush which rose
to her face
yes uncle it is like him but i could not see very distinctly you
know it was moonlight he was riding a great huge chestnut horse
i know he murmured and tearing along like a lost spirit he
flashed past like a meteor i expect no you could not see him and
cannot judge of my portrait
but he didnt flash past he would have done no doubt but the
chestnut declined i think it was frightened by me for i was standing
on the bank
and he stopped asked mr etheridge it was a wonder such a little
thing even as the shying of his horse was sufficient to rouse the devil
in him he stopped
because he was obliged said stella in a low voice a deep blush of
maidenly shame rising to her face as she remembers that it was she who
had really stopped him
and was he very furious
no the proverbial lamb could not have been more quiet said stella
with a musical laugh
mr etheridge laughed
he must have been in a good humor it was strange his being out
tonight the hall is full of people from town but it would not matter
to him if he wanted to ride though the prince himself were there he
would go and my picture
did him justice uncle yes he is very handsome he wore a loose
velvet coat tonight of a dark purple i did not know gentlemen wore
such colors now
a smoking coat he explained i think i can see him no doubt he had
obeyed the impulse of the momenthad jumped up and left them there at
the hallsaddled his own horse and tore away across the river well
you have probably seen the last of him for some time stella he rarely
stays at the hall more than a day or two town has too great a charm
for him
stellas lips opened and she was about to reply that he had suddenly
resolved to stay but something stopped the words on her lips
presently there was a knock at the door and mrs penfold came in with
the candles
you have given me quite a turn miss stella she said with a smile
of reproach i thought you were lost your room is quite ready now
miss
stella went up to the old man and kissed him
goodnight uncle she murmured
goodnight my child he said his eyes dwelling on her tenderly but
with something of the bewildered look clouding them goodnight and
happy dreams for this your first night at home
at home murmured stella at home you are very good to me uncle
and she kissed him again
mrs penfold had done wonders in so short a time permitted her and
stella found herself standing alone in a tiny room modestly but
comfortablyoh so comfortablyfurnished with its white bed and its
oldfashioned dimity curtains framing the lattice window as her gaze
wandered round the room her glorious eyes grew moist it was all so
sudden so sweet a contrast to the gaunt bare room which for a weary
year she had shared with a score of girls as miserable as herself so
sudden that she could scarcely believe it was real
but youth is ever ready to accept the surprises of life and she fell
asleepfell asleep to dream that she was back in the wretched school
in italy and chained to a stone wall from which all her efforts to
free herself were unavailing but presently she thought that a tall
stalwart figure came riding down on a big chestnut horse and that with
one sweep of his strong hand he broke her chains asunder and lifting
her into his saddle bore her away then the scene changed she seemed
to be following her rescuer who with his handsome face turned over his
shoulder drew her on continually with a strange fascinating smile all
through her dreams the smiling eyes haunted her and once she stretched
out her hands to keep it from her but even in the action the gesture
of repulse turned in a strange subtle manner to one of entreaty and
welcome and she drew the smile as it were to her bosom and folded
her hands over it a girlish fancy perhaps but such fancies influence
a life for good or ill for joy or misery
lord leycester wyndward of whose smile stella was dreaming had ridden
up the hills the great chestnut scarcely breaking his pace but
breathing hard and defiantly from its wide red nostrilshad ridden
up the hills and through the woods and reached the open plateau lying
round the hall
a noble park occupied the plateaua park of chestnuts and oaks
which were the pride of the county through the park wound the road
gleaming white in the moonlight to the front gates of wyndward the
lodgekeeper heard the beat of the chestnuts feet for which he had
been listening intently and threw open the gates and lord leycester
entered the grounds they were vast in extent and exquisitely laid out
the road winding between a noble avenue of trees that arched overhead
the present earls grandfather had gone in for arboriculture and the
way was lined for fifty feet back with rare shrubs and conifers
so serpentine was the road that the great gray mansion broke upon the
gaze suddenly mentally startling him who approached it for the first
time
to lord leycester it was a familiar sight but familiar as it was he
glanced up at it with what was almost a nod of approval like most men
of his nature he possessed a passionate love and appreciation for the
beautiful and there was tonight a strange indefinable fire in his
hot blood which made him more than usually susceptible to the influence
of the scene a sweeping curve of the road led to the terrace which
stretched along the whole front of the house and by which the
principal entrance was gained
lord leycester struck off to the right and entered a modern courtyard
three sides of which were occupied by the admirable stables a couple
of grooms had been listening as intently as the lodgekeeper and as he
entered the yard they hurried forward silently and took the chestnut
lord leycester dropped to the ground patted the horse which made a
playfullyaffectionate snap at his arm and ascending a flight of
steps entered the lower end of the long hall which stretched through
the building
the hall was softly but sufficiently lighted by shaded lamps supported
by huge figures in bronze which diffused a charming glow upon the
innumerable pictures upon the panels of dark oak from the vaulted
roof hung tattered flags most of them borne by the earlier wyndwards
some of them bestowed by the graceful hands of dead and gone princes
the somewhat gloomy aspect of the place was lightened by the gleaming
armor of the knightly effigies which stood at regular intervals upon
the tesselated floor and by the deep crimson of the curtains which
screened the heavy doors and tall windows the whole scene the very
atmosphere as it seemed was characteristic of an ancient and powerful
race notwithstanding that the house was full of guests and that a
brilliant party was at that moment in the drawingroom not a sound
penetrated the vast hall the two or three servants who were standing
by the doors or sitting on the benches talking in hushed voices were
silent the moment he entered and one came forward to receive any
commands
notwithstanding the brusqueness which is the salient characteristic of
our present life the old world state and formality still existed at
wyndward be as exacting and capricious as you might you had no fear
of meeting with inattention or disrespect from the army of servants
whose one aim and purpose in life seemed to be to minister to the wants
and moods of their superiors
it was a princely house conducted in stately fashion without regard
to cost or trouble and the servants from the pages to the countesss
own maid were as proud of their position in its degree as the lord
of wyndward of his
send oliver to me said lord wyndward as he passed the man i am
going to my room
he went up the stairs and passing along the principal corridor
entered a room fronting the park it was one of a suite which consisted
of a sort of sittingroom a dressingroom and beyond a bedroom
the sittingroom gave pretty plain indications of the owners tastes
and dispositions
it was a medley of objects connected with sport and art here a set
of boxinggloves and foils a gunrack well stocked fishingrods
and whips hung over the antique fireplace with the wide open hearth
and dogirons on one side of the room hung a collection of etchings
unique and priceless on another half a dozen gems in oil while
against the third stood a piano and an easel upon which rested a
canvas displaying a halffinished venus rising from her cradle of sea
foam for upon this the only son of the house the partial gods had
bestowed many gifts any one of which had he been a poor man would
have made the world regard him as one of its masters but as it was
he painted and played for amusement only and there were only a few of
his friends and only those who were most intimate who suspected that
the wild reckless leycester could do more than ride like a centaur and
shoot like a north american indian how were they to know seeing that
he rarely spoke of art and never of his own passionate love of it had
they known it would have given them a key to much in his character
which puzzled and bewildered them they would have been nearer
understanding how it was that in one man could be combined the soft
tenderness of a southern nature with the resolute defiant recklessness
of the northern
he entered the room and went to the fireplace in which a log was
burning brightly to guard against the too frequent treachery of an
early summer evening and flinging his hat on to a chair passed his
hand through his hair with a thoughtful yet restless smile
stella he murmured stella that was wrong a star should be fair
and golden all light and sunshine while shegreat heaven what eyes
it was surely the sweetest loveliest face that a man ever looked upon
no wonder that coming upon it so suddenlywith my thoughts a hundred
miles away coming upon it suddenly as it shone up above methat i
should think it only a vision if that face as i saw it could smile
out from the academy next spring what crowds of fools would gather
round to gape and stare at it ifyes but who could do it no one no
one as well try and catch the sunlight on a brush and paint it on the
canvasas well try he broke off suddenly his eye caught by the
venus aphrodite smiling from the easel and going across to it stood
and contemplated it
venus with a pale pink face and meaningless blue eyes with insipid
yellow hair and simpering smile never more will venus take that
semblance for me no she will be as i saw her tonight with dark
silken hair and sweeping lashes shading the dark brown eyes in which
one sees the soul peering from their depths that is venus not this
and with a smile of derision he took up a brush and drew a dark broad
effacing line across the fair face
so departs forever all my former dreams of womanly loveliness
loveliness i have never seen it until tonight stella a star yes
she is rightly named after all she shone down on me like a star
and igreat heavenwas like one bewitched while sheshe made a
laughingstock of me compared me with the nag and treated me like a
schoolboy too big to be whipped but not too large to be laughed at
by jove it is not a thing to be proud of called to task by a girla
little slip of a girl not yet a woman and yet i would not have missed
that laugh and the light scorn of those dark eyes though they lighted
up at my expense stella
there was a knock at the door and his valet oliver entered
lord leycester stared at him a moment abstractedly then roused himself
from his reverie
what is it oliver
you sent for me my lord
oh yes i had forgotten i will wash and get into my other coat
oliver passed noiselessly into the other room and assisted his master
to change the velvet smokingjacket for the dress coat brushed the
thick shortcut chestnut hair into order and opened the door
where are they all he asked are any of them in the smokingroom
yes my lord lord barton and captain halliday the marquis of
sandford and sir william are in the billiardroom
lord leycester nodded and went down the stairs across the hall
a servant drew a curtain aside and opened a door and lord
leycester entered a small anteroom one side of which opened into
a longstretching fernery from which came the soft trip trip of
fountains and the breath which filled the whole atmosphere with a
tropical perfume
a couple of footmen in gorgeous livery were standing beside a double
curtain and at a sign from lord leycester they drew it apart lord
leycester passed through and down a small corridor lined with statuary
at the end of which was another curtain no passage or door or
anteroom but was thus masked to shut out the two things which the
earl held as abominationsdraught and noise
with the opening of these curtains the large saloon was revealed
like the scene on the stage of a theater it was a magnificent room
in keeping with the rest of the place richly but not gorgeously
decorated and lighted by wax candles shining through faintly hued
globes at one end stood a grand piano in white and ormolu and a lady
was playing and singing while others were standing round with teacups
in their hands near the fireplace was a table upon which stood a
silver tea equipage with which the countess was busied
lady wyndward was still in her prime notwithstanding that lord
leycester was twentythree she had been married at eighteen and was
now in the perfection of matronly beauty one had only to glance at
her to learn from whence leycester had got his strange beauty near
her stood a tall thin gentleman with proud haughty cleancut face
and iron gray hair worn rather long and brushed back from a white
lofty brow it was the earl his dark piercing eyes were bent upon the
ground as he stood listening to the music but he saw leycester enter
and raised his head as a slight frown crossed his face lady wyndward
saw the frown and sought the cause but her face showed no signs of
surprise or displeasure it was calm and impassive at all times as if
its owner disdained the weakness of ordinary mortals leycester paused
a moment taking in the scene then he crossed the room and went up to
the table
lady wyndward looked up with her serene imperial smile
will you have some tea leycester
thanks he said
she gave him his cup and as he took it a young man left the group at
the piano and came up to him laughing
where have you been leycester he asked putting his hand on the
broad shoulder it was lord charles guildford leycesters most
intimate friend
between these two existed an affection which was almost say rather
more than fraternal they had been together at eton where leycester
the great stalwart lad had fought the slight frail boys battles
they had lived in the same rooms at oxford had been comrades in all
the wild escapades which made their term at college a notorious one
and they were inseparable leycester had grown from a tall lad into a
stalwart man lord charlesor charlie as he was calledhad fulfilled
the promise of his frail boyhood and developed into a slight thin
fairhaired youth with the indolent grace which sometimes accompanies
weakness and the gentle nature of a woman
leycester turned to him with a smile and the earl looked up to hear
the answer the countess busied herself with the teapot as if she were
not listening as intently
i went for a galop charlie said leycester you fellows were half
asleep in the smokingroom and i had listened to bartons indian story
for the hundredth time and it got rather slow then i remembered that
the chestnut had been eating his head off for the last five weeks and
thought i would give him a turn
the earl frowned and turned away lord charles laughed
pretty behavior he exclaimed and here were we hunting all over the
place for you
why didnt you come into the drawingroom to us lord leycester said
a beautiful girl who was sitting near we should not have bored you
with any indian stories
but you see i should have bored you lady constance he said
the girl smiled up into his face
perhaps you would she said you are more considerate than i
thought
i never venture into the ladies sanctum after dinner till the tea is
announced he retorted i have an idea shared by my sex generally
that it is not safethat in short you are too ferocious
and you prefer riding about the country till we quiet down are we
quiet now or do we look ferocious
and she smiled up at him from behind her fan with a plain invitation
he sat down beside her and began to talk the infinite nothings which
came to his lips so easily the trivial small change which his musical
voice and rare smile seemed to transform to true coin but while he
talked his thoughts were wandering to the darkhaired girl who had
shone down upon him from her green and fragrant bower in the lane and
he found himself picturing her in the little room at the cottage in the
meadows amongst the curious litter of the old artists studio and
gradually his answers grew disjointed and inconsequential
he got up presently got up abruptly and wandered across the room
stopping to exchange a word or two with one and the other his tall
graceful figure towering above those of the other men his handsome
head thrown back musingly many an admiring and wistful glance
followed him from among the women and not a few would have exerted
all their fascinations to keep him by their side had they not known
by experience that when he was in his present mood he was deaf to the
voice and smile of the charmer charmed she never so wisely
chapter iv
the countess watched him from her table and looking up at the earl
murmured
leycester is in one of his restless moods tonight
yes he said with a sigh what is itdo you know
no she said calmly he was all right at dinner
why can he not behave like other people said the earl sadly can
you fancy any other man leaving his fathers guests and riding about
the country
leycester never was like any other she said not without a touch of
pride he is as he is and nothing can alter him
the earl was silent for a moment his long white hands folded behind
his back his dark eyes fixed on the floor
has he told you of his last escapadehis last mad freak he said in
a low voice
yes she answered calmly he has never concealed anything from me
it is nearly twenty thousand pounds even wyndward must feel such
strains as this
the countess raised her head
i know she said he has told me everything it was a point of
honor i did not quite understand horseracing is a pastime with which
i have little sympathy though we have always owned racehorses it was
a point of honor some one had been taking advantage of his name to act
dishonestly and he withdrew the horse he could take no other course
he says
the earl sighed
no doubt but it is mad folly and there is no end to itif he could
see some limit why does he not marry
the countess glanced at the handsome face
he will not marry until he meets with some one he can love
the earl looked round the room at the many beautiful graceful women who
adorned it and sighed impatiently
he is hard to please
he is assented the countess with the same touch of pride
it is time he married and settled continued the earl for most men
a year or two would not matter but with himi do not like to think
that the title rests only on our two lives as mine must be near its
close
algernon
and on his which is risked daily
he stooped silenced by the sudden look of pain in the beautiful eyes
why do you not speak to him he will do anything for you
the countess smiled
everything but that no i cannot speak to him it would be useless i
do not wish to weaken my influence
get lilian to speak to him he said
the countess sighed
lilian she murmured she would not do it she thinks him something
more than human and that no woman in the world can be good enough
toto hold his stirrup or fill his wineglass
the earl frowned
between you he said you have spoiled him
the countess shook her head gently
no we have not he is now as a man what he was as a boy do you
remember what nelson said when hardy asked him why he did nothing
while one of their ships was fighting two of the enemys i am doing
all i canwatching
before the earl could reply a cabinet minister came up and engaged him
in conversation and the countess rose and crossed the room to where an
elderly lady sat with a portfolio of engravings before her it was the
dowager countess of longford a tiny little woman with a thin wrinkled
face and keen but kindly gray eyes that lit up her white face and made
it remarkable
she was dressed as simply as a quakeress excepting for some old and
priceless lace which softened the rigor of her plainly made gray satin
dress she looked up as the younger countess approached and made room
for her on the sofa
lady wyndward sat down in silence which was unbroken for a minute
then the old countess said without looking at her
the boy grows handsomer every day ethel
lady wyndward sighed
what is the matter asked the other with a keen smile what has he
been doing now burning a church or running off with a lord mayors
daughter
he has not been doing anything very much answered lady wyndward
except losing some money
the old countess raised her eyebrows lightly
that does not matter
not much no he has not been doing anything i wish he would thats
what is the matter
i understand retorted the other he is most dangerous when quiet
you are always afraid he is preparing for some piece of madness beyond
the ordinary well my dear if you will give the world such a
creature you must put up with the consequencesbe prepared to pay the
penalty i should be quite content to do so
ah you dont know said the countess with a smile that had
something pathetic in it
yes i do retorted the old lady curtly and i envy you still i
love the boy ethel there is not a woman of us in the room from the
youngest to the oldest who does not love him you cannot expect one
whom the gods have so favored to behave like an ordinary mortal
why not it is just what algernon has said to me
i thought as much i was watching you two of all things beware of
this dont let algernon interfere with him it is a strange thing to
say but his father is the worst man in all the world to attempt to put
the bridle on leycester it is we women who alone have the power to
guide him
that is where my fear lies said the countess it is the thought of
what may happen in that quarter which fills me with daily dread
there is only one safeguardmarry him remarked the old countess
but with a comical smile
the countess sighed
again that is what algernon says you both say it as calmly as if you
told me to give him a cup of tea
the old countess was silent for a moment then she said
where is lenore beauchamp
lady wyndward was almost guilty of a start
you read my thoughts she said
the old lady nodded
she is the only woman who can really touch him ask her here let them
be together she will be glad to come
i am not sure lenore is proud she might guess why we wanted her
the old lady drew up her head as haughtily as if she was leycesters
mother
and then is there any girl among them who would not jump at the
chance i dont mean because he is the heir to wyndward he is enough
in himself without that
it is well you are not his mother you would have made him what he is
not nowvain
the old lady sighed
i know it but you are wrong about lenore if she ever cared for
anyone it is leycester she is proud but love levels pride and
she may put forth her power if she should not even leycester can
withstand her ask her down and leave the rest to herand providence
the countess sat for a moment in silence then she put her hand upon
the thin wrinkled hand unadorned by a single gem
i have always you to come to i think you understand him better than
his own mother
no said the old lady but i love him nearly as well
i will write at once said the countess and she rose and crossed to
the anteroom
there was a writingtable amongst the furniture the servants saw her
go to it and noiselessly left the room
she took up the pen and thought a moment then wrote
 my dear lenorewill you come down and spend a week with us we have
 a few friends with us but we are not complete without you do not say
 no but come i do not name any day so that you may be free to fix
 your own
     yours affectionately
          ethel wyndward
 psleycester is with us
as she wrote the signature she heard a step behind her which she knew
was leycesters
he stopped short as he saw her and coming up to her put his hand on
her white shoulder
writing mother he said
the countess folded her letter
yes where are you going
he pointed to the louis quatorze clock that ticked solemnly on a
bracket
ten oclock mother he said with a smile
oh yes i see she assented
he stood for a moment looking down at her with all a young mans filial
pride in a mothers beauty and bending down touched her cheek with
his lips then passed out
the countess looked after him with softened eyes
who could help loving him she murmured
humming an air from the last opera bouffe he ran lightly up the
staircase and passed along the corridor but as he reached the further
end and knocked at a door the light air died upon his lips
a low voice murmured come in and opening the door gently he
entered
the room was a small one and luxuriously furnished in a rather strange
style on the first entrance a stranger would have been struck by
the soft and delicate tints which pervaded throughout there was not
a brilliant color in the apartment the carpet and hangings the
furniture the pictures themselves were all of a reposeful tint which
could not tire the eye or weary the sense the carpet was a thick
persian rug which deadened the sound of footsteps costly hangings of
a cool and restful gray covered the walls save at intervals the fire
itself was screened by a semitransparent screen and the only light in
the room came from a lamp which was suspended by a silver chain from
the ceiling and was covered by a thick shade
on a couch placed by the window reclined a young girl as leycester
entered she half rose and turned a pale but beautiful face toward him
with an expectant smile
beautiful is a word that is easily written and written so often that
its significance has got dulled it fails to convey any idea of the
ethereal loveliness of lilian wyndward had mr etheridge painted a
face with leycesters eyes and given it the delicatelycut lips and
spiritual expression of one of raphaels angels it would have been a
fair representation of lilian wyndward
it is you leycester she said i knew you would come and she
pointed to a small traveling clock that stood on a table near her
he went up to her and kissed her and she put her arms round his neck
and laid her face against his her eyes looking into his with rapt
devotion
how hot you are dear is it hot down there
awfully he said seating himself beside her and thrusting his
hands into his pockets there is not a breath of air moving and if
there were the governor would take care to shut it out this room is
deliriously cool lil it is a treat to come into it
is it she said with a glad eagerness you really think it is i
like to hear you say that
yes its the prettiest room in the house what is it smells so sweet
lilac she said and she pointed to a bunch on the table
he started slightly and stretching out his hand took a spray out of
the epergne
i thought it was lilac he said quietly i noticed it when i came
in
she took the spray from him and fastened it in his coat against which
her hands looked white as the driven snow
you shall take it to your own room ley she said you shall take
them all
not for worlds lil he said this will do
and what are they doing she asked
the usual thing he replied playing singing rubber at whist and
boring each other to death generally
she smiled
and what have you been doing
assisting in the latter amusement he answered lightly
they told me you had gone out she said
he nodded
yes i took the chestnut for a spin
she laughed a soft hushed laugh
and left them the first night that was like you ley
what was the use of staying it was wrong i suppose i am
unfortunate yes i went for a ride
it was a lovely evening i watched the sunset and she looked at the
window if i had known you were going i would have looked for you i
like to see you riding that big chestnut you went across the meadows
yes he said across the meadows
he was silent for a minute then he said suddenly lil i have seen a
vision tonight
a vision ley she repeated looking up at him eagerly
he nodded
a vision the most beautiful girl i have ever seen excepting you
lil
she made no protest but smiled
ley a girl what was she like
i cant tell you he said i came upon her in a moment the chestnut
saw her first and was human enough to be struck motionless i was
struck too
and you cant tell me what she was like
no if i were to describe her with usual phrases you would smile you
women always do you cant help being a woman lil
was she dark or fair
dark he replied i did not know it at the time it was impossible
to think whether she was dark or fair while one looked at her but i
remembered afterward lil you remember that picture i sent you from
paristhe picture of the girl with the dark eyes and long silky
hairnot black but brown in the sunlight with long lashes shading
the eyes and the lips curved in a halfserious smile as she looks down
at the dog fawning at her feet
i remember ley was she like that
yes only alive fancy the girl in the picture alive fancy yourself
the dog she was smiling at i was the dog
ley
and she spoke as well as smiled you can imagine the voice that girl
in the picture would have soft and musical but clear as a bell and
full of a subtle kind of witchery half serious half mockery it was
the voice of the girl i met in the lane this evening
ley ley you have come to make poetry to me tonight i am very
grateful
poetry it is truth but you are right such a face such a voice
would make a poet of the hardest man that lives
and you are not hard ley but the girl who is she what is her name
her namehe hesitated a moment and his voice unconsciously grew
wonderfully musicalis stellastella
stella she repeated it is a beautiful name
is it not stella
and she iswho
the niece of old etheridge the artist at the cottage
lilians eyes opened wide
really ley i must see her
his face flushed and he looked at her
she caught the eager look and her own paled suddenly
no she said gravely i will not see her leyyou will forget her
by tomorrow
he smiled
you will forget her by tomorrow ley let me look at you
he turned his face to her and she looked straight into his eyes then
she put her arm round his neck
oh ley has it come at last
what do you mean he asked not angrily but with a touch of
grimness as if he were afraid of the answer
ley she said you must not see her again ley you will go
tomorrow will you not
why he asked it is not like you to send me away lil
no but i do i who look forward to seeing you as the sweetest thing
in my lifei who would rather have you near me than beother than i
ami who lie and wait and listen for your footstepsi send you ley
think you must go ley go at once for your own sake and for hers
he rose and smiled down at her
for my sake perhaps but not for hers you foolish girl do you think
all your sex is as partial as you are you did not see her as i saw her
tonightdid not hear her ready wit at my expense for her sake you
make me smile lil
i cannot smile ley you will not stay what good can come of it i
know you so well you will not be content until you have seen your
venus again and thenah ley what can she do but love you and love
you but to lose you ley all that has gone before has made me smile
because with them i knew you were heartwhole i could look into your
eyes and see the light of laughter in their depths but not this time
leynot this time you must go promise me
his face went pale under her gaze and the defiant look which so
rarely shone out in her presence came into his eyes and about his
lips
i cannot promise lil he said
chapter v
     for love lay lurking in the clouds and mist
        i heard him singing sweetly on the mountain side
    tis all in vain you fly for everywhere am i
        in every quiet valley on every mountain side
in the clear birdlike tones of stellas voice the musical words
floated from the open window of her room above and through the open
french windows of the old mans studio
with a little start he turned his head away from the easel and looked
toward the door
stella had only been in the house three days but he had already
learned something of her habits and knew that when he heard the
beautiful voice singing at the window in the early morning he might
expect to see the owner of the voice enter shortly
his expectation was not doomed to disappointment the voice sounded on
the stairs in the hall and a moment afterward the door opened and
stella stood looking smilingly into the room
if he had thought her beautiful and winsome on that first evening of
her coming when she was weary with anxiety and traveling and dressed
in duststained clothes be sure he thought her more beautiful still
now that the light heart felt free to reveal itself and the shabby
dress had given place to the white and simple but still graceful
morning gown
mrs penfold had worked hard during those three days and with the aid
of the dulverfield milliner had succeeded in filling a small wardrobe
for her young lady as she had learned to call her the old artist
ignorant of the power of women in such direction had watched the
transformation with inward amazement and delight and was never tired
of hearing about dresses and hats jackets and capes and was rather
disappointed than otherwise when he found that the grand transformation
had been effected at a very small cost
bright and beautiful she stood like a vision of youth and health in
the doorway her dark eyes laughingly contemplating the old mans
gentle stare of wonderthe look which always came into his eyes when
she appeared
did i disturb you by my piping uncle she asked as she kissed him
oh no my dear he answered i like to hear youi like to hear
you
she leant against his shoulder and looked at his work
how beautiful it is she murmured how quickly it grows i heard
you come down this morning and i meant to get up but i was so
tiredlazy wasnt i
no no he said eagerly i am sorry i disturbed you i came down as
quietly as i could i knew you would be tired after your dissipation
you must tell me all about it
yes come to breakfast and i will tell you
must i he said glancing at his picture reluctantly
he had been in the habit of eating his breakfast by installments
painting while he ate a mouthful and drank his cup of coffee but
stella insisted upon his changing what she called a very wicked habit
yes of course see how nice it looks and she drew him gently to the
table and forced him into a chair
the old man submitted with a sigh that was not altogether one of
regret and still humming she sat opposite the urn and began to fill
the cups
and did you enjoy yourself he asked gazing at her dreamily
oh very much they were so kind mrs hamilton is the dearest old
lady and the doctorwhat makes him smile so much uncle
i dont know i think doctors generally do
oh very well well he was very kind too and so were the miss
hamiltons it was very nice indeed and they took so much notice of
measked me all sorts of questions sometimes i scarcely knew what to
answer i think they thought because i had been brought up in italy i
ought to have spoken with a strong accent and looked utterly different
to themselves i think they were a little disappointed uncle
oh he said and who else was there
oh the clergyman mr fieldinga very solemn gentleman indeed he
said he didnt see much of you and hoped he should see me in church
mr etheridge rubbed his head and looked rather guilty
i expect that was a backhanded knock for me stella he said rather
ruefully you see i dont go to church often i always mean to go but
i generally forget the time or i wander into the fields or up into
the woods and forget all about the church till its too late
but thats very wicked abominably so said stella gravely but with
a twinkle in her dark eyes i must look after your morals as well as
your meals i see uncle
yes he assented meeklydo do
well then there was a mr adelstone a young gentleman from london
he was quite the lion of the evening i think he was a nephew of mr
fieldings
the old man nodded
yes and did you like him
stella thought a moment holding the creamjug critically over the
coffeecup
not much uncle it was very wrong and very bad taste i am afraid
for they all seemed to admire him immensely and so did he himself
mr etheridge looked at her rather alarmed
i must say stella you get too critical i dont think we are quite
used to it
she laughed
i dont fancy mr adelstone was at all conscious of adverse criticism
he seemed quite satisfied with everybody himself in particular he
certainly was beautifully dressed and he had the dearest little hands
and feet in the world and his hair was parted to a hair and as
smooth as a blackandtan terriers so that he had some grounds for
satisfaction
what did he do to offend you stella asked the old man rather
shrewdly
she laughed again and a little touch of color came into her face but
she answered quite frankly
he paid me compliments uncle
that doesnt offend your sex generally stella
it offends me said stella quickly ii detest them especially
when the man who pays them does it with a selfsatisfied smile which
shows that he is thinking more of his own eloquence and gallantry than
of the person he is flattering
the old man looked at her
will you oblige me by telling me your age again he said
she laughed
am i too wise uncle well never mindill promise to be good and
stupid if you like but you are not eating any breakfast and you must
not keep looking at that odious easel all the time as if you were
longing to get back to it did you ever see a jealous woman
no never
well if you dont want to you must not confine all your attention to
your work
i dont think there is much fear of that when you are near he said
meekly
she laughed and jumped up to kiss him with delight
now that was a splendid compliment sir you are improving
rapidlymr adelstone himself couldnt have done it more neatly
scarcely had the words left her lips than the door opened
mr adelstone said mrs penfold
a young man tall and dark and faultlessly dressed stood in the
doorway his hat in one hand a bouquet of flowers in the other he was
undeniably goodlooking and as he stood with a smile upon his face
looked at his best a severe critic might have found fault with his
eyes and said that they were a little too small and a little too near
together might also have added that they were rather shifty and that
there was something approaching the sinister in the curves of the thin
lips but he was undeniably goodlooking and notwithstanding his well
cut clothes and spotless boots with their gray gaiters his white hands
with the choice selection of rings there was an indication of power
about him no one could have suspected him of being a fool or lacking
the power of observation for instance as he stood now smiling and
waiting for a welcome his dark eyes took in every detail of the room
without appearing to leave stellas face
mr etheridge looked up with the usual confused air with which he
always received his rare visitors but stella held out her hand with a
smile calm and selfpossessed there is a great deal of the woman even
about a girl of nineteen
goodmorning mr adelstone she said you have come just in time
for a cup of coffee
i ought to apologize for intruding at such an unseasonable hour he
said as he bent over her hand but your good housekeeper would not
hear of my going without paying my respects i am afraid im intruding
not at all not at all murmured the artist heres a chair and
he rose and cleared a chair of its litter by the simple process of
sweeping it on to the floor
mr adelstone sat down
i hope you are not tired after your mild dissipation last night he
asked of stella
she laughed
not at all i was telling uncle how nice it was it was my first party
in england you know
oh you musnt call it a party he said but i am very glad you
enjoyed it
what beautiful flowers said stella glancing at the bouquet
he handed them to her
will you be so kind as to accept them he said i heard you admire
them in the conservatory last night and i brought them for you from the
rectory greenhouse
for me exclaimed stella openeyed oh i didnt know i am so
sorry you should have troubled it was very kind you must have robbed
the poor plants terribly
they would be quite consoled if they could know for whom their
blossoms were intended he said with a low bow
stella looked at him with a smile and glanced half archly at her uncle
that was very nice she said poor flowers it is a pity they cant
know cant you tell them there is a language of flowers you know
mr adelstone smiled he was not accustomed to have his compliments met
with such ready wit and was nonplussed for a moment while his eyes
dropped from her face with a little shifty look
mr etheridge broke the rather embarrassing pause
put them in the vase for her mr adelstone will you please and
come and have some breakfast you cant have had any
he waited until stella echoed the invitation then drew up to the table
stella rang for cup and saucer and plates and poured him out some
coffee and he plunged into small talk with the greatest ease his keen
eyes watching every graceful turn of stellas arm and glancing now and
again at the beautiful face
it was very good small talk and amusing mr adelstone was one of
those men who had seen everything he talked of the london season that
was just coming on to stella who sat and listened half amused half
puzzled for london was an unknown land to her and the string of
names noble and fashionable which fell from his ready tongue was
entirely strange to her
then he talked of the coming academy to mr etheridge and seemed to
know all about the pictures that were going to be exhibited and which
ones would make a stir and which would fail then he addressed himself
to stella again
you must pay london a visit miss etheridge there is no place like it
the whole world throughnot even paris or rome
stella smiled
it is not very likely that i shall see london for a long time my
uncle does not often go although it is so near do you
no no he assented not often
perhaps you are to be congratulated said mr adelstone with all
its charms i am glad to get away from it
you live there said stella
yes he said quietly welcoming the faint look of interest in her
eyes yes i live in chambers as it is called in one of the old law
inns i am a lawyer
stella nodded
i know you wear a long black gown and a wig
he smiled
and address a jury and do you say mlud instead of my lord as
people in novels always make barristers say
i dont know perhaps i do he answered with a smile but i dont
address a jury or have an opportunity of calling a judge my lud or
my lord often most of my work is done at my chambers i am very
glad to get down into the country for a holiday
are you going to stay long asked mr etheridge with polite interest
mr adelstone paused a moment and glanced at stella before answering
i dont know he said i meant going back today buti think i
have changed my mind
stella was only half listening but the words caused her to start they
were the same as those which lord leycester had uttered three nights
ago
mr adelstones keen eyes saw the start and he made a mental note of
it
ah it is beautiful weather said mr etheridge it would be a pity
to leave wyndward for london now
yes i shall be more than ever sorry to go now said mr adelstone
and his glance rested for a moment on stellas face but it was quite
lost for stellas eyes were fixed on the scene beyond the window
dreamily
with almost a start she turned to him
let me give you some more coffee
no thanks he said then as stella rose and rang the bell he
walked to the easel that will be a beautiful picture mr etheridge
he said viewing it with a critical air
i dont know said the artist simply
you will exhibit it
i never exhibit anything was the quiet reply
no i am surprised exclaimed the young man but there was something
in the quiet manner of the old man that stopped any further questions
no said mr etheridge why should i i haveand he smiledno
ambition besides i am an old man i have had my chance let the young
ones take theirs i leave them room you are fond of art
very said mr adelstone may i look round
the old man waved his hand and took up his brush
jasper adelstone wandered round the room taking up the canvases and
examining them stella stood at the window humming softly
suddenly she heard him utter an involuntary exclamation and turning
round saw that he had the portrait of lord leycester in his hand
his face was turned toward her and as she turned quickly he was in
time to catch a sinister frown of dislike which rested for a moment on
his face but vanished as he raised his eyes and met hers
lord leycester he said with a smile and an uprising of the
eyebrows a remarkable instance of an artists power
what do you mean asked stella quietly but with lowered eyes
i mean that it is a fair example of ideality mr etheridge has
painted a likeness of lord leycester and added an ideal poetry of his
own
you mean that it is not like him she said
mr etheridge painted on deaf to both of them
no he said looking at the picture with a cold smile it is like
him but ithonors him it endows him with a poetry which he does not
possess
you know him said stella
who does not he answered and his thin lips curled with a smiling
sneer
a faint color came into stellas face and she raised her eyes for a
moment
what do you mean
i mean that lord leycester has made himself too famousi was going to
say infamous
a vivid crimson rushed to her face and left it pale again the next
instant
do not she said then added quickly i mean do not forget that he
is not here to defend himself
he looked at her with a sinister scrutiny
i beg your pardon i did not know he was a friend of yours he said
she raised her eyes and looked at him steadily
lord leycester is no friend of mine she said quietly
i am glad of it he responded
stellas eyes darkened and deepened in a way peculiar to her and her
color came it was true that lord leycester was no friend of hers she
had but seen and spoken with him by chance and for a few moments but
who was this mr adelstone that he should presume to be glad or sorry
on her account
he was quick to see that he had made a slip and quick to recover
himself
pray forgive me if i have presumed too far upon our slight
acquaintance but i was only thinking at that moment that you had been
so short a time in england as to be ignorant of people who are well
known to us with whom they have lived and that you would not know lord
leycesters real character
stella inclined her head gravely something within her stirred her to
take up arms in the absent mans defense the one word infamous
stuck and rankled in her mind
you said that lord leycester was infamous she said with a grave
smile surely that is too strong a word
he thought a moment his eyes resting on her face keenly
perhaps but i am not sure i certainly used it as a play upon the
word famous but i dont think even then that i did him an injustice
a man whose name is known all over the countrywhose name is familiar
as a household wordmust be notorious either for good or evil for
wisdom or folly lord leycester is not famous for virtue or wisdom i
cannot say any more
stella turned aside a faint crimson dyeing her face a strange thrill
of pity ay and of impatience at her heart why should he be so
wicked so mad and recklessso notorious that even this selfsatisfied
young gentleman could safely moralize about him and warn her against
making his acquaintance oh the pity of itthe pity of it as
shakespeare has itthat one with such a beautiful godlook face
should be so bad
there was a few moments silence jasper adelstone still stood with
the picture in his hand but glancing at stellas face with covert
watchfulness for all his outward calmness his heart was beating
quickly stellas was the sort of beauty to make a mans heart beat
quickly or not at all those who came to offer at her shrine would
offer no halfmeasured oblations as he watched her his heart beat
wildly and his small bright eyes glittered he had thought her
beautiful at the party last night where she had outshone all the other
girls of the village as a star outshines a rushlight but this morning
her loveliness revealed itself in all its fresh purity and hejasper
adelstone the critical man of the world the man whose opinion about
women was looked upon by his companions in lincolnsinn and the
bachelors haunts at the westend as worth havingfelt his heart
slipping from him he put the picture down and approached her
you have no idea how beautiful and fresh the meadows are will you
stroll down to the river with me he said resolving to take her by
surprise and capture her
but he did not know stella she was only a schoolgirlinnocent and
ignorant of the ways of men and the world but perhaps because
of thatbecause she had not learnt the usual hackneyed words of
evasionthe ordinary elementary tactics of flirtation she was not to
be taken by surprise
with a smile she turned her eyes upon him and shook her head
thank you no that is impossible i have all my household duties
to perform and thatpointing to the sun with her white slim
handreminds me that it is time i set about them
he took up his hat instantly turning to hide the frown that knitted
his brow and spoiled his face and went up to the painter to say
goodmorning
mr etheridge started and stared at him he had quite forgotten his
presence
goodmorning goodmorninggoing i beg your pardon wont you stop
and take some tea with us
mr adelstone would like some dinner first uncle said stella
then she gave him her hand
goodmorning she said and thank you very much for the flowers
he held her hand as long as he dared then passed out
stella perhaps unconsciously gave a sigh of relief
very nice young fellow my dear said mr etheridge without taking
his eyes from the canvas very clever too i remember him quite a
little boy and always said he would make his way they say that he has
done so i am not surprised jasper
jasper said stella what a horrible name
eh horrible i dont knowi dont know
but i do said stella laughing well what were you going to say
that jasper adelstone is the sort of man to insist upon having
anything he sets his heart upon
i am glad to hear it said stella as she opened the door for his
sake and i hope also for his sake that he wont set his mind upon
the sun or the moon and with a laugh she ran away
in the kitchen mrs penford was awaiting her with unconcealed
impatience upon the white scrubbed table stood the preparations for
the making of pastry an art which stella who had insisted upon making
herself useful had coaxed mrs penfold into teaching her at first
that good woman had insisted that stella should do nothing in the
little household she had announced with terrible gravity that such
things werent becoming to a young lady like miss stella and that she
had always done for mr etheridge and she always would but before
the second day had passed stella had won the battle as mrs penfold
said there was no resisting the girl who mingled willfulness with
bewitching firmness and persuasion and mrs penfold had given in
youll cover yourself with flour miss stella and give your uncle the
indigestion miss that you will she remonstrated
but the flour will brush off and uncle neednt eat pies and puddings
for a little while ill eat them i dont mind indigestion stella
declared and she made a delightfully piquant little apron which
completed mrs penfolds conquest
with a song upon her lips she burst into the kitchen and caught up the
rolling pin
am i not awfully late she exclaimed i was afraid you would have
done it all before i came but you wouldnt be so mean as to take an
advantage would you
mrs penfold grunted
its all nonsense miss stella theres no occasion for it
stella with her hand in the flour elevated the rollingpin in heroic
style
mrs penfold she exclaimed with the air of a princess the woman
be her station what it may who cannot make a jam roleypoley or an
apple tart is unworthy the name of an englishwoman give me the jam
stop though dont you think rhubarb would be very nice for a change
i wish youd go and play the organ miss stella and leave the rhubarb
alone
man cannot live on music retorted stella his soul craves for
puddings i wonder whether uncles soul craves for jam or rhubarb i
think ill go and ask him and dropping the rollingpinwhich mrs
penfold succeeded in catching before it fell on the floorshe wiped
her hand of a fifteenth part of the floor and ran into the studio
uncle i have come to lay before you the rival claims of rhubarb
and strawberry jam the one is sweet and luscious to the taste but
somewhat cloying the other is fresh and young but somewhat sour
good heavens what are you talking about exclaimed the bewildered
painter staring at her
rhubarb or jam now noble roman speak or die she exclaimed with
upraised arm her eyes dancing her lips apart with rippling laughter
mr etheridge stared at her with all an artists admiration in his eyes
oh the pudding he said then he suddenly stopped and stared beyond
her
chapter vi
stella heard a step on the threshold of the window and turning to
follow the direction of his eyes saw the stalwart form of lord
leycester standing in the window
he was dressed in a suit of brown velveteen with tightfitting
breeches and stockings and carried a whip in his hand with which he
barred the entrance against a couple of colleys a huge mastiff and a
skye terrier the last barking with furious indignation at being kept
outside
even at the moment of surprise stella was conscious of a sudden
reluctant thrill of admiration for the graceful figure in the
closefitting velvet and the handsome face with its dark eyes
regarding her with a grave respectful intenseness
back dogs he said go back vix then as they drew back the big
ones throwing themselves down on the path with patient obedience he
came into the room
i beg your pardon he said standing before stella his head bent i
thought mr etheridge was alone or i should not have entered in this
rough fashion
as he spoke in the lane so now it was no meaningless excuse but
with a tone of most reverential respect and proud humility stella
girllike noticed that he did not even venture to hold out his hand
and certainly mr adelstones selfsatisfied smile and assured manner
rose in her mind to contrast with this stately highbred humility
do not apologize it does not matter she said conscious that her
face had grown crimson and that her eyes were downcast
does it not i am forgiven and he held out his hand
stella had crossed her hands behind her as he entered with an
instinctive desire to hide her bare arms and the flour now she put out
her hand a few inches and held it up with a smile
i cant she said
he looked at the white handat the white arm so beautifully molded
that a sculptor would have sighed over it in despair at his inability
to imitate it and he still held out his hand
i do not mind the flour he said not as mr adelstone would have
said it but simply naturally
stella gave him one small taper finger and he took it and held it for a
moment his eyes smiling into hers then he relinquished it with not
a word of commonplace compliment but in silence and turned to mr
etheridge
it is quite hopeless to ask you to forgive me for interrupting you
i know so i wont ask he said and there was in his voice stella
noticed a frank candor that was almost boyish but full of respect at
once it seemed to intimate that he had known and honored the old man
since he leycester was a boy
how are you my lord said mr etheridge giving him his long thin
hand but still keeping a hold as it were on his beloved easel
taking the dogs for a walk are they safe take care stella
for stella was kneeling down in the midst of them making friends with
the huge mastiff much to the jealous disgust of the others who were
literally crowding and pushing round her
lord leycester looked round and was silent for a moment his eyes fixed
on the kneeling girl rather than on the dogs then he said suddenly
they are quite safe and then he added for stellas behalf they
are quite safe miss etheridge
stella turned her face toward him
i am not afraid i should as soon think of biting them as they would
dream of biting me wouldnt you and she drew the mastiffs great
head on to her lap where it lay with his big eyes looking up at her
piteously as he licked her hand
great heavens what a herd of them said mr etheridge who loved
dogson canvas
i ought not to have brought them said lord leycester but they will
be quite quiet and will do no harm i assure you
i dont care if they dont bite my niece said mr etheridge
there is no fear of that he said quietly or i should not allow
her to go near them please go on with your work or i shall think i am
a nuisance
mr etheridge waved him to a chair
wont you sit down he said
lord leycester shook his head
i have come to ask you a favor he said
mr etheridge nodded
what is it
lord leycester laughed his rare laugh
i am trembling in my shoes he said my tongue cleaves to my mouth
with nervousness
the old painter glanced round at him and his face relaxed into a smile
as his eyes rested on the bold handsome face and easy grace of the
speaker
yes you look excessively frightened he said what is it
it was noticeable that excepting in his first greeting the old man
had not given him the benefit of his title he had known him when
leycester had been a boy running in and out of the cottage always
followed by a pack of dogs and generally doing some mischief
i want you to do a little scene for me
the old man groaned and looked at his picture firmly
you know the glade in the woods opening out opposite the small island
i want you to paint it
i am sorry began the old man
lord leycester went on interrupting him gently
have you seen it lately he said and as he spoke stella came into
the room enticing the mastiff after her with a handful of biscuits
she had taken from the cheffonier it is very beautiful it is the
loveliest bit on the whole river right up from the stream it stretches
green with the young spring leaves to the sky above the hill in the
open space between the trees the primroses have made a golden carpet i
saw two kingfishers sailing up it as i stood and looked this morning
and as i looked i thought how well how delightfully you would put it
on canvas think the bright green the golden foreground the early
summer sky to crown the whole and reflected in the river running
below
mr etheridge paused in his work and listened and stella kneeling
over the dog listened too with downbent face and wondered how the
painter could stand so firm and obstinate
to her the voice sounded like the sweetest music set to some poem she
saw the picture as he drew it and in her heart the music of the words
and voice found an echoing harmony
forgotten was the other mans warning vain it would have been if he
had repeated it at that moment as well associate the darkness of a
winters night with the bright gladness of a summers morning as think
of evil in connection with that noble face and musical voice
mr etheridge paused but he shook his head
very fine very temptingly put you are a master of words leycester
but i am immovable as a rock indeed your eloquence is wasted it is
not an impressionable man whom you address i james etheridge am on
this picture i am lost in my work lord leycester
you will not do it
the old man smiled
i will not to another man i should present an excuse and mask my
refusal with you anything but a simple no is of no avail
lord leycester smiled and turned away
i am sorry he said i meant it for a present to my sister lilian
again stellas eyes turned toward him this maninfamous
the old man put down his brush and turned upon him
why didnt you say so at first he said
lord leycester smiled
i wanted to see if you would do something for mefor myself he
said with infinite naivete
you want it for lady lilian said mr etheridge i will do it of
course
i shant say thank you said lord leycester i have nothing to thank
you for she shall do that when will you come
next weeknext month
now at once said lord leycester stretching out his hand with a
peculiar gesture which struck stella by its infinite grace
the old man groaned
i thought so i thought so it would always be now at once with you
the spring wont wait for you the green of those leaves is changing
now very slowly but surely as we speak in a week it will be gone
and with it halfall the beauty will go too you will come now will
you not
mr etheridge looked round with comical dismay then he laughed
lord leycesters laugh chimed in and he turned to stella with the air
of a man who has conquered and needs no more words
you see said mr etheridge that is the way i am led like a pig to
market will i or will i not and the sketch will take me how long
a few hours
and there will be all the things to drag down
lord leicester strode to an oldfashioned cabinet
i will carry them and yourself into the bargain if you like
then with his hand upon the cabinet he stopped short and turned to
stella
i beg your pardoni am always sinning i forgot that there was now
a presiding spirit i am so used to taking liberties with your uncles
belongings i know where all his paraphernalia is so well that
stella rose and smiled at them
your knowledge is deeper than my uncles then she said do not beg
pardon of me
may i he said and he opened the cabinet and took out the
sketchingpad and colorbox then with some difficulty he
disentangled a folding campstool from a mass of artistic litter in a
corner and then prepared to depart
mr etheridge watched these proceedings with a rueful countenance but
seeing that resistance had long passed out of his power he said
where is my hat stella i must go i suppose
lord leycester opened the door for her and she went out followed by
all the dogs and fetched the soft felt hat holding it by the very
tips of her fingers
with a sigh mr etheridge dropped it on his head
give me some of the things he said but lord leycester declined
not one he said laughing and mr etheridge without another word
walked out
lord leycester stood looking at stella a wistful eagerness in his eyes
i have gone so far he said that i am emboldened to venture still
further will you come too
stella started and an eager light flashed for a moment in her eyes
then she held out her hands and laughed
i have to make a pudding she said
he looked at the white arms and then at her with an intensified
eagerness
if you knew how beautiful the morning ishow grand the river
looksyou would let the pudding go
stella shook her head
he inclined his head too highly bred to persist
i am so sorry he said simply i am sorry now that i have gained my
way i thought that you would have come
stella stood silent and with something like a sigh put down the
things and held out her hand but as he took the finger which she gave
him his face brightened and a light came into his eyes
are you still firm
i would not desert the pudding for anything my lord said stella
naively
at the my lord a slight shade covered his face but it went again
instantly as he said
well then will you come when the inevitable pudding is made there
he said eagerly and still holding her hand he drew her to the window
and pointed with his whip theres the place it is not farjust
across the meadows and through the first gate do you see it
yes said stella gently withdrawing her hand
and you will come he asked his eyes fixed on hers with their intent
earnestness
at that instant the wordthe odious wordinfamous rang in her ears
and her face paled he noticed the sudden pallor and his eyes grew
dark with earnest questioning
i see he said quietly you will not come
what was it that moved her with a sudden impulse she raised her eyes
and looked at him steadily
yes i will come she said
he inclined his head without a word called to the dogs and passed out
stella stood for a moment looking after them then she went into the
kitchennot laughing nor singing but with a strange gravity a
strange feeling had got possession of her
she felt as if she was laboring under some spell charmed is an often
misused word but it is the right word to describe the sensation
was it his face or his voice that haunted her as she stood absently
looking down at the table simple words short and commonplace which
he had used rang in her ears with a new meaning
mrs penfold stood and regarded her in curious astonishment she was
getting used to stellas quickly changing moods but the sudden change
bewildered her
let me do it miss stella she pleaded but stella shook her head
firmly not by one inch would she swerve from her cause for all the
beautiful voice and noble face
in rapt silence she finished her work then she went upstairs and put
on her hat and came down as she passed out of the house and down the
path the mastiff leaped the gate and bounded toward her and the next
moment she saw lord leycester seated on a stile
he dropped down and came toward her
how quick you have been he said i thought a pudding was a mystery
which demanded an immensity of time
stella looked up at him her dark brows drawn to a straight line
you waited for me she said
no he said simply i came back i did not like to think that you
should come alone
stella was silent
are you angry he asked in a low voice
stella was silent for a moment then she looked at him frankly
no she said
if she had but said yes and turned back but the path all beautiful
with the bright coloring of spring stretched before her and she had
no thought of turning back no thought or suspicion of the dark and
perilous land toward which she was traveling by his side
already the glamour of love was falling upon her like the soft mist of
a summer evening blindly passively she was moving toward the fate
which the gods had prepared for her
chapter vii
side by side they walked across the meadows the larks rising before
them and soaring up to the heavens with a burst of song the river
running in silvery silence to the sea the green trees waving gently in
the summer breeze and above them the long stretching gray masonry of
wyndward hall
lord leycester was strangely silent for some minutes since that are
you angry and stella as she walked by his side stooping now and
again to gather a cowslip glanced up at his face and wondered whether
her uncle could be mistaken whether they were not all deceived in
thinking the quiet graceful creature with the beautiful face and
dreamy almost womanly soft eyes wild and reckless and desperate and
altogether bad she almost forgot how she had seen him on that first
night of their meeting with his whip upraised and the sudden fire of
anger in his eyes
presently he spoke so suddenly that stella who had been lost in her
speculations respecting him started guiltily
i have been wondering he said how mr etheridge takes the change
which your presence must make in the cottage
stella looked up with surprise then she smiled
he bears it with admirable resignation she said with that air of
meek archness which her uncle found so amusing
lord leycester looked down at her
that is a rebuke for the presumption of my remark he said
no said stella
i did not mean to be presumptuous think your uncle has lived the
whole of his life alone the life of a solitary a hermit suddenly
there enters into that life a young and beaua young girl full of the
spirit of youth and its aspirations it must make a great change
as i said says stella he bears it with pious fortitude then she
added in a lower voice he is very good to me
he could not be otherwise was the quiet response i mean that he
could not be anything but good gentle and loving with any living
thing i have known him since i was a boy he added he was always
the same always living a life of dreams i wonder whether he takes you
as a dream
a very substantial and responsible one then said stella with her
little laugh one that lasts through the daytime
he looked at her with that strange intent look which she had learned
that she could not meet
and you he said
i said stella though she knew what he meant
he nodded
how do you like the changethis still quiet life in the thames
valley are you tired of it already will you pine for all the gayeties
you have left
stella looked up at himhis eyes were still fixed on hers
i have left no gayeties she said i left a bare and horrid school
that was as unlike home as the desert of sahara is like this lovely
meadow how do i feel as if i had been translated to paradiseas if
i who was beginning to think that i was alone in the world i had no
business to be in had found some one friend to love
she paused and he glancing at the black waistband to her white dress
said with the tenderest most humble voice
i beg your pardon will you forgive mei did not know
and his voice broke
stella looked up at him with a smile shining through the unshed tears
howwhy should you know yes i was quite alone in the world my
father died a year ago
forgive me he murmured and he laid his hand with a feathers weight
on her arm i implore you to forgive me it was cruel and thoughtless
no said stella how should you know
if i had been anything better than an unthinking brute i might have
guessed
there was a moments pause then stella spoke
yes it is paradise i had no idea england was like this they called
it the land of fogs
you have not seen london on a november evening he said with a
laugh most foreigners come over to england and put up at some hotel
at the westend and judge the whole land by the london samplevery
few come even so far as this you have not been to london
i passed through it said stella that is all but i heard a great
deal about it last night she added with a smile
yes he said with great interestlast night
yes at mrs hamiltons she was kind enough to ask me to an evening
party and one of the guests took great pains to impress me with the
importance and magnificence of london
he looked at her
may i ask who she was he said
it was not a she but a gentleman it was mr adelstone
lord leycester thought a moment
adelstone adelstone i dont know him
before she was quite aware of it the retort slipped from her lips
he knows you
he looked at her with a thoughtful smile
does he i dont remember him stay yes isnt he a relation of mr
fieldings
his nephew said stella and feeling the dark penetrating eyes on
her she blushed faintly it annoyed her and she struggled to suppress
it but the blush came and he saw it
i remember him now he said a tall thin dark man a lawyer i
believe yes i remember him and he told you about london
yes said stella and as she remembered the conversation of a few
hours ago her color deepened he is very amusing and wellinformed
and he took pity on my ignorance in the kindest way i was very
grateful
there was something in her tone that made him look at her questioningly
i think he said your gratitude is easily earned
oh no she retorted i am the most ungrateful of beings isnt that
uncle sitting there she added quickly to change the subject
he looked up
yes he is hard at work i did not think i should have won him it was
my sisters name that worked the magic charm
he is fond of your sister said stella thoughtfully
his eyes were on her in an instant
he has spoken of her he said
stella could have bitten her tongue out for the slip
yes she said hehe told me about heri asked him whose house it
was upon the hills
meaning the hall he said pointing with his whip
yes and he told me i knew by the way he spoke of your sister that he
was fond of her her name is lilian is it not
yes he said lilian and the name left his lips with soft
tenderness i think every one who knows her loves her this picture is
for her
stella glanced up at his face anything less imperious at that moment
it would be impossible to imagine
lady lilian is fond of pictures she said
yes he said she is devoted to art in all its forms yes that
little sketch will give her more pleasure thanthani scarcely know
what to say what are women most fond of
stella laughed
diamonds are they not
are you fond of them he said i think not
why not she retorted why should i not have the attributes of my
sex yes i am fond of diamonds i am fond of everything that is
beautiful and costly and rare i remember once going to a ball at
florence
he looked at her
only to see it she exclaimed i was too young to be seen and
they took me in a gallery overlooking the great salon and i watched
the great ladies in their beautiful dresses and shining gems and i
thought that i would give all the world to be like one of them and the
thought spoiled my enjoyment i remember coming away crying you see it
was so dark and solitary in the great gallery and i felt so mean and
insignificant and she laughed
he was listening with earnest interest every word she said had a charm
for him he had never met any girlany womanlike her so frank and
openminded listening to her was like looking into a crystal lake in
which everything is revealed and all is bright and pure
and are you wiser now he asked
not one whit she replied i should like now less than then
to be shut up in a dark gallery and look on at others enjoying
themselves isnt that a confession of an envious and altogether wicked
disposition
yes he assented with a strange smile barely escaping from under
his tawny mustache i should be right in prophesying all sorts of bad
endings to you
as he spoke he opened the gate for her driving the dogs back with a
crack of his whip so that she might pass firsta small thing but
characteristic of him
the painter looked up
keep those dogs off my back leycester he said well stella have
you concocted your poison
stella went and looked over his shoulder
yes uncle she said
you have been long enough to make twenty indigestible compounds he
said gazing at the view he was sketching
stella bent her head to hide the blush which rose as she remembered
how slowly they had walked across the meadows
how are you getting on said lord leycester
the old man grunted
pretty well better than i shall now you have come to fidget about
lord leycester laughed
a pretty plain hint that our room is desired more than our company
miss etheridge can we not vanish into space
stella laughed and sank down on the grass
it is uncles way of begging us to stay she said
lord leycester laughed and sending the dogs off flung himself down
almost at her feet
did i exaggerate he said pointing his whip at the view
not an atom replied stella it is beautifulbeautiful and that is
all that one can find to say
i wish you would be content to say it and not insist upon my painting
it replied mr etheridge
lord leycester sprang to his feet
that is the last straw we will not remain to be abused miss
etheridge he said
stella remained immovable he came and stood over her looking down at
her with wistful eagerness in silence
what lovely woods she said you were right they are carpeted with
primroses we have none in our meadow
would you like to go and get some he asked
stella turned her face up to him
yes but i dont care to swim across
he smiled and went down to the bank unfastened a boat and leaping
into it called to her
stella sprang to her feet with the impulsive delight of a girl at the
sight of a boat when she had expected nothing better than rushes
is it a boatreally she exclaimed
come and see he said
she went down to the waters edge and looked at it
how did it come there she asked
i pay a fairy to drop a boat from the skies whenever i want it
i see said stella gravely
he laughed
how did you think i came across did you think i swam and he
arranged a cushion
she laughed
i forgot that how stupid of me
will you step in he said
stella looked back at her uncle and hesitated a moment
he will assure you that i shall not drown you he said
i am not afraiddo you think i am afraid she said scornfully
yes i think that at this moment you are trembling with nervousness
and dread
she put her foothe could not help seeing how small and shapely it
wason the gunwale and he held out his hand and took hers it was
well he did so for the boat was only a small lightly built gig and
her sudden movement had made it rock
as it was she staggered slightly and he had to take her by the arm
so with one hand grasping her hand and the other her arm he held
her for a momentfor longer than a moment then he placed her on the
cushion and seating himself took up the sculls and pushed off
stella leant back and of course dropped one hand in the water not one
woman out of twenty who ever sat in a boat can resist that impulse to
have closer communion with the water and he pulled slowly across the
stream
the sun shone full upon them making their way a path of rippling gold
and turning stellas hair into a rich brown
little wonder that as he sat opposite her his eyes should rest on her
face and less that thus resting its exquisite beauty and freshness
and purity should sink into the soul of him to whom beauty was the one
thing worth living for
unconscious of his rapt gaze stella leant back her eyes fixed on the
water her whole attention absorbed by its musical ripple as it ran
through her fingers
in silence he pulled the sculls slowly and noiselessly he would not
have spoken and broken the spell for worlds before him as he looked
upon her rose the picture of which he had spoken to his sister last
night
but more beautiful he musedmore beautiful how lost she is she
has forgotten meforgotten everything oh heaven if one were to
waken her into love
for an instant at the thought the color came into his face and the
fire to his eyes then a half guilty half repentful feeling struck
through him
no it would be cruelcruel and yet to see the azure light shining
in those eyesto see those lips half parted with the breath of a great
passion would be worthwhat it would make amends for all that a man
might suffer though he died the next moment if those eyes smiled if
those lips were upturned for love of him
so lost were they that the touching of the boat and the bank made them
start
so soon murmured stella how beautiful it is i think i was
dreaming
and i know that i was he said with a subtle significance as he
rose and held out his hand but stella sprang lightly on shore without
accepting it he tied up the boat and followed her she was already on
her knee picking the yellow primroses
without a word he followed her example sometimes they were so near
together that she could feel his breath stirring her hairso near that
their hands almost met
at last she sank on to the mossy ground with a laugh and pointing to
her hat which was full of the spring earthstars said laughingly
what ruthless pillage do not pick any more it is wanton waste
are you sure you have plenty he said why hesitate when there are
such millions
no no more she said i feel guilty already
he glanced at the handful he had gathered and she saw the glance and
laughed
you do not know what to do with those you have and still want more
see you must tie them in bundles
show me he said and he threw himself down beside her
she gathered them up into bundles and tied them with a long stem of
fern and he tried to do the same but his hands white and slender as
they were were not so deft as hers and he held the huge bundle to her
you must tie it he said
she laughed and put the fern round but it broke and the primroses
fell in a golden shower over their hands they both made a grasp at
them and their hands met
for a moment stella laughed then the laugh died away for he still
held her hand and the warmth of his grasp seemed stealing upward to
her heart with something like an effort she drew her hand away and
sprang to her feet
ii must go she said uncle will wonder where i have gone and
she looked down at the water with almost frightened eagerness
he will know you are here quite safe he said wait do not go this
moment up there above our heads we can see the river stretching away
for miles it is not a step will you come
she hesitated a moment then she turned and walked beside him between
the trees
a step or two as he said and they reached a sort of plateau crowned
by a mossgrown rock in which some rough steps were hewn he sprang up
the steps and reached the top then bent down and held out his hand
stella hesitated a moment
it will repay your trouble come he said and she put her hand in
his and her foot on the first step and he drew her up beside him
look he said
an exclamation of delight broke from stellas lips
you are not sorry you came
i did not think it would be so lovely she said
he stood beside her not looking at the view but at her dark eyes
dilating with dreamy raptureat her halfparted lips and the sweet
clearcut profile presented to him
she turned suddenly and to hide the look of admiration he raised his
hand and pointed out the objects in the view
and what is that little house there asked stella
that is one of the lodges he said
one of the lodgesone of your own lodges you mean she asked
he nodded lightly yes
and all this between here and that lodge belongs to you
no not an inch he said laughing to my father
it is a great deal she said
too much for one man you think he said with a smile a great many
other people think so too i dont know what you would think if you
knew how much we wyndwards have managed at one time or the other to lay
our acquiring grasp on this is one of our smallest estates he said
simply
stella looked at the view dreamily
one of the smallest yes i have heard that you are very rich it must
be very nice
i dont know he said you see one cannot tell until one has been
poor i dont think there is anything in it i dont think one is any
the happier there is always something left to long for
she turned her dark eyes on him with a smile of incredulity
what can you possibly have to long for she said
he looked at her with a strange smile then suddenly his face grew
grave and wistfulalmost sad as it seemed to her
you cannot guess and i cannot tell you but believe me that as i
stand here there is an aching void in my heart and i do long for
something very earnestly
the voice was like music deep and thrilling she listened and wondered
and you should be so happy she said almost unconsciously
happy he echoed and his dark eyes rested on hers with a strange
expression that was halfmocking halfsad do you know what the poets
say
count no man happy till he dies do you mean said stella
yes he said i do not think i know what happiness means i have
been pursuing it all my life sometimes have been within reach of it
but it has always evaded mealways slipped from my grasp sometimes
i have resolved to let it goto pursue it no longer but fate has
decreed that man shall always be seeking for the unattainablethat he
who once looks upon happiness with the eyes of desire who stretches
out his hands toward her shall pursue her to the end
andbut surely some get their desire
some he said to find that the prize is not worth the race they
have run for it to find that they have wearied of it when it is
gained to find that it is no prize at all but a delusive blank all
dead sea fruit that turns to dust upon the lips
not all surely not all she murmured strangely moved by his words
no not all he said with a hidden light in his eyes that she
did not see to some there comes a moment when they know that
happinessreal true happinesslies just beyond their grasp and the
case of rich men is more to be pitied than all others what would you
say if i told you that it was mine
she looked up at him with a gentle smile not on her lips but in her
eyes
i should say that i was very sorry she murmured i should say that
you deserved she stopped short smitten by sudden remembrance of
all she had heard of him
he filled up the pause with a laugh a laugh such as she had not heard
upon his lips till now
you were right to stop he said if i get all the happiness i
deservewell no man will envy me
let us go down now said stella gently my uncle
he leapt down and held up his hand
chapter viii
stella put hers into it but reluctantly and tried to spring but her
dress caught and she slipped forward
she would have fallen but that he was on the alert to save her quite
simply and naturally he put his arms round her and lifted her down
only for a moment he held her in his embrace her panting form close to
his her face almost resting on his shoulders but that moment roused
the blood in his fiery heart and her face went pale
are you hurt he murmured
no no she said and she slipped out of his arms and stood a little
away from him the color coming and going in her face it was the first
time that any mans arms save her fathers had ever encircled her
are you quite sure he repeated
quite she said then she laughed what would have happened if i had
slipped
you would have sprained your ankle he said
sprained my ankle really she repeated with open eyes
yes and i should have had to carry you down to the boat he said
slowly
she looked away from him
i am glad i did not slip
and i he said amglad also
she stooped and picked up the primroses and ran down the slope her
cheeks aflame a feeling that was something like shame and yet too
full of a strange indefinable joy to be sullen shame took possession
of her
with light feet her hat swinging in her hand she threaded her way
between the trees and sprang on to the grassy road beside the river
bank
he did not follow so quickly but stood for a moment looking at her
his face pale his eyes full of a strange wistful restlessness
then stella heard his step firm and masterful behind her a sudden
impulse tempted her sorely to jump into the boat and push offshe
could pull a pair of scullsand her hand was on the edge of the boat
when she heard the sound of bells and paused with astonishment
looking up she saw a tiny phton drawn by a pair of creamwhite ponies
coming along the road it was the bells on their harness that she had
heard
they came along at a fair pace and stella saw that the phton was
being driven by a coachman in darkbrown livery but the next moment
all her attention was absorbed by the young girl who sat beside him
she was so fair so lovely so ethereal looking that stella was
spellbound
a book was in her handungloved and small and white as a childsbut
she was not reading she held it so loosely that as the phton came
along the top of the bank which hid stella the book dropped from the
lax grasp of the white fingers
the girl uttered an exclamation and stella obeying one of her sudden
impulses sprang lightly up the bank and picking up the book held it
toward her
her appearance was so sudden that lady lilian was startled and for a
moment the pale face was dyed with a faint color even after the moment
had passed she sat speechless and the surprise in her eyes gave place
to a frank generous admiration
oh thank youthank you she said how kind of you it was so
stupid of me to drop it but where did you come fromthe clouds and
there was a delicious hint of flattery in the look that accompanied the
words
quite the reverse said stella with her open smile i was standing
below there by the boat
and she pointed
oh said lady lilian i did not see you
you were looking the other way said stella drawing back to allow
the carriage to proceed but lady lilian seemed reluctant to go and
made no sign to the coachman who sat holding the reins like an image
of stone apparently deaf and dumb
for a few strokes of times scythe the two girls looked at each
otherthe one with the pale face and the blue eyes regarding the
fresh healthful beauty of the other with sad wistful gaze then lady
lilian spoke
what beautiful primroses you have been gathering them on the slopes
with a suggestion of a sigh
yes said stella will you take them
oh no no i could not think of robbing you
stella smiled with her characteristic archness
it is i who have been the thief i have been taking what did not
belong to me you will take these
lady lilian was too well bred to refuse besides she thirsted for them
if you will give them to me and will not mind picking some more she
said
stella laid the bunch on the costly sables which wrapped the frail
figure
lady lilian put them to her face with a caressing gesture you are
like me fond of flowers she said
stella nodded yes
then there was a pause above them unseen by lilian forgotten by
stella stood lord leycester
he was watching and waiting with a strange smile he could read the
meaning in his sisters eyes she was longing to know more of the
beautiful girl who had sprang like a fairy to her side
with a faint flush lady lilian said
youyou are a stranger are you not i mean you do not live here
yes said stella i liveand she smiled and pointed to the cottage
across the meadowthere
lady lilian started and lord leycester seized the moment and coming
down quietly stood by stellas side
leycester exclaimed lilian with a start of surprise
he smiled into her eyes his strange masterful irresistible smile it
was as if he had said did i not tell you can you withstand her
but aloud he said
let me make the introduction in due form this is miss etheridge
lilian miss etheridge this is my sister as the french philosopher
said know each other
lady lilian held out her hand
i am very glad she said
stella took the thin white hand and held it for a moment then lady
lilian looked from one to the other
lord leycester interpreted the glance at once
miss etheridge has intrusted herself on the watery deep with me he
said we came across to gather flowers leaving mr etheridge to paint
there
and he waved his hand across the river
lady lilian looked
i see she saidi see and he is painting is he not clever how
proud you must be of him
stellas eyes grew dark it was the one word wanting to draw them
together she said not a word
your uncle and i are old friends lady lilian continued sometime
whenwhen i am stronger i am coming to see himwhen the weather
gets warmer stella glanced at the frail form clad in sables with
a moistened eyei am going to spend a long afternoon among the
pictures he is always so kind and patient and explains them all to
me but as i am not able to come to you you will come and see me
will you not
there was a moments silence lord leycester stood looking over the
river as if waiting for stellas reply
stella looked up
i shall be very glad she said and lord leycester drew a breath
almost of relief
you will will you not said lady lilian with a sweet smile
yes i will come said stella almost solemnly
you will find me poor company said the daughter of the great earl
with meek humility i see so little of the world that i grow dull and
ignorant but i shall be so glad to see you and she held out her hand
stella took it in her warm soft fingers
i will come she said
lady lilian looked at the coachman who though his eyes were fixed in
quite another direction seemed to see the glance for he touched the
horses with the whip
goodbye she said goodbye
then as the phton moved on she called out in her low musical
voice that was a low echo of her brothers
oh leycester lenore has come
leycester raised his hat
very well he said goodbye
stella stood a moment looking after her strangely enough the last
words rang in her ears with a senseless kind of insistence and
emphasis lenore has come she found herself repeating them mentally
recalling herself she turned swiftly to lord leycester
how beautiful she is she said almost in a whisper
he looked at her with gratitude in his eloquent eyes
yes
so beautiful and so kind stella murmured and the tears sprang to
her eyes i can see her face now i can hear her voice i do not
wonder that you love her as you do
how do you know that i love her he said brothers generally
stella stopped him with a gesture
no man with a heart warmer than a stone could help loving her
and so you agree that my heart is warmer than a stone thank you for
that at least he said with a smile that was not at all unselfish
stella looked at him
let us go now she said see uncle is getting his things together
not without the primroses he said lilian will break her heart if
you go without any let me get some and he went up the slope
stella stood in thought the sudden meeting with the fairylike
creatures had filled her with strange thoughts she understood now
that rank and money are not all that is wanted for earthly happiness
so lost in thought was she that she did not hear the sound of a horse
coming along the mossy road though the animal was coming at a great
pace
lord leycesters ears were freer or quicker however for he caught the
sound and turned round
turned round in time to see a huge bay horse ridden by a tall thin
dark young man almost upon the slim form standing with its back to it
with something like an oath on his lips he dropped the flowers and
with one spring stood between her and the horse and seizing the bridle
with both hands threw the beast with sheer force on to its haunches
the rider had been staring at the river and was taken by surprise so
complete that as the horse rose on its legs he was thrown from the
saddle
stella alarmed by the noise turned and swerved out of the path
and so they were grouped lord leycester pale with furious passion
still holding the reins and forcing the horse in an iron grip and the
erstwhile rider lying huddled up on the mossy road
he lay still only for a moment however the next he was on his feet
and advancing toward lord leycester it was jasper adelstone
his face was deadly pale making by contrast his small eyes black as
coals
what do you mean he exclaimed furiously and halfunconsciously he
raised his whip
it was an unlucky gesture for it was all that was needed to rouse the
devil in lord leycesters breast
with one little irresistible gesture he seized the whip arm and the
whip and flinging the owner to the ground again with one movement
broke the whip and flung it on the top of him with the other
it was all done in a second with all the will in the world stella had
no time to interpose before the rash act was accomplished but now she
sprang between them
lord leycester she cried pale and horrorstricken as she gazed
into his face white and working with passion all its beauty gone
and with the mask of a fury in its place lord leycester
at the sound of her voicepleading expostulating rebukinga shiver
ran through him his hand fell to his side and still holding the now
plunging and furious horse with a grip of steel he stood humbly before
her
not so jasper adelstone with a slow sinuous movement he rose
and shook himself and glared at him speechless from the sheer
breathlessness of furious hate he stood and looked at the tall
velvetclad figure
stella was the first to break the silence
oh my lord she said
at the sound of her reproachful voice lord leycesters face paled
forgive me he said humbly i begi crave your forgiveness but i
thought you were in danger you wereyou were then at the thought
his fiery passion broke out again and he turned to the silent
whitefaced jasper what the devil do you mean by riding in that
fashion
jasper adelstones lips moved and at last speech came
you shall answer for this lord leycester
it was the worst word he could have said
in an instant all lord leycesters repentances fled
with a smothered oath on his lips he advanced toward him
what is that all you have to say do you know you miserable wretch
that you nearly rode over this ladyyes rode over her answer for it
confound you and he raised his arm
but stella all her wits on the qui vive was in time and her
own arms were wound about his on which the muscles stood thick and
prominentlike iron bands
with a gesture he became calm again and there was a mute prayer for
pardon in his eyes as he looked at her
do not be afraid he murmured between his lips i will not hurt
him no no
then he pointed to the horse
mount sir and get out of my sight stop and the fiery passion
broke out again no by heaven you shall not until you have begged
the ladys pardon
no no said stella
but i say yes said lord leycester his eyes blazing is every
tailor to ride through the chase and knock down whom he will ask for
pardon sir or
jasper stood looking from one to the other
no no said stella it was all an accident please pray do not say
another word mr adelstone i beg you will go without another word
jasper adelstone hesitated for a moment
miss stella he said hoarsely
alas it was oil on the smoldering fire
miss stella exclaimed lord leycester who gave you the right to
address this lady by her christian name sir
jasper bit his lip
miss etheridge you cannot doubt that i am heartily sorry that this
unpleasant contretemps should have been caused by my carelessness i
was riding carelessly
like an idiot broke in lord leycester
and did not see you no harm would have resulted however if this
manif lord leycester wyndward had not with brutal force thrown me
from the saddle i should have seen you in time and as i say no harm
would have been done all that has occurred is this manlord leycester
wyndwardsfault again i beg your pardon
and he bent his head before her but as he did so a malignant gleam
shot out of his eyes in the direction of the tall stalwart figure and
white passionate face
no no there is no occasion said stella trembling i do not want
you to beg my pardon it was only an accident you did not expect to
see anyone hereiioh i wish i had not come
lord leycester started
do not say that he murmured
then aloud
here is your horse sir mount him and go home and thank your stars
the lady has escaped without a broken limb
jasper stood a moment looking at him then with another inclination of
the head he slowly mounted the horse
lord leycester his passion gone stood calm and motionless for a
moment then raised his hat with an oldworld gesture
goodday to you and remember to ride more carefully in future
jasper adelstone looked down at him with a malignant smile on his thin
lips
goodday my lord i shall remember i am not one to forget no i am
not one to forget and striking spurs into the horse he rode off
chapter ix
who is lenore uncle
it was the evening of the same daya day never to be forgotten by
stella a day marked with a white stone in her mental calendar never
would she be able to look upon a field of primroses never hear the
music of the river running over the weir without remembering this
morning the first she had spent with lord leycester
it was evening now and the twothe painter and the girlwere sitting
by the open window looking out into the gloaming he lost in memory
she going over and over again the incidents of the morning from the
visit of mr jasper adelstone to his encounter with lord leycester
it was strange it was almost phenomenalfor stella was frankness and
candor itselfthat she had said nothing of the encounter to her uncle
once or twice she had opened her lipsonce at dinner and once again
as she sat beside him leaning her arm on his chair while he smoked his
pipeshe had opened her lips to tell him of that sudden outburst of
fury on the part of lord leycesterthat passionate rage which proved
all that the painter had said of his hot temper to be true but she had
found some difficulty in the recital which had kept her silent
she had told him of her walk in the woods had told him of her meeting
with lady lilian but of that passionate encounter between the two men
she said nothing
when jasper had ridden on pale and livid with suppressed passion lord
leycester had stood looking at her in silence now as she sat looking
into the gloaming she saw him in her minds eye still his beautiful
eyes eloquent with remorse and humility his clearcut lip quivering
with the sense of his weakness
will you forgive me he said at last and that was all without
another word he had offered to help her into the boat help which
stella had disregarded and had rowed her across to her uncle without
a word but with the same penitent imploring look in his eyes he
raised his hat and left herhad gone home to the hall to his sister
lady lilian and to lenore
ever since she had heard the name drop softly from lady lilians lips
it had rung in her ears there was a subtle kind of charm about it that
half fascinated half annoyed her
and now leaning her head on her arm and with her dark eyes fixed on
the stars which glittered merrily in the sky she put the question
who is lenore uncle
he stirred in his chair and looked at her absently
lenore lenore i dont know stella and yet the name sounds
familiar where did you hear it its scarcely fair to spring a
question like that on me you might ask me who is julia louisa anna
maria
stella laughed softly
i heard it this morning uncle lady lilian told her brother as she
left us that lenore had come
ah yes he said now i know so she has come has she who is
lenore and he smiled there is scarcely another woman in england who
would need to ask that question stella
no she said turning her eyes upon him with surprise why is she
so famous
exactly yes that is just the word she is famous
for what uncle is she a great actress painter musicianwhat
she is something that the world nowadays reckons far above any of
the classes you have named stellashe is a great beauty
oh is that all said stella curtly
all he echoed amused
yes and she nodded it seems so easy
so easy and he laughed
yes she continued so very easy if you happen to be born so there
is no merit in it and is that all she is
he was staggered by her sang froid for a moment
well i was scarcely fair perhaps as you say it is very easy to be
a great beautyif you are onebut it is rather difficult if you are
not but lenore is something more than thatshe is an enchantress
thats better remarked stella i like that and how does she
enchant does she keep tame snakes and play music to them or
mesmerize people or what
the painter laughed again with great enjoyment at her naivete
you are quite a cynic stella where did you learn the trick from
your father or is it a natural gift no she does not keep tame
snakes and i dont know that she has acquired the art of mesmerism
but she can charm for all that first she is really and truly very
beautiful
tell me what she is like interrupted stella softly
the old man paused a moment to light his pipe
she is very fair he said
i know said stella dreamily and with a little smile with yellow
hair and blue eyes and a pink and white complexion and blue veins and
a tiny mouth
all wrong he said with a laugh you have womanlike pictured
a china doll lenore is as unlike a china doll as it is possible to
imagine she has golden hair it is truebut golden hair not yellow
there is a difference then her eyes are not blue they are violet
violet
violet he repeated gravely i have seen them as violet as the
flowers that grow on the bank over there her mouth is not small there
was never yet a woman worth a fig who had a small mouth it is rather
large than otherwise but then it isa mouth
expressive said stella quietly
eloquent he corrected the sort of mouth that can speak volumes
with a curve of the lip you think i exaggerate wait until you see
her
i dont think said stella slowly that i am particularly desirous
of seeing her uncle it reminds we of what they say of naplessee
naples and die see lenore and die
he laughed
well it is not altogether false many have seen hermany men and
been ready to die for love of her
stella laughed softly
she must be very beautiful for you to talk like this uncle she is
charming too
yes she is charming he said low with a charm that one is bound
to admit at once and unreservedly
but what does she do asked stella with a touch of feminine
impatience
what does she not he answered there is scarcely an accomplishment
under the sun or moon that she has not at her command in a word
stella lenore is the outcome of the higher civilization she is the
type of our latest requirement which demands more than mere beauty
and will not be satisfied with mere cleverness she rides beautifully
and fearlessly she plays and sings better than onehalf the women one
hears at concerts they tell me that no woman in london can dance with
greater grace and i have seen her land a salmon of twenty pounds with
all the skill of a scotch gillie
stella was silent a moment
you have described a paragon uncle how all her women friends must
detest her
he laughed
i think you are wrong i never knew a woman more popular with her sex
how proud her husband must be of her murmured stella
her husband what husband she is not married
stella laughed
not married such a perfection unmarried is it possible that mankind
can permit such a paragon to remain single uncle they must be afraid
of her
well perhaps they aresome of them he assented smiling no
he continued musingly she is not married lenore might have been
married long before this she has had many chances and some of them
great ones she might have been a duchess by this time if she had
chosen
and why did she not said stella such a woman should be nothing
less than a duchess it is a duchess whom you have described uncle
i dont know he said simply i dont think anyone knows perhaps
she does not know herself
stella was silent for a moment her imagination was hard at work
is she rich poorwhat uncle
i dont know rich i should think he answered
and what is her other name or has she only one name like a princess
or a church dignitary
her name is beauchamplady lenore beauchamp
lady repeated stella surprised she has a title then it was all
that was wanted
yes she is the daughter of a peer
what a happy woman she must beis she a woman or a girl though i
have imagined her a woman of thirty
he laughed
lady lenore isishe thought a momentjust twentythree
thats a woman said stella decidedly and this wonderful creature
is at the hall within sight of us tell me uncle do they keep her in
a glass case and only permit her to be seen as a curiosity at so much
a head they ought to do so you know
he laughed and his hand stroked her hair
what is it voltaire says stella he remarked if you want a woman
to hate another praise her to the first one
stellas face flushed hotly and she laughed with just a touch of scorn
hate i dont hate her unclei admire her i should like to see her
to touch herto feel for myself the wonderful charm of which you
speak i should like to see how she bears it it must be strange you
know to be superior to all ones kind
if she feels strange he said thoughtfully she does not show it
i never saw more perfect grace and ease than hers i do not think
anything in the world would ruffle her i think if she were on board
a ship that was going down inch by inch and she knew that she was
within say five minutes of death she would not flinch or drop for
a moment the smile which usually rests upon her lips that is her
charm stellathe perfect ease and perfect grace which spring from a
consciousness of her power
there was silence for a moment the painter had spoken in his usual
dreamy fashion more like communion with his own thoughts than a direct
address to his hearer and stella listening allowed every word to
sink into her mind
his description impressed her strongly more than she cared to admit
already so it seemed to her she felt fascinated by this beautiful
creature who appeared as perfect and faultless as one of the heathen
goddessessay diana
where does she live she asked dreamily
he smoked in silence for a moment
live i scarcely know she is everywhere in london in the season
visiting in country houses at other times there is not a house in
england where she would not be received with a welcome accorded to
princes it is rather strange that she should be down here just now
the season has commenced most of the visitors have left the hall some
of them to be in their places in parliament it is rather strange that
she should have come down at this time
stella colored and a feeling of vague irritation took possession of
herwhy she scarcely knew
i should think that everyone would be glad to come to wyndward hall at
any timeeven lady lenore beauchamp she said in a low voice
he nodded
wyndward hall is a fine place he said slowly but lady lenore is
accustomed towell to palaces there is not a ballroom in london
where her absence will not be noticed it is strange perhapsand he
smiledlady wyndward has some motive
some motive repeated stella turning her eyes toward him what
motive can she have
there is leycester he said musingly
leycester
the word was out of her lips before she was aware of it and a vivid
crimson dyed her face
lord leycester i mean
yes he answered nothing would please his mother more than to see
him marry and he could not marry a more suitable person than lenore
yes that must be it of course well he could not do better and as
for her though she has refused greater chances there is a charm in
being the future countess of wyndward which is not to be despised i
wonder whether he will fall into the trapif trap it is intended to
be
stella sat silent her head thrown back her eyes fixed on the stars
he saw she was very pale and there was a strange intent look in her
eyes there was also a dull aching in her heart which was scarcely
distinct enough for pain but which annoyed and shamed her what
could it matter to herto her stella etheridge the niece of a
poor painterwhom lord leycester future earl of wyndward married
nothing less than nothing but still the dull aching throbbed in her
heart and his face floated between her and the stars his voice rang
in her ears
how fortunate how blessed some women were here for instance was
this girl of twentythree beautiful famously beautiful noble and
reigning like a queen in the great world and yet the gods were not
satisfied but they must give her leycester wyndward for of course it
was impossible that he should resist her if she chose to put forth her
charm had not her uncle just said that she could fascinatehad she
not even evidently fascinated him the dreamer the artist the man who
had seen and who knew the world so well
for a moment she gave herself up to this reflection and to the dull
aching then with a gesture of impatience she rose so suddenly as to
startle the old man
what is the matter stella he asked
nothing nothing she said shall we have lights the room is so
dark and still and her voice broke for a moment
she went to the mantelshelf and lit a candle and as she did so she
looked up and saw her face reflected in the antique mirror and started
was that her facethat pale halfstartled visage looking at her so
sadly with a laugh she put the dark hair from her brow and gliding to
the organ began to play feverishly restlessly at first but presently
the music worked its charm and soothed her savage breast
yes she was savage she knew it she felt it this woman had
everything while she
the door opened and a stream of light broke in from the lamp carried by
mrs penfold
are you there miss stella oh yes there you are i thought it was
mr etheridge playing you dont often play like that theres a note
for you
a note for me exclaimed stella turning on her stool with amazement
mrs penfold smiled and nodded
yes miss and theres an answer please
stella took the note hesitatingly as if she half expected it to
contain a charge of explosive dynamite the envelope was addressed in
a thin beautiful hand to miss stella etheridge stella turned the
envelope over and started as she saw the arms stamped upon it she knew
it it was the wyndward crest
for a moment she sat looking down at it without offering to open
it then with an effort she tore it open slowly and read the note
enclosed
 dear miss etheridgewill you redeem the promise you made me this
 afternoon and come and see me will you ask mr etheridge to bring you
 to dine with them tomorrow at eight oclock i say them because i
 dine always alone but perhaps you will not mind coming to me after
 dinner for a little while do not let mr etheridge refuse as he
 generally does but tell him to bring you for my sake
     yours very truly
          lilian wyndward
stella read it and reread it as if she could not believe her senses
lady lilians invitation had sounded so vague that she had scarcely
remembered it and now here was a direct invitation to wyndham hall
and to dinner
well miss said mrs penfold
stella started
i will give you the answer directly she said
then she went across to her uncle and stood beside him the letter
in her hand he was lost in thought and quite unsuspicious of the
thunderclap preparing for him
uncle i have just got a letter
eh where from stella
from lady lilian
he looked up quickly
she has asked me to dinner tomorrow
no he said she put the letter in his hand read it will you my
dear he said
and she read it conscious that her voice trembled
well he said
well she repeated with a smile
he put his hand to his brow
to dinnertomorrow oh dear me well well you would like to go
and he looked up at her of course you would like to go
she looked down her face was delicately flushedher eyes shone
of course he said well say yes it is very kind you see
stella your wish is gratified almost as soon as you utter it you will
see your paragonlady lenore
she started and her face went pale
i have changed my mind she said in a low voice i find i dont
want to see her so badly as i thought i think i dont care to go
uncle
he stared at her she was still an enigma to him
nonsense child not care to see wyndward hall nonsense besides
its lady lilian we must go stella
she still stood with the letter in her hand
butbut unclei have nothing to wear
nothing to wear and he looked at her up and down
nothing fit for wyndward hall she said uncle i dont think i care
to go
he laughed gently
you will find something to wear between now and halfpast seven
tomorrow he said or my faith in mrs penfolds resources will be
shaken accept my dear
she went slowly to the table and wrote two linestwo lines only
 dear lady lilianwe shall be very glad indeed to come and see you
 tomorrow yours very truly
     stella etheridge
then she rang the bell and gave the note to mrs penfold
i am going to wyndward hall tomorrow she said with a smile and i
have got nothing to wear mrs penfold and she laughed
mrs penfold threw up her hands after the manner of her kind
to the hall miss stella tomorrow oh dear what shall we do then
she glanced at the armchair and beckoned stella out of the room
come upstairs then and let us see what we can manage to the hall
think of that and she threw up her head proudly
stella sat on a chair looking on with a smile while the scanty
wardrobe was overhauled
scanty as it was it contained everything that was needful for such use
as stella might ordinarily require but a dinner at the hall was quite
out of the ordinary at last after holding up dress after dress and
dropping it with a shake of the head mrs penfold took up a cream
sateen
thats very pretty said stella
but its only sateen exclaimed mrs penfold
it looks like satina little said stella by candlelight at least
and they have real satin and silks and velvets deplored mrs
penfold eagerly
nobody will notice me said stella consolingly it doesnt matter
mrs penfold glanced at her with a curious smile
will they not miss stella i dont know i think they will but it
must be this dress or nothing you cant go in a cotton or the black
merino and the muslin you wore the other night
wouldnt do at all said stella well make this sateen do mrs
penfold i think it looks very nice the lace is good isnt it
the lace said mrs penfold thoughtfully then her face brightened
wait a moment she said and she dropped the dress and hurried from
the room returning in a few moments with a small box speaking of
lace just reminded me miss stella that i had some by me it was made
by my motheri dont know whether its good and as she spoke she
opened the box and lifted some lace from the interior
why its point
point is it miss i didnt know then it is good
good exclaimed stellaits beautiful delicious heavenly and
will you lend it to me
no ill give it to you if you will take it miss stella said the
good woman with a proud smile
no no not for worlds but i will wear it if youll let me said
stella and she took a long strip and put it round her throat oh it
is beautiful beautiful it would make the poorest dress look handsome
i will take great care of it indeed i will
what nonsense dear miss stella how glad i am i thought of it and
it does look pretty now you wear it and she looked at the beautiful
face admiringly and youll want gloveslet me seeyes you have got
some cream gloves theyll go with the dress wont they now you go
downstairs and ill look the things out and tack the lace on going
to the hall im so glad miss stella
are you said stella softly as she went downstairs i dont know
whether im glad or sorry
chapter x
the great clock in the hall stables chimed the halfhourhalfpast
seven and the sound came floating down the valley
mr etheridge stood at the door clad in evening dress which
oldfashioned and wellworn as it was sat upon him with a gracious
air and made him look more distinguished than ever the fly was
waiting at the door and he glanced at his watch and took a step toward
the stairs when a light appeared above and a light step sounded over
his head the next moment a vision as it seemed to him floated into
sight and came down upon him
stella was in the cream sateen dressthe exquisite lace was clinging
round her slender graceful throatthere was a red rose in her
hair but it was not the dress nor the lace nor the rose even
which chained the painters eyeit was the lovely girlish face the
excitement had brought a dash of warm color in the clear olive cheeks
and a bright light into the dark eyes the lips were halfapart with a
smile and the whole face was eloquent of youths fresh tide of life
and spirits if they had had all howell and james stock to choose
from they could not have chosen a more suitable dressa more becoming
color the whole made a fitting frame for the girlish beauty
well uncle she said with a little blush
what have you done to yourself my child he said with simple
openeyed wonder
isnt sheisnt it beautiful murmured mrs penfold in an ecstasy
but then if it had been a morning cotton it would have been all the
same and she proceeded to wrap a woolen shawl round her so carefully
as if she was something that might be destroyed at too hard a touch
mind she has this wound round her like this when she comes out sir
and be sure and keep the window up
and dont let the air breathe on me or i shall melt uncle laughed
stella
upon my word im half disposed to think so he muttered
then they entered the flymrs penfold disposing the short train of
the despised sateen with gingerly careand started
how have you managed it all asked the old man quite bewildered i
feel quite strange conveying a brilliant young lady
and i feelfrightened out of my life said stella with a little
breath and a laugh
then you conceal your alarm with infinite art he retorted
thats just it she assented my heart is beating like a steam
hammer but like an indian at the stake i am determined to smile to
the end they will be very terrible uncle will they not
who he asked
the countess and the paragoni mean lady lenore beauchamp i shall
have to be careful or i shall be calling her the paragon to her face
what would she do uncle
smile and pass it by with a gracious air he said laughing you are
a clever and a bold girl stella but even you could not take a rise
as we used to say in my schooldays out of lady lenore
i am not clever and i am trembling like a mouse said stella with a
piteous little pout youll stand by me uncle wont you
he laughed
i think you are quite able to defend yourself my dear he said
never knew one of your sex who was not
the fly rumbled over the bridge and entered the long avenue and
stella looking out saw the lights of the house shining at the end of
the vista
what a grand place it is she murmured almost to herself uncle i
feel as if i were about to enter another world and i am i think i
have never seen a countess in my life before have been shut up within
the four walls of a school if she says one word to me i shall expire
he laughed and began to feel for the sketch which he had brought with
him
you will not find her so very terrible he said
the fly got to the end of the avenue at last and wound round the broad
drive to the front entrance
it loomed so large and aweinspiring above them that stellas heart
seemed to sink but her color came again as two tall footmen in grand
but not gorgeous livery came down the broad steps and opened the fly
door she would not let them see that she wasafraid afraid yes that
was the word which described her feelings as she was ushered into the
hall and she looked round at its vastness
there were several other footmen standing about with solemn faces
and a maid dressed in black with a spotless muslin cap came forward
with what seemed to stella solemn and stately steps and asked her in
almost a reverential whisper whether she would come upstairs but
stella shook her head and was about to unwind the shawl when the
maid with a quick but respectful movement undertook the task going
through it with the greatest care and attention
then her uncle held his arm and she put her hand upon it and in the
instant as if they had been waiting and watching though their eyes
had been fixed on the ground two footmen drew aside the curtains
shutting off the corridor to the drawingroom and another footman
paced slowly and with head erect before them
it was all so solemn the dim yet sufficient light the towering hall
with its flags and armor the endless curtains with their gold fringe
that stella was reminded of some gothic cathedral the white gleaming
statues seemed to look down at her as she passed between them with
a frown of astonishment at her audacity in entering their solemn
presence the very silence seemed to reproach her light footsteps on
the thicklycarpeted mosaic floor
she began to be overpowered but suddenly she remembered that she too
was of ancient birth that she was an etheridge and that the man whose
arm she was leaning upon was an artist and a great one and she held
her head erect and called the color to her face
it was not a moment too soon for another pair of curtains were
drawn aside and the next instant she stood on the threshold of the
drawingroom and she heard a low but distinct voice say
mr and miss etheridge
she had not time to look round she saw as in a flash the exquisite
room with its shaded candles and softlygleaming mirrors saw
several tall blackcoated whitechested forms of gentlemen and
richlydressed ladies then she was conscious that a tall beautiful
and stately lady was gliding across the room toward them and knew it
was the countess
lady wyndward had heard the announcement and had risen from where she
was sitting with the countess of longford to welcome the guests the
painter was a favorite of hers and if she could have had her will he
would have been a frequent visitor at the hall
when lilian had told her of her meeting with mr etheridges niece and
asked permission to invite her she had assented at once expecting
to see some wellsubdued middleaged woman why she should have thus
pictured her she could not have told perhaps because mr etheridge
was old and so subdued himself she had scarcely listened to lilians
description and leycester had said no word
but now as she came forward and saw a young and beautiful girl
graceful and selfpossessed dressed with perfect taste and looking
as distinguished as if she had gone through a couple of london
seasons when the vision of stella in all her fresh young loveliness
broke upon her suddenly and unexpectedly an infinite surprise took
possession of her and for a moment she half paused but it was only
for a moment and by no change in her face however slight was her
surprise revealed
how do you do mr etheridge it was so kind of you to come i know
how great an honor this is and i am grateful
this is what stella heard in the softest most dulcet of voiceskind
grateful this was how a countess welcomed a poor painter a glow of
light seemed to illumine stellas mind she had expected to see a tall
stately woman dressed in satin and diamonds and with a courtly severe
manner and instead here was a lady with a small gentle voice and a
face all softness and kindness in an instant she had learned her first
lessonthat a mark of high rank and breeding is pure gentleness and
humility the queen sits beside the bed of a sick peasant the peer
thanks the waiter who hands him his umbrella
yes it was very good of you to come and this is your niece how do
you do miss etheridge i am very glad to see you
stella took her gloved hand her courage came instantly and she raised
her eyes to the beautiful serene face little guessing that as she did
so the countess was filled with surprise and admiration as the dark
orbs raised
we are quite a small party said the countess nearly all our
friends have left us we should have been in town before this but lord
wyndward is detained by business
as she spoke the earl approached them and stella saw a tall thin
noblelooking man bending before her as if he were expecting a touch of
her hand
how do you do mr etheridge we have managed to entice you from your
hermitage at last eh how do you do miss etheridge i hope you didnt
feel the cold driving
stella smiled and she knew why every approach was screened by curtains
the earl drew the painter aside and the countess just laying her
fingers on stellas arm guided her to the old countess of longford
mr etheridges niece she said then to stella this is lady
longford
stella was conscious of a pair of keen gray eyes fixed on her face
glad to know you my dear said the old lady come and sit beside
me and tell me about your uncle he is a wonderful man but a very
wicked one
wicked said stella
yes wicked repeated the old lady with a smile on her wrinkled
face all obstinate people are wicked and he is obstinate because he
persists in hiding himself away instead of coming into the world and
consenting to be famous as he should be
stellas heart warmed directly
but perhaps now that you have come you will persuade him to leave his
shell
do you mean the cottage i dont think anything would persuade him to
leave that why should he he is quite happy
the countess looked at her
thats a sensible retort she said why should he i dont knowi
dont know what to answer but i owe him a grudge do you know that he
has persistently refused to come and see me though i have almost gone
on my knees to him
stella smiled
he does not care to go anywhere she said if he went anywhere i am
sure he would come to you
the old countess glanced at her approvingly
that was nicely said she murmured how old are you
nineteen said stella simply
then you have inherited your uncles brains the old lady replied
curtly it is not given to every girl to say the right thing at
nineteen
stella blushed and looked round the room
there were ten or twelve persons standing and sitting about some of
them beautiful women exquisitely dressed talking to some gentlemen
but lord leycester was not amongst the latter she was conscious of
that although she scarcely knew that she was looking for him she
wondered which was lady lenore there was a tall fair girl leaning
against the piano but somehow stella did not think it was the famous
beauty
the clock on the bracket struck eight and she saw the earl take out
his watch and glance at it mechanically and as he did so a voice
behind her said
dinner is served my lady
nobody took any notice however and the countess did not show by sign
or look that she heard suddenly the curtains at the other end of the
room were swung apart and a tall form entered
though her eyes were fixed on another part of the room she knew who it
was and for a moment she would not look that way then she directed
her eyes slowly and saw that her instinct had not misled her
it was leycester
for a moment she was conscious of a feeling of surprise she thought
she knew him well but in that instant he looked so different that he
seemed almost a stranger
she had not seen him before in evening dress and the change from the
velvet coat and knickerbockers to the severe but aristocratic black
suit struck her
like all wellmade highbred men he looked at his best in the dress
which fashion has decreed shall be the evening costume of gentlemen
she had thought him handsome noble in the easy careless suit of
velvet she knew that he was distinguished looking in his suit of
evening sables
with his hand upon the curtain he stood his head erect his eyes not
eagerly but commandingly scanning the room
she could not tell why or how she knew but she knew that he was
looking for her
presently he sees her and a subtle change came over his face it was
not a smile so much as a look of satisfaction and she knew again that
a frown would have settled on his white brow if she whom he sought had
not been there
with a high but firm step he came across the room and stood before her
holding out his hand
you have come he said i thought you would not come it is very
kind of mr etheridge
she gave him her hand without a word she knew that the keen gray
eyes of the old lady beside her were fixed on her face he seemed to
remember too for in a quieter more commonplace tone he added
i am late it is an habitual fault of mine
it is said the old countess
he turned his smile upon her
are you going to scold me
i am not fond of wasting my time she said come and sit down for a
minute if you can
he glanced at the clock
am i not keeping you all waiting he said
lady longford shook her head
no we are waiting for lenore
then she is not here thought stella
oh lenore he said with a smile well no one will dare to scold
her
as he spoke the curtain parted and someone entered
framed by the curtain that fell behind her in crimson folds stood a
girlnot yet a woman for all her twentythree yearsof wonderful
beauty with deep golden hair and violet eyes
stella knew her at once from her uncles description but it was not
the beauty that surprised her and made her start it was something more
than that it was the nameless indescribable charm which surrounded
her it was the grace which distinguished her figure her very attitude
she stood a moment with a faint halfsmile upon her lips looking
round then she glided with a peculiar movement that struck stella as
grace itself to lady wyndward and bent her head down to the countess
stella could not hear what she said but she knew that she was
apologizing for her tardiness by the way the earl who was standing
by smiled at her yes evidently lady lenore would not be scolded for
keeping dinner waiting
stella sat watching her she felt her eyes riveted to her in fact and
suddenly she was aware that the violet eyes were fixed on hers
she saw the beautiful lips move saw the earl make answer and then
watched them move together across the room
whither were they going to her surprise they came toward her and
stopped in front of her
miss etheridge said the earl in his low subdued voice let me
introduce lady lenore beauchamp to you
stella looked up and met the violet eyes fixed on her
for a moment she was speechless the eyes so serene and full and
commanding seemed to seek out her soul and to read every thought it
held to read it so closely and clearly that her own eyes dropped then
with an effort she held out her hand and as the great beautys closed
softly over it she raised her lids again and so they stood looking
at each other and lord leycester stood beside with the characteristic
smile on his face
chapter xi
as stella looked up at the great beauty she felt for the first time
that her own dress pretty as it was was only sateen she had not been
conscious of it before but she felt it now in the presence of this
exquisitelydressed woman in very truth lady lenore was welldressed
it was not only that her costumes came from redferns or worths and
her millinery from louise but lenore had acquired the art of wearing
the productions of these artistes when looking at her one was
forcibly reminded of the frenchmans saying that the world was divided
into two classesthe people who were clothed and the people who wore
their clothes lady lenore belonged to those who wear their clothes
the beautiful dress sat upon her as if she had been made to it instead
of it to her not a piece of lace not a single article of jewelry but
sat in its place gracefully and artistically
tonight she wore a dress composed of some soft and readilydraping
material neither cashmere nor satinsome one of the new materials
which have come over from the far east and of which we scarcely yet
know the names it was of the most delicate shade of grayishblue
which was brought out and accentuated by the single camellia resting
amidst the soft lace on her bosom the arms were bare from the elbows
exquisitely warmly white and beautifully formed one heavy bracelet
set with huge indian pearls lined the wrist there were similar huge
pearls in the rings on her fingers and in the pendant which hung by a
seedpearl necklace
imagine a beautiful an almost faultlesslybeautiful face rising from
the delicate harmony of colorimagine a pair of dark eyes now blue
now violet as she stood in repose or smiled and fringed by long
silken lashesand you may imagine the bare material outward beauty of
lenore beauchamp but no words can describe what really was the charm
of the faceits wonderful power of expression its eloquent mobility
which even when the eyes and lips were in repose drew you to watching
and waiting for them to speak
stella though she had scarcely heard those lips utter a word knew what
her uncle meant when he said that there was a peculiar fascination
about her which went beyond her mere beauty and as she looked a
strange feeling crossed stellas mind she remembered an old story
which she had heard years ago when she was sitting on the lap of
her italian nursethe story of the strange and beautiful indian
serpent which sits beneath the tree and fixing its eyes upon the bird
overhead draws and charms it with its spell until the bird drops
senseless and helpless to its fate
but even as she thought of this she was ashamed of the idea for there
is nothing serpentlike in lenores beauty only this stella thought
that if ever those eyes and lips smiled and murmured to a man i love
you that man must drop resistance would be vain and useless
all this takes long to write it flashed across stellas mind in a
moment even as they looked at each other in silence then at last lady
lenore spoke
have you been gathering primroses today she said with a smile
it was a strange way of beginning an acquaintance and stella felt the
color mount to her face the words recalled the whole of the scene of
yesterday morning the speaker intended that they should
no she said not today
miss etheridge gathered enough yesterday for a week did you
not said lord leycester and the voice sounded to stella like an
assistance she half glanced at him gratefully and met his eyes fixed
on her with a strange light in them that caused hers to drop again
i must find this wonderful flowerland said lady lenore lilian was
quite eloquent about it last night
we shall be happy to act as pioneers in the discovery he said and
stella could not help noticing the we did he mean she and he
at that moment lady wyndward came toward them and murmured something
to him and he left them and offered his arm to a lady at the other end
of the room then lady wyndward waved her fan slightly and smiled and
a tall thin fairhaired man came up
lord charles will you take charge of miss etheridge
lord guildford bowed and offered his arm
i shall be delighted he said and he smiled down at stella in his
frank way
there was a general movement ladies and gentlemen were pairing off and
moving toward the door beside which stood the two footmen with the
solemn air of soldiers attending an execution
seven minutes late said lord charles glancing up at the clock as
they passed we must chalk that up to lady lenore i admire and envy
her courage dont you miss etheridge i should no more dare to be
late for dinner at wyndward thanthanwhats the most audacious thing
you can think of
stella smiled there was something catching in the lighthearted
frank and free tones of the young viscount
standing on a sofa in muddy boots has always been my idea of a great
social crime she said
he laughed approvingly and his laugh seemed to float lightly through
the quiet room
thats goodthats awfully good he said with intense enjoyment
standing on a sofathats awfully good must tell leycester that did
you ever do it by the way
never said stella gravely but with a smile
no he said do you know i think you are capable of it if you were
provoked
provoked said stella
dared i mean he explained you know we used to have a game at
school called dare him i expect all fellows have played it one
fellow does the most extraordinary things and dares the other fellows
to do it leycester used to play it best he was a regular good hand at
it the worst of it was that we all used to get thrashed the masters
didnt care about halfadozen fellows flinging stones at the windows
and climbing on to the roof at the dead of night
poor masters said stella
he laughed
yes they didnt have a particularly fine time of it when leycester
was at school
as he spoke he glanced at the tall figure of lord leycester in front
of them with an admiring air such as a schoolboy might wear
there isnt much that leycester wouldnt dare he said
they entered the diningroom a large room lined with oak and
magnificently furnished in which the long table with its snowy cloth
and glittering plate and glass shone out conspicuously
lord guildford found no difficulty in discovering their seats each
place being distinguished by a small tablet bearing the name of the
intended occupant as stella took her seat she noticed a beautiful
bouquet beside her serviette and saw that one was placed for every
lady in the room
a solemn stately butler who looked like a bishop stood beside the
earls chair and with a glance and a slight movement of his hand
directed the noiseless footmen
a clergyman said grace and the dinner commenced stella looking
round saw that her uncle was seated near lady wyndward and that lady
lenore was opposite herself she looked round for lord leycester and
was startled to hear his voice at her left he was speaking to lady
longford as she turned to look at him she happened to catch lady
wyndwards eye also fixed upon him with a strange expression and
wondered what it meant the next moment she knew for bending his head
and looking straight before him he said
do you like your flowers
stella took up the bouquet it was composed almost entirely of white
blossoms and smelt divinely
they are beautiful she said heliotrope and camelliasmy favorite
flowers
it must have been instinct he said
what do you mean she asked
i chose them he said in the same low voice
chose them she retorted
yes and he smiled that was what made me late i came in here first
and had a grand review of the bouquets i was curious to know if i
could guess your favorite flowers
youyouchanged them said stella with a feeling of mild horror
lord guildford asked me just now what i considered the most audacious
act a man would commit i know now
he smiled
i changed something else he said
stella looked at him inquiringly there was a bold smile in his dark
eyes
he pointed to the little tablet bearing his name
this i found it over the way there next to that old lady in
the emeralds she is a dreadful old ladybeware of her she is a
politician and she always asks everybody who comes near her what they
think of the present parliament i thought it would be nicer to come
over here
the color crept slowly into stellas face and her eyes dropped
it was very wrong she said i am sure lady wyndward will be angry
how could you interfere with the arrangements they all seem so solemn
and grand to me
he laughed softly
they are we always eat our meals as if they were the last we could
expect to haveas if the executioner was waiting outside and feeling
the edge of the ax impatiently there is only one man here who dares to
laugh outright
who is that asked stella
he nodded to lord guildford who was actively engaged in bending
his head over his soup with the air of a hungry man charlie he
saidlord guildford i mean he laughs everywhere dont you
charlie
eh yes oh yes what is he telling you about me miss etheridge
dont believe a word he says i mean to have him up for libel some day
he says you laugh everywhere said stella
lord charles laughed at once and stella looked round half alarmed but
nobody seemed to faint or show any particular horror
nobody minds him said lord leycester balancing his spoon he is
like the kings jester licensed to play wheresoever he pleases
im fearfully hungry said lord charles ive been in the saddle
since three oclockis that the menu miss etheridge let us mark
our favorite dishes and he offered her a halfhold of the porcelain
tablet on which was written the items of the various courses
stella looked down the long list with something like amused dismay
its dreadfully long she said i dont think i have any favorite
dishes
no not really he demanded what a treat will you really let me
advise you
i shall be most grateful said stella
oh this is charming said lord guildford next to choosing ones
own dinner there is nothing better than choosing one for someone else
let me see and thereupon he made a careful selection which stella
broke into with an amused laugh
i could not possibly eat all these things she said
oh but you must he said why i have been most careful to pick out
only those dishes suitable for a ladys delicate appetite you cant
leave one of them out you cant indeed without spoiling your dinner
my dear said the countess bending forward dont let him teach
you anything except to take warning by his epicureanism he is only
anxious that you should be too occupied to disturb him
lord charles laughed
that is cruel he said you take my advice miss etheridge there
are only two things i understand and those are a horse and a good
dinner
meanwhile the dinner was proceeding and to stella it seemed that
good scarcely adequately described it one elaborate course after
another followed in slow succession borne in by the richlyliveried
footmen on the massive plate for which wyndward hall was famous dishes
which she had never heard of seemed to make their appearance only to
pass out again untouched excepting by the clergyman lord guildford
and one or two other gentlemen she noticed that the earl scarcely
touched anything beyond a tiny piece of fish and a mutton cutlet and
lord guildford who seemed to take an interest in anything connected
with the dinner remarked as he glanced at the stately head of the
house
there is one other person present who is of your way of thinking miss
etheridgei mean the earl he doesnt know what a good dinner means i
dont suppose he will taste anything more than the fish and a piece of
cheshire when he is in town and at work
at work said stella
in the house of lords you know he is a member of the cabinet
stella nodded
he is a statesman
exactly he generally dines off a mutton chop served in the library
ive seen him lunching off a penny biscuit and a glass of water
terrible isnt it
stella laughed
perhaps he finds he can work better on a chop and a glass of water
she said
dont believe it retorted lord guildford no man can work well
unless he is wellfed
guildford ought to know said lord leycester audibly he does so
much work
so i do retorts lord charles stay and keep you in order and if
that isnt hard work i dont know what is
this was very amusing for stella it was all so strange too and so
little what she imagined here were two peers talking like schoolboys
for her amusement as if they were mere nobodies and she were somebody
worth amusing
every now and then she could hear lady lenores voice musical and
soft yet full and distinct she was talking of the coming season and
stella heard her speak of great peoplepersons names which she had
read of but never expected to hear spoken of so familiarly it seemed
to her that she had got into some charmed circle it scarcely seemed
real then occasionally but very seldom the earls thin clear
highbred voice would be heard and once he looked across at stella
herself and said
will you not try some of those rissoles miss etheridge they are
generally very good
and he never touches them murmured lord charles with a mock groan
she could hear her uncle talking alsotalking more fluently than
was his wontto lady wyndward who was speaking about the pictures
and once stella saw her glance in her direction as if they had been
speaking of her the dinner seemed very long but it came to an end
at last and the countess rose as stella rose with the rest of the
ladies the old countess of longford locked her arm in hers
i am not so old that i cant walk and i am not lame my dear she
said but i like something young and strong to lean upon you are
both you dont mind
no said stella yes i am strong
the old countess looked up at her with a glance of admiration in her
gray eyes
and young she said significantly
they passed into a drawingroomnot the one they had entered first
but a smaller room which bore the name of my ladys it was
exquisitely furnished in the modern antique style there were some
beautiful hangings that covered the walls and served as background for
costly cabinets and brackets upon which was arranged a collection of
ancient china second to none in the kingdom the end of the room opened
into a fernery in which were growing tall palms and whole miniature
forests of maidenhair kept moist by sparkling fountains that fell with
a plash plash into marble basins birds were twitting and flitting
about behind a wire netting so slight and carefully concealed as to be
scarcely perceptible
no footman was allowed to enter this ladies paradise two maids in
their soft black dresses and snowy caps were moving about arranging a
table for the countess to serve tea upon
it was like a scene from the arabian nights only more beautiful and
luxurious than anything stella had imagined even when reading that
wonderful book of fairytales
the countess went straight to her table and took off her graywhite
gloves some of the ladies settled themselves in the most indolent of
attitudes on the couches and chairs and others strolled into the fern
house the old countess made herself comfortable on a low divan and
made room for stella beside her
and this is your first visit to wyndward hall my dear she said
yes answered stella her eyes still wandering round the room
and you live in that little village on the other side of the river
yes said stella again it is very pretty is it not
it is as pretty as anything in one of your uncles pictures and are
you quite happy
stella brought her eyes upon the pale wrinkled face
happy oh yes quite she said
yes i think you are said the old lady with a keen glance at the
beautiful face and bright pure eyes then you must keep so my dear
she said
but isnt that rather difficult said stella with a smile
lady longford looked at her
that serves me right for meddling she said yes it is difficult
very difficult and yet the art is easy enough it contains only one
rule and that is to be content
then i shall continue to be happy said stella for i am very
content
for the present said the old lady take care my dear
stella smiled it was a strange sort of conversation and there was a
suggestion of something that did not appear on the surface
do you think that i look very discontented then she asked
no said the old lady eying her again no you look very
contentedat present isnt that a beautiful forest
it was an abrupt change of the subject but stella was equal to it
i have been admiring it since i came in she said it is like fairy
land
go and enter it said the old countessi am going to sleep for
exactly ten minutes will you come back to me then you see i am very
frank and rude but i am very old indeed
stella rose with a smile
i think you are very kind to me she said
the old countess looked up at the beautiful face with the dark soft
eyes bent down on her and something like a sigh of regret came into
her old keen eyes
you know how to make pretty speeches my dear she said you learnt
that in italy i expect mind you come back to me
then as stella moved away the old lady looked after her
poor child she murmuredpoor child she is but a child but he
wont care is it too late i wonder but why should i worry about it
but it seemed as if she must worry about it whatever it was for
after a few minutes effort to sleep she rose and went across to the
teatable
lady wyndward was making tea but looked up and pushed a chair close
beside her
what is it she asked with a smile
who is she asked the countess taking a cup and stirring the tea
round and round very much as betty the washerwoman doesvery much
indeed
lady wyndward did not ask who but replied in her serene placid
voice directly
i dont know of course i know that she is mr etheridges niece but
i dont know anything about her except that she has just come here
from italy she said that she was not happy there
she is very beautiful murmured the countess
she isvery assented lady wyndward
and something more than distinguished i never saw a more graceful
girl she is only a child of course
quite a child assented lady wyndward again
there was a pause then the old countess said almost abruptly
why is she here
lady wyndward filled a cup carefully before replying
she is a friend of lilians she said at least she invited her
i thought she was rather a friend of leycesters said the old lady
dryly
lady wyndward looked at her and a faint a very faint color came into
her aristocratic face
you mean that he has noticed her she said
very much i sat next to him at dinner was it wise to put him next to
her a childs head is quickly turned
i did not arrange it so replied lady wyndward i put his tablet
next to lenores as usual but it got moved i dont know who could
have done it
i do said the old lady it was leycester himself i am sure of it
by the way he looked
lady wyndwards white brow contracted for a moment
it is like him he will do or dare anything for an hours amusement i
ought to be angry with him
be as angry as you like but dont let him know that you are said
the old lady shrewdly
lady wyndward understood
how beautiful lenore looks tonight she said looking across the
room where lady lenore stood fanning herself her head thrown back her
eyes fixed on a picture
yes assented the old countess if i were a man i should not rest
until i had won her if i were a manbut then men are so different to
what we imagine them they turn aside from a garden lily to pluck a
wayside flower
but they come back to the lily said lady wyndward with a smile
yes muttered the old countess suavely after they have grown tired
of the wild flower and thrown it aside
as she spoke the curtains were withdrawn and the gentlemen came
sauntering in
no one rests long over the wine nowadays the earl scarcely drank
a glass after the ladies left he would fill his glassfill two
perhaps but rarely did more than sip them lord leycester would
take a bumper of claretthe cellars were celebrated for the chateau
margaux tonight it seemed as if he had taken an additional one for
there was a deeper color on his face and a brighter light in his eyes
than usual the light which used to shine there in his schooldays
when there was some piece of wildness on more mad than usual lord
guildford came in leaning lightly upon his arm and he was talking to
him in a low voice
one of the most beautiful faces i have ever seen ley not your
regular cutouttopattern kind of face but fresh andandnatural
the sort of face venus might have had when she rose from the sea that
fine morning
hush said lord leycester with a slight start and he thought of the
picture in his room the picture of the venus with the pale fair face
across which he had drawn the defacing brush that night he had come
home from his meeting with stella hush they will hear you yes she
is beautiful
yes beautiful take care take care ley muttered lord charles
leycester put his hand from him with a smile
you talk in parables tonight charlie and dont provide the key go
and get some tea
he went himself toward the table and got a cup but his eyes wandered
round the room and the old countess and lady wyndward noticed the
searching glance
leycester said his mother will you ask lenore to sing for us
he put down his cup and went down the room to where she was sitting
beside the earl
my mother has sent me as one of her ambassadors to the queen of
music he said will your majesty deign to sing for us
she looked up at him with a smile then gave her cup to one of the
maids and put her hand upon his arm
do you know that this is the first time you have spoken to me
sincesincei cannot remember
one does not dare intrude upon royalty too frequently it would be
presumptuous he said
in what am i royal she asked
in your beauty he said and he was the only man in the room who
would have dared so pointed a reply
thanks she said with a calm smile you are very frank tonight
am i and why not we do not hesitate to call the summer sky blue
or the ocean vast there are some things so palpable and generally
acknowledged that to be reserved about them would be absurd
that will do she said since when have you learnt such eloquent
phrases what shall i sing or shall i sing at all
to please me you have but to sing to please yourself he said
find me something then she said and sat down with her hands folded
looking a very queen indeed
he knelt down beside the canterbury and as at a signal there was
a general gathering round the piano but she still sat calm and
unconscious very queenlike indeed
leycester found a song and set it up for her opened the piano took
her bouquet from her lap and waited for her gloves the rest looking
on as if interference were quite out of the question
slowly she removed her gloves and gave them to him touched the piano
with her jeweled fingers and began to sing
at this moment stella who had been wandering round the fernery came
back to the entrance and stood listening and absorbed
she had never heard so beautiful a voice not even in italy but
presently even while a thrill of admiration was running through
her she became conscious that there was something wanting her
musical sense was unsatisfied the notes were clear belllike and
as harmonious as a thrushs the modulation perfect but there was
something wanting was it heart from where she stood she could see the
lovely face with its dark violet eyes upturned its eloquent mouth
curved to allow the music vent and the loveliness held her inthralled
though the voice did not move her
the song came to an end and the singer sat with a calm smile receiving
the murmurs of gratitude and appreciation but she declined to sing
again and stella saw lord leycester hand her her gloves and bouquet
and stand ready to conduct her whither she would
he stands like her slave to obey her slightest wish she thought
ah how happy she must be and with a something that was almost
a sigh she turned back into the dim calm of the fernery she felt
strangely alone and solitary at that moment
suddenly there was a step behind her and looking up she saw lord
leycester
i have found you he said and there was a ring of satisfaction and
pleasure in his voice that went straight to her heart where have you
been hiding
she looked up at the handsome face full of life and strong manhood and
her eyes fell
i have not been hiding she said i have been here
you are right he said seating himself beside her this is the best
place it is cool and quiet here it is more like our woods is it not
with the ferns and the primroses and at the our he smiled into her
eyes
it is very lovely here she said its all lovely how beautifully
she sings she added rather irrelevantly
sings he said oh lenore yes she sings well perfectly and that
reminds me i have been sent to ask you to make music for us
stella shrank back with a glance of alarm
i oh no no i could not
he smiled at her
but your uncle
he should not said stella with a touch of crimson i could not
sing i am afraid
afraid you he said of what
ofofeverything she said with a little laugh i could not sing
before all these people i have never done so besides to sing after
lady lenore would be like dancing a hornpipe
i should be content if you would dance a hornpipe he said i should
think it good and wise
are you laughing at me she said looking up at the dark eyes why
laughing at you he repeated i i could not it is you who laugh at
me i think you are laughing at me most times you will not sing then
i cannot she said
then you shall not he responded you shall not do anything you do
not like but some time you will sing for us will you not your uncle
has been telling us about your voice and how you came by it and his
own voice grew wonderfully gentle
my father he meant said stella simply yes he could sing he was
a great musician and when i think of that i am inclined to resolve
never to open my lips again
there was a moments pause stella sat pulling a piece of maidenhair
apart her eyes downcast his eyes were reading her beautiful face
and noting the graceful turns of the white neck someone was playing
the grand piano and the music floated in and about the tall palms it
was an intoxicating moment for him the air was balmy with perfumes
from the exotics the warm blood was running freely in his veins the
beauty of the girl beside him seemed to entrance him instinctively his
hand being idly near her went toward hers and would have touched it
but suddenly one of the maids entered and with a slow respectful air
approached them she held a silver salver on which lay a small note
folded in a lovers knot
lord leycester looked up the interruption came just in time
for me he said
for miss etheridge my lord replied the maid with a courtesy
for me echoed stella taking the note
i can guess who it is from he said with a smile lilian is growing
impatientif she is ever that
stella unfolded the note this was it will you come to me now if you
care to
oh yes i will go at once she said standing up
he rose with a sigh
it is the first time i have envied lilian anything he said in a
low voice
this way if you please miss said the maid
a momenta moment only said lord leycester and as stella stopped
he gathered a few sprays of maidenhair from the margin of the fountain
it is a peaceoffering will you take it to her i promised that i
would ask you to go directly after dinner he said softly
yes said stella and as she took it there rose once more in her mind
the word jasper adelstone had spokeninfamous this man who sent his
sister such a message in such a voice
thanks he said but it was scarcely necessary i have sent her
something more beautiful more precious
stella did not understand far a moment then as her eyes met his she
knew that he meant herself and the color flooded her face
you should not say that she said gravely and before he could
answer she moved away and followed the maid
the maid led her through the hall and up the broad stairs across the
corridor and knocked at lady lilians door
stella entered and a grave peace seemed to fall upon her
lady lilian was lying on the couch by the window and raised herself to
hold out her hand
how good of you to come she said eagerly and as the voice broke on
stellas ear she knew what lady lenores voice wanted you think me
very selfish to bring you away from them all do you not she added
still holding stellas hand in her white cool one
no said stella i am very glad to come i would have come before
but i did not know whether i might
i have been waiting and did not like to send for you said lady
lilian and have you had a pleasant evening
stella sank into a low seat beside the couch and looked up into the
lovely face with a smile
i have had a wonderful evening she said
lady lilian looked at her inquiringly
wonderful said stella frankly you see i have never been in such
a place as this before it all seems so grand and beautifulmore
beautiful than grand indeed that i can scarcely believe it is real
it is realtoo real said lady lilian with a smile and a little
sigh i daresay you think it is very nice and ido you know what i
think
stella shook her head
i think as i look down at your little cottage how beautiful how
nice your life must be
mine said stella well yes it is very nice but this is
wonderful
because you are not used to it said lady lilian ah you would soon
get tired of it believe me
never breathed stella looking down as she did so she saw the
maidenhair and held it up
lord leycester sent these to you she said
a loving light came into lady lilians eyes as she took the green
fragrant sprays
leycester she said touching her cheek with them that is like
himhe is too good to me
stella looked across the room at a picture of the madonna rising from
the earth with upturned glorious eyes
is he she murmured
oh yes yes there never was a brother like him in all the wide
world said lady lilian in a rapt voice i cannot tell you how
good he is to me he is always thinking of mehe who has so much to
think of i fancy sometimes that people are apt to deem him selfish
andandthoughtless but they do not know
no said stella again the voice sounded like music in her earsshe
could have listened forever while it sung his song and yet that word
suddenly rang out in discord and she smiled he seems very kind she
saidhe is very kind to me
lady lilian looked at her suddenly and an anxious expression came into
her eyes it was not many nights ago that she had implored leycester to
see no more of the girl with the dark eyes and silky hair and here was
the girl sitting at her feet and it was her doing she had not thought
of that before she had been so fascinated by the fresh young beauty
by the pure frank eyes that she had actually acted against her own
instincts and brought her into leycesters path
yes he is very kind to everybody she said and you have enjoyed
yourself have they been singing
yes lady beauchamp
lenore said lilian eagerly ah yes does she not sing
beautifully and is she not lovely
she sings beautifully and she is very lovely said stella still
looking at the madonna
lady lilian laughed softly
i am very fond of lenore you will like her very much when you know
her better she isi was going to sayvery imperial
that would be right said stella she is like a queen only more
beautiful than most queens have been
i am so glad you admire her said lady lilian then she paused a
moment and her white hand fell like a thistle down on the dark head
beside her shall i tell you a secret
stella looked up with a smile
yes i will promise to keep it
lilian smiled down at her
how strangely you said thatso gravely yes i think you would keep
a secret to the death but this is not one of that sort it is only
thisthat we hope all of us that lenore will become my sister
stella did not start did not remove her eyes from the pale lovely
face but into those eyes a something came that was not wonder nor
pain but a strong indefinable expression as if she were holding her
breath in the effort to suppress any sign of feeling
do you mean that lord leycester will marry her she said distinctly
lady lilian nodded
yes that is it would it not be nice
stella smiled
for lord leycester
lady lilian laughed her soft laugh
what a strange girl you are she said smoothing the silky hair
what am i to say to that wellyes of course and for lenore too
she added with a touch of pride
yes for lady lenore also said stella and her eyes went back to the
madonna
we are all so anxious to see leycester married went on lady lilian
with a smile they say he isso wild i think it is they say ah
they do not see him as i see him do you think he is wild
stella paled the strain was great her heart was beating with
suppressed throbs the gentle girl did not know how she was torturing
her with such questions
i she murmured i do not know i cannot tell how should i i
scarcely know your brother
ah no i forget said lady lilian to me it seems as if we had
known each other so long and we only met the other morning for a few
minutes how is it do you possess some charm and did you conceal it
in the flowers you gave me so that i am under a spell stella that is
your name isnt it it is a beautiful name are you angry with me for
calling you by it
angry no said stella putting up her warm firm hand and touching
the thin white one resting on her hair no i like you to call me by
it
and you will call me by minelilian
if you wish it said stella yes i will
and we shall be great friends see i have kept your flowers quite
cool and fresh and she pointed to a vase in which the primroses stood
at the other end of the room i love wild flowers they are heavens
very own are they not no human hand does anything for them or helps
them to grow
stella listened to the low beautiful voice with a rapt awe
lady lilian looked down at her with a smile
i wonder whether you would grant me a favor if i asked it she said
i would do anything for you said stella looking up at her
will you go and play for me she said i know that you can play and
sing because i have looked into your eyes
suppose i say that i cannot said stella laughing softly
you cannot said lady lilian i am never mistaken leycester says
that i am a witch in such matters
well i will try said stella and she crossed the room and opened
the tiny piano and began to play a sonata by schubert
i cannot play like lady lenore she said almost to herself but lady
lilian heard her
you play exquisitely she said
no i cant play repeated stella with almost a touch of impatience
then she looked up and saw the madonna and on the impulse of the
moment began to sing gounods ave maria there is no more exquisite
piece of devotional music in the world and it was stellas favorite
she had sung it often and often in the dreary schooldays with all
her longing heart in her voice she had sung it in solemn aisled
cathedrals while the incense rose to the vaulted roof but she had
never sung it as she sang it nownow that the strange indefinable
pain was filling her heart with wistful vague longing lady lilian
leant forwardher lips parted her eyes filling with tearsso rapt
that she did not notice that the door had opened and that lord
leycester stood in the room when she did see him he held up his hand
to silence any word of greeting and stood with his head lowered his
eyes fixed on stellas face upturned white and rapt as he listened
his handsome face grew pale his dark eyes deepened with intense
emotion he had stood beside the piano downstairs while lady lenore
had been singing with a calm polite attention here and at this
moment his heart beat and throbbed with an intense longing to bend and
kiss the upturned facewith an intense longing to draw the eyes toward
histo silence the exquisite voiceto change its imploring prayer
into a song of love
all unconsciously stella sang on till the end that last lingering
exquisite longdrawn sigh then she turned and saw him but she did
not moveonly turned pale her eyes fixed on his and so they looked
at each other
with an effort he broke the spell and moved but he did not speak to
her at once but to lilian
i have brought you something he said in a low voice and he held up
the sketch
lady lilian uttered a cry of delight
and it is for me oh leycester that is nice it is beautiful i know
who painted itit was your uncle stella oh yes i know
you are right said leycester then he went toward stella
how can i thank you he said in a low voice i know now why you
would not sing to to us downstairs you were quite right i would not
have you sing to a mob in a drawingroom after dinner what shall i
saywhat can i say
stella looked up pale and almost breathless beneath the passionate fire
that burned in his eyes
i did not know you were here she said at last
or you would not have sung i am glad i camei cannot say how glad
you will not sing again
no no she said
no he said i did not think you would and yet i would give
something to hear you onceonly once more
no said stella and she rose and went back to her seat
isnt it beautiful said lady lilian in a murmur i have been
richly endowed tonight your song and this picture how exquisite it
was where did you learn to sing like that
nowhere said leycester that cannot be learnt
lilian looked at him he was still pale and his eyes seemed to burn
with suppressed eagerness
go and thank mr etheridge she said
presently he said and he came and put his hand on her arm
presently let me rest here a little while it is paradise after
he paused
you shall not rest she said go and sing something ley
then as stella looked up she laughed softly
did you not know he could sing he is a bad wicked indolent boy
he can do all sorts of things when he likes but he never will exert
himself he will not sing now will you
he stood looking at stella and as if constrained to speak and look at
him stella raised her eyes
will you sing she said almost inaudibly
as if waiting for her command he bent his head and went to the piano
his fingers strayed over the notes slowly for a moment or two then he
said without turning his head
have you seen these flowers
stella did not wish to move but the voice seemed to draw her and she
rose and crossed to the piano
he looked up
stay he murmured
she hesitated a second then stood with downcast eyes which hidden as
they were seemed to feel his ardent gaze fixed upon her
he still touched the keys gently and then without further prelude he
began in a low voice
    i wandered down the valley in the eventide
    the birds were singing sweetly in the summer air
    the river glided murmring to the ocean wide
      but still no peace was there
    for love lay lurking in the ferny brake
    i saw him lying with his bow beside
    he cried sweetheart we will never never part
    by the river in the valley at the eventide
    i fled to the mountains to the clouds and mist
    where the eagle and the hawk share their solitary throne
    here at least i cried wicked love i can deride
      he will leave me here at peace alone
    but love lay lurking in the clouds and mist
    i heard him singing sweetly on the mountain side
    tis all in vain you fly for everywhere am i
    in every quiet valley on every mountain side
with his eyes fixed on hers he sang as if every word were addressed to
her his voice was like a flute mellow and clear and musical but it
was not the voice but the words that seemed to sink into stellas heart
as she listened it seemed to her as if he dared her to fly to seek
safety from himhis love he seemed to say would pursue her in every
quiet valley on every mountain side
for a moment she forgot lady lenore forgot everything she felt
helpless beneath the spell of those dark eyes the musical voice her
head drooped her eyes closed
tis all in vain you fly for everywhere am i in every quiet valley
on every mountain side
was it to be so with her would his presence haunt her ever and
everywhere
with a start she turned from him and glided swiftly to the couch as if
seeking protection
lady lilian looked at her
you are tired she said
i think i am said stella
leycester take her away i will not have her wearied or she will not
come again you will come again will you not
yes said stella i will come again
lord leycester stood beside the open door but lilian still clung to
her hand
goodnight she said and she put up her face
stella bent and kissed her
goodnight she answered and passed out
they went down the stairs in silence and reached the fernery then he
stopped short
will you not wait a moment here he said
stella shook her head
it must be late she said
a moment only he said let me feel that i have you to myself for a
moment before you goyou have belonged to others until now
no no she saidi must go
and she moved on but he put out his hand and stopped her
stella
she turned and looked at him most piteously but he saw only her
loveliness before him like a flower
stella he repeated and he drew her nearer i must speaki must
tell youi love you
chapter xii
i love you he said
only three words but only a woman can understand what those three
words meant to stella
she was a girla mere child as lady wyndward had said never save
from her fathers lips had she heard those words before
even now she scarcely realized their full meaning she only knew that
his hand was upon her arm that his eyes were fixed on hers with a
passionate pleading entreaty combined with a masterful power which
she felt unable to resist
white and almost breathless she stood not downcast for her eyes felt
drawn to his all her maidenly nature roused and excited by this first
declaration of a mans love
stella i love you he repeated and his voice sounded like some low
subtle music which rang through her ears even after the words had died
from his lips
pale and trembling she looked at him and put her hand to gently force
his grasp from her arm
no no she panted
but it is yes he said and he took her other hand and held her
a close prisoner looking into the depths of the dark wondering
troubled eyes i love you stella
no she repeated again almost inaudibly it is impossible
impossible he echoed and a faint smile flitted across the eager
facea smile that seemed to intensify the passion in his eyes it
seems to me impossible not to love you stella are you angry with
meoffended i have been too sudden too rude and rough
at his tender pleading her eyes drooped for the first time
too rough too rude he who seemed to her the type of knightly
chivalry and courtesy
i should have remembered how pure and delicate a flower my beautiful
love was he murmured i should have remembered that my love was a
star to be approached with reverence and awe not taken by storm i
have been too presumptuous but oh stella you do not know what such
love as mine is it is like a mountain torrent hard to stem it sweeps
all before it that is my love for you stella and now what will you
say to me
as he spoke he drew her still nearer to him she could feel his breath
stirring her hair could almost hear the passionate beating of his
heart
what should she say to him if she allowed her heart to speak she would
hide her face upon his breast and whispertake me but girl as she
was she had some idea of all that divided them the very place in
which they stood was eloquent of the difference between them between
him the future lord of wyndward and she the poor painters niece
will you not speak to me he murmured have you not a single word
for me stella if you knew how i long to hear those beautiful lips
answer me with the words i have spoken stella i would give all i
possess in the world to hear you say i love you
no no she said again almost pantingly do not ask medo not say
any more ii cannot bear it
his face flushed hotly for a moment but he held her tightly and his
eyes searched hers for the truth
does it pain you to hear that i love you he whispered are you
angry sorry can you not love me stella oh my darlinglet me call
you my darling mine if only for once for one short minute see
you are mine i hold you in both hands be mine for a short minute at
least while you answer me are you sorry can you not give me a little
love in return for all the love i bear you cannot you stella
panting now and with the rich color coming and going on her face she
looks this way and that like some wild timid animal seeking to escape
do not press me do not force me to speak she almost moans let me
go now
no by heaven he says almost fiercely you shall not must not go
until you have answered me tell me stella is it because i am nothing
to you and you do not like to tell me so ah better the truth at
once hard as it may be to bear than suspense tell me stella
ititis not that she says with drooping head
what is it then he whispers and he bends his head to catch her
faintly whispered words so that his lips almost touch her face
from the drawingroom comes the sound of some one playing it recalls
all the grandeur of the scene all the high mightiness of the house to
which he belongsof which he is so nearly the head and it gives her
strength
slowly she raises her head and looks at him
there is infinite tenderness infinite yearning and suppressed
maidenly passion in her eyes
it is not that she says butdo you forget
forget he asks patiently gently though his eyes are burning with
impetuous eagerness
do you forget who i amwho you are she says faintly
i forget everything except that you are to me the most lovely and
precious of creatures on gods earth he says passionately then
with a touch of his characteristic pride what need have i to remember
anything else stella
but i have she said oh yes it is for me to remember i cannoti
ought not to forget it is for me to remember i am only stella
etheridge an artists niece a nobodyan insignificant girl and
youoh lord leycester
and i he says as if ready to meet her fairly at every point
and youshe looks aroundyou are a nobleman will be the lord of
all this beautiful placeof all that you were showing me the other
day you should not ought not to tell me thatthatwhat you have
told me
he bent over her and his hand closed on her arm with a masterful
caressing touch
you mean that because i am what i amthat because i am rich i am to
be made poor because i have so muchtoo much that the one thing on
earth which would make the rest worth having is to be denied me
he laughed almost fiercely
better to be the poorest son of the soil than lord of many acres if
that were true stella but it is not i do not care whether i am rich
or poor noble or namelessyes i do i am glad for your sake i have
never cared before i have never realized it before but i do now i am
glad now do you know why
she shook her head her eyes downcast
because i can lay them all at your feet and as he speaks he bends
on one knee beside her and draws her hand with trembling hands to his
heart
see stella i lay them at your feet i say take them if you think
them worthtake them and make them worth having no i say rather
share them with me set against your love my darling title lands
wealthare all worthless dross to me give me your love stella i
must i will have it and he presses a passionate clinging kiss
on her hand
frightened by his vehemence stella draws her hand away and shrinks
back
he rises and draws her to a seat standing beside her calm and penitent
forgive me stella i frighten you see i will be quite gentle and
quietonly listen to me
no no she murmurs trembling i must not thinkififi said
what you wish me to say how could i meet the countess what would they
say to me they would blame me for stealing your love
you have not stolen no nun from a convent could have been more free
from artifice than you stella you have stolen nothing it is i who
have givengiven you all
she shook her head
it is the same she murmured they would be so displeased oh it
cannot be
it cannot be he repeated with a smile but it has already come to
pass am i one to love and unlove in a breath stella look at me
she raises her eyes and meets his eager passionate gaze
do i look like one to be swayed as a reed by any passing wind gentle
or rough no stella such love as i feel for you is not to be turned
aside even if you were to tell me that you do not cannot love me
my love would not die it has taken root in my heartit has become
part of myself there is not one hour since i saw you that i have not
thought about you stella you have come to me even in my sleep i have
dreamed that you whispered to me i love you let the dream be a true
one oh my life my darling let your heart speak if it is to say
that it loves me see stella you are all the world to medo not rob
me of happiness you do not doubt my love
doubt his love that was not possible for her to do since every word
every look bore the impress of truth
but still she would not yield even as he spoke she fancied she
could see the stern face of the earl looking at her with hard
condemnationcould see the beautiful eyes of the countess looking down
at her with cold displeasure and wondering amazed scorn
footsteps were approaching and she rose hurriedly to fly from him if
need be but lord leycester was not a man to be turned aside as she
rose he took her arm gently tenderly with loving persuasion and drew
her near to him
come with me he said do not leave me for a moment see the door
is openit is quite warm we shall be alone here oh my darling do
not leave me in suspense
she was powerless to resist and he led her on to the terrace outside
out into the dusky night odorous with the breath of the flowers and
mystical in the dim light of the stars a gentle summer zephyrlike
air stirred the trees the sound of the water falling over the weir
came like music up the hillside a nightingale sang in the woods below
them all the night seemed full of slumberous passion and unspoken love
we are alone here stella he murmured now answer me listen once
more darling i am not tired of telling you i shall never tire of it
listen i love youi love you
the stars grew dull and misty before her eyes the charm of his voice
of his presence was stealing over her the passionate love which burnt
in her heart for him was finding its way through cool prudence her
lips were tremulous a sigh long and deep broke from them
i love you he replied as if the words were a spell as indeed they
werea spell not to be resisted give me your answer stella come
close to me whisper it whisper i love you or send me away but
you will not do that no you shall not do that and forgetful of his
vow to be gentle with her he put his arm round her drew her to him
andkissed her
it was the first kiss a thrill ran through her the sky seemed to
sink the whole night to pause as if it were waiting with a little
shudder of exquisite pleasure mingled with that subtle pain which
ecstasy always brings in its train she laid her head upon his breast
and hiding her eyes murmured
i love you
if the words meant much to himto him the man of the world before
whom many a beautiful woman had been ready to bow with complaisant
homageif they meant much to him how much more did they mean to her
all her young maiden faith spoke in those three words with them she
surrendered her young pure life her unstained unsullied heart to
him with a passion as intense as his own she repaid him tenfold
for a moment he was silent his eyes fixed on the stars his whole
being thrilling under the musicthe joy of this simple avowal then
he pressed her to him and poured a shower of kisses upon her hair and
upon her arm which lay across his breast
my darling my darling he murmured is it really true can idare
i believe it you love me oh my darling the whole world seems
changed to me you love me see stella it seems so wonderful that i
cannot realize it let me see your eyes i shall find the truth there
she pressed still closer to him but he raised her head gentlyin his
very touch was a caress and it was as if his hands kissed herand
looked long into the rapt upturned eyes then he bent his head slowly
and kissed her oncehungrily clingingly
stellas eyes closed and her face paled under that passionate caress
then slowly and with a little sigh she raised her head and kissed him
back again kiss for kiss
no word was spoken side by side with her head upon his breast they
stood in silence for them time had vanished the whole world seemed to
stand still
half amazed with a dim wonder at this new delight which had entered
her life stella watched the stars and listened to the music of the
river something had happened to change her whole existence it was
as if the old stella whom she knew so well had gone and a new being
wonderfully blessed wonderfully happy had taken her place
and as for him for the man of the world he too stood amazed
overwhelmed by the newborn joy if any one had told him that life held
such a moment for him he would not have believed it he who had as he
thought drained the cup of earthly pleasure to the dregs his blood
ran wildly through his veins his heart beat madly
at last he murmured this is love
but suddenly the awakening came with a start she looked up at him and
strove to free herself vainly from his embrace
what have i done she whispered with awesubdued voice
done he murmured with a rapt smile made one man happier than he
ever dreamed it possible for mortal to be that is all
ah no she said i have done wrong i am afraidafraid
afraid of what there is nothing to make you afraid can you speak of
fear while you are in my armswith your head on my breast lean back
my darling now speak of fear
yes even now she whispered nowand i am so happy she broke off
to herself but he heard her so happy is it all a dream tell me
he bent and kissed her
is it a dream do you think he answered
the crimson dyed her face and neck and her eyes drooped
and you are happy he said think what i must be for a mans love
is deeper more passionate than a womans stella think what i must
be
she sighed and looked up at him
but still it is wrong i fear that all the world will say that
all the world he echoed with smiling scorn what have we to do
with the world we two stand outside beyond it our world is loveis
our two selves my darling
all the world she said ah what will they say and instinctively
she glanced over her shoulder at the great house with the glow of light
streaming from its many windows even nownow they are wondering
where you are expecting waiting for you what would they say if they
knew you were here with meandand all that has happened
his eyes darkened he knew better than she with all her fears what
they would say and already he was braving himself to meet the storm
but he smiled to reassure her
they will say that i am the most fortunate of men they will say that
the gods have lavished their good gifts with both handsthey have
given me all the things that you make so much of and the greatest of
all thingsthe true sole love of a pure beautiful angel
oh hush hush she murmured
you are an angel to me he said simply i am not worthy to touch
the hem of your dress if i could but live my worthless sinful life
over again for your sake my darling it should be purer and a little
less unworthy of you
oh hush she murmured you unworthy of me you are my king
strong man as he was he was stirred and moved to the depths of his
being at the simple words eloquent of her absolute trust and devotion
my stella he murmured if you knew all but see my life is yours
from henceforth i place it in your hands mold it as you will it is
yours henceforth
she was looking at him all her soul in her eyes and at his words
of passionate protestation a sudden thrill ran through her then as
instantly as if a sudden cold hand had come between them she shivered
mine she breathed fearfully until they snatch it from me
chapter xiii
he started the words had almost the solemnity of a prophesy
who will dare he said then he laughed my little fearsome
trembling darling he murmured fear nothing or rather tell me what
you fear and whom
she glanced toward the windows
i fear them all she said quietly and simply
my father
she inclined her head and let her head fall upon his shoulder
the countess all of them lord leycester
he put his hand upon her lips softly
what was that i heard he said with tender reproach
she looked up
leycester she whispered
he nodded
would to heaven the name stood alone he said almost bitterly the
barrier you fancy stands between us would vanish and fade away then
never even in sport call me by my title again my darling or i shall
hate it
she smiled
i shall never forget it she said they will not let me i am not
lady lenore
he started slightly then looked down at her
thank heaven no he said with a smile
stella smiled almost sadly
she might forget she is noble too how beautiful she is
is she he said smiling down at her to me there is only one
beautiful face in the world andit is here and he touched it with
his fingerheremy very own but what is lenore to us tonight my
darling why do you speak of her
becauseshall i tell you
he nodded looking down at her
because they saidlady lilian said that she stopped
well
that they wished you to marry her she whispered
he laughed his short laugh
she might say the same of several young ladies he said my mother
is very anxious on the point yes but wishes are not horses or one
could probably be persuaded to mount and ride as their parents wish
themdont that sound wise and profound i shall not ride to lady
lenore i have ridden to your feet my darling
and you will never ride away again she murmured
never he said here by your side i shall remain while life lasts
while life lasts she repeated as if the words were music i shall
have you near me always ah it sounds too beautiful too beautiful
but it will be true he said
the clock chimed the hour stella started
so late she said with a little sigh i must go and she glanced
at the windows with a little shudder if i could but steal away
without seeing themwithout being seen i feel she paused and the
crimson covered her face and neckas if they had but to glance at me
to knowto know what has happened and she trembled
are you so afraid he said really so afraid well why should they
know
she looked up eagerly
oh no do not let them know why should we tell them itit is like
letting them share in our happiness it is our secret is it not
let us keep it he said quietly musingly why should they know
indeed let us keep the world outside for a while at least you and i
alone in our love my darling
with his arm round her they went back to the fernery and here she drew
away from him but not until he had taken another kiss
it is our real good night you know he said the goodnight we
shall say presently will mean nothing this is our goodnight happy
dreams my angel my star
stella clung to him for a moment with a little reluctant sigh then she
looked up at him with a smile
i am afraid i am awfully tumbled and tangled she said putting her
hand to her hair
he smoothed the silken threads with his hand and as he did so drew the
rose from her hair
this is mine he murmured and he put it in his coat
oh no she exclaimed and this is how you keep our secret do you
not think every eye would notice that great rose and know whence it
came
yes yes i see he said after all a woman is the one for a
secretthe man is not in the field but then it will be safe here
and he put the rose inside the breast of his coat
then trying to look as if nothing had happened trying to look as if
the whole world had not become changed for her stella sauntered into
the drawingroom by his side
and it really seemed as if no one had noticed their entrance stella
felt inclined to congratulate herself not taking into consideration
the usages of high breeding which enable so many people to look as if
they were unaware of an entrance which they had been expecting for an
hour since
no one seems to notice she whispered behind her fan but lord
leycester smiledhe knew better
she walked up the room and lord leycester stopped before a picture
and pointed to it but he did not speak of the pictureinstead he
murmured
will you meet me by the stile by the river tomorrow evening stella
yes she murmured
i will bring the boat and we will row down the stream will you come
at six oclock
yes she said again
if he asked her to meet him on the banks of the styx she would have
answered as obediently
then mr etheridge approached with the countess and before he could
speak lord leycester took the bull by the horns as it were
lilian is delighted with the sketch he said we left her filled
with gratitude did we not miss etheridge
stella inclined her head the large serene eyes of the countess seemed
to penetrate to the bottom of her heart and read hertheirsecret
already
i think we must be going stella the fly has been waiting some time
said her uncle in his quiet fashion
so soon murmured the countess
but mr etheridge glanced at the clock with a smile and stella held
out her hand
as she did so she felt rather than saw the graceful form of lady
lenore coming toward them
are you going miss etheridge she said her clear voice full of
regret we have seen so little of you and i meant to ask you so much
about italy i am so sorry
and as she spoke she looked full into poor stellas eyes
for a moment stella was silent and downcast then she raised her eyes
and held out her hand
it is late she murmured yes we must go
as she looked up she met the gaze of the violet eyes and almost
started for there seemed to be shining in them a significant smile of
mocking scorn and contemptuous amusement they seemed to say quite
plainly
you think that no one knows your secret you think that you have
triumphed that you have won him poor simple child poor fool wait
and see
if ever eyes spoke this is what lady lenores seemed to say in that
momentary glance and as stella turned aside her face paled slightly
you must come and see us again miss etheridge said the countess
graciously
lilian has extorted a solemn promise to that effect said leycester
as he shook hands with mr etheridge
then he held out his hand to stella but in spite of prudence he could
not part from her till the last moment
let me take you to your carriage he said and see that you are well
wrapped up
the countesss eyes grew cold and she looked beyond them rather than
at them and stella murmured something about trouble but he laughed
softly and drawing her hand on his arm led her away
all the room saw it and a sort of thrill ran through them it was
an attention he paid only to such old and honored friends as the old
countess and lenore
oh why did you come whispered stella as they reached the hall
the countess looked so angry
he smiled
i could not help it there not a word more now let me wrap this
round you and of course as he wrapped it round her he managed to
convey a caress in the touch of his hand
remember my darling he murmured almost dangerously loud as he put
her into the fly tomorrow at six
then he stood bareheaded and the last stella saw was the light of
tender passionate love burning in his dark eyes
she sank back in the furthermost corner of the fly in silent rapt
reflection was it all a dream was it only a trick of fancy or did
she feel his passionate kisses on her lips and face entangled in her
hair had she really heard lord leycester wyndward declare that he
loved her
are you asleep stella said her uncle and she started
no not asleep dear she said butbut tired and so happy the
word slipped out before she was aware of it
but the unsuspecting recluse did not notice the thrill of joy in the
tone of her reply
ah yes just so i daresay it was something new and strange to you
it is a beautiful place by the way what do you think of lady lenore
stella started
oh she is very beautiful and as wonderful as you said dear she
murmured
yes isnt she she will make a grand countess will she not
what said stella
he smiled
wonderful creatures women are to be sure for the life of me i
could not tell in exact words how the countess managed to give me the
impression but she did give it me and unmistakably
what impression said stella
he laughed
that matters were settled between lord leycester and lady lenore and
that they were to be married they will make a fine match will they
not
yesnoi mean yes said stella and a happy smile came into her
eyes as she leant back
no it was not lady lenore he was going to marrynot the great beauty
with the golden hair and violet eyes but a little mere nobody called
stella etheridge she leant back and hugged her secret to her bosom
and caressed it the fly trundled along after the manner of flys and
stopped at last at the white gate in the lane
mr etheridge got out and held his hand for stella and she leapt out
as she did so she uttered a slight cry for a tall figure was standing
beside the gate in the light by the lamps
bless my soul whats the matter exclaimed mr etheridge turning
round oh its you mr adelstone
i am very sorry to have startled you miss stella said jasper
adelstone and he came forward with his hat raised by his left hand
his right was in a sling stellas gentle eyes saw it and her face
paled
i was taking a stroll through the meadows and looked in mrs penfold
said that you had gone to the hall coming back from the river i heard
the fly and waited to say goodnight
it is very kind murmured stella her eyes still fixed on the useless
arm with a kind of fascination
come in and have a cigar said mr etheridge ah what is the matter
with your arm man
jasper looked at him then turned his small keen eyes on stellas face
a mere trifle he said imet with an accident the other day
and sprained it it is a mere nothing no i wont come in thanks
bytheway im nearly forgetting a most important matter and he
put his left hand in his pocket and drew something out i met the
postoffice boy in the lane and he gave me this to save his legs and
he held out a telegram envelope
a telegram for me exclaimed mr etheridge wonders will never
cease come inside mr adelstone
but jasper shook his head
i will wish you goodnight now he said will you excuse my left
hand miss stella he added as he extended it
stella took it it was burning hot and dry
i am so sorry she said in a low voice i cannot tell how sorry i
am
do not think of it he said pray forget it asi do he added
with hidden irony it is a mere nothing
stella looked down
and i am sure thatlord leycester is sorry
no doubt he said i am quite sure lord leycester did not want to
break my arm but indeed i was rightly punished for my carelessness
though i assure you that i should have pulled up in time
yes yes i am sure of that i am sure i was in no danger said
stella earnestly
yes he said in a low voice there was really no necessity for lord
leycester to throw me off my horse or even to insult me but lord
leycester is a privileged person is he not
ii dont know what you mean said stella faintly
i mean that lord leycester may do things with impunity which others
cannot even think of and his sharp eyes grew to her face which
stella felt was growing crimson
ii am sure he will be very sorry she said when he knows how
much you are hurt and he will apologize most sincerely
i have no doubt he said lightly and after all it is something
to have ones arm sprained by lord leycester wyndward is it not it is
better than a broken heart
a broken heart what do you mean said stella her face flushed her
eyes challenging his with a touch of indignation
he smiled
i meant that lord leycester is as skilled in breaking hearts as limbs
but i forgot i must not say anything against the heir to wyndward in
your hearing pray forgive me goodnight
and with a bow and a keen look from his small eyes he moved away
stella stood looking after him for a moment and a shiver ran through
her as if from a cold wind
breaking hearts what did he mean
an exclamation from her uncle caused her to turn suddenly
he was standing in the light of the window with the open telegram in
his hand his face pale and anxious
great heaven he muttered what am i to do
chapter xiv
what shall i do exclaimed mr etheridge
stella came to him quickly with a little cry of dismay
what is it uncle are you illis it bad news oh what is the
matter
and she looked up into his pale and agitated face with anxious concern
his gaze was fixed on vacancy but there was more than abstraction in
his eyesthere was acute pain and anguish
what is it dear she asked laying her hand on his arm pray tell
me
at the words he started slightly and crushed the telegram in his hand
no no he saidanything but that then composing himself with an
effort he pressed her hand and smiled faintly yes it is bad news
stella it is always bad news that a telegram brings
stella led him in his hands were trembling and the dumb look of pain
still clouded his eyes
will you not tell me what it is she murmured as he sank into his
accustomed chair and leant his white head on his hand tell me what it
is and let me help you to bear it by sharing it with you
and she wound her arm around his neck
dont ask me stella i cant tell youi cannot the shame would kill
me no no
shame murmured stella her proud lovely face paling as she shrank
back a little but the next moment she pressed closer to him with a
sad smile
not shame for you dear shame and you were never meant to come
together
he started and raised his head
yes shame he repeated almost fiercely his hands clinchedsuch
bitter debasing shame and disgrace for the first time the name we
have held for so many years will be stained and dragged in the dirt
what shall i do and he hid his face in his hands
then with a sudden start he rose and looked round with trembling
eagerness
ii must go to london he said brokenly what is the time so
late is there no train stella run and ask mrs penfold i must go at
onceat once every moment is of consequence
go to londontonightso late oh you cannot exclaimed stella
aghast
my dear i must he said more calmly it is urgent most urgent
business that calls for me and i must go
stella stole out of the room and was about to wake mrs penfold when
she remembered having seen a timetable in the kitchen and stealing
downstairs again hunted until she found it
when she took it into the studio she found her uncle standing with his
hat on and his coat buttoned
give it to me he said there is a train an early market train that
i can catch if i start at once and with trembling fingers he turned
over the pages of the timebook yes i must go stella
but not alone uncle she implored not alone surely you will let
me come with you
he put his hand upon her arm and kissed her his eyes moist
stella i must go alone no one can help me in this matter there are
some troubles that we must meet unaided except by a higher power this
is one of them heaven bless you my dear you help me to bear it with
your loving sympathy i wish i could tell you but i cannot stellai
cannot
do not then dear she whispered you will not be away long
not longer than i can help he sighed you will be quite safe
stella
safe and she smiled sadly
mrs penfold must take care of you i dont like leaving you but it
cannot be helped child i did not think to have a secret from you so
soon
at the words stella started and a red flush came over her face
she too had a secret and as it flashed into her mind from whence
the sudden trouble had momentarily banished it her heart beat fast and
her eyes drooped
there should be no secrets between us two he said
buttheretheredont look so troubled my dear i shall not be
long gone
she clung to him to the last until indeed the little white gate had
closed behind him then she went back to the house and sat down in his
chair and sat pondering and trembling
for a time the secret trouble which had befallen her uncle absorbed all
her mind and care but presently the memory of all that had happened
to her that evening awoke and overcame her sorrow and she sat with
clasped hands and drooping head recalling the handsome face and
passionate voice of lord leycester
it was all so wonderful so unreal that it seemed like a stage play
in which the magnificent house formed the scene and the noble men and
women the players with the tall stalwart graceful form of lord
leycester for the hero it was difficult to realize that she too took
a part so to speak in the drama that she was in fact the heroine
and that it was to her that all the passionate vows of the young lord
had been spoken she could feel his burning kisses on her lips could
feel the touch of the clinging lingering caresses on her neck yes it
was all real she loved lord leycester and he strange and wonderful
to add loved her
why should he do it she marveled who was she that he should deign to
shower down upon her such fervent admiration and passionate devotion
mechanically she rose and went over to the venetian mirror and looked
at the reflection which beamed softly in the dim light
he had called her beautiful lovely she shook her head and smiled with
a sigh as she thought of lady lenore there were beauty and loveliness
indeed how had it happened that he had passed her by and chosen her
stella
but it was so and wonder and gratitude and love welled up in her
heart and filled her eyes with those tears which show that the cup of
human happiness is full to overflowing the clock struck the hour and
with a sigh as she thought of her uncle she turned from the glass
she felt that she could not go to bed it was far pleasanter to sit
up in the stillness and silence and thinkthink to take one little
incident after another and go over it slowly and enjoyingly she
wandered about her room in this frame of mind filled with happiness
one moment as she thought of the great good which the gods had given
unto her then overwhelmed by a wave of troubled anxiety as she
remembered that her uncle the old man whose goodness to her had won
her love was speeding on the journey toward his secret trouble and
sorrow
wandering thus she suddenly bethought her of a picture that stood
with its face to the wall and swooping down on it as one does on
a suddenly remembered treasure she took up leycester wyndwards
portrait and gazing long and eagerly at it suddenly bent and kissed
it she knew now what the smile in those dark eyes meant she knew now
how the lovelight could flash from them
uncle was right she murmured with a smile that was half sad there
is no woman who could resist those eyes if they said i love you
she put the portrait down upon the cabinet so that she could see it
when she chose to look at it and abstractedly began to set the room
in order putting a picture straight here and setting the books upon
their shelves stopping occasionally to glance at the handsome eyes
watching her from the top of the cabinet as often happens when the
mind is set on one thing and the hands upon another she met with an
accident in one corner of the room stood a threecornered whatnot of
japanese work inclosed by doors inlaid with ivory and motherofpearl
in attempting to set a bronze straight upon the top of this piece of
furniture while she looked at the portrait of her hearts lord and
master she let the bronze slip and in the endeavor to save it from
falling overturned the whatnot
it fell with the usual brittle sounding crash which accompanies the
overthrow of such bricabrac and the doors being forced open out
poured a miscellaneous collection of valuable but useless articles
with a little exclamation of selfreproach and dismay stella went down
on her knees to collect the scattered curios they were of all sorts
bits of old china from japan medals and coins of ancient date and
some miniatures in carved frames
stella eyed each article as she picked it up with anxious criticism
but fortunately nothing appeared the worse for the downfall and she
was putting the last thing a miniature in its accustomed place
when the case flew open in her hand and a delicately painted portrait
on ivory looked up at her scarcely glancing at it she was about to
replace it in the case when an inscription on the back caught her eye
and she carried case and miniature to the light
the portrait was that of a boy a fairhaired boy with a smiling mouth
and laughing blue eyes it was a pretty face and stella turned it over
to read the inscription
it consisted of only one word frank
stella looked at the face again listlessly but suddenly
something in ita resemblance to someone whom she knew and that
intimatelyflashed upon her she looked again more curiously yes
there could be no doubt of it the face bore a certain likeness to
that of her uncle not only to her uncle but to herself for raising
her eyes from the portrait to the mirror she saw a vague somethingin
expression only perhapslooking at her from the glass as it did from
the portrait
frank frank she murmured i know no one of that name who can it
be
she went back to the cabinet and took out the other miniatures but
they were closed and the spring which she had touched accidentally of
the one of the boy she could not find in the others
there was an air of mystery about the matter which not a little
heightened by the lateness of the hour and the solemn silence that
reigned in the house oppressed and haunted her
with a little gesture of repudiation she put the boys face into its
covering and replaced it in the cabinet as she did so she glanced
up at that other face smiling down at her and started and a sudden
thought halfweird halfprophetical flashed across her mind
it was the portrait of lord leycester which had greeted her on the
night of her arrival and foreshadowed all that had happened to her
was there anything of significance in this chance discovery of the
childs face
with a smile of selfreproach she put the fantastic idea from her and
setting the beloved face in its place amongst the other canvases took
the candle from the table and stole quietly upstairs
but when she slept the boys face haunted her and mingled in her
dreams with that of lord leycesters
chapter xv
lord leycester stood for a minute or two looking after the carriage
that bore stella and her uncle away then he returned to the house
they were a hotheaded race these wyndwards and leycester was to
put it mildly as little capable of prudence or calculation as any of
his line but though his heart was beating fast and the vision of the
beautiful girl in all her young unstained loveliness danced before his
eyes as he crossed the hall even he paused a moment to consider the
situation with a grim smile he felt forced to confess that it was
rather a singular one
the heir of wyndward the hope of the house the heir to an ancient
name and a princely estate had plighted his troth to the niece of a
paintera girl be she beautiful as she might without either rank or
wealth to recommend her to his parents
he might have chosen from the highest and the wealthiest the highest
and the wealthiest had been so to speak at his feet he knew that
no dearer wish existed in his mothers heart of hearts than that he
should marry and settle well he was going to marry and settle but
what a marriage and settlement it would be instead of adding luster to
the already illustrious name instead of adding power to the already
influential race of wyndward it would in the earl and countesss
eyes in the opinion of the world be nothing but a mesalliance
he paused in the corridor the two footmen eying him with covert and
respectful attention and a smile curved his lips as he pictured to
himself the manner in which the proud countess would receive his avowal
of love for stella etheridge the painters niece
even as it was he was quite conscious that he had gone very far
indeed this evening toward provoking the displeasure of the countess
he had almost neglected the brilliant gathering for the sake of this
unknown girl he had left his mothers oldest friends even lady lenore
herself to follow stella how would they receive him
with a smile halfdefiant half anticipatory of amusement he motioned
to the servants to withdraw the curtain and entered the room
some of the ladies had already retired lady longford had gone for one
but lady lenore still sat on her couch attended by a circle of devoted
adherents as he entered the countess without seeming to glance at
him saw him and noticed the peculiar expression on his face
it was the expression which it always wore when he was on the brink of
some rashly mad exploit
leycester had plenty of couragetoo much some said he walked
straight up to the countess and stood over her
well mother he said almost as if he were challenging her what do
you think of her
the countess lifted her serene eyes and looked at him she would not
pretend to be ignorant of whom he meant
of miss etheridge she said i have not thought about her if i had
i should say that she was a very pleasantlooking girl
pleasantlooking he echoed and his eyebrows went up that is a
mild way of describing her she is more than pleasant
that is enough for a young girl in her position said the countess
or in any said a musical voice behind him and lord leycester
turning round saw lady lenore
that was well said he said nodding
she is more than pleasant said lady lenore smiling at him as if he
had won her warmest approbation by neglecting her all the evening she
is very pretty beautiful indeed and somay i say the word dear
lady wyndwardso fresh
the countess smiled with her even brows unclouded
a schoolgirl should be fresh as you put it lenore or she is
nothing
lord leycester looked from one to the other and his gaze rested on
lady lenores superb beauty with a complacent eye
to say that a man in love is blind to all women other than the one of
his heart is absurd it is not true he had never admired lady lenore
more than he did this moment when she spoke in stellas defense but he
admired her while he loved stella
you are right lenore he said she is beautiful
i admire her exceedingly said lady lenore smiling at him as if she
knew his secret and approved of it
the countess glanced from one to the other
it is getting late she said you must go now lenore
lady lenore bowed her head she like all else who came within the
circle of the mistress of wyndward obeyed her
very well i am a little tired goodnight
lord leycester took her hand but held it a moment he felt grateful to
her for the word spoken on stellas behalf
let me see you to the corridor said lord leycester
and with a bow which comprehended the other occupants of the room he
accompanied her
they walked in silence to the foot of the stairs then lady lenore held
out her hand
goodnight she said and happy dreams
he looked at her curiously was there any significance in her
wordsdid she know all that had passed between stella and himself
but nothing more significant met his scrutiny than the soft languor of
her eyes and pressing her hand as he bent over it he murmured
i wish you the same
she nodded smilingly to him and went away and he turned back to the
hall
as he did so the billiardroom door opened and lord charles put out
his head
one game ley he said
lord leycester shook his head
not tonight charlie
lord charles looked at him then laughed and withdrew his head
leycester sauntered down the hall and back again he felt very restless
and disinclined for bed stellas voice was ringing in his ears
stellas lips still clung with that last soft caress to his he could
not face the laughter and hard voices of the billiardroom it would
be profanation with a sudden turn he went lightly up the stairs and
entered his own room
throwing himself into a chair he folded his arms behind his head and
closed his eyes to call up a vision of the girl who had rested on his
breastwhose sweet pure lips had murmured i love you
my darling he whisperedmy darling love i have never known it
till now and i shall see you tomorrow and hear you whisper that
again i love you and its me she loves not the viscount and heir
to wyndward but me leycester leycesterit was a hard ugly name
until she spoke itnow it sounds like music stella my star my
angel
suddenly his reverie was disturbed by a knock at the door with a
start he came back to reality and got up but before he could reach
the door it opened and the countess came in
not in bed she said with a smile
i have only just come up he replied
the countess smiled again
you have been up nearly half an hour
he was almost guilty of a blush
so long he said i must have been thinking
and he laughed as he drew a chair forward he waited until she was
seated before he resumed his own never by word or deed did he permit
himself to grow lax in courtesy to her and then he looked up at her
with a smile
have you come for a chat my lady he said calling her by her title
in the mockserious way in which he was accustomed to address her when
they were alone
yes i have come for a chat leycester she said quietly
does that mean a scold he asked raising his eyebrows but still
smiling your tone is suspicious mother well i am at your mercy
i have nothing to scold you for said the countess leaning back in
the comfortable chairall the chairs were comfortable in these rooms
of his do you feel that you deserve one
lord leycester was silent if he had answered he might have been
compelled to admit that perhaps there was some excuse for complaint in
regard to his conduct that evening silence was safest
no i have not come to scold you leycester i dont think i have ever
done that said the countess softly
no you have been the best of mothers my lady he responded i
never saw you in an ill temper in my life perhaps that is why you look
so young you do look absurdly young you know he added gazing at
her with affectionate admiration
when the countess seemed lost in thought leycester added
devereux says that the majority of english wives and mothers look so
girlish that he believes it must be the custom to marry them when they
are children
the countess smiled
lord devereux is master of fine phrases leycester yes i was married
very young
then she looked round the room a strange reluctance to commence the
task she had set herself took possession of her
you have made your rooms very pretty leycester
he leant back watching her with a smile
you havent come to talk about my rooms mother
then she straightened herself for her work
no leycester i have come to talk about you
rather an uninteresting subject however proceed
you may make it very hard for me said the countess with a little
sigh
he smiled
then you have come to scold
no only to advise
that is generally the same thing under another name
i do not often do it said the countess in a low voice
forgive me he said stooping forward and kissing her now mother
fire away what is it not about that race moneyyou dont want me to
give up the horses
the countess smiled almost scornfully
why should i leycester they cost a great deal of money but if they
amuse you why and she shrugged her shoulders slightly
they do cost a great deal of money he said with a laugh but i
dont know that they amuse me very much i dont think anything amuses
me very greatly
then the countess looked at him
when a man talks like that leycester it generally means that it is
time he was married
he half expected what was coming but he looked grave nevertheless he
turned to her with a smile
isnt that rather a desperate remedy my lady he said i can give
up my horses if they cease to amuse me and bore me too much i can give
up most of the other socalled amusements but marriagesupposing
that should fail it would be rather serious
why should it fail
it does sometimes he retorted gravely
not when love enters into it she answered gently
he was silent his eyes bent on the ground from which seemed to rise a
slim girlish figure with stellas face and eyes
there is no greater happiness than that which marriage affords when
one is married to the person one loves do you think your father has
been unhappy leycester
he turned to her with a smile
every manfew men have his luck my lady will you find me another
lady ethel
she colored this was a direct question and she longed to answer it
but she dared notnot just yet
the world is full of fond loving women she said
he nodded he thought he knew one at least and his eyes went to that
mental vision of stella again
leycester i want to see you married and settled she murmured after
a pause it is time it is fitting that you should be ill put the
question of your own happiness aside for the moment there are other
things at stake
you would not like me to be the last earl of wyndward mother the
title would die with me would it not
yes she said that must not be leycester
he shook his head with a quiet smile no it should not be he thought
i wonder she continued that the thing has not come about before
this and without any word of mine i dont think you are very
hardhearted unimpressionable leycester you and i have met some
beautiful women and some good and pure ones i should not have been
surprised if you had come to me with the confession of your conquest
long ago you would have come to me would you not leycester she
asked
a faint flush stole over his face and his eyes dropped slightly he
did not answer for a moment and she went on as if he had assented
i should have been very glad to have heard of it i should have
welcomed your choice very heartily
are you sure he said almost mechanically
quite she answered serenely your wife will be a second daughter
to me i hope leycester i know that i should love her if you do are
we ever at variance
never until tonight he might have answered but he remained silent
what if he should turn to her with the frank openness with which he had
gone to her in all his troubles and joys and say
i have made my choicewelcome her she is stella etheridge the
painters daughter
but he could not do this he knew so well how she would have looked at
him saw already with full prophetic insight the calm serene smile of
haughty incredulity with which she would have received his demand he
was silent
you wonder why i speak to you about this tonight leycester
a little he said with a smile that had very little mirth in it he
felt that he was doing what he had never done beforeconcealing his
heart from her meeting her with secrecy and evasion and his proud
finelytempered mind revolted at the necessity for it a little i was
just considering that i had not grown older by a score of years and
had not been doing anything particularly wild have they been telling
you any dreadful stories about me mother and persuading you that
matrimony is the only thing to save me from ruin and he laughed
the countess colored
no one tells me any stories respecting you leycester for the
simple reason that i should not listen to them i have nothing to do
withwith your outer life unless you yourself make me part and parcel
of it i am not afraid that you will do anything bad or dishonorable
leycester
thanks he said quietly then what is it mother why does this
advice press so closely on your soul that you feel constrained to
unburden yourself
because i feel that the time has come she said because i have your
happiness and welfare so closely at heart that i am obliged to watch
over you and secure them for you if i can
there never was a mother like you he said gently but this is a
serious step my lady and i amshall i say slightly unprepared you
speak to me as if i were a sultan and had but to throw my handkerchief
at any fair maid whom i may fancy to obtain her
the countess looked at him and for a moment all her passionate pride
in him shone in her eyes
is there no one to whom you think you could throw that handkerchief
leycester she asked significantly
his face flushed and his eyes glowed at that moment he felt the warm
lips of his girllove resting on his own
that is a blunt question my lady he said would it be fair to
reply fair to her supposing that there be one
in whom should you confide but in me said the countess with a touch
of hauteur in her voice hauteur softened by love
he looked down and turned the ruby ring on his finger if he could but
confide in her
in whom else but in me from whom you have i think had few secrets
if your choice is made you would come to me leycester i think you
would i cannot imagine your acting otherwise you see i have no
fearand she smiledno fear that your choice would be anything but
a good and a wise one i know you so well leycester you have been
wildyou yourself said it not i
yes he said quietly
but through it all you have not forgotten the race from whence you
sprung the name you bear no i do not fear that most disastrous of
all mistakes which a man in your position can makea mesalliance
he was silent but his brows drew together
you speak strangely my lady he said almost grimly
yes she assented calmly serenely but with a grave intensity in
her tone which lent significance to every wordyes i feel strongly
every mother who has a son in your position feels as strongly i doubt
not there are few mad things that you can do which will not admit of
remedy and rectification one of them the worst of them is a foolish
marriage
marriages are made in heaven he murmured
no she said gently a great many are made in a very different
place but why need we talk of this we might as well discuss whether
it would be wise of you to commit manslaughter or burglary or
suicide or any other vulgar crimeand indeed a mesalliance would in
your case strongly resemble one suicide it would be social suicide
at least and from what i know of your nature leycester i do not
think that would suit you
i think not he said grimly but mother i am not contemplating a
matrimonial union with one of the dairymaids not at present
she smiled
you might commit a mesalliance with one in higher position leycester
but why do we talk of this
i think you commenced it he said
did i she said sweetly i beg your pardon i feel as if i had
insulted you by the mere chance mention of such a thing and i have
tired you too
and she rose with queenly grace
no no he said rising i am very grateful mother you will
believe that
will you be more than that she asked putting her hand on his
shoulder and sliding it round his neck will you be obedient
and she smiled at him lovingly
will i get out the handkerchief do you mean he asked looking at
her with a curious gaze
yes she replied make me happy by throwing it
and suppose he said that the favored damsel declines the honor
we will risk that she murmured with a smile
he laughed
one would think you had already chosen mother he said
she looked at him with the smile still shining in her eyes and on her
lips
suppose i have there is no matchmaker like a mother
he started
you have you surprise me may one ask on whom your choice has fallen
sultaness
think she said in a low voice
i am thinking very deeply he answered with hidden meaning
if i were left to choose for you i should be very exacting
leycester dont you think
i am afraid so he said with a smile every goose thinks her
bantling a swan and would mate it with an eagle forgive me mother
she inclined her head
i should require much i should want beauty wealth
of which we have too much already go on
rank and what is still better a high position the wyndwards cannot
troop with crows leycester
beauty wealth rank and a mysterious sort of position a princess
perhaps my lady
a proud light shone in her eyes
i should not feel abased in the presence of a princess if you brought
her to me she said with that serene hauteur which characterized her
no i am satisfied with less than that leycester
i am relieved he said smiling and this exalted personageparagon
i should saywho is she
look roundyou need not strain your vision she returned i can see
her now oh blind blind that you cannot see her also she whom i
see is more than all these she is a woman with a loving heart in her
bosom that needs but a word to set it beating foryou
his face flushed
i can think of no one he said you make one ashamed mother
i need not tell you her name then she said
but he shook his head
i must know it now i think he said gravely
she was silent a moment then she said in a low voice
it is lenore leycester
he drew away from her so that her arm fell from his shoulder and
looked her full in the face
before him rose the proud imperial figure before him stood the lovely
face of lenore with its crown of golden hair and its deep eloquent
eyes of violet and beside it hovering like a spirit the face of his
girllove
the violet eyes seemed to gaze at him with all the strength of
conscious loveliness seemed to bend upon him with a glance of
defiance as if they saidi am here waiting i smile you cannot
resist me and the dark tender eyes beside them seemed to turn upon
him with gentle passionate pleading praying him to be constant and
faithful
lenore he said in a low voice mother ought you to have said
this
she did not shrink from his almost reproachful gaze
why should i hesitate when my sons happiness is at stake she said
calmly if i saw a treasure some pearl of great price lying at your
feet and felt that you were passing it by unnoticed and disregarded
should i be wrong in speaking the word that would place it in your
grasp your happiness is mylife leycester if ever there was a
treasure a pearl of great price among women it is lenore are you
passing her by you will not do that
never since he could remember had he seen her so moved her voice
was calm and even as usual but her eyes were warm with an intense
earnestness the diamonds trembled on her neck
he stood before her looking away beyond her a strange trouble at his
heart for the first time he sawhe appreciated ratherthe beautiful
girl whom as it were she held up to his mental gaze but that
other that girllove whose lips still seemed to murmur i love you
leycester what of her
with a sudden start he moved away
i do not think you should have spoken he said you cannot know
the countess smiled
a mothers eyes are quick she said a word and the pearl is at your
feet leycester
he was but a man warmblooded and impressionable and for a moment his
face flushed but the i love you still rang in his ears
if that be so all the more cause for silence mother he said but
i hope you are mistaken
i am not mistaken she said do you think and she smiled that
i should have spoken if i had not been sure oh leycester and she
moved toward him think of her is there any beauty so beautiful as
hers is there any one woman you have ever met who possessed a tithe of
her charms think of her as the head of the house think of her in my
place
he put up his hand
think of her she went on quickly as your own your very own
leycester there is no man born who could turn away from her
almost involuntarily he turned and went to the fireplace and leant
upon it
there is no man who so turning but would in time give all that he
possessed to come back to her
then her voice changed
leycester you have been very good are you angry
no he said and he went to her not angry butbut troubled you
think only of me but i think of lenore
think of her still she said and be sure that i have made no
mistake if you doubt me put it to the test
he started
and you will find that i am right i am going now leycester
goodnight and she kissed him
he went to the door and opened it his face was pale and grave
goodnight he said gently you have given me something to think of
with a vengeance and he forced a smile
she went out without a word her maid was waiting for her in her
dressingroom but she passed into the inner room and sank down in a
chair and for the first time her face was pale and her eyes anxious
it has gone further than i thought she murmured i who know every
look in his eyes read his secret but it shall not be i will save him
yet but how but how
poor stella
lord leicester left alone fell to pacing the room his brow bent his
mind in a turmoil
he loved his mother with a passionate devotion part and parcel of
his nature every word she had said had sunk into his mind he loved
her and he knew her he knew that she would rather die than give her
consent to his marriage with such an one as stella pure and good and
sweet though she was
he was greatly troubled but he stood firm
come what will he murmured i cannot part with her she is my
treasure and pearl of great price and i have not passed her by my
darling
suddenly breaking into his reverie came a knock at the door
he went to open it but it opened before he could reach it and lord
charles walked in
there was a smile on his handsome lighthearted face which barely hid
an expression of affectionate sympathy
anything the matter old man he said closing the door
yesnonot muchwhy said leycester forcing a smile
why echoed lord charles thrusting his hands into the huge pockets
of his dressinggown and eying him with mock reproach can you ask
when you remember that my room is exactly underneath yours and that it
sounds as if you had turned this into the den of a traveling menagerie
what are you wearing the carpet out for ley and he sat down and
looked up at the troubled face with that frank sincerity which invites
confidence
im in a fix said leycester
come on said lord charles curtly
i cant you cant help me in this said leycester with a sigh
lord charles rose at once
then ill go i wish i could what have you been doing
leysomething tonight i expect never mind if i can help you
youll let me know
leycester threw him a cigarcase
sit down and smoke charlie he said i cant open my mind but i
want to think and youll help me is it late
awfully said lord charles with a yawn what a jolly evening it has
been i say ley havent you been carrying it on rather thick with
that pretty girl with the dark eyes
leycester paused in his task of lighting a cigar and looked down at
him
which girl he said with a little touch of hauteur in his face
the painters niece said lord charles what a beautiful girl she
is reminds me of a whatdoyoucallit
what is that
aa gazelle its rather a pity that she should be intended for that
saucy lawyer fellow
what asked lord leycester quietly
havent you heard said lord charles grimly the fellows were
talking about it in the billiardroom
about what demanded lord leycester still quietly though his
eyes glittered stella the common talk of the billiardroom it was
desecration
oh it was longford he knows the man
what man
this jasper adelstone she is engaged to
lord leycester held the cigar to his lips and his teeth closed over it
with a sudden fierce passion
coming upon all that had passed this was the last straw
its a lie he said
lord charles looked up with a start then his face grew grave
perhaps so he said but after all it cant matter to you ley
lord leycester turned away in silence
chapter xvi
jasper adelstone was in love
it was some time before he would bring himself to admit it even to
himself for he was wont to pride himself on his superiority to all
attacks of the tender passion
often and often had he amused himself and his chosen companions by
ridiculing the conditions of those weak mortals who allowed themselves
to be carried away by what he termed a weak and contemptible affection
for the other sex
marriage he used to say was entirely a matter of business a man
didnt marry until he was obliged and then only did so to better
himself as to love and that kind of thingwell it was an exploded
ideaa myth which had died out at any rate too absurd a thing
altogether for a man possessed of common sensefor such a man for
instance as jasper adelstone he had seen plenty of pretty women and
was received by them with anything but disfavor he was goodlooking
almost handsome and would have been that if he could have got rid
of the sharp cunning glint of his small eyes and he was clever and
accomplished he was just the man it would have been supposed to
fall a victim to the tender passion but he had stuck fast by his
principles and gone stealthily along the road to success with his
cold smile ready for everyone in general and not a warm beam in his
heart for anyone in particular
and now yes he was in lovein love as deeply unreasoningly as
impulsively as the veriest schoolboy
this was very annoying it would have been very annoying if the object
of his passion had been an heiress or the lady of title whom he had in
his inmost mind determined to marry if he married at all for he would
have preferred to have attained to his ambition without any awkward and
inconvenient lovemaking
but the girl who had inspired him with this sudden and unreasoning
passion was much to his disgust neither an heiress nor an offshoot of
nobility
she was a mere nobodythe niece of an obscure painter she was not
even in society
there was no good to be got by marrying her none whatever she could
not help him a single step on his ambitious path through life on the
first evening of his meeting with stella when the beauty and more
than her beauty the nameless charm of her bright pure freshness
overwhelmed and startled him he took himself to task very seriously
jasper he said you wont go and make a fool of yourself i hope
she is entirely out of your line she is only a pretty girl youve
seen a score a hundred as pretty or prettier and shes a mere
nobody oh no you wont make a fool of yourselfyoull go back to
town tomorrow morning
but he did not go back to town instead he went into the conservatory
at the rectory and made up a bouquet and took it to the cottage and
sank deeper still into the mire of foolishness as he would have called
it
but even then it was not too late he might have escaped even then
by dint of calling up his selfish nature and thinking of all his
ambitions but stella unfortunately rousedwhat was more powerful in
him than his sudden lovehis selfconceit
she actually dared to defend lord leycester wyndward
that was almost the finishing stroke unwittingly dealt by stella and
he went away inwardly raging with incipient jealousy
but the last straw was yet to come that should break the back of all
his prudent resolves and that was the meeting with stella and lord
leycester in the riverwoods and lord leycesters attack on him
that momentthe moment when he lay on the ground looking up at
the dark handsome angry and somewhat scornful face of the young
peerjasper adelstone registered a vow
he vowed that come what would by fair means or foul he would have
stella
he vowed that he would snatch her from the haughty and fiery young lord
who had dared to hurl him jasper to the dust and insult him
what love he already possessed for her suddenly sprang up into a
fierce flame of jealous passion and as he rode home to the rectory he
repeated that vow several times and at once without the loss of an
hour began to hunt about for some means to fulfill it
he was no fool this jasper adelstone for all his conceit and he knew
the immense odds against him if lord leycester really meant anything
by his attention to stella he knew what fearful advantages leycester
heldall the court cards were in his hands he was handsome renowned
noble wealthya suitor whom the highest in the land would think twice
about before refusing
he almost guessed too that stella already loved leycester he had
seen her face turned to the young lordhad heard her voice as she
spoke to him
he ground his teeth together with vicious rage as he thought of the
difference between her way of speaking to him and to leycester
but she shall speak to me look at me like that before the game is
over he swore to himself i can afford to wait for my opportunity
it will come and i shall know how to use it curse him yes i am
determined now i will take him from her
it was a bold audacious resolution but then jasper was both bold
and audacious in the most dangerous of ways in the cold calculating
manner of a cunning unscrupulous man
he was cleverundoubtedly clever he had been very successful and
had made that success by his own unaided efforts already young as he
was he was beginning to be talked about when people were in any great
difficulty in his branch of the law they went to him sure of finding
him cool ready and capable
his chambers in the inn held a little museum of secretssecrets about
persons of rank and standing who were supposed to be quite free from
such inconvenient things as skeletons in cupboards
people came to him when they were in any social fix when they owed
more money than they could pay when they wanted a divorce or were
anxious to hush up some secret whose threatened disclosure involved
shame and disgrace and jasper adelstone was always ready with sound
advice and better still some subtle scheme or plan
yes he was a successful man and had failed so seldomalmost
neverthat he felt he could be confident in this matter too
i have always done well for others he thought i have gained some
difficult points for other people now i will undertake this difficult
matter for myself
he went home to the rectory and pondered recalling all he knew of old
etheridge it was very little and the rector could tell him no more
than he knew already
james etheridge lived the life of a recluse appearing to have no
friends or relations save stella nothing was known about his former
life he had come down into the quiet valley some years ago and
settled at once in the mode of existence which was palpable to all
is he was he ever married asked jasper
the rector thought not
i dont know he said he certainly hasnt been married down here i
dont think anything is known about him
and with this jasper had to be content all the next day after his
meeting with stella and leycester he strolled about the meadows hoping
to see her but failed he knew he ought to be in london but he could
not tear himself away
his arm felt a little stiff and though there was nothing else the
matter with it he bound it up and hung it in a sling explaining to
the rector that he had fallen from his horse
then he heard of the party at the hall and grinding his teeth with
envy and malice he stole into the lane and watched stella start
in his eyes she looked doubly beautiful since he had sworn to have
her and he wandered about the lane and meadows thinking of her and
thinking too of lord leycester all that evening waiting for her to
return to get one look at her
fortune favored him with more than a look for while he was waiting
the boy from the postoffice came down the lane and jasper with very
little difficulty persuaded him to give up the telegram to his keeping
i am sorry to say that jasper was very much tempted to open that
telegram and if he resisted the temptation it was not in consequence
of any pangs of conscience but because he thought that it would
scarcely be worth while
it is only some commission for a picture he said to himself people
dont communicate secretly by telegram excepting in cipher
so he delivered it unopened as we know but when he heard that sudden
exclamation of the old mans he was heartily sorry he had not opened it
when he parted from stella at the gate he walked off down the lane
but only until out of sight and then returned under the shadow of the
hedge and waited
he could see into the studio and see the old man sitting in the chair
bowed with sorrow and stellas graceful figure hovering about him
there was something worth knowing in that telegram he muttered i
was a fool not to make myself acquainted with it what will he do now
he thought the question out still watching and the old mans
movements seen plainly through the lighted windowsfor stella had only
drawn the muslin curtain too hurriedly and imperfectlyafforded an
answer
he is going up to town he muttered
he knew that there was an early market train and felt sure that the
old man was going by it
hastily glancing at his watch he set his hat firmly on his head
dipped his arm out of the sling and ran toward the rectory entering
by a side door he went to his room took a bag containing some
papers secured his coat and umbrella and leaving a note on the
breakfasttable to the effect that he was suddenly obliged to go to
town made for the station
as he did not wish to be seen he kept in the shadow and waited and
was rewarded in a few minutes by the appearance of mr etheridge
there was no one on the station beside themselves and jasper had
no difficulty in keeping out of the old mans way a sleepy porter
sauntered up and down yawning and swinging his lantern and jasper
decided that he wouldnt trouble him by taking a ticket
the train came up mr etheridge got into a firstclass carriage and
jasper waiting until the last moment sprang into one at the further
end of the train
never mind the ticket he said to the porter ill pay at the other
end
the train was an express from wyndward and jasper who knew how to
take care of himself pulled the curtains closed drew a traveling cap
from his bag and curling himself up went to sleep while the old man
a few carriages further off sat with his white head bowed in sorrowful
and wakeful meditation
when the train arrived at the terminus jasper awaking from a
refreshing sleep drew aside the curtain and watched mr etheridge get
out waited until he approached the cabstand then following up behind
him nearer heard him tell the cabman to drive him to kings hotel
covent garden
then jasper called a cab and drove to the square in which his chambers
were situated dismissed the cab and saw it crawl away out of sight
and climbed up the staircase which served as the approach to the many
doors which lined the narrow grim passages
on one of these doors his name was inscribed in black letters he
opened this door with a key struck a light and lit a candle which
stood on a ledge and entered a small room which served for the purpose
of a clerks office and a clients waitingroom
beyond this and communicating by a green baize door was his own
businessroom but there were still other rooms behind one his
livingroom another in which he slept and beyond that a smaller room
he entered this and holding the light on high allowed its rays to fall
upon a man lying curled up on a small bed
he was a very small man with a thin parchmentlined face crowned by
closelycropped hair which is ambiguously described as auburn
this was jaspers clerk factotum slave he it was who sat in the
outer office and received the visitors and ushered them into jaspers
presence or put them off with excuses
he was a singularlooking man no particular age or individuality some
of jaspers friends were often curious as to where jasper had picked
him up but jasper always evaded the question or put it by with some
jest and scrivells antecedents remained a mystery
that he was a devoted and never tiring servant was palpable to all
in jaspers presence he seemed to live only to obey his will and
anticipate his wishes now at the first touch of jaspers hand the
man started and sat bolt upright screening his eyes from the light and
staring at jasper expectantly
awake scrivell asked jasper
yes sir quite was the reply and indeed he looked as if he had
been on the alert for hours past
thats right i want you get up and dress and come into the next
room ill leave the candle
you neednt sir was the reply i can see
jasper nodded
i believe you canlike a cat he said and carried the card with him
in a few minutesin a very few minutesthe door opened and scrivell
entered
he looked wofully thin and emaciated was dressed in an old but still
respectable suit of black and might have been taken for an old man but
for the sharp alert look in his gray eyes and the sandy hair which
showed no signs of gray
jasper was sitting before his dressingtable opening his letters which
he had carried in from the other room
oh here you are he said i want you to go out
scrivell nodded
do you know kings hotel covent garden asked jasper
kings yes sir
well i want you to go down there
he paused but he might have known the man would not express any
surprise
yes sir he said as coolly as if jasper had told him to go to bed
again
i want you to go down there and keep a lookout for me a gentleman
has just driven there an old man rather bent with long white hair
understand
yes was the quiet reply
he will probably go out the first thing quite early i want to know
where he goes
only the first place he goes to was the question
jasper hesitated
suppose you keep an eye upon him generally till say one oclock
then come back to me i want to know his movements you understand
scrivell
i understand sir was the answer any name
jasper hesitated a moment and a faint color came into his face
somehow he was conscious of a strange reluctance to mention the
nameher name but he overcame it
yes etheridge he said quietly but that doesnt matter dont
make any inquiries at the hotel or elsewhere if you can help it
very good sir said the man and noiselessly he turned and left the
room
little did stella dreaming in the cottage by the sweet smelling
meadows and the murmuring river think that the first woof of the web
which jasper adelstone was spinning for her was commenced that night in
the grim chambers of lincolnsinn
as little did lady wyndward guess as she lay awake vainly striving to
find some means of averting the consequences of her sons infatuation
for the painters niece that a keener and less scrupulous mind had
already set to work in the same direction
chapter xvii
jasper undressed and went to bed and slept as soundly as men of his
peculiar caliber do sleep while scrivell was standing at the corner
of a street in covent garden with his hands in his pockets and his
eyes on the entrance to kings hotel a little after nine jasper awoke
had his bath dressed went out got some breakfast and sat down to
work and for the time being forgotactually forgotthat such an
individual as stella etheridge existed
that was the secret of his power that he could concentrate his
attention on one subject to the absolute abnegation of all others
several visitors put in an appearance on business jasper opening the
door by means of a wire which drew back the handle without moving
at about halfpast twelve someone knocked jasper opened the door and
a tall fashionablydressed young gentleman entered
it was a certain captain halliday who had been one of the guests at
wyndward hall on the first night of our introduction there
captain halliday was a man about town one who had been rich but who
had worked very hard to make himself poorand nearly succeeded he
was a wellknown man and a member of a fast club at which high play
formed the chief amusement
jasper knew him socially and got upa thing he did not often doto
shake hands
how do you do he said motioning him to a chair anything i can do
for you
it was generally understood by jaspers acquaintances that jaspers
time was money and they respected the hours devoted by him to business
captain halliday smiled
you always come to the point adelstone he replied yes i want a
little advice
jasper sat down and clasped his hands over his knee they were very
white and carefullykept hands
hope i may be able to give it to you what is it
well look here said the captain you dont mind my smoking a
cigarette do you i can always talk better while i am smoking
not at alli like it said jasper
but the lady clients said the captain with a little contraction of
the eyelids which was suspiciously near a wink
i dont think they mind said jasper they are generally too
occupied with their own business to notice a light and he handed the
wax tapers which stood on his desk for sealing purposes
the captain lighted his cigarette slowly it was evident that the
matter upon which he required advice was delicate and only to be
attacked with much deliberation
look here he began ive come upon rather an awkward business
jasper smiled it not unfrequently happened that his clients came
to him for money and not unfrequently he managed to find some for
themof course through some friend always through some friend in
the city who demanded and obtained a tolerably large interest
jasper smiled and wondered how much the captain wanted and whether it
would be safe to lend it
what is it he said
you know the rookery asked the captain
jasper nodded
i was there the other nightim there every night im afraid he
added but i am referring to the night before last
yes said jasper intending to help him and luck went against you
and you lost a pile
no i didnt said the captain i won a pile
i congratulate you said jasper with a cool smile
i won a pile said the captain from all round but principally from
a young fellowa mere boy who was there as a visitor introduced by
young bellamyknow young bellamy
yes yes said jasperhe was very busy everybody knows bellamy
well
well the young fellowi was awfully sorry for him and tried to
persuade him to turn it up but he wouldnt you know what youngsters
are when they are green at this confounded game
jasper nodded again rather more impatiently scrivell would be back
directly and he was anxious to hear the result of his scrutiny
luck went with him at first and he won a good deal but it turned
after a time and i was the better by a cool hundred and fifty i
stopped at thatit was too much as it was to win from a youngster and
he gave me his i o u
the captain paused and lit another cigarette
next morning being rather presseddid i tell you i went home with
gooch and one or two others and lost the lot he broke off simply
jasper smiled
no you did not mention it but i can quite believe it go on
next morning being rather pressedi wanted to pay my own i o usi
looked him up to collect his
and he put you off and you want me to help you said jasper smiling
behind his white hand
no i dont i wish youd hear me out said the captain not
unnaturally aggrieved by the repeated interruption
i beg your pardon said jasper i thought i should help to bring you
to the point but there tell it your own way
he didnt refuse he gave me a bill said the captain said he was
sorry he couldnt manage the cash but expecting me to call had got a
bill ready
which you naturally declined to accept from a perfect stranger said
jasper
which i did nothing of the sort said the captain coolly it was
backed by bellamy and that was good enough for me bellamys name
written across the back making himself responsible for the money if
the young fellow didnt pay
i understand what a bill is said jasper with a smile
of course assented the captain puffing at his cigarette bellamys
name mind which was good enough for me
and for most people
well i meant to get some fellow to discount this get some money for
it you know but happening to meet bellamy at the club it occurred to
me that he mightnt like the bill hawked about so i asked him if hed
take it up see
quite whether hed give you the money for itthe hundred and fifty
pounds i see said jasper well
well i put it rather delicatelythere was a lot of fellows
aboutand he didnt seem to understand me what bill do you mean old
man he said i took an oath not to fly any more paper a year ago
and ive kept it by george
jasper leant forward slightly the keen hard look which comes into the
eyes of a hound that suddenly scents game came into his but this time
he did not speak as was usual with him when interested he remained
silent
well i flatter myself i played a cool hand said the captain
complacently flicking the ash from his cigarette i knew the bill was
aa
forgery said jasper coldly
the captain nodded gravely
a forgery but i felt for the poor young beggar and didnt want to
be hard on him so i pretended to bellamy that id made a mistake and
meant somebody else and explained that id been at the champagne
rather freely the other night andyou know bellamyhe was satisfied
well said jasper in a low voice
well then i took a cab and drove to 22 percival street
he paused abruptly and bit his lip but jasper though he heard the
address and had stamped it as it were on his memory showed no sign
of having noticed it and examined his nails curiously
i drove to the young fellows rooms and he confessed to it poor
young beggar i pitied him from the bottom of my hearti did indeed
wrong i know justice and example and all that youll say but if
youd seen him with his head buried in his hands and his whole frame
shaking like a leaf why youd have pitied him yourself
jasper put up his hand to his mouth to hide a sneer
very likely he saidmost likely i have a particularly soft heart
forforgers
the captain started slightly it was a horrible word
i dont believe the young beggar meant it not in cold blood you
know but he was so knocked of a heap by my dropping down upon him and
so afraid of looking like a welsher that the idea of the bill struck
him and he did it he swears that bellamy and he are such chums that
bellamy wouldnt have minded
ah said jasper with a smile the judge and jury will look at that
in a different light
the judge and jury what do you mean demanded the captain you
dont think im going towhatsitsnameprosecute
then what are you here for jasper was going to say but politely
corrected it to then what can i do for you
well heres the strange part of the story i went home to find the
bill and tear it up
jasper smiled again and again hid the delicate sneer
but if youll believe me i couldnt find it what do you think id
done with it
i dont know said jasper lit your cigar with it
no in a fit of absence of mindwell call it champagne cup and
brandyandsodaid given it to old murphy with some other bills in
payment of a debt think of that theres that poor young beggar almost
out of his mind with remorse and terror and that old wretch murphy
has got that bill and if it isnt got from him hell have the law of
youngof the boy as sure as fate is fate
yes i know murphy said jasper with delicious coolness hed be
so wild that hed not rest satisfied until hed sent your fast young
friend across the herringpond
but he mustnt i should never forgive myself think of it adelstone
quite a young boya curlyheaded young beggar that ought to be
forgiven a little thing of this sort
a little thing and jasper laughed
he also rose and looked as if he had already expended as much of his
time as he could afford
well he said
well echoed the captain now i want you to send for that bill
adelstone and get it at once
certainly said jasper i may be permitted to mention that you
are doing rather awell very injudicious thing you are losing a
hundred and fifty pounds to save your gentleman fromwell departing
for that bourne to which he will certainly sooner or later wend he
will get transported sooner or later a youngster who begins like this
always goes on why lose a hundred and fifty pounds but there he
added seeing a look of quiet determination on the captains honest
if simple face that is your business mine is to give you advice
and ive done it if youll write a check for the amount ill send
my clerk over to murphys he is out at present but hell be back
looking at the clock before you have written the check and he
handed the captain a pen and motioned him politely to the desk
but the captain changed color and laughed with some embarrassment
look here he said look here adelstone it isnt quite convenient
to write a checkconfound it you talk as if i had the old balance at
my bankers i cant do it i ask you to lend me the moneysee
jasper gave a start of surprise though he felt none he knew what had
been coming
im very sorry my dear fellow he said but im afraid i cant do
it i am very short this morning and have some heavy matters to meet
ive been buying some shares for a client and am quite cleared out for
the present
but pleaded the captain earnestly more earnestly than he had ever
pleaded for a loan on his own account but think of the youngster
adelstone
then jasper smileda hard cold smile
excuse me halliday he said thrusting his hands in his pockets
but i have been thinking of him and i cant see my way to doing this
for a young scoundrel
hes no scoundrel said the captain with a flush
a young forger then if you prefer it my dear fellow said jasper
with a cold laugh who ought to be punished if anyone deserves
punishment why it is compounding a felony he added virtuously
oh come said the captain with a troubled smile thats nonsense
you talking like that i want the matter hushed up adelstone
well though i dont agree with you i wont argue the matter said
jasper but i cant lend you the money to hush it up with halliday
if it were for yourself now
there was something in jaspers cold face in his compressed almost
sneering lips and hard keen eyes that convinced the captain any
further time expended in endeavoring to soften jasper adelstones heart
would be time wasted
never mind he said im sorry ive taken up your time
goodmorning of course this is quite confidential you know eh
jasper raised his eyebrows and smiled pleasantly
my dear halliday you are in a lawyers office nothing that occurs
within these walls gets out unless the client wishes it your little
story is as safely locked up in my bosom as if you had never told it
goodmorning
the captain put on his hat and turned to go but at that moment the
door opened and scrivell entered
i beg pardon he said and drew back but paused and instead of
going out walked up to jaspers desk and laid a piece of paper on it
jasper took it up eagerly there was one line written on it and it was
this
22 percival street
jasper did not start he did not even change color but his lips
tightened and a gleam of eagerness shot from his eyes
with the paper in his hand he looked up carelessly
all right scrivell oh by the way just run after captain halliday
and tell him i should like another word with him
scrivell disappeared and in another minute the captain reentered
he still looked rather downcast
what is it he said with his hand on the door
jasper went and closed it then he laughed in his quiet noiseless way
im afraid youll think me a soft kind of lawyer halliday but this
story of yours has touched me it has indeed
the captain nodded and dropped into a chair
i thought it had he said simply touch anybody wouldnt it
yes yes said jasper with a sigh its very wrong you
knowaltogether out of the line but i suppose youve set your heart
on hushing it up eh
i have indeed said the captain eagerly and if you knew all youd
say the same
havent you told me all said jasper quietly i dont mean the
boys name you can keep that if you like
no i dont mean to conceal anything if youll help me said the
captain ingenuously of course if you had decided not to i should
have kept dark about his name
of course said jasper with a smile and he glanced at the slip of
paper well perhaps youd better tell me all hadnt you
i think i had assented the captain well the youngsters name
isetheridge
etherhow do you spell it asked jasper carelessly
the captain spelt it
not a common name and hes anything but a common boy hes a handsome
youngster and i couldnt help pitying him because he has been left to
himself so muchno friends and all that sort of thing
hows that asked jasper with his eyes cast down a hungry eagerness
eating at his heart there was some mystery after all then about the
old man
well it is this way it seems hes the son of an old mana painter
or a writer or something who lives away in the country and who cant
bear this boy near him
why asked jasper examining his nails
because hes like his mother said the captain simply
and she said jasper softly
she ran away with another man and left her boy behind
i understand
yes resumed the captain usual thing the husband this boys
father was awfully cut up left the world and buried himself and sent
the boy away treated him very well though all the same sent him to
eton and to cambridge under the care of a tutor and that sort of
thing but couldnt bear to see him hes up now for the holidaysthe
boy i mean
i understand said jasper in a low voice quite a story isnt it
andhe paused to throw the piece of paper on the firedo you think
the boy has communicated with the father ever since
heaven knowsnot unlikely he said something about telegraphing
oh yes just so said jasper carelessly well it will be
inconvenient but i suppose i must do what you want the sooner we get
this over the better and he sat down and drew out his check book
thanks thanks muttered the captain i didnt think a good fellow
like you would stand back i didnt indeed
i ought not to do it murmured jasper with a shake of the head as
he rang the bell
take this letter to murphy and wait scrivell he said
scrivell disappeared noiselessly
by the way said jasper have you mentioned this to any one
excepting me
not to a soul replied the captain and you bet i shall not of
course
of course said jasper with a smile it wouldnt be worth spending
a hundred and fifty to hush it up if you did mention such a thing to
one personexcepting me of courseand he smiledand you let the
whole world know where did you get all this information
from bellamy the boys chum said the captain he asked me to look
him up occasionally
i see said jasper you wont mind my writing a letter or two will
you
go on said the captain lighting the fifth cigarette
jasper went to a cupboard and brought out a small bottle of champagne
and a couple of glasses
the generous glow of so virtuous an actionwhich bytheway is
strictly illegalsuggests something to drink he said with a smile
the captain nodded
i didnt know you did this sort of thing here he said looking round
i dont as a rule said jasper with a dry smile will you slip that
bolt into the door
the captain greatly enjoying anything in the shape of an irregularity
did as he was bidden and the two sat and sipped their wine and jasper
threw off his dry business air and chatted about things in general
until scrivell knocked jasper opened the door for him and took an
envelope from his hand and carried it to the desk
well said the captain eagerly
all right said jasper holding up the bill
the captain drew a long breath of relief
i feel as if i had done it myself he said with a laugh poor young
beggar hell be glad to know hes to get off scot free
ah said jasper bytheway hadnt you better drop him a line
right exclaimed the captain eagerly thats a good idea may i
write it here
jasper pushed a sheet of plain paper before him and an envelope
dont date it from here he said date it from your lodgings you
dont want him to know that anybody else knows anything about it of
course
of course not how thoughtful you are thats the best of a
lawyeralways keeps his head cool and he drew up a chair and wrote
not in the best of hands or the best of spelling
 dear mr etheridgeive gotyou know what it is all right nothing
 more need be said be a good boy for the future
 yours truly
     harry halliday
hows that he asked handing the note to jasper
jasper looked up he was bending over his desk apparently writing a
letter and looked up with an absent expression
eh he said oh yes that will do stop though to set his mind
quite at rest better say that you have destroyed itas you have
see and he took the envelope and held it over the taper until it
burnt down nearly to his finger dropping the remaining fragment on the
desk and allowing it to turn and smolder away
the captain added the line to that effect
now your man can run with it if youll be so good
jasper smiled
no he said i think not ill send a commissionaire
he rang the bell and took up the letter
send this by the commissionaire he said there is no answer tell
him to give it in and come away
and now im off said the captain ill let you have a check in a
day or two adelstone and im very much obliged to you
all right said jasper with a slightly absent air as if his mind
was already engaged with other matters no hurry whenever its
convenient goodbye
he went back to his desk before the captain had left the room and
bent over his letter but as the departing footsteps died away he
sprang up locked the door and drawing a slip of paper from under his
blotting pad held it before him with both hands and looked down at it
with a smile of eager triumph
it was the forged bill without a word or gesture he looked at it for a
full minute gloating over it as if it were some live sentient thing
lying in his path and utterly at his mercy then at last he raised his
head and his lips parted with a smile of conscious power
so soon he muttered so soon fate is with me she is mine my
beautiful stella yes she is mine though a hundred lord leycesters
stood between us
chapter xviii
when stella awoke in the morning it was with a start that she
remembered the scene of last night and that she was with the
exception of mrs penfold alone in the cottage
while she was dressing she recalled the incidents of the eventful
eveningthe party at the hall the telegram and not least the
finding of the mysterious miniature but above all there shone out
clear and distinct the allimportant fact that lord leycester loved
her and that she had promised to meet him this evening
but for the present there was much on her mind she had to meet mrs
penfold and communicate the information that mr etheridge had
suddenly been called to london on important business
she could not suppress a smile as she pictured mrs penfolds
astonishment and curiosity and wondered how she should satisfy the
latter without betraying the small amount of confidence which her uncle
had placed in her
she went downstairs to find the breakfast laid and mrs penfold
hovering about with unconcealed impatience
wheres your uncle miss stella she asked i do hope he hasnt gone
sketching before breakfast for he is sure to forget all about it and
wont come back till dinnertime if he does then
uncle has gone to london said stella
towhere demanded mrs penfold
then stella explained
gone to london last night hasnt slept in his bed why miss how
could you let him
but he was obliged to go said stella with a little sigh and a
rueful glance at the empty chair opposite her own
obliged exclaimed mrs penfold whatever was the matter your uncle
isnt obliged to go anywhere miss stella she added with a touch of
pride
stella shook her head
there was a telegram she said i dont know what the business was
but he was obliged to go
mrs penfold stood stockstill in dismay and astonishment
it will be the death of him she breathed awestruck he never goes
anywhere any distance and starting off like that miss stella in the
dead of night and after being out at the hallwhy its enough to kill
a gentleman like him who cant bear any noise or anything sudden like
im very sorry said stella he said that he was obliged to go
and when is he coming back asked mrs penfold
stella shook her head
i dont know i hope todayi do hope today it all seems so quiet
and lonely without him and she looked round the room and sighed
mrs penfold stood with the waiter in her hand staring at the
beautiful face
youyou dont know what it is miss stella she asked in a low
voice and with a certain significance in her tone
stella looked up at her
no i dont knowuncle did not tell me she replied
mrs penfold looked at her curiously and seemed lost in thought
and you dont know where hes gone miss stella i dont ask out of
curiosity
im sure of that said stella warmly no i dont know
and you dont guess
stella looked up at her with wide open eyes and shook her head
mrs penfold turned the waiter in her hand then she said suddenly
i wish mr adelstone was here
stella started
mr adelstone
mrs penfold nodded
yes miss stella he is such a clever young gentleman and hes so
friendly hed do anything for your uncle he always was friendly but
hes more so than ever now
is he said stella why
mrs penfold looked at her with a smile which died away before
stellas look of unconsciousness
i dont know miss stella but he is he is always about the cottage
oh i forgot he called yesterday and left something for you
and she went out returning presently with a bouquet of flowers
i took them in the pantry to keep cool and fresh arent they
beautiful miss
very said stella smelling them and holding them a little way from
her after the manner of her sex very beautiful it is very kind of
him are they for uncle or for me
mrs penfold smiled
for you miss stella is it likely hed leave them for your uncle
i dont know said stella he is uncles friend not mine will you
put them in water please
mrs penfold took them with a little air of disappointment it was not
in this cool manner that she expected stella to receive the flowers
yes miss and theres nothing to be done
no said stella except to wait for my uncles return
mrs penfold hesitated a moment then she went out
stella made an effort to eat some breakfast but it was a failure she
felt restless and listless a spell seemed to have been cast over the
little housea spell of mystery and secrecy
after breakfast she took up her hat and wandered about the garden
communing with herself and ever watching the path across the meadows
though she knew that her uncle could not possibly return yet
the day wore away and the evening came and as the daylight gave
place to sunset stellas heart beat faster all day she had been
thinkingdreaming of the hour that was now so near at hand longing
for and yet almost dreading it this love was so strange so mysterious
a thing that it almost frightened her
almost for the first time she asked herself whether she was not doing
wrongwhether she had not better stay at home and give up this
precious meeting
but she mentally pictured lord leycesters waiting for hermentally
called up the tone of his voice welcoming her and her conscience was
stilled
i must go she murmured and as if afraid lest she should change her
mind she put on her hat and went down the path with a quick step but
she turned back at the gate and called to mrs penfold
i am going for a stroll she said with a sudden blush if uncle
returns while i am away tell him i shall not be long
and then she went across the meadows to the river bank
all was silent save the thrushes in the woods and the nightingale with
its long liquid note and short jug jug and she sank down upon the
grassy bank and waited
the clock struck the hour of appointment and her heart beat fast
suppose he did not come her cheek paled and a faint sickening feeling
of disappointment crept over her the minutes passed hours they
seemed and then with a sudden resolution she rose
he will not come she murmured i will go back it is better so
but even as the words left her lips sadly a light skiff shot from the
shadow of the opposite bank and flew across the river
it was lord leycester she knew him though his back was turned toward
her and he was dressed in a suit of boating flannel and her heart
leapt
with practiced ease he brought the skiff alongside the bank and sprang
up beside her both hands outstretched
my darling he murmured his eyes shining with a greeting as
passionate as his wordshave you been waiting long did you think i
was not coming
stella put her hands in his and glanced up at him for a moment her
face flushed then paled
iidid not know she said shyly but with a little smile lurking
in the corner of her red lips
you knew i should come he went on what should what could prevent
me stella i was here before you i have been lying under that tree
watching you you looked so beautiful that i lay there feasting my
eyes and reluctant to move lest i should dispel the beautiful vision
stella looked across and her eyes drooped
you where there while ii was thinking that you had
perhapsforgotten
forgotten and he laughed softly i have been looking forward to
this hour i dreamt of it last night can you say the same stella
she was silent for a moment then she looked up at him shyly as a soft
yes dropped from her lips
he would have drawn her close to him but she shrank back with a little
frightened gesture
come he said and he drew her gently toward the boat
stella hesitated
suppose she said someone saw us and the color flew to her face
and if he retorted with a sudden look of defiance which melted in
a moment there is no fear of that my darling we will go down the
back water come
there was no resisting that lowvoiced mingling of entreaty and loving
command with the tenderest care he helped her into the boat and
arranged the cushion for her
see he said if we meet any boat you must put up your sunshade but
we shall not where we are going
stella leant back and watched him under her lowered lids as he
rowedevery stroke of the strong arm sending the boat along like an
arrow from the bowand an exquisite happiness fell upon her she did
not want him to speak it was enough for her to sit and watch him to
know that he was within reach of her hand if she bent forward to feel
that he loved her
he rowed down stream until they came to an island then he guided the
boat out of the principal current into a back water and rested on his
oars
now let me look at you he said i havent had an opportunity yet
stella put up her sunshade to shield her face and laughingly he drew
it away
that is not fair i have been thirsting for a glance from those dark
eyes all day i cannot have them hidden now and what are you thinking
of he asked smilingly but with suppressed eagerness there is a
serious little look in those eyes of yoursof mine they are mine are
they not stella what is it
shall i tell you she answered in a low voice
yes he said you shall whisper it let me come nearer to you and
he sank down at her feet and put up his hand for hers now then
stella hesitated a moment
i was thinking and wondering whether thiswhether this isnt very
wrong leleycester
the name dropped almost inaudibly but he heard it and put her hand to
his lips
wrong he said as if he were weighing the question most judiciously
yes and no yes if we do not love each other we two no if we do i
can speak for myself stella my conscience is at rest because i love
you and you
her hand closed in his
no my darling he said i would not ask you to do anything
wrong it may be a little unconventional this stolen halfhour of
oursperhaps it is but what do you and i care for the conventional
it is our happiness we care for and he smiled up at her
it was a dangerously subtle argument for a girl of nineteen and coming
from the man she loved but it sufficed for stella who scarcely knew
the full meaning of the term conventional but nevertheless she
looked down at him with a serious light in her eye
i wonder if lady lenore would have done it she said
a cloud like a summer fleece swept across his face
lenore he said then he laughed lenore and you are two very
different persons thank heaven lenore and he laughed worships the
conventional she would not move a step in any direction excepting that
properly mapped out by mrs grundy
you would not ask her then said stella
he smiled
no i should not he said emphatically and significantly i should
not ask anyone but you my darling would you wish me to
no no she said hastily and she laughed
then let us be happy he said caressing her hand do you know that
you have made a conquesti mean in addition to myself
no she said i
yes you he repeated i mean my sister lilian
ah said stella with a little glad light in her eyes how beautiful
and lovable she is
he nodded
yes and she has fallen in love with you we are very much alike in
our tastes he said with a significant smile yes she thinks you
beautiful and lovable
stella looked down at the ardent face so handsome in its passionate
eagerness
did youdid you tell her she murmured
he understood what she meant and shook his head
no it was to be a secretour secret for the present my darling i
did not tell her
she would be sorry said stella they would all be sorry would they
not she added sadly
why should you think of that he expostulated gently what does it
matter all will come right in the end they will not be sorry when you
are my wife when is it to be stella and his voice grew thrillingly
soft
stella started and a scarlet blush flushed her face
ah no she said almost pantingly not for very very longperhaps
never
it must be very soon he murmured putting his arm around her i
could not wait long i could not endure existence if we should chance
to be parted stella i never knew what love meant until now if you
knew how i have waited for this meeting of ours how the weary hours
have hung with leaden weight upon my hands how miserably dull the day
seemed you would understand
perhaps i do she said softly and the dark eyes dwelt upon his
musingly as she recalled her own listlessness and impatience
then you must think as i do he said quick to take advantage say
you do stella think how very happy we should be
she did think and the thought made her tremble with excess of joy
we two together in the world where we would go and what we would do
we could go to all the beautiful placesyour own italy switzerland
and always togetherthink of it
i am thinking she said with a smile
he drew closer and put her arm around his neck the very innocence and
purity of her love inflamed his passion and enhanced her charms in his
sight
he had been loved before but never like this with such perfect
unquestioning love
well then my darling why should we wait it must be soon stella
no no she said faintly why should it ii am very happy
what is it you dread is it so dreadful the thought that we should be
alone togetherall in all to each other
it is not that said stella her eyes fixed on the line of light that
fell on the water from the rising moon it is not that i am thinking
of others
always of others he said with tender reproach think of meof
ourselves
i wish she said
wish he coaxed her see if i cannot gratify it i will if it be
possible
it is not possible she said i was going to say that i wish you
were notwhat you are
you said something like that last night he said darling i have
wished it often you wish that i were plain mr brown
no no she said with a smile not that
that i were a mr wyndward
with no castle she broke in ah if that could be if you were
only say a workman how good that would be think you would live in
a little cottage and you would go to work and come home at night and
i should be waiting for you with your teado they have tea or dinner
she broke off to inquire with a laugh
you see he said returning her laugh it would not do why stella
you were not made for a workmans wife the sordid cares of poverty
are for different natures to yours and yet we should be happy we
two and he sighed wistfully you would be glad to see me come home
stella
yes she said half seriously half archly i have seen them in
italy the peasants wives standing at the cottage doors the hot
sunset lighting up their faces and their colored kerchiefs waiting for
their husbands and watching them as they climbed the hills from the
pastures and the vineyards and they have looked so happy that ii
have envied them i was not happy in italy you know
my stella he murmured his love for her was so deep and passionate
his sympathy so keen that half phrases were as plainly understood by
him as if she had spoken for hours and so you would wait for me
at some cottage door he said well it shall be so i will leave
england if you likeleave the castle and take some little ivygreen
cottage
she smiled and shook her head
then they would have reason to complain she said they would say
she has dragged him down to her levelshe has taught him to forget
all the duties of his rank and high positionshe haswhat is it
tennyson saysrobbed him of all the uses of life and left him
worthless
lord leycester looked up at the exquisite face with a new light of
admiration
this was no mere pretty doll no mere breadandbutter schoolgirl
to whom he had given his love but a girl who thought and who could
express her thoughts
stella he murmured you almost frighten me with your wisdom
where did you learn such experience well it is not to be a cottage
then and i am not to work in the fields or tend the sheep what then
remains nothing save that you take your proper place in the world
as my wife the indescribable tenderness with which he whispered the
last word brought the warm blood to her face where should i find a
lovelier face to add to the line of portraits in the old hall where
should i find a more graceful form to stand by my side and welcome my
guests where a more gracious ladye than the maiden i love
oh hush hush whispered stella her heart beating beneath the
exquisite pleasure of his words and the gently passionate voice in
which they were spoken i am nothing but a simple stupid girl who
knows nothing except she stopped
except he pressed her
she looked at the water a moment then she bent down and lightly
touched his hand with her lips
except that she loves you
it was all summed up in this he did not attempt to return the caress
he took it reverentially half overwhelmed with it it was as if a
sudden stillness had fallen on nature as if the night stood still in
awe of her great happiness
they were silent for a minute both wrapped in thoughts of the other
then stella said suddenly and with a little nottobesuppressed sigh
i must go see the moon is almost above the trees
it rises early tonight very he said eagerly
but i must go she said
wait a moment he pleaded let us go on shore and walk to the
weironly to the weir then we will come back and i will row you over
it will not take five minutes come i want to show it to you with
the moon on it it is a favorite spot of mine i have often stood and
watched it as the water danced over it in the moonlight i want to do
so this evening with you by my side i am selfish am i not
he helped her out of the boat almost taking her in his arms and
touching her sleeve with his lips in his chivalrous mood he would not
so far take advantage of her in her helplessness as to kiss her face
and they walked hand in hand as they used to do in the good old days
when men and women were not ashamed of love
why is it that they should be now why is it that when a pair of lovers
indulge on the stage in the most chaste of embraces a snigger and a
grin run through the audience in this age of burlesque and satire of
sarcasm and cynicism is there to be no love making if so what are
poets and novelists to write aboutthe electric light and the science
of astronomy
they walked hand in hand leycester wyndward viscount trevor heir to
wyndward and an earldom and stella the painters niece and threaded
the wood keeping well under the shadows of the high trees until they
reached the bank where the weir touched
lord leycester took her to the brink and held her lightly
see he said pointing to the silver stream of water isnt that
beautiful but it is not for its beauty only that i have brought you to
the river stella i want you to plight your troth to me here
here she said looking up at his eager face
yes this spot is reported hauntedhaunted by good fairies instead of
evil spirits we will ask them to smile on our betrothal stella
she smiled and watched his eyes with halfserious amusement there was
a strange light of earnestness in them
stooping down he took up a handful of the foaming water and threw a few
drops on her head and a few on his own
that is the old danish rite stella he said now repeat after me
    come joy or woe come pain or pleasure
    come poverty or richest treasure
    i cling to thee love heart unto heart
    till death us sever we will not part
stella repeated the words after him with a faint smile on her lips
which died away under the glow of his earnest eyes
then as the last words dropt hurriedly from her lips he took her in
his arms and kissed her
now we are betrothed stella you and i against all the world
as he spoke a cloud sailed across the moon and the shadows now at
their feet suddenly changed from silver to dullish lead
stella shuddered in his arms and clung to him with a little convulsive
movement that thrilled him
let us go she said let us go it seems almost as if there were
spirits here how dark it is
only for a moment darling he said see and he took her face and
turned it to the moonlight again one kiss and we will go
with no blush on her face but with a glow of passionate love in her
eyes she raised her face looked into his for a moment then kissed
him
then they turned and went toward the boat but this time she clung
to his arm and her head nestled on his shoulder as they turned
something white and ghostlike moved from behind the trees in front of
which they had been standing
it stood in the moonlight looking after them itself so white and
eerie that it might have been one of the good fairies but that in its
facebeautiful enough for any fairythere glittered the white angry
threatening look of an evil spirit
was it the nearness of this exquisitelygraceful figure in white which
by some instinct stella had felt and been alarmed at
the figure watched them for a moment until they were out of sight then
it turned and struck into a path leading toward the hall
as it did so another figurea black one this timecame out of the
shadow and crossed the path obliquely
she turned and saw a white not unhandsome face with small keen eyes
bent on her she the watcher had been watched
for a moment she stood as if halftempted to speak but the next drew
the fleecy shawl round her head with a gesture of almost insolent
hauteur
but she was not to escape so easily the dark thin figure slipped
back and stooping down picked up the handkerchief which in her
sweeping gesture she had let drop
pardon he said
she looked at him with cool disdain then took the handkerchief and
with an inclination of her head that was scarcely a bow would have
passed on again but he did not move from her path and hat in hand
stood looking at her
proud fearless imperiously haughty as she was she felt constrained
to stop
he knew by the mere fact of her stopping that he had impressed her and
he at once followed up the advantage gained
if she had wanted to pass him without speaking she should have taken
no notice of the handkerchief and gone on her way no doubt she now
wished that she had done so but it was too late now
will you permit me to speak to you he said in a quiet almost a
constrained voice every word distinct every word full of significance
she looked at him at the pale face with its thin resolute lips and
small keen eyes and inclined her head
if you intend to speak to me sir i apprehend that i cannot prevent
it you will do well to remember that we are not alone here
still uncovered he bowed
your ladyship has no need to remind me of that fact no deed or word
of mine will cause you to wish for a protector
i have yet to learn that she said you appear to know me sir
no words will convey any idea of the haughty scorn expressed by the icy
tone and the cold glance of the violet eyes
a faint smile deferential yet selfpossessed swept across his face
there are some so well known to the world that their faces are easily
recognized even in the moonlight such an one is the lady len
she put up her hand white and glittering with priceless gems and at
the commanding gesture he stopped but the smile swept across his face
again and he put up his hand to his lips
you know my name you wish to speak to me
he inclined his head
what have you to say to me
she had not asked his name she had treated him as if he were some
beggar who had crept up to her carriage as it stood at rest and by a
mixture of bravado and servility gained her ear there was a fierce
passionate resentment at this treatment burning in his bosom but he
kept it down
is it some favor you have to ask she said with cold pitiless
hauteur seeing that he hesitated
thanks he said i was waiting for a suggestioni must put it in
that way yes i have to ask a favor my lady i am a stranger to
you
she waved her hand as if she did not care so much as a withered blade
of grass for his personal history and with a little twitch of the lips
he continued
i am a stranger to you but i still venture to ask your assistance
she looked and smiled like one who has known all along what was coming
but to please his own whim had waited quite naturally
exactly she said i have no money
then he started and stood before her and what there was of manliness
awoke within him
money he said are you mad
lady lenore stared at him haughtily
i fear that you are she said did you not demandask is too
commonplace a word to describe a request made by a man of a woman alone
and unprotecteddid you not demand money sir
money he repeated then he smiled you are laboring under a
misapprehension he said i am in no need of money the assistance i
need is not of a pecuniary kind
then what is it she asked and he detected a touch of curiosity in
the insolentlyhaughty voice be good enough to state your desire as
briefly as you can sir and permit me to go on my way
then he played a card
with a low bow he raised his hat and drew from the path
i beg your ladyships pardon he said respectfully but with a
scarcely feigned air of disappointment i see that i have made a
mistake i apologize most humbly for having intruded upon your good
nature and i take my leave i wish your ladyship goodevening and he
turned
lady lenore looked after him with cold disdain then she bit her lip
and her eyes dropped and suddenly without raising her voice she said
wait
he turned and stood with his hand thrust in the breast of his coat his
face calm and selfpossessed
she paused a moment and eyed him struggling if the truth were known
and no doubt he knew it with her curiosity and her pride which last
forbade her hold any further converse with him at last curiosity
conquered
i have called you back sir to ask the nature of this mistake you
say that you have made your conduct your manner your words are
inexplicable to me be good enough to explain
it was a command and he inclined his head in respectful recognition
i am a student of nature my lady he said in a low voice and i am
fond of rambling in the woods here especially at moonlight it is not
a singular fancy
her face did not flush but her eyes gleamed she saw the sneer in the
words
go on sir she said coldly
chance led me tonight in the direction of the river i was standing
admiring it when two individualsthe two individuals who have just
left usapproached suspecting a love tryst i was retreating when
the moon revealed to me that one of the individuals was a person in
whom i take a great interest
which she asked coldly and calmly
the young lady he replied and his eyes drooped for a moment
that interest rather than curiosityher lips curled and she
looked up at him with infinite scorninterest rather than curiosity
prompted me to remain and an unwilling listener i heard the strange
engagementbetrothal call it what you willthat took place
he paused she drew the shawl round her head and eyed him askance
in what way does this concern me sir she demanded haughtily
pardon you perceive my mistake he said with a fitting smile i
was under the impression that as interest or curiosity prompted you
also to listen you might be pleased to assist me
she bit her lip now
how did you know that i was listening she demanded
he smiled
i saw your ladyship approach i saw you take up your position behind
the tree and i saw your face as they talked
as she remembered all that that face must have told him her heart
throbbed with a wild longing to see him helpless at her feet her face
went a blood red and her hands closed tightly on the shawl
well sir she said at last after a pause during which he had stood
eying her under his lowered lids granting that you are right in your
surmises how can i assist you supposing that i choose to do so
he looked at her full in the face
by helping me to prevent the fulfillment of the engagementbetrothal
which you and i have just witnessed he said promptly and frankly
she was silent a moment her eyes looking beyond him as if she were
considering then she said
why should i help you how do you know that i take any interest inin
these two persons
you forget he said softly i saw your face
she started there was something in the bold audacity of the man that
proved him the master
if i admit that i do take some interest what proof have i that i
shall be following that interest by confiding in you she asked
haughtily but less haughtily than hitherto
i can give you a sufficient proof he said quietly iloveher
she started there was so calm and cool and yet intense an expression
in his voice
you love her she repeated the girl who has just left us
the young lady he said with a slight emphasis who has just
plighted her troth to lord leycester wyndward
there was silence for a moment his direct statement of the case had
told on her
and if i help youif i consentwhat shape is my assistance to take
i leave that to you he said i can answer for her for stella
etheridgethat is her name
i do not wish to mention names she said coldly
quite right he said trees have ears as you and i have just
proved
she shuddered at the familiar confident tone in his voice
i will not mention names he repeated let us say him and her
candidlyand between us my lady there should be nothing but
candori have sworn that nothing shall come of this betrothal i love
her andihate him
she looked at him his face was deadly white and his eyes gleamed but
a smile still played about his lips
you he continued hate her andlovehim
lady lenore started and a crimson flush of shame stained her fair face
how dare you she exclaimed
he smiled
i have shown you my hand my lady i know yours will you tell me that
i am wrong say the wordsay that you are indifferent how matters
goand i will make my bow and leave you
she stood and looked at himshe could not say the word he had spoken
the truth she did love lord leycester with a passion that surprised
her with a passion that had not made itself known to her until
tonight when she had seen him take into his arms another womanhad
heard his protestations of love for another woman and seen him kiss
another woman
wounded pride selflove passionate desire all fought for mastery
within her bosom and the man who stood calmly before her knew it
he read every thought of her heart as it was mirrored on the proud
beautiful face
i do not understand she said you come to me a perfect stranger
and make these confessions
he smiled
i come to you because you and i desire to accomplish one endthe
separation of these two persons i come to you because i have already
found some means toward such an end and i believe you are capable of
devising and carrying out the remainder lady lenore
do not utter my name she said looking round uneasily
you and you alone can help me as i have said i can influence
the girl you can influence him i have worked hard for that
influencehave plotted and planned and schemed for it cleverness
ingenuitycall it what you willhas been exerted by me you have only
to exert yourpardon meyour beauty
with a gesture she drew the shawl nearer her faceit was like
profanation to hear him speak of her beauty
together we conquer alone i think we should fail for though i
hold her in a cleft stick i cannot answer for him he is headstrong and
wild and in a moment might upset my plans your taskif you accept
itis to see that he does not will you accept it
she paused
what is your hold over her she asked curiously
he smiled
pardon me if i decline to answer be assured that i have a hold upon
her your hold on him is as strong as that of mine on her will you
exert it
she was silent
think he said let me put the case clearly for his own good
you ought not to hesitate what good can come of such a marriagea
viscount an earl marry the niece of a painter an obscure nobody it
is for his own goodthe husband of stellai forgotno names as her
husband he sinks into insignificance as yours he rises to the height
which his position and yours entitle him to can you hesitate
no tempter since the world began not even the serpent at the foot
of the appletree in eden could have put it more ingeniously she
wavered reluctant to make a compact with a man and a stranger and
such a man she stood and hesitated
he drew out his watch
it is getting late he said i see your ladyship declines the
alliance i offer you i wish you goodnight and he raised his hat
she put forth her hand it was as white as her face
stop she said i agree
good he said with a smile give me your hand and he held out his
she hesitated but she put her hand in his the mental strength of the
man overcame her repugnance
so we seal our bargain all i ask your ladyship to do is to watch and
to strike when the iron is hot when that time comes i will give you
warning
and his hand closed over hers
a shudder ran through her at the contact his hand was cold as ice
there is no chance that these two will keep their compact now he
said you and i will prevent it goodnight my lady
stop she said and he turned you have not told me your nameyou
know mine
he smiled at hera smile of victory and selfconfidence
my name is jasper adelstone he said
her lips repeated the name
shall i see you safely into the hall
no no she said go if you please
he inclined his head and left her but he did not go until she had
entered the private park by another gate and her figure was lost to
sight
lord leycester rowed stella across the river and parted from her
goodnight my beloved he whispered it is not for long i shall
see you tomorrow goodnight i shall wait here until i see you enter
the lane you will be safe then
he held her in his arms for a moment then he let her go and stood on
the bank watching her
she sped across the meadows and entered the lane breathless
pausing for a moment to recover her composure she went on to the gate
and opened it
as she did so a slight youthful figure slipped out of the shadow and
confronted her
she uttered a slight cry and looked up
at that moment the moonlight fell upon the face in front of her
it was the same face in the miniature the same face though changed
from boyhood to youth
it was frank
chapter xix
it was the face she had seen in the miniature changed from childhood
to youth the same blue eyes frank confiding and womanishthe
same golden hair clustering in short curls instead of falling on the
shoulders as in the picturethe same smiling mouth with its little
touch of weakness about the under lip a taking a pretty rather than a
handsome face it ought to have belonged rather to a girl than a boy
stella stared and doubted the evidence of her senses her dream
flashed across her mind and made her heart beat with a sudden emotion
whether of fear or pleasure she could not tell
who was this boy and what was he doing there leaning on the gate as if
the place belonged to him and he had a right to be there
she took a step nearer and he opened the gate for her stella
entered and he raised his hat allowing the moonbeams to fall on his
yellow hair and smiled at her very much as a child might smile with
grave openeyed admiration and greeting
are youyou are stella he said in a voice that made her
startit was so like her uncles but softer and brighter
my name is stella she said filled with wonder
he held out his hand frankly but with a little timid shyness
then we are cousins he said
cousins exclaimed stella but she gave him her hand
yes cousins he said you are stella uncle harolds daughter are
you not well i am frank
she had felt it
frank she repeated amazedly
he nodded
yes i am your cousin frank i hopeand a cloud settled on his
facei hope you are not sorry
sorry she uttered feeling stupid and confused no i am not sorry
i am very gladof course i am very glad and she held out her hand
this time but i didnt know
no he said with a little sigh no i suppose you did not
a step was heard behind them and mr etheridge appeared
stella ran to him with a glad cry and put her arms round his neck
uncle
he kissed her and parting the hair from her forehead looked into her
eyes tenderly
yes stella i am back he said there was a sad weariness in his
voice and he looked haggard and tired andhe hesitated and put
his hand on the boys shoulderi have brought someone with me
thisis frank he hesitated again my son
stella suppressed a start and smiled up at him as if the announcement
were one of the most natural
i am so glad she whispered
he nodded
yes yes and his gaze wandered to the face of the boy who stood
looking at them with a little faint smile half timid half uneasy
frank has come to stop with us for a time he is going to the
university
yes said stella again she felt that there was some mystery felt
that the boy was connected in some way with that telegram and the
hurried visit to town and with her characteristic gentleness and tact
hastened to smooth matters ill go and see if mrs penfold has made
proper arrangements she said
mr etheridge looked after her as she went into the house the boys
voice startled him
how beautiful she is he murmured a faint flush on his cheek a
light of boyish admiration in his eyes i didnt know i had such a
beautiful cousin so
no said the old man warmly go on frank wait
the boy paused and mr etheridge put his hand on his shoulder
she is as good as she is beautiful she is an angel frank i need not
say that she knowsnothing
the boys face flushed then went pale and his eyes drooped
thank you sir he said gratefully no and he shuddered i
wouldnt have her know forfor the world
then he went in stella was flitting about the room seeing the laying
of a cloth for an impromptu meal he paused at the window as if afraid
to approach or disturb her but she saw him and came to him with
that peculiar little graceful gait which her uncle had noticed so
particularly on the first night of her coming
i am so glad you have come she said uncle must be glad too
yes he said in a low voice you are glad really glad
her beautiful eyes opened and she smiled
very glad you must come in and have some supper it is quite ready
and she went and called her uncle
the old man came in and sat down the boy waited until she pointed to a
chair into which he dropped obediently
mr etheridge offered no explanation of his visit to london and
she asked for none but while he sat with his usual silent dreamy
taciturnity she talked to him
frank sat and listened scarcely taking his eyes off her
presently mr etheridge looked up
where have you been this evening stella he asked
a sudden blush covered her face but though frank saw it his father
did not
i have been into the woods she said to the river
he nodded
very beautiful the witches trystingplace they call it he added
absently
stellas face paled and she hung her head
you were rather late werent you
yestoo late said stella guiltily if she might only tell him i
wont be so late again
he looked up
you will have frank to keep you company now he said
stella turned to the boy with a smile that was still eloquent of guilt
i shall be very glad she said feeling dreadfully deceitful you
know all the pretty places no doubt and must act as cicerone
his eyes dropped
no i dont he said i havent been here before
frank has been at school said mr etheridge quietly you will have
to be the cicerone and he rose and wandered to the window
stella rang the bell wheeled up the armchair and got the old mans
pipe hanging over him with marked tenderness and the boy watched her
with the same intent look
then she came back to her seat and took out some work
you are not going to work tonight he said leaning his elbows on
the table and his head upon his handssmall white delicate hands to
match the face
this is only makebelieve she said dont you know the old proverb
about idle hands and she laughed
he started and his face paled
stella wondered what she had said to affect him and hurried on
i cant sit still and do nothing can you
yes for hours he said with a smile i am awfully idle but i must
get better habits i must follow your example i mean to read while
im down hereread hard dont you know shall i begin tonight he
asked his eyes upon her with almost slavish intentness
not tonight she said with a laugh you must be tired you have
come from london havent you
yes he said and i am rather tired i would rather sit and watch
you if you dont mind
she shook her head
not in the least you can tell me about your school
i would rather sit and watch you in silence he said unless you
like to talk i should like that
he seemed a queer boy there was something almost sad in his quietness
but stella felt that it was only temporary
he is tired poor boy she thought
presently she said
how old are you
seventeen he said
she looked at him
i did not think you were so old she said with a laugh
he smiled
few persons do yes i am seventeen
why you are quite a man she said with a laugh
he blushedproving his boyhoodand shook his head
stella came the old mans voice will you play something
she rose instantly and glided to the organ and began to play
she had been playing some little time then she commenced to sing
suddenly she heard a sound suspiciously like a sob close to her side
and looking round saw that the boy had stolen to a low seat near her
and was leaning his face upon his hands she stopped but with a sudden
gesture and a look toward her the silent seated figure motioned her
to go on
she finishedit was the ave mariaand then bent down to him
you are tired she whispered
the voice was so sweet so kind so sisterly that it went straight to
the bottom of the lads heart
he looked up at her with that expression in his eyes which one sees in
the eyes of a faithful devoted dog then bent and kissed the sleeve of
her dress
all the tenderness of stellas nature welled up at the simple act and
with a little murmur she bent down and put her lips to his forehead
his face flushed and he shrank back
dont he said in a strained voice i am not worthy
for answer she stooped again and kissed him
he did not shrink this time but took her hand and held it with a
convulsive grasp and something trembled on his lip when he started
and stared toward the window
stella turned her head quickly and stared also for there standing
with his face turned toward them with his eyes fixed on them stood
jasper adelstone she rose but he came forward with his finger on his
lip
he is asleep he said glancing at the chair and he held out his
hand
stella took it it was hot and dry
i ought to apologize for coming in so late he said in a cautious
voice but i was passing and the music proved too great a temptation
will you forgive me
certainly said stella we are very glad to see you this is my
cousin frank she added
the small eyes that had been fixed on her face turned to the boys and
a strange look came into them for a second then in his usual tone he
said
indeed home for a holiday i suppose how do you do and he held out
his hand
frank came out of the shadow and took it and jasper held his hand and
looked at him with a strange smile
you have not introduced me he said to stella
stella smiled
this is mr adelstone a friend of uncles she said
jasper adelstone looked at her
will you not say a friend of yours also he asked gently
stella laughed
i beg your pardon yes if i may ill say a friend of ours
and yours too i hope said jasper adelstone to frank
yes thank you answered the boy but there was a strange
illconcealed shyness and reluctance in his manner
stella drew a chair forward
wont you sit down she asked
he sat down
i am afraid i have interrupted you he said will you go ondo
please
stella glanced at her uncle
i am afraid i should wake him she said
he looked disappointed
some other time said stella
thanks he said
uncle is very tired tonight he has just come from london
indeed said jasper with wellfeigned surprise i have been to
london also that reminds me i have ventured to bring some music for
youfor your uncle and he drew a book from his pocket
stella took it and uttered a little exclamation of pleasure it was a
volume of italian songs some of them familiar to her all of them good
how nice how thoughtful of you she said some of them are old
favorites of mine uncle will be so pleased thank you very much
he put his hand to his mouth
i am glad there are some songs you like he said i thought that
perhaps you would prefer italian to english
yesyes said stella turning over the leaves very much prefer it
perhaps some night you will allow me to hear some of them
indeed you shall she said lightly
i may have an opportunity he went on for i am afraid i shall be
rather a frequent visitor
yes said stella interrogatively
the fact is he said hesitatingly and he could have cursed himself
for his hesitation and awkwardnesshe who was never awkward or
irresolute at other timeshe who had faced the proud disdain of lady
lenore and conquered itthe fact is that i have some business with
your uncle a client of mine is a patron of the fine arts he is a very
wealthy man and he is anxious that mr etheridge whom he greatly
admires should paint him a picture on a subject which he has given
to me it is rather a difficult subjecti mean it will require some
explanation as the picture progresses and i have promised if mr
etheridge will permit me to give the explanation
stella nodded she had taken up her work again and bent over it quite
unconscious of the admiration with which the two pair of eyes were
fixed on herthe guarded passionate wistful longing in the mans
the open awefelt admiration of the boys
but she said with a smile you know howi was going to say
obstinatemy uncle is do you think he will paint it
i hope to be able to persuade him he said with a modest smile
perhaps he will do it for me i am an old friend you know
is it for you then she asked
no no he said quickly but this artpatron is a great friend of
mine and i have pledged myself to persuade mr etheridge
i see said stella
jasper was silent a moment his eyes wandering round the room in search
of the flowershis flowers they were nowhere to be seen but on her
bosom were the wild blossoms which lord leycester had gathered
a dark shade crossed his face for a moment and his hands clinched
but he composed himself the time would come when she would wear his
flowers and his alonehe had sworn it
he turned to frank with a smile
are you going to stay at home for long he asked
frank had withdrawn into the shadow where he had been watching stella
and jaspers faces alternately he started visibly
i dont know he said
i hope we shall see a great deal of each other he said i am
staying at the rectory taking holiday also
thank you said frank but not overjoyously
jasper rose
i must go now he said goodnight he took stellas hand and bent
over it then turning to the boy goodnight yes he added and he
held the small hands with a tight pressure we must see a good deal of
each other you and i
then he stole out noiselessly
as he disappeared frank heaved a sigh of relief and stella looked at
him
he was still standing as he had stood when jasper held his hand
looking after him and there was a strange look on his face which
aroused stellas attention
well she said with a smile
frank started and looked down at her with a smile
is it true he asked that he is a great friend of my fathers
stella nodded
i suppose so yes
and of yours he said intently
stella hesitated
i have known him such a short time she said almost apologetically
i thought so he said he is not a friend of yoursyou dont like
him
butsaid stella
i know it he said as well as if you had told me and i am glad of
it
there was a tone of suppressed excitement in his voicea restless
uneasy look in his eyes which astonished stella
why she said
because he answered i do not like him iand a shiver ran
through himi hate him
stella stared
you hate him she exclaimed you have only seen him for a few
minutes ought you to say that
no i suppose not he replied but i cant help it i hate him
there is something about him thatthat
he hesitated
well
that makes me afraid i felt while he was talking as if i was being
smothered dont you know what i mean
yes said stella quickly
it was that she had felt herself sometimes when jaspers low smooth
voice was in her ears but she felt that it was foolish to encourage
the boys fancy
but that is nonsense she said he is very kind and considerate he
has sent me some beautiful flowers
he has he said gloomily
and this music
frank took up the book and eyed it scornfully and threw it on the
table as if he were tempted to pitch it out of the window
what does he do it for he demanded
i dont knowonly out of kindness
frank shook his head
i dont believe it ii wish he hadnt i beg your pardon have i
offended you he added contritely
no said stella laughing not a bit you foolish boy and she
leant on her elbows and looked up at him with her dark eyes smiling
he came nearer and looked down at her
i am glad you dont like him
i didnt say
but i know it because i shouldnt like to hate anyone you liked he
added
then said stella with her rare musical laugh as its very wicked
to hate anyone and i ought to help you to be good the best thing i
can do is to like mr adelstone
heaven forbid he said so earnestly so passionately that stella
started
you are a wicked boy she said with a smile
i am he said gravely and his lips quivered but if anything could
make me better it would be living near you you are not offended
not a bit laughed stella but i shall be directly so you had
better go to bed your room is quite ready and you look tired
goodnight and she gave him her hand
he too bent over it but how differently to jasper and he touched it
reverently with his lips
goodnight he said say goodnight to my father for me and he
went out
chapter xx
one hears of the devotion of a dog to its master the love of a horse
for its rider such devotion such love stella received from the boy
frank he was a very singular boy and strange he soon lost the air of
melancholy and sadness which hung about him on the first night of his
arrival and became happier and sometimes even merry there was always
a certain kind of reserve about him
as stellaknowing nothing of the history of the forged billsaid he
had his thinking fits when he used to sit with his head in his hands
his eyes fixed on vacancy
but these fits were not of frequent occurrence and oftener he was
in the best of boyish moods chatty and cheerful and chaffy his
devotion to stella indeed was extraordinary it was more than the
love of a brother it was not the love of a sweetheart it was a kind
of worship he would sit for hours by her side more often at her
feet listening to her singing or watching her at work he was never
so happy as when he was with her walking in the meadows and he would
gladly lay aside his fishing rod or his book to hang about with her in
the garden
there had never been anyone so beautiful as stellathere had never
been anyone so good the boy looked up to her with the same admiration
and love with which the devotee might regard his patron saint
his attachment was so marked that even his father who noticed so
little observed it and commented on it
frank follows you like a dog stella he said the third evening
after the boys arrival dont let him bother you he has his reading
to get through and theres the river and his rod send him about his
business if he worries you
stella laughed
frank worry me she exclaimed lightly he is incapable of such a
thing there never was such a dear considerate boy why i should miss
him dreadfully if he were to go away for an hour or two even no he
doesnt bother me in the slightest and as to his books and his rod he
shamelessly confessed yesterday that he didnt care for any of them
half as much as he cared for me
the old man looked up and sighed
it is strange he said you seem to be the only person who ever had
any influence over him
i ought to be very proud then said stella and i am no one could
help loving him he is so irresistible
the old man went on with his work with a little sigh
then hes so pretty continued stella it is a shame to call a boy
pretty but that is just what he is
yes said mr etheridge grimly it is the face of a girl with all
a girls weakness
hush said stella warningly here he comes well frank she said
as he came in his slim form dressed in boating flannels his rod in
his hand what have you been doingfishing
no he said his eyes fixed on her face i meant to but you said
that you would come out directly and so i waited are you ready it
doesnt matterill wait i suppose its the pudding or the custards
or the canary wants feeding i wish there were no puddings or canaries
what an impatient boy it is she exclaimed with a laugh well now
im ready
lets go down to the river he said theres someone fishing
thereat least hes supposed to be fishing but he keeps his eyes
fixed in this direction so that i dont imagine he is getting much
sport
what is he like said stella
like said frank oh a tall wellmade young fellow in brown
velvet a man with a yellow mustache
stellas face flushed and she glanced round at her uncle
let us go she said i know who it is it is lord leycester
not lord leycester wyndward exclaimed frank not really i should
like to see him do you know him stella
yesa little said stella shyly a little
yes it is lord leycester said stella and the color came to her
face
i have heard so much about lord leycester said frank eagerly
everybody knows him in london he is an awful swell isnt he
stella smiled
you will teach me the most dreadful slang frank she said is he
such a swell as you call him
oh awful there isnt anything that he doesnt do he drives a coach
and four and hes the owner of two of the best race horses in england
and hes got a yachtthe gipsy you knowand oh theres no end to
his swelldom and you know him
yes said stella and her heart smote her that she could not say i
know him so well that i am engaged to be married to him but she could
not she had promised and must keep her promise
frank could not get over his wonder and admiration
why hes one of the most popular men in london he said let me
see theres something else i heard about him oh yes he is going to
be married
is he said stella and a little smile came about her lips
frank nodded
to a swell as great as himself to lady lenore beauchamp
the smile died away from stellas lips and her face paled
it was false and ridiculous but the mere rumor struck her not with a
daggers but a pins point
is he she said feeling deceitful and guilty and she walked on in
silence to the rivers bank while frank ran on telling all he knew of
lord leycesters swelldom according to frank he was a very great swell
indeed a sort of prince amongst men and as stella listened her heart
went out to the boy in gratitude
and she was to marry this great man
they reached the rivers bank and lord leycester who had been
watching them put down his rod and came across
stella held out her hand her face crimson with a warm blush her eyes
downcast
how do you do stelmiss etheridge he said pressing her hand then
he glanced at frank
this is my cousin frank said stella frank etheridge
frank with his blue eyes wide open with awe looked up at the handsome
face of the awful swell and bowed respectfully but lord leycester
held out his hand and smiled at himthe rare sweet smile
how do you do mr etheridge he said warmly and at the greeting
the boys heart leaped up and his face flushed i am very glad to meet
you went on leycester in his frank wayjust the way to enslave a
boyvery glad indeed for i was feeling bored to death with rod and
line are you fond of fishing will you come for a row do you think
you can persuade your cousin to accompany us
frank looked up eagerly at stella who stood her beautiful face
downcast and grave but for the little tremulous smile of happiness
which shone in the dark eyes and played about the lips
do stella he said do let us go
stella looked up with a smile and lord leycester helped her into the
boat
you can row he said to frank
yes said frank eagerly i can row
you shall pull behind me then said leycester
they took up sculls and lord leycester as he leaned forward for the
stroke spoke in a low tone
my darling have you wondered where i have been
stella glanced at frank pulling away manfully
he cannot hear whispered leycester the noise of the sculls
prevents him are you angry with me for being away
she shook her head
you havent missed me
i have missed you she said sharply
his heart leaped at the plain frank avowal
i have been to london he said there has been some trouble about
some foolish tiresome horses i was obliged to go stella every hour
seemed an age to me i dared not write i could not send a message
stella i want to speak to you very particularly will he be offended
if i get rid of him he seems a nice boy
frank is the dearest boy in the world she said eagerly
leycester nodded
i did not know mr etheridge had a sonit is his son
yes she said neither did i know it but he is the dearest boy
leycester looked round
frank he saidyou dont mind my calling you frank
frank colored
it is very friendly of your lordship
leycester smiled
i shall think you are offended if you address me in that way he
said my name is leycester if you call me my lord i shall have
to call you sir i cant help being a lord you know its my
misfortune not my fault
frank laughed
i wish it was my misfortune or my fault he said
leycester smiled
there is a jack just opposite where i was fishing i saw him half an
hour ago would you like to try for him
frank put the sculls up at once
all right said leycester and he pulled for the shore
youll find my rod quite ready youll stay here stelmiss etheridge
well pull about gently till frank has caught his fish
frank sprang to land and ran to the spot where leycester had left his
rod and leycester sculled up stream again for a few strokes then he
put the sculls down and leant forward and seized stellas hand
he will see you said stella blushing
no he will not he retorted and he bent until his lips touched her
hand stella i want to speak to you very seriously you must promise
you will not be angry with me
stella looked at him with a smile
is it so serious she said in that low murmuring voice which a
woman uses when she speaks to the man she loves
very he said gravely but with the bold defiant look in his eyes
which presaged some bold defiant deed stella i want you to marry
me
stella started and her hand closed spasmodically on his
i want you to marry me soon he went onat once
oh no no she said in a whisper and her hand trembled in his
marry him at once the thought was so full of immensity that it
overwhelmed her
but it must be yes yes yes he said my darling i find that i
cannot live without you i cannot i cannot you will take pity on me
take pity on himthe great lord leycester the most popular man in
london the heir to wyndward the hero of whom frank had been speaking
so enthusiastically while she was but stella etheridge the painters
penniless niece
what am i to say what can i say she said in a low voice her eyes
downcast her heart beating fast
i will tell you he said you must say yes my darling to all i
ask you
there was a moments pause in which she felt that indeed she must say
yes to anything he asked her
listen darling he went on caressing her hand his eyes fixed
on her face wistfully i have been thinking of this love of ours
thinking of it night and day and i feel that you and i can do no good
by waiting you are happyyes because you are a woman but i am not
happy because perhaps that i am a man i shall not be happy until we
are oneuntil you are my very own stella we must be married at once
not at once she pleaded
at once he said and there was a strange eager impatient light
in his eyes stella i can speak to you as i can speak to no one
elseyou and i are one in thoughtyou are my other self my darling
i would go through fire to save you a moments pain not only pain but
uneasiness and annoyance
her fingers closed on his hand and her eyes raised to his face for a
moment plainly said i believe it but her lips said nothing
stella there would be pain and annoyance to you ifif we were to
make known our love it is a foolish stupid idiotic world but as the
world is we must accept itwe cannot alter it if we were to declare
our love all sorts of people would be arrayed against us do you
think your uncle would consent to it
stella thought a moment
i know what you mean she said in a low voice no uncle would not
consent but it is not that only lady wyndwardthe earlno one of
your people would consent
his lips curled
about their consent i care little he said in the quiet defiant
manner peculiar to him but i do care for your happiness and peace of
mind and i fear they might make you unhappy anduncomfortable so
stella i think you and i had better walk to church one fine morning
and say nothing to nobody
stella started
secretly do you mean oh leycester
my darling is it not best then when it is all over and you are my
very own nobody will say anything because it will be no good to say
anything stella it must be so if we waited until we got everybodys
consent we might wait until we were as old as methuselah
but uncle murmured stella he has been so good to me
and i will be good to you he murmured with such sweet significance
that the beautiful face crimsoned he only wants to see you happy and
i will make you happy my darlingmy own
as he spoke he took her hand and held it to his lips as if he never
meant to part with it and stella could not find a word to say if she
had found a word it would have been yes
he was silent a momentthinking then he said
stella you think i have some plan ready but i have not i would
not even think of a plan till i got your consent now i have got your
consenti have havent i
stella was silent but her hand closed over his
i will think i will make a plan we shall want some one to help us
he thought a moment then he looked up with a smile
i know it shall befrank
frank exclaimed stella
he nodded
yes i like him i like him because he likes you stella that boy
adores you
stella smiled
he is a dear good boy
he shall help us he shall be our mercury and carry messages do you
know stella that you and i have never written to each other since we
have been engaged when i was in london i longed for some memento of
you some written line something you had touched you will write now
darling and frank shall act as messenger i will think it all out and
send you word if i do not see you frank and i must be good friends
it is quite true that the boy adores you i can see it in his eyes
that is no wonderanybody everybody who knows you must adore you my
darling
something has been said of the infinite charm possessed by leycester
a charm quite irresistible when he chose to exert it this morning he
exerted it to the utmost extent stella felt in dreamland and under
a spell if he had asked her to go to land and marry him there and
thenif he had asked her to follow him to the ends of the world she
would have felt bound to so follow him she forgot time and place and
everything as she listened to him for a time at least but as the boat
drifted down to the spot where they had left frank she remembered the
boy and looked up with a start
frank is not there she said where has he gone
leycester looked up smiling
you are a sister to him he said he must have wandered down the
bank he is all right
then he looked down the river and a sudden light came into his eyes
the foolish boy he said he has gone on to the weir
the weir exclaimed stella
dont be frightened he said he is all right he is standing on the
wooden stage over the weir
stella looked round
he will fall she said isnt it very dangerous
it did look dangerous frank had climbed on to the weir bars and was
standing over a narrow beam his legs apart his eyes fixed on the big
float which danced in the foaming water
he is all right said leycester ill tell him to come off dont be
alarmed my darling you have gone quite pale
call to him to come off at once said stella
leycester rowed to land and they both walked to the weir a few paces
only
better come off there frank called out leycester
frank looked round
ive just had a touch he said there is a tremendous jack there or
perhaps its a trout hell come again directly
come off said leycester you are frightening stellayour cousin
all right said frank but at the moment the fish jack or trout
seized the bait and with an exultant cry frank jerked his rod
ive got him he shouted its a monster have you got a net lordi
mean leycester
no bother the net and the fish too said leycester leave the fish
and come off your cousin is alarmed
oh very well said frank and he jerked the rod to get clear of the
fish and at the same moment turned warily toward the shore
but the fishjack or trouthad got a firm hold and was not disposed
to go and making a turn to the open river put a strain on the rod
which frank had not expected
it was a question whether he should drop the rod or cling on
he decided on the latter and the next moment he missed his footing
and fell into the foaming water stella did not utter a cryit was not
her way of expressing her emotionbut she grasped leycesters arm
all right my darling he murmured it is all right and as he
spoke he put her hand from his arm gently and tenderly
the next moment he had torn off his coat and springing on the weir
stood for just a second to calculate the distance and dived off
stella even then did not shriek but she sank speechless on the bank
and with clasped hands and agonized terror watched the struggle
lord leycester rose to the surface almost instantly he was a skilled
diver and a powerful swimmer and he had not lost his presence of mind
for a moment
it was a terrible place to jump froma still more terrible place from
which to rescue a drowning person but lord leycester had done the
thing before and he was not afraid
he saw the boys golden head come up a few yards beyond where he lord
leycester rose and he struck out for it a few stokes and he reached
and grasped him
dont cling to me my boy he gasped
no fear lord leycester gasped frank in return
then lord leycester seized him by the hair and striking out for the
shore fought hard
it was a hard fight the recoil of the stream as it fell from the
weir was tremendous it was like forcing ones way through liquid
iron but lord leycester did force his way and still clinging to the
boys hair dragged him ashore
dripping wet they stood and looked at each other then lord leycester
laughed but frank the boy did not
lord leycester he said speaking pantingly you have saved my life
nonsense said leycester shaking himself i have had a pleasant
bath thats all
you have saved my life said frank solemnly i should never have
been able to force my way through that current alone i know what a
weir stream is
nonsense said leycester again then he turned to where stella
stood white and trembling dont be frightened stella dont be
frightened darling
the word was said before he could recall it and he glanced at frank
frank nodded
i know he said with a smile i knew it half an hour ago since you
first spoke to her
frank murmured stella
i knew he loved you said frank calmly he could not help it how
could anybody help it who knew you
leycester laid his hand on the boys arm
you must go home at once he said gently
you have saved my life said frank again lord leycester i shall
never forget it perhaps some day i shall be able to repay you it
seems unlikely but remember the story of the lion and the mouse
never mind the lion and the mouse said leycester smiling as he
wrung the thames water from his clothes you must get home at once
but i do remember the lion and the mouse said frank his teeth
chattering you have saved my life
meanwhile stella stood wordless and motionless her eyes wandering from
her lover to frank
wordless because she could find no words to express her admiration for
her lovers heroism
at last she spoke
oh leycester she said and that was all
leycester took her in his arms and kissed her
frank he said you must keep our secret
i would lay down my life for either of you said the boy looking up
at him
they went down to the boat in silence and leycester rowed them across
in silence then as they landed frank spoke again and there was a
strange light in his eyes
i know he said i know your secret i would lay down my life for
you
chapter xxi
stella hurried frank across the meadows a rather difficult task as
he would insist upon talking his teeth chattering and his clothes
dripping
what a splendid fellow stella what a happy girl you ought to beyou
are
perhaps i am assented stella with a little smile but do you make
haste frank cant you run any faster ill race you to the lane
no you wont he retorted cheerfully you run like a greyhound at
the best of times and now i seem to have got a couple of tons clinging
to me youd beat me hollow but stella think of him plunging off the
beam many a man would have been satisfied to jump off the bank if he
had he wouldnt have saved me he knew that and he made nothing of
it nothing and that is the man they call a dandy and a fop
never mind what they call him but run implored stella
i dont know any other man who could have done it he went on his
teeth chattering and how friendly and jolly he was calling me frank
and telling me to call him leycester stella what a lucky girl you
are but he is not a bit too good for you after all no one is too good
for you and he does love you stella i could see it by the way he
looked at you and you thought to hide it and that i shouldnt see it
did you think i was a muff
i think you will be laid up with a bad cold sir if you dont run
said stella what will uncle say
frank stopped short and his face paled he seemed to shrink
my father must know nothing about it he said dont tell him
stella i will get in the back way and change dont tell him
but said stella
no no he reiterated i dont want him to know it will only
trouble him andhis voice falteredi have given him so much
trouble
very well said stella but come along or you will be ill and then
he must know
this appeared to have the desired effect and he took her hand and set
off at a run they reached the lane and were just turning into it
when the tall thin figure of jasper emerged
both stella and frank stopped and she felt his hand close in hers
tightly
stella heres that man adelstone he said in a whisper of aversion
must we stop
jasper settled that question by raising his hat and coming forward
with outstretched hand
goodevening he said his small keen eyes glancing from stella to
the boy and taking in the fact of the wet clothes in a moment
what is the matter
nothing much said stella with a smile and hurriedly my cousin has
fallen into the water we are hurrying home
fallen in the water said jasper turning and walking beside them
how did he manage that
frank was silent and stella with a little flush said gravely
we were on the water
i was fishing from the weir broke in frank pressing her hand
warningly and i fell in that is all
there was something almost like defiance in the tone and the glance he
gave at the sinister face
into the weir stream exclaimed jasper and you got ashore you must
be a good swimmer my dear frank
i ampretty well said frank almost sullenly
perhaps you had the waterman to help you said jasper looking from
one to the other
then stella who felt that it would be better to speak out said
gravely
lord leycester was near and leapt in and saved him
jaspers face paled and an angry light shot from his eyes
how fortunate that he should happen to be near he said it was
brave of him
there was a suspicion of a sneer in the thin voice that roused the
spirit of the boy
it was brave he said perhaps you dont know what it is to swim
through a weir current mr adelstone
jasper smiled down at the flushed upturned face
no but i think i should have tried if i had been lucky enough to be
in lord leycesters place
im very glad you werent said frank in a low voice
i am sure you would said stella quickly anyone would come
frank goodevening mr adelstone
jasper paused and looked at her she looked very beautiful with her
flushed face and eager eyes and his heart was beating rapidly
i came out hoping to see you miss etheridge he said may i come
in
yes of course uncle will be very pleased she said but go in the
front way please we are going in at the back because we dont wish
uncle to know it would only upset him you will not tell him please
you may always rely on my discretion said jasper
stella still holding franks hand dragged him into the kitchen and
stopped mrs penfolds exclamation of dismay
frank has had an accident mrs penfold yes he fell in the river
ill tell you all about it afterward but he must change his things at
onceat once run up frank and get into the blanket
all right he said then as he went out of the room he took her by
the arm
dont let that man stay stella ihate him
my dear frank
i hate him what did he mean by sneering at lord leycester
he doesnt like lord leycester said stella
who cares exclaimed frank indignantly curs are not particularly
fond of lions but
stella would hear no more but pushed him up the stairs with anxious
impatience then she went into the studio as she neared the door she
could hear jasper adelstones voice he was talking to her uncle
and something in the tone struck her as peculiar and struck her
unpleasantly
there was a tone of familiarity almost of covert power in it that
annoyed her
with her hand on the door she paused and it seemed to her as if she
heard him speak her name she was not sure and she would not wait but
with a little heightened color she opened the door and entered
as she did so jasper laid his hand upon the old mans arm as if to call
his attention to her entrance and the painter turned round with a
start and looking at her intently said with evident perplexity
a mere girla mere girl jasper and shaking his head resumed his
work
jasper stood a moment a smile on his face watching stella from the
corner of his eyes then he said suddenly
i have been admiring your roses miss stella and breaking the last
commandment i have been coveting them
oh said stella pray take any you like there are such numbers of
them that we can spare them can we not uncle
as usual the painter took no notice and jasper in a matteroffact
voice said
do you mind coming out and telling me which i may cut i only want
one or two to take to london with me to brighten my dull rooms
certainly said stella moving toward the window are you going to
london
he muttered something and followed her out his eyes taking in the
lithe grace of her figure with a hungry wistfulness
now then said stella standing in the middle of the path and waving
her hand
which shall it be white rose or red and she smiled up at him
he looked at her for a moment in silence she had never appeared to
him more beautiful than this morning there was a subtle light of
hidden joy shining in her eyes a glow of youthful hope about her face
that set his heart beating with mingled pleasure and paindelight in
the beauty which he had sworn should be his pain and torture in the
thought that anotherthe hated lord leycesterhad already looked upon
it that morning
even as he stood silently regarding her a bitter suspicion smote
through his heart that the joyousness which shone from the dark eyes
had been set there by lord leycester he bit his lip and his face went
pale then with a start he came close to her
give me which you please he said here is a knife
stella took the knife heedlessly and carelessly there was no
significance in the deed she did not know that he would attach any
importance to the fact that she should cut the rose and give it to him
with her own hand if she had so understood it she would have dropped
the knife as if it had been an adder
in simple truth she was not thinking of himscarcely saw him she was
thinking of that lover the god of her heart and seeing him as he
swam through the river foam for she was scarcely conscious of jasper
adelstones presence and in the acuteness of his passion he almost
suspected it
white or red she said knife in hand
he glanced at her
red he said and his lips felt hot and dry
stella cut a red rosea dark red rose and with a little womanly
gesture put it to her face it was a little girlish trick all
unthinking unconsciously done but it sent the blood to the heart of
the man watching her in a sudden passionate rush
there she said it is a beauty they speak of the roses of
florence but give me an english rose florentine roses are fuller than
these but not so beautifuloh not so beautiful there and she held
it out to him without looking at him if she had done so she would
have surely read something in the white constrained face and small
glittering eyes that would have warned her
he took it without a word in simple truth he was trying to restrain
himself he felt that the time was not ripe for actionthat a word
of the devouring passion which consumed him would be dangerous and
he whispered to himself not yet not yet but her loveliness that
touch of the rose to his face overmastered his cool calculating
spirit
thank you he said at last thank you very much i shall value it
dearly i shall put it on my desk in my dark grim room and think of
you
then stella looked up and started slightly
oh she said hurriedly you would like some more perhaps pray take
what you would like and she held out the knife and looked upon him
with a sudden coldness in the eyes that should have warned him
no i want no more he said all the roses that ever bloomed would
not add to my pleasure it is this rose from your hand that i value
stella made a slight movement toward the window but he put out his
hand
stay one momentonly a moment he said and in his eagerness he put
out his hand and touched her arm the arm sacred to leycester
stella shrank back and a little shudder swept through her
whatwhat is it she asked in a low voice that she tried to make
calm and cold and repressive
he stood shutting and opening the knife with a nervous restlessness
as unlike his calm impassability as the streaming torrent that forces
its way through the mountain gorge is like the lake at their feet his
eyes fixed on her face with anxious eagerness
i want to speak to you he said only a few wordsa very few words
will you listen to me i hope you will listen to me
stella stood her face turned away from him her heart beating
but coldly and with fear and repugnance not as it had beat when
leycesters low tones first fell upon her ear
he moistened his lips again and his hand closed over the shut knife
with a tight clasp as if he were striving to regain selfcommand
i know it is unwise i feel thatthat you would rather not listen to
me and that i shall do very little good by speaking but i cannot
there are times stella
stella moved slightly at the familiar name
there are times when a man loses selfcontrol when he flings prudence
to the winds or rather lets it slip from him this is one of those
moments stellamiss etheridge i feel that i must speak let it cost
me what it may
still silent she stood as if turned to stone he put his hand to his
browhis white thin hand with its carefully trimmed nailsand wiped
away the perspiration that stood in big beads
miss etheridge i think you can guess what it is i want to say and i
hope that you will not think any the less of me because of my inability
to say it as it should be said as i would have it said stella if you
look back if you will recall the times since first we met you cannot
fail to know my meaning
she turned her face toward him for a moment and shook her head
you mean that i have no right to think so do you think that you a
woman have not seen what every woman sees so quickly when it is the
casethat i have learned to love you
the word was out at last and as it left him he trembled
stella did not start but her face went paler than before and she
shrank slightly
yes he went on i have learned to love you i think i loved you
the first evening we met i was not sure then andi will tell you
the whole truth i have sworn to myself that i would do iti tried to
fight against it i am not a man easily given to love no i am a man
of the worldone who has to make his way in the world one who has an
ambition and i tried to put you from my thoughtsi tried hard but i
failed
he paused and eyed her watchfully her face was like a mask of stone
i grew to love you more day by dayi was not happy away from you
i carried your image up with me to londonit came between me and my
work but i was patienti told myself that i should gain nothing by
being too rashthat i must give you time to know me and toto love
me
he paused and moistened his lips and looked at her why did she not
speakof what was she thinking
at that moment if he could but have known it she was thinking of her
true loverof the young lord who had not waited and calculated but
who had poured the torrent of his passionate love at her feethad
taken her in his arms and made her love him and as she thought how
small how mean this other man seemed to her
i gave you minei meant to give you more he continued i want to
do something worthy of your love i ami am not a rich man stellai
have no titleas yet
stellas eyes flashed for a moment and her lips closed it was an
unlucky speech for him
no not yet but i shall have riches and titlei have set my mind
on them and there is nothing that i have set my mind on that i have
not got or will not getnothing he repeated with almost fierce
intensity
still she did not speak like a bird charmed fascinated by a snake
she stood listening though every word was torture to her
i have set my mind on winning your love stella i love you as few men
love with all my heart and soul there is nothing i would not do to
win you there is nothing i wouldpause at
a faint shudder stole through her and he saw it and added quickly
i would do anything to make you happymove heaven and earth to see
you always smiling as you smiled this morning stella i love you what
have you to say to me
he stopped white and seemingly exhausted his thin lips tightly
compressed his whole frame quivering
chapter xxii
stella turned her eyes upon him and something like pity took
possession of her for a moment it was a womanly feeling and it
softened her reply
iam very sorry she said in a low voice
sorry he repeated hoarsely quickly do not say that
yesi am very sorry she repeated iidid not know
did not know that i loved you he retorted almost sharply were you
blind every word every look of mine would have told you if you had
cared to know
her face flushed and she raised her eyes to his with a flash of
indignation
i did not know she breathed
forgive me he pleaded hoarsely ii am very unfortunate i offend
and anger you i told you that i should not be able to say what i had
to say with credit to myself pray forgive me i meant that though i
tried to hide my love it must have betrayed itself how could it be
otherwise stella have you no other word for me
none she said looking away i am very sorry i did not know but
it could not have been never
he stood regarding her his breath coming in long gasps
you mean you never can love me he asked
stella raised her eyes
yes she said
his hand closed over the knife until the back of the blade pressed
deeply into the quivering palm
never isis a long day he said hoarsely do not say never i
will be patient see i am patient i am calm now and will not offend
you again i will be patient and wait i will wait for years if you
will but give me hopeif you will but try to love me a little
stellas face paled and her lips quivered
i cannot she said in a low voice youyou do not understand
one cannot teach oneself to lovecannot try it is impossible
besidesyou do not know what you ask you do not understand
do i not he said and a bitter sneer curled the thin lips i do
understand i knowi have a suspicion of the reason why you answer me
like this
stellas face burnt for a moment then went pale but her eyes met his
steadily
there is something behind your refusal no girl would speak as you
do unless there was something behind there is someone else am i not
right
you have no right to ask me said stella firmly
my love gives me the right to ask but i need not put the question
and there is no necessity for you to answer if you have been blind i
have not i have seen and noted and i tell you i tell you plainly
that what you hope for cannot be i say cannotshall not be he
added between his closed teeth
stellas eyes flashed as she stood before him glorious in her
loveliness
have you finished she asked
he was silent regarding her watchfully
if you have finished mr adelstone i will leave you
stay he said and he stood in the path so that she could not pass
him stay one moment i will not ask you to reconsider your reply
i will only ask you to forgive me his voice grew hoarse and his
eyes drooped yes i will beg you to forgive me think of what i am
suffering and you will not refuse me that forgive me stellamiss
etheridge i have been wrong mad and brutal but it has sprung from
the depth of my love i am not altogether to blame will you say that
you will forgive me and thatthat we remain friends
stella paused
he watched her eagerly
ifif he said quickly before she could speakif you will let
this pass as if it had not beenif you will forget all i have saidi
will promise not to offend again do not let us partdo not send me
away never to see you again i am an old friend of your uncles i
should not like to lose his friendship i think i may say that he would
miss mine let us be friends miss etheridge
stella inclined her head
thank you thank you he said meekly tremulously i shall be
very grateful for your friendship miss stella i will keep the rose
to remind me of your forbearance and he was patting the rose in his
coat when stella with a start stretched out her hand
no give it me back please she said
he stood eying her
let me keep it he said it is a little thing
no she said firmly and her face burnt you must not keep it ii
did not think when i gave it to you give it me back please and she
held out her hand
he still hesitated and stella overstrained made a step toward him
give it me she said i musti will have it
an angry flush came on his face and he held the rose from her
it is mine he said you gave it to me i cannot give it back
the words had scarcely left his lips when the rose was dashed from his
hand and frank stood white and panting between them
how dare you he gasped passionately his hands clinched his eyes
gleaming fiercely upon the white face how dare you and with a
savage exclamation the boy dashed his foot on the flower and ground it
under his heel
the action so full of scornful defiance spurred jasper back to
consciousness with a smothered oath he grasped the boys shoulders
frank turned upon him with the savage ferocity of a wild animal with
upraised arm then suddenly like a lightning flash jaspers face
changed and a convulsive smile forced itself upon his lips
he caught the arm and held it and smiled down at him
my dear frank he murmured what is the matter
so sudden was the change so unexpected that stella who had caught
the boys other arm stood transfixed
frank gasped
what did you mean by keeping the rose he burst out
jasper laughed softly
oh i see he said nodding with amused playfulness i see you
were watchingfrom the window perhaps eh and he shook his arm
playfully and like a great many other spectators took jest for
earnest impetuous boy
frank looked at the pale smiling face and at stellas downcast one
is it true he asked stella bluntly
oh come said jasper reproachfully isnt that rather rude but i
must forgive you and i do it easily my dear frank when i remember
that your sudden onslaught was prompted by a desire to champion miss
stella now come you owe me a rose go and cut me one and we will be
friendsgreat friends will we not
frank slid from his grasp but stood eying him suspiciously
you will not said jasper still uncertain lest it should have been
sober earnest then i will cut one for myself may i and he smiled at
stella
stella did not speak but she inclined her head
jasper went to one of the standards and cut a red rose deliberately and
carefully and placed it in his coat then he cut another and with a
smile held it to stella
will that do instead of the one the stupid boy has spoiled he said
laughing
stella would have liked to refuse it but franks eyes were upon her
slowly she held out her hand and took the rose
a smile of triumph glittered for a moment in jaspers eyes then he put
his hand on franks shoulder
my dear frank he said in a soft voice you must be careful you
must repress that impulsive temper of yours must he not and he
turned to stella and held out his hand goodbye it is so dangerous
you know he murmured holding stellas hand but keeping his smiling
eyes fixed on the boys face why some of these days you will be
doing someone an injury and find yourself in prison doing as they call
it six months hard labor like a common thiefor forger and he
laughed as if it were the best joke in the world
not so frank as the bantering words left the thin smiling lips frank
recoiled suddenly and his face went white
jasper looked at him
and now you are sorry he said tell me it was only your fun why
my dear boy you wear your heart on your sleeve well if you would
really like to beg my pardon you may do it
the boy turned his white face toward him
ibegyourpardon he said as if every word cost him an agony
and then with a sudden twitch of the face he turned and went slowly
with bent head toward the house
jasper looked after him with a steely cruel glitter in his eyes and
he laughed softly
dear boy he murmured i have taken so fond a liking for him and
this only deepens it he did it for your sake you did not think i
meant to keep the rose no i should have given it to you but i may
keep this i will to remind me of your promise that we may still be
friends
and he let her hand go and walked away
chapter xxiii
lord leycester was on fire as he strode up the hill to the hall and
that notwithstanding he was wet to the skin he was on fire with love
he swore to himself as he climbed up the slope that there was no
one like his stella no one so beautiful so lovable and sweet as the
darkeyed girl who had stolen his heart from him that moonlight night
in the lane
and he also vowed that he would wait no longer for the inestimable
treasure the exquisite happiness that lay within his grasp
his great wealth his time honored title seemed as nothing to him
compared with the thought of possessing the first real love of his life
he smiled rather seriously as he pictured his fathers anger his
mothers dismay and despair and lils dear lilians grief but it
was a smile though a serious one
they will get over it when it has once been done after all barring
that she has no title and no moneyneither of which are wanted by the
wayshe is as delightful a daughterinlaw as any mother or father
could wish for yes ill do it
but how that was the question
there is no gretna green nowadays he pondered regretfully i wish
there were a ride to the border with my darling by my side nestling
close to me all the way with mingled love and alarm would be worth
taking a man cant very well put up the banns in any outoftheway
place because there are few outoftheway places where they
havent heard of us wyndwards by jove he muttered with a little
startthere is a special license i was almost forgetting that that
comes of not being used to being married a special license and
pondering deeply he reached the house
the party at the hall was very small indeed now but lady lenore and
lord charles still remained lenore had once or twice declared that she
must go but lady wyndward had entreated her to stay
do not go lenore she had said with gentle significance you
knowyou must know that we count upon you
she did not say for what purpose she counted upon her but lenore
had understood and had smiled with that faint sweet smile which
constituted one of her charms
lord charles stayed because leycester was still there
of course i ought to go lady wyndward he said you must be
heartily tired of me but who is to play billiards with leycester if
i go or who is to keep him in order dont you see and so he had
stayed with one or two others who were only too glad to remain at the
hall out of the london dust and turmoil
by all it was quite understood that lord leycester should be considered
as quite a free agent free to come and go as he chose and never to
be counted on they were as surprised as they were gratified if he
joined them in a drive or a walk and were never astonished when he
disappeared without furnishing any clew to his intentions
lady wyndward bore it all very patiently she knew that what lady
longford had said was quite true that it was useless to attempt to
drive him but she did say a word to the old countess
there is something amiss she said with a sigh and the old countess
had smiled and shown her teeth
of course there is my dear ethel she retorted there always is
where he is concerned he is about some mischief i am as convinced as
you are but it does not matter it will come all right in time
but will it asked lady wyndward with a sigh
yes i think so said the old countess and lenore agrees with me
or she would not stay
it is very good of her to stay said lady wyndward with a sigh
very assented the old lady with a smile it is encouraging i am
sure she would not stay if she did not see excuse yes ethel it will
all come right he will marry lenore or rather she will marry him
and they will settle down andi dont know whether you have asked me
to stand godmother to the first child
lady wyndward tried to feel encouraged and confident but she felt
uneasy she was surprised that lenore still remained she knew nothing
of that meeting between the proud beauty and jasper adelstone
and lenore a great change had come over her she herself could
scarcely understand it
at nightas she sat before her glass while her maid brushed out the
long tresses that fell over the white shoulders like a stream of liquid
goldshe asked herself what it meant was it really true that she was
in love with lord leycester she had not been in love with him when she
first came to the hallshe would have smiled away the suggestion if
anyone had made it but nowhow was it with her now and as she asked
herself the question a crimson flush would stain the beautiful face
and the violet eyes would gleam with mingled shame and selfscorn so
that the maid would eye her wonderingly under respectfully lowered lids
yes she was forced to admit that she did love himlove him with a
passion which was a torture rather than a joy she had not known the
full extent of that passion until the hour when she had stood concealed
between the trees at the river and heard leycesters voice murmuring
words of love to another
and that other an unknown miserable painters niece often at
night when the great hall was hushed and still she lay tossing to and
fro with miserable longing and intolerable shame as she recalled that
hour when she had been discovered by jasper adelstone and forced to
become his confederate
she the great beautybefore whom princes had bent in homageto be
lovesmitten by a man whose heart was given to anothershe to be the
confederate and accomplice of a scheming underbred lawyer
it was intolerable unbearable but it was trueit was true and in
the very keenest paroxysm of her shame she would confess that she would
do all that she had done would conspire with even a baser one than
jasper adelstone to gain her end
she she would murmur in the still watches of the nightshe to
marry the man to whom i have given my love it is impossibleit shall
not be though i have to move heaven and earth it shall not be
and then after a sleepless night she would come down to
breakfastfair and sweet and smilinga little pale perhaps but
looking all the lovelier for such paleness without the shadow of a
care in the deep violet eyes
toward leycester her bearing was simply perfection she did not wish to
alarm him she knew that a hint of what she felt would put him on his
guard and she held herself in severe restraint
her manner to him was simply what it was to anyone elseexquisitely
refined and charming if anything she adopted a lighter tone and
sought to and succeeded in calling forth his rare laughter
she deceived him completely
lenore in love with me he said to himself more than once the idea
is ridiculous what could have made the mother imagine such a thing
and so they met freely and frankly and he talked and laughed with her
at his ease little dreaming that she was watching him as a cat watches
a mouse and that not a thing he said or did escaped her
she knew by instinct where he spent the times in which he was missing
from the hall and pictured to herself the meetings between him and the
girl who had robbed her of his love and as the jealousy increased so
did the love which created it day by day she realized still more fully
that he had won her heartthat it was gone to him foreverthat her
whole future happiness depended upon him
the very tone of his voice so deep and musicalhis rare laughthe
smile that made his face so gay and brightyes even the bursts of the
passionate temper which lit up the dark eyes with sudden fire were
precious to her
yes i love him she murmured to herselfit is all summed up in
that i love him
and leycester still smiling to himself over his mothers amusing
mistake was all unsuspecting all his thoughts were of stella
now as he came toward the terrace she stood with lady longford and
lord charles looking down at him
she watched him her cheek resting on her white hand her face hidden
from the rest by the sunshade whose lining of hearty blue harmonized
with the golden hair and her heart hungered as victor hugo says
heres leycester said lord charles
lady longford looked over the balustrade
what has he been doing rowingfishing
he went out with a fishing rod said lord charles with a grin but
the fish appear to have devoured it at any rate leycester hasnt got
it now hullo old man where have you been come up here
leycester sprang up the steps and stood beside lenore it was the first
time she had seen him that morning and she inclined her head and held
out her hand with a smile
he took her hand it was warm and soft his own was still cold from his
bath and she opened her eyes widely
your hand is quite cold she said then she touched his sleeve and
you are wet where have you been
leycester laughed carelessly
i have met with a slight accident and gained a pleasant bath
an accident she repeated not curiously but with calm serene
interest
yes he said shortly a young friend of mine fell into the river
and i joined company just for companys sake
i understand she said with a smile you went in to save him
well thats putting rather a fine point to it he said smilingly
but its true may one ask his name
leycester flicked a piece of moss from the stone coping and hesitated
for a moment
his name is frank he said frank etheridge
lady lenore nodded
a pretty name i dont remember it i hope he is grateful
i hope so said leycester i am sure he is more grateful than the
occasion merits
the old countess looked round at him
what is it you say she said you have been in the river after some
boy and you stand there lounging about in your wet clothes well the
lad ought to be grateful for though you will not catch your death
you will in all probability catch a chronic influenza cold and thats
worse than death its life with a pockethandkerchief to your nose
go and change your things at once
i think i had better after that fearful prognostication said
leycester with a smile and he sauntered off
etheridge said lady longford that is the name of that pretty girl
with the dark eyes who dined here the other night
yes said lenore indifferently for the old countess looked at her
she knew that the indifference was assumed
if leycester doesnt take care he will find himself in danger with
those dark eyes girls are apt to be grateful toward men who rescue
their cousins from a watery grave
lady lenore shifted her sunshade and smiled serenely
no doubt she is very grateful why should she not be do you think
lord leycester is in danger i do not and she strolled away
the old lady glanced at lord charles
that is a wonderful girl charles she said with earnest admiration
what lenore he said rather just found it out lady longford
no mr impertinence i have known it all along but she astonishes me
afresh every day what a great name she would have won on the stage
but she will do better as lady wyndward
lord charles shook his head and whistled softly
rather premature that isnt it he said leycester doesnt seem
very keen in that quarter does he
lady longford smiled at him and showed her teeth
what does it matter how he seems she said it rests with herwith
her you are a nice boy charles but you are not clever
just exactly what my old schoolmaster used to say before he birched
me said lord charles
if you were clever if you were anything else than unutterably stupid
you would go and see that leycester changes his clothes snapped the
old lady ill be bound he is sitting or lounging about in those wet
things still
a nods as good as a wink to a blind horse said lord charles
laughing ill go and do as i am bidden he will probably tell me to
go and mind my own business but here goes and he walked off toward
the house
he found leycester in the hands of his valet being rapidly transferred
from wet flannels to orthodox morning attire and apparently the valet
was not having a particularly easy time of it
lord charles sank into a chair and watched the performance with amused
interest
whats the matter ley he asked when the man left the room for a
moment youll drive that poor devil into a lunatic asylum
hes so confoundedly slow answered leycester brushing away at his
hair which the valet had already arranged and tugging at a refractory
scarf i havent a moment to lose
may one ask whence this haste said lord charles with a smile
leycester colored slightly
ive half a mind to tell you charlie he said but i cant id
better keep it to myself
im glad of it retorted lord charles im sure its some piece of
madness and if you told me youd want me to take a hand in it
but thats just it said leycester with a laugh youve got to take
a hand in it old fellow
oh
leycester nodded and clapped him on the shoulder with a musical laugh
the best of you charlie he said is that one can always rely on
you
lord charles groaned
dontdont ley he implored i know that phrase so well you
always were wont to use it when there was some particularly evil
piece of business to be done in the old days frankly im a reformed
character and i decline to aid and abet you in any further madness
this isnt madness said leycesteroh keep outside a moment
oliver i dont want youthis is not madness charlie its the
sanest thing ive ever done in my life
i dare say
it is indeed look here i am going up to london
i guessed that poor london
do stop and listen to mei havent a moment to spare i want you to
do a little delicate service for me
i decline what is it retorts lord charles inconsistently
it is very simple i want you to deliver a note for me
oh come you know wont one of the army of servants who devour the
land like locusts serve your turn
no no none will do but yourself i want this note delivered at once
and i dont want anyone but our two selves to know anything about it i
dont want it to be carried about in one of the servants pockets for
an hour or two
lord charles stretched his legs and shook his head
look here ley isnt this rather too thin he remonstrated of
course its to someone of the gentler sex
leycester smiled
you are wrong he said with a smile wheres the bradshaw oliver
and he opened the door put out the notepaper and then tell them to
get a dogcart to take me to the station
you will want me my lord
no i am going alone look sharp
oliver put out the writing materials and departed and leycester sat
down and stared for a moment at the crested paper
shall i go asked lord charles ironically
no i dont mean to lose sight of you old fellow replied leycester
sit where you are
can i help you i am rather good at amorous epistles especially other
peoples
be quiet
then he seized the pen and wrote
 my dear franki have inclosed a note for stella will you give it
 to her when she is alone and with your own hand she will tell you
 that i have asked her to come with you by the eleven oclock train
 tomorrow will you bring her to 24 bruton street i shall meet
 you there instead of meeting you at the station you see i put it
 quite simply and am quite confident that you will help us you know
 our secret and will stand by us will you not of course you will
 come without any luggage and without letting anyone divine your
 intentions
     yours my dear frank
          leycester
this was all very well it was easy enough to write to the boy because
he leycester knew that if he had asked frank to walk through fire
frank would do it but stella
a sharp pang of doubt assailed him as he took up the second sheet of
paper suppose she should not come
he got up and strode to and fro the room his brows knit the old look
of determination on his face
drop it ley said lord charles quietly
leycester stopped and smiled down at him
you dont know what that would mean charlie he said
perhaps i do toher whomsoever it should be
then leycester laughed outright
you are on the wrong track this time altogether he said quite
wrong
and he sat down and plunged into his letter
like the first it was very short
 my darlingdo not be frightened when you read what follows and do
 not hesitate think as you read that our happiness depends upon your
 decision i want you to come with frank by the eleven oclock train
 to london whither i am going now i want you to take a cab and go to
 24 bruton street where i shall be waiting for you you know what will
 happen my darling before the morrow you and i will have set out on
 that long journey through life handinhand man and wife my pen
 trembles as i write the words you will come stella think i know
 what you will feeli know as if i were standing beside you how you
 will tremble and hesitate and dread the step but you must take it
 dearest once we are married all will go well and pleasantly i cannot
 wait any longer why should i i have written to frank and confided
 him to your care trust yourself to him throw all your doubts and
 fears to the winds think only of my love and may i add your own
     yours ever
          leycester
he inclosed stellas letter in a small envelope and that with franks
letter in a larger one which he addressed to frank
chapter xxiv
there he said balancing it on his finger and smiling in his eager
impatient waythere is the missive charlie read the superscription
thereof
lord charles took the letter gingerly and shook his head
the lad you picked out of the water he said what does it mean i
wish youd drop it ley
leycester shook his head
this is the last time i shall ask you to do me a favor charlie
till the next
you mustnt refuse i want you to give this to the boy you will find
him down at etheridges cottage you cannot mistake him he is a fair
delicatelooking boy with yellow hair and blue eyes
lord charles hesitated and looked up with a grave light in his eyes and
a faint flush on his face
ley he said in a low voice she is too good far too good
lord leycesters face flushed
if it were any other man charlie he said looking him full in the
eyes i should cut up rough i tell you that you misunderstand meand
you wrong me
then said lord charles it is almost a worse case ley ley what
are you going to do
i am going to do what no man on earth could prevent me doing said
leycester calmly but with a fierce light in his eyes not even you
charlie
lord charles rose
give me the letter he said quietly at any rate i know when
words are useless is there anything else shall i order a straight
waistcoat this mark my words leythisif it is what i conjecture
it to bethis is the very maddest thing you have ever done
it is the very wisest and sanest responded leycester no there is
nothing else charlie i may wire for you tomorrow if i do you will
come
yes i will come said lord charles
oliver knocked at the moment
the dogcart is waiting my lord and there is only just time
leycester and lord charles passed out and down the stairs
the sound of laughter and music floated faintly through the parted
curtains of the drawingroom
what shall i say to them asked lord charles nodding toward the room
leycester smiled grimly
tell them he said that i have gone to town on business and he
laughed quietly
then suddenly he stopped as if a thought had struck him and glanced at
his watch
one moment he said and ran lightly up the stairs to lilians room
her maid met him at the door
her ladyship is asleep she said
leycester hesitated then he signed to her to open the door and
entered
lady lilian lay extended on her couch her eyes closed a faint
painful smile on her face
he stood and looked at her a moment then he bent and lightly touched
her lips with his
goodbye lil he murmured you at least will understand
then he ran down putting on his gloves and had one foot on the
dogcart step when lady wyndward came into the hall
leycester she said where are you going
he turned and looked at her rather wistfully lord charles fingered the
letter in his pocket and wished himself in peru
to london mother he said
why she asked
it was an unusual question for her who rarely asked him his
intentions or the why and wherefore and he hesitated
on business he said
she looked at the flushed face and the fire smoldering in his eyes and
then at lord charles who jingled the money in his pocket and whistled
softly with an air of pure abstraction
what is it she asked and an unusual look of trouble and doubt came
into her eyes
nothing that need trouble you mother he said i shall be back
he stopped when should he be backsoon he added
then he stooped and kissed her
lady wyndward looked up into his eyes
dont go leycester she murmured
almost roughly in his impatience he put her arm from him
you dont know what you ask he said then in a gentle tone he said
goodbye and sprang into the cart
the horse rose for a moment then put his fore feet down and went off
like a rocket under the sharp cut of the whip and lady wyndward with
a sigh of apprehension turned to where lord charles had stood
had stood for he had seized the moment of departure to steal off
he had helped leycester in many a mad freak had stood in with him in
many a wild adventure which had cost them much after trouble and no
small amount of money but lord charles had a shrewd suspicion that
this which he was asked to assist in was the climax of all that had
gone before but he felt that he must do it as we have said there
were times when words were of as little use as chaff with leycester
and this was one of them
ruefully but unshaken in his devotion he went upstairs for his hat
and stick and sauntered down still wishing that he could have been in
peru
there will be a terrible storm he muttered his people will cut up
rough and i shall of course bear some portion of the blame but
i dont mind that it is ley i am thinking of will it turn out all
right
he was asking himself the question dolefully and helplessly as he
descended the stairs when he became conscious of the graceful form of
lady lenore standing in the hall and looking up at him
she had watched lord leycesters departure from the window she knew
that he was going to town suddenlyknew that lord charles had been
closeted with him and now only needed to glance at lord charles
rueful face to be convinced that something had happened but there was
nothing of this in her smile as she looked up at him gently fluttering
a japanese fan and holding back the trailing skirts with her white
bejeweled fingers
lord charles started as he saw her
by jove he murmured if it is as i think what will she do and
with an instinctive dread he felt half inclined to turn and reascend
the stairs but lenore was too quick for him
we have been looking for you lord charles she said languidly
some rash individual has proposed lawntennis we want you to play
lord charles looked confused the letter burnt his pocket and he knew
that he should know no peace until he got rid of it
awfully sorry he said going down to the postoffice to post a
letter
lady lenore smiled and glanced archly at the clock
no post till seven she said wont it do after our game
no post he said with affected concern better telegraph he
muttered
ill get you a form she said sweetly and you can send it by one
of the pages
eh he stammered blushing like a schoolboy no dont trouble
couldnt think of it after all it doesnt matter
then she knew that leycester had given him some missive and she
watched him closely no poorer hand at deception than poor charles
could possibly be imagined he felt as if the softlysmiling velvet
eyes could see into his pocket and his hand closed over the letter
with a movement that she noted instantly
it is a letter she thought and it is for her
and a pang of jealous fire ran through her but she still looked up at
him with a languid smile
well are you coming
of course he assented with too palpablyfeigned alacrity and he
ran down the stairs
she caught up a sunhat and put it on and pointed to the racquets that
stood in their stand in the hall she would not let him out of her
sight for a moment
they are all waiting she said
he followed her on to the lawn the group stood playing with the balls
and waiting impatiently
lord charles looked round helplessly but he had no time to think
shall we play together said lenore we know each others play so
well
lord charles nodded not too gallantly
all right he said and as he spoke his hand wandered to his pocket
the game commenced they were well matched and presently lord charles
whose two games were billiards and tennis got interested he also got
warm and taking off his coat flung it on to the grass
lady lenore glanced at it and presently as she changed places with
him took off her bracelet and threw it on the coat
jewelery is superfluous in tennis she said with a soft laugh we
mean to win this set do we not lord charles
he laughed
if you say so he replied you always win if you mean it
nearly always she said with a significant smile
all the four were enthusiasts if lenore could be called enthusiastic
about anything and the game was hotly contested the sun poured
down upon their faces but they played on pausing occasionally for
the usual squabble over the scoring the servants brought claret and
champagne cup lady wyndward and the earl came out and sat in the
shade watching
we shall win exclaimed lord charles the perspiration running down
his face his whole soul absorbed in the work the letter entirely
forgotten
i think so said lady lenore but as she spoke she missed a long ball
how did you manage that he inquired
it is the racquet she said apologetically it is a little too
heavy it always gets too heavy when i have been playing a little
while i wish i had my other one
ill send for it he said eagerly
no no she said they wont know which it isthey never do
ill go for it then he said gracefully cant lose the game you
know
will you she said eagerly it stands on the hall table
i know he said wait a moment he called out to the others and
bolted off
lenore looked after him for a moment then she glanced round the other
two were standing discussing the game the onlookers were gathered
round the champagne cup lady wyndward was lost in thought with eyes
bent to the ground
the beautys eyes flashed and her face grew slightly pale her eyes
wandered to the coat she hesitated for a moment then she walked
leisurely toward it and stooped down and picked up the bracelet as she
did so she turned the coat over with her other hand and drew the note
from the pocket
a glance put her in possession of the address and she returned the
note to its place and strolled back to the tenniscourt with an
unmoved countenance but her heart beat fast as her acute brain seized
upon the problem and worked it out
a note to the boy a letter which can be confided to no less trusty a
hand than lord charles leycesters sudden departure for london lord
charless confusion and embarrassment secresy and mystery what does
it mean
a presentiment seemed to possess her that a critical moment had
arrived she seemed to feel by instinct that some movement was in
progress by which she should lose all chance of securing leycester
her heart beat fast so fast that the delicate veins in her white
hands throbbed but she still smiled and even glided across to lady
wyndward who sat thoughtfully in the shade looking at the tennis but
thinking of leycester
she looked up as the tall graceful figure approached
you are tiring yourself to death my dear she said with a sigh
no i am enjoying it what is the matter
lady wyndward looked at her candidly
i am troubled about my only troublous subject leycester has gone off
again
i know was the quiet answer
where i know not he said london i dont know why i should feel
particularly uneasy but i do there is some plot afoot between lord
charles and him
i know it smiled lenore lord charles is not good at keeping a
secret he makes a very bad conspirator
he would do anything for leycester any mad thing sighed lady
wyndward
the beautiful face smiled down at her thoughtfully for a moment then
lenore said
do you think you could keep lord charles on the tennislawn here for
halfanhour
why asked lady wyndward yes i think so
do so then replied lady lenore i will tell you why afterward
lord charles is very clever no doubt but i think i am cleverer dont
you
i think you are all that is good and beautiful my dear sighed the
anxious mother
dear lady wyndward softly murmured the beauty well keep him
chained here for halfanhour and leave the rest to me i am not apt
to ask unreasonable requests dear
no ill do anything you want or tell me replied lady wyndward i
am full of anxious fears lenore do you know what it means
lady lenore hesitated
no i do not know but i think i can guess see here he comes
lord charles came striding along swinging the racquet
here you are lady lenore is that the right one
yes she said but i cant play any longer i am so sorry but i
have hurt my hand no its a mere nothing i am going in to bathe it
oh its an awful pity said lord charles i am very sorry well
the game is over we must play it out another day im going down to
the village and ill call at the chemists for a lotion i expect you
have sprained your hand and suddenly reminded of his mission he was
walking toward his coat but lenore glanced at the countess and lady
wyndward stopped him with a word
we cant have the game stopped she said here is miss dalton dying
to play arent you dear she said turning to a young girl who had
been watching the game yes i knew it you must take her in place of
lenore go on my dear
miss dalton or miss any one else would as soon have thought of
disobeying lady wyndward as jumping off the top story of the hall and
the girl rose obediently and took the racquet which lenore smilingly
held out to her
then what did lenore do she walked deliberately to lord charles
coat dropped her bracelet on it stooped picked up the bracelet
and abstracted the letter and concealing the latter in her sunshade
glided toward the house
with fast beating heart she gained her own room and locked the door
then she drew the letter from her sunshade and eyed it as a thief might
eye a safe in which lay the treasure he coveted
then she rang the bell and ordered some hot water
i have sprained my wrist she said in explanation and i want the
water very hot
the maid brought the water and offered to bathe the wrist but lady
lenore sent her away and locked the door again
then she held the envelope over the steaming jug and watched the paper
part
even then she hesitated even as the note lay open to her
this which she contemplated doing was the meanest act a mortal could be
guilty of and hitherto she had scorned all baseness and meanness but
love is stronger than a sense of right and wrong in some women and it
overcame her scruples
with a sudden compression of the lips she drew out the note and read
it and as she read it her face paled every word of endearment stabbed
her straight to the heart and made her writhe
my darling she murmured my darling how he must love her and for
a moment she sat with the letter in her hand overcome by jealousy and
misery then with a start she roused herself let come what might
the thing should not happen this girl should not be leycesters wife
but how to prevent it she sat and thought as the precious moments
ticked themselves out into eternity and suddenly she remembered
jasper adelstoneremembered him with a scornful contempt but still
remembered him
any port in a storm she said a drowning man clings to a straw and
he is no straw
then she inclosed the letter in its envelope and taking out the
writingcase wrote on a scented sheet of paper meet me by the weir
at eight oclock this she inclosed in an envelope and addressed to
jasper adelstone esq and with the two notes in her hand returned to
the tennis lawn
they were still playinglord charles absorbed in the game and once
more quite oblivious of the letter
she stood and watched them for a minute then she went and sank down
beside the jacket and hiding the movements with her sunshade restored
leycesters letter to its place
a few minutes afterward the single line she had written was on its way
to jasper
chapter xxv
i am frank etheridge said frank looking up at lord charles as
the latter stopped at the little gate in the lane yes i am frank
etheridge and as he repeated the sentence a shy almost a timid
apprehensive expression came into his eyes
all right said lord charles looking round with a most inconsistent
look of caution on his frank handsome face then i have a letter for
you
for me said frank and his face paled
lord charles eyed him with astonishment
what is the matter he said what are you alarmed at i am not a
bailiffi am only mercury and he chuckled at the joke at his own
expense i have a letter for youfrom my friend lord leycester
franks face lit up and he held out his hand promptly
lord charles took the letter from his pocket and turned it over quickly
its got tumbled and creased he said fact is i ought to have
given it to you an hour or two ago but i was led on to tennis and
forgot it
oh its all right said frank eagerly i am very much obliged
sir wont you come in my father and my cousin stella will be glad to
see you
but lord charles shook his head and glanced at the pretty cottage
with its air of peace which surrounded it with something like a pang
of remorse
i do hope this will all turn out right he thought leycester
means well but he is as likely as not to bungle it in one of his
mad humors then aloud he said no i wont come in but he
hesitated a moment but will you tell your cousinmiss etheridge
thatthat simple lord charles hesitated and took off his hat and
stared at the makers name for a moment well look here you know if
either you or she want any assistancewant a friend you knowcome
to me i shall be at the hall you understand dont you my name is
guildford
frank nodded and took lord charless extended hand
thank you very much lord guildford he said
and lord charles with another rather rueful glance at the cottage
retired
frank tore open the envelope and devoured the contents of the short
and pregnant note then he went in search of stella
she was sitting at the organ not playing but touching the keys with
her fingers a rapt look of meditation on her face mr etheridge was
hard at work making the best of the golden evening light
stella started as the boy came in and would have spoken but he put
his finger to his lips and beckoned her
they both passed out without attracting the attention of the absorbed
artist and frank drew stella into the garden and to a small arbor at
the further end she looked at his flushed excited face with a smile
what does this mysterious conduct mean frank she asked
he put his arm round her and drew her to a seat
ive got something for you stella he said what will you give me
for it it is worthwell untold treasure but ill be satisfied with
a kiss
she bent and kissed his forehead
of course it is nothing she said with a laugh but as he took the
letter from his pocket and held it up her face changed what is it
frank
he put the letter in her hand and with an instinctive delicacy got up
and walked away
read it stel he said ill be back directly
stella took the letter and opened it when frank came back she was
sitting with the open letter in her hand her face very pale her eyes
filled with a strange light
well he said
oh frank she breathed i cannot do it i cannot
cannot he exclaimed you must why stella of what are you afraid
i shall be with you
she shook her head slowly
it is not that i am not afraid and there was a touch of pride in
her voice do you think i am afraid ofof leycester
no he retorted i should think not i would trust him if i were in
your place to the end of the world i know what he has asked you to
do stel and youwemust do it
stella looked at him
and uncle
the boy colored but his eyes met hers steadily
well it will not hurt him he will not mind he likes lord leycester
and when we come back and tell him he will be only too grateful that it
is all over without any fuss or trouble you know that stel
she did know it but her heart still misgave her with a touch of color
in her pale face at the thought of what it meant she said gently
he has been a father to me frank ah you do not know
yes i do he said shortly but a husband is more than a father
stella and my father wont be any the less fond of you because you are
lady leycester wyndward
oh hushhush breathed stella glancing round as if she feared the
very shrubs and flowers might hear
frank threw himself beside her and laying his hand on her arm looked
up into her beautiful face with eager entreaty
you will go stel you will do what he asks and stella looked down
at him with gentle wonder leycester himself could not have pleaded his
own cause more earnestly
dont you see stel he said answering her look for she had not
spoken i would do anything for himanything he risked his life
for me but it is not only that it is because he has treated me
sosowell i cant explain but i would do anything for him stella
ii love you you know butbut i feel as if i should hate you if
you refused to do what he asks
stellas eyes glistened it made her heart throb to hear the boys
championship of the man she loved
besides he continued why should you hesitate for it is for your
own happinessfor the happiness of us all think you will be the
future countess of wyndward the mistress of the hall
stella looked at him reproachfully
frank
yes i know you dont care about that neither do i much but other
people will my father will be gladhe could not help being so and
then you will be safe
safe what do you mean asked stella
he hesitated then he looked up at her with an angry resentful flash in
his blue eyes
stel i was thinking of that fellow adelstone i dont like him i
hate him in fact and i hate him all the more because he has set his
mind upon having you
stella smiled and shook her head
oh of course you cant see any harm in him its quite right you
shouldntyou are a girl and dont know the world but i know
something of men and i say that jasper adelstone is not a man to be
trusted
i dont like him said stella in a low tone but i am quite
safe as you call it without marrywithout doing what you and
leycester wish
i dont know he muttered gloomily at any rate you would be
safe then andand stella you must go see now leycester has
trusted you to mehas placed this in my hands it is as if he said i
saved your lifeyou promised to help me here is something to dodo
it and i will you will go think stela few short hours and you
will be lady leycester
she did think of it and her heart beat tumultuously
yes she would be safe not only from jasper adelstone but from lady
lenore whom she feared more than she did twenty jasper adelstones
leycester would be her own her very own and though she did not care
much for the wyndward coronet she did care for him
she covered her face with her hands and sat quite motionless for a few
minutes the boy watching her eagerly impatiently then she dropped
her hands and looked down at him with the quiet grave resolute smile
which he knew so well
yes frank i will do it was all she said
he kissed her hand gratefully
think it is lord leycester thanking you stel he whispered and
now for the preparations you must pack a small bag and i will do
the same and then i must take them down the lane and hide them it
wouldnt do to go out of the house in the morning with the bags in
our handsmrs penfold would raise the neighborhood and we must
stroll out as if we were strolling down to the river but therehe
broke off for he saw stellas face always so eloquent beginning to
show signs of irresolutionleave it all to meill see to it lord
leycester knew he could trust me
stella sat for a few minutes in silence thinking of the old man who
had received her in her helplessness who had loved and treated her as
a daughter and whom she was about to deceive
her heart smote her keenly but still frank had spoken the
truthhusband was more than father and leycester would be her husband
she stooped and kissed the boy
i must go in now frank she said do not say any more i will go
but i cannot talk of it
she went in the dusk was falling and the old man stood beside his
easel eying it wistfully
she went and drew him away
no more tonight uncle she said in tones that quivered
dangerously come and sit down come and sit and watch the river as
you sat the day i came do you remember
yesyes my dear he murmured sinking into the chair and taking
the pipe she filled for him i remember the day it was a happy day
for me it would be a miserable day the day you left me stella
stella hid her face on his shoulder and her arm went round his neck
he smoothed her hair in silence
where is frank he asked dreamily
in the garden shall i call him dear frank he is a dear boy uncle
yes he answered musingly then he roused slightly yes frank is a
good boy he has changed greatly i have to thank you for that too my
dear
me uncle
the old man nodded his eyes fixed on the distant lights of the hall
yes it is your influence stella i have watched and noticed it
there is no one in the world who has so much power over him yes he is
a good boy now thanks to you
what could she say her heart throbbed quickly her influence and she
was now going to help him to deceive his fatherfor her sake
in silence she hid her face and a tear rolled down her cheek and fell
upon his arm
uncle she murmured you know i love you you know that you will
always remember and believe that whateverwhatever happens
he nodded all unsuspectingly and smiled
what is going to happen stella he asked but even as he asked his
gaze grew dreamy and absent and she looking in his face was silent
                                   
as the clock struck the hour jasper adelstone threaded his way through
the wood and stood concealed behind the oak by the weir
he had not spent a pleasant time since the avowal of his love to
stella and her refusal most men would have been daunted and
discouraged at such a refusal so scornfully so decidedly given but
jasper adelstone was not the sort to be so easily balked opposition
only served to whet his appetite and harden his resolution
he had set his mind upon gaining stella he had set his mind upon
balking lord leycester and he was not to be turned from his purpose by
her refusing his addresses or the petulance of the boy who had chosen
to insult and set him at defiance
but he had passed a bad time of it and was meditating a renewal of the
attack when lady lenores note was brought to him although it bore no
signature he knew from whence it came and he knew that something had
happened of importance or she would not have sent for him
another man might have vented his spite and taken revenge for the
haughty insolence displayed by her on their former meeting by keeping
her waiting but jasper adelstone was not altogether a mean man and
certainly not such a fool as to risk an advantage for the sake of
gratifying a little private malice
he was punctual to the minute and stood watching the weir and the
path by turns with a face that was naturally calm and selfpossessed
though in reality he was burning with impatience
presently he heard the rustle of a dress and saw her coming swiftly
and gracefully through the trees she wore a dark dress of some soft
stuff that clung to her supple figure and awoke for a moment his sense
of admiration but only for a moment bad as he was he was faithful
and of single purpose he had no thought of anyone but stella if lady
lenore had laid her rank and her wealth at his feet he would have
turned from them
lenore came down the path neither looking to the right nor the left
but straight before her her head held up haughtily and her whole gait
as full of pride and conscious power as if she were treading the floor
of a london ballroom even in doing a mean thing she could not do it
meanly arrived at the weir she stood for a moment looking down at the
water her gloved hand resting on the wooden sill and jasper watching
her could not but wonder at her calm selfpossession
and yet he thought she has more at stake than i she has a
coronetand the man she loves and the thought gave him courage as
he came out and stood before her raising his hat
chapter xxvi
she turned and inclined her head haughtily and waited as if for him
to speak but jasper remained silent she had sent for him he was here
at last she spoke
you received my note mr adelstone
i am here he said with a slight smile
she bit her lip her pride revolting at his presence at his very tone
i sent for you she said after a pause and in the coldest tone
because i have some information which i thought would interest you
your ladyship is very good he said
and because she went on scorning to accept his thanks i thought
you might be of service
he inclined his head he would not meet her half waywould not help
her let her tell him why she had sent for him and he would throw
himself into the case not till then
the last time that we met you said words which i am not likely to have
forgotten
i have not forgotten them he said and i am prepared to stand by
them
you profess to be willingto be eager to prevent a certain
occurrence
if you mean the marriage of lord leycester and stelmiss etheridge i
am more than willing i am determined to prevent it
you speak with great confidence she said
i am always confident lady lenore he said it is by confidence
that great things are achieved this is only a small one
and yet it may be beyond your power to achieve she said scornfully
i think not he retorted quietly and gravely
be that as it may she said i have come here this evening to place
in your hands a piece of information respecting the girl in whom you
profess to take an interest
the blood came to his pale face and his eyes gleamed with sudden
resentment
by the girl do you refer to miss stella etheridge he said
quietly if so permit me to remind your ladyship that she is a lady
lady lenore made a gesture of haughty indifference
call her what you please she said coldly insolently i did refer
to her
and to the man in whom you take an interest he said with an
insolence that matched her own
the dark red flamed in her face and she looked at him
that is a side of the question which we will not enter upon if you
please mr adelstone she said
i am to understand then he said with quiet scorn that you came
here this evening by your own appointment to do me a service is that
so
he had roused her at last
understand think what you will she said in a low strange voice
let there be no parley between us i wanted to see you and sent for
you and you are here let that suffice you wish to prevent the
marriage of lord leycester and the lady whom we saw him with at this
spot you speak confidently of your power to do so you will have a
speedy opportunity of testing that power for lord leycester intends
marrying her tomorrow or at latest the next day
he did not start neither did he turn pale but he looked at her
calmly fixedly she knew that her shaft had told home and she stood
and watched and enjoyed
how do you know this he asked quietly in a very low voice
she paused it was a bitter humiliation to have to admit to this man
whom she regarded as the dust under her feet that she the lady
lenore had stooped so low as to steal and read a letter addressed to
another person and that person her rivalbut it had to be admitted
i know it because he wrote and made arrangements for her flight and
their clandestine meeting
how do you know it he asked and his voice was dry and harsh
she paused a moment
because i saw the letter she said eying him defiantly
he smiledeven in his agony and fury he smiled at her humiliation
you have indeed done much in my service he said with a sneer
yours came fiercely to her lips then she made a gesture of
contempt as if he were beneath her resentment
you saw the letter he said what were the arrangements when and
where was she to meet him curse him he ground out between his teeth
she is to go to london by the eleven oclock train tomorrow and he
will meet her and take her to 24 bruton street she said curtly
he choked back the oath that came to his lips
meet him and alone he muttered the sweat breaking out on his
forehead his lips writhing
no not alone a boy her cousin is to accompany them
ah he said and a malignant smile curled his lips i can scotch
that small snake but himlord leycester and his hands clinched
he took a turn in the narrow path and then came back to her
and afterward he asked what is to follow
she shook her head with contemptuous indifference and leant against
the wooden rail looking down at the bubbling seething water
i do not know i imagine as the boy accompanies her that he will
get a special license andmarry her but perhapsand she glanced
round at his white face with a malicious smileperhaps the boy is a
mere blind and lord leycester will dispose of him
and then
then she said slowly well lord leycesters character is
tolerably well known in all probability he will not find it necessary
to make the girli beg your pardon the young ladythe future
countess of wyndward
she had gone too far as the cruel fearful words left her lips in all
their biting merciless scorn and contempt he sprang upon her and
seized her by the arm
her feet slipped and she turned and clung to him half her body
hanging over the white foaming water
for a moment they stood there his gleaming eyes threatening death
into hers then with a sudden long breath as if he had mastered his
murderous impulse he stepped backward and drew her with him into
safety
take care he said wiping the perspiration from his white forehead
with a trembling hand your ladyship nearly went too far you forget
that i love this girl as you call her though she is an angel of light
and a star of nobility beside you who stoop to open letters and utter
slander take care
she eyed him with a cruel scorn in her eyes and on her lips that were
white and shamed
you would murder me she said
he laughed a low dry laugh
i would murder anyone who spoke of her as you spoke he said with
quiet intensity so be warned my lady for the future teach your
proud temper respect when it touches her name besidesand he made
a gesture as of contemptit was a foolish lie you know that he
intended nothing of the kind you know that she is too pure even for
his dastardly heart to compass her destruction i imagine it is that
which makes you hate her so is it not no matter now that you are
warned and that you have learnt that i jasper adelstone am no mere
slave to dance or writhe at your pleasure we will return to the
purport of the meeting will you not sit down and he pointed to the
weir stage
she was trembling from sheer physical weakness combined with impotent
rage and fury but she would rather have died than obey him
go on she said what have you to say
this he returned that this marriage must be prevented and that
miss etheridges good name must be preserved and protected i can
prevent this marriage even now at the last hour i will do so on the
condition that you give me your promise that you will never while life
lasts speak of this i have not much fear that you will do so even you
will hesitate before you proclaim to a third person your capability of
opening another persons letters
i promise she said coldly and how will you prevent this you do
not know the man against whom you intend to pit yourself beware of
him lord leycester is a man who will not be trifled with
thanks he retorted you are very kind to warn me especially as you
would very much like to see me at lord leycesters feet but i need no
warning i deal with her not with him how is my affair
she rose
i will go she said coldly
stay he said you have got your part to do
she eyed him with haughty surprise
i
he nodded
let me think for a moment and he took a turn on the path then he
came back and stood beside her
this is your part he said in low distinct tones and remember
that the stake you are playing for is as great and greater than mine
i am playing for love you are playing for love and for wealth and
rank and influence all that makes life worth living for for such as
you
you are insolent
no i am simply candid between us two there can be no further
byplay or concealment if she obeys this command of his and and
he groanedi fear she will obey it they will start by the eleven
oclock train and he will await them at the london terminus they must
start by that train but they must not reach the terminus
she started and eyed him in the dusk
he smiled sardonically
no i do not take extreme measures until they are absolutely
necessary lady lenore it is an easy matter to prevent them reaching
the terminus a very easy oneit is only a matter of a forged note
her lips moved
a forged note
he nodded
yes having bidden her take a decided course he must write and alter
his instructions do you not understand
she was silent watching him
a note must come from himit will be better to write to the boy
because he is not familiar with lord leycesters handwritingtelling
them to get out at the station before london at vauxhall they are to
get out and go to the entrance where they will find a brougham which
will take them to him you understand
i understand she said but the notewho is to forgewrite it
he smiled at her with malignant triumph
you
i
he smiled again
yes you who so well able to do it you are an adept at manipulating
correspondence remember my lady
she winced and her eyes blazed under their lowered lids
you know his handwriting you can easily obtain access to his writing
materials the paper and envelope will bear the wyndward crest the
note can be delivered by a servant from the hall
she was silent overwhelmed by the power of his cunning and a
reluctant admiration of his resource and ready ingenuity took
possession of her as he had said he was no slaveno puppet to be
worked at will
you see he said after allowing a moment for his scheme to sink into
her brain the note will be delivered almost at the last moment at
the carriage door as the train starts you will do it
she turned away with a last effort
i will not
good he said then i will find some other means stella etheridge
shall never be lord leycesters wife but neither shall a certain lady
lenore beauchamp
she turned upon him with a scornful smile
tomorrow when he stands balked and discomfited filled with impotent
rage and sees me carry her off before his eyes i will give him
something to console him this little note to wit and a full account
of your share in this conspiracy which robs him of his prey
you will not dare she breathed her head erect her eyes blazing
dare and he laughed what is there to dare come my lady it is
not my fault if you remain in ignorance of the nature of the man you
are dealing with work with me and i will serve you desert mefor it
would be desertionand i will thwart you which is it to be you will
write and send the note
she moved her hand
what else
a gleam of triumph shot from his small eyes he thought for a moment
only this he said and it is your welfare that i am now thinking
of when lord leycester returns from his fruitless errand he will be
in a fit state for consolation you can give it to him i have greatly
overrated the ingenuity and tact of lady lenore beauchamp if that tact
and ingenuity does not enable her to bring lord leycester wyndward to
her feet before the month has passed
pale and humiliated but still meeting his sneering contemptuous gaze
with steadfast eyes she inclined her head
is that all
that is all he said i can rely on you yes i thinki am sure i
can after all our interests are mutual
she gathered her shawl round her and moved toward the path
he raised his hat
when next we meet lady lenore it will be as strangers who have
nothing in common the past will have been wiped out from both our
minds and our lives i shall be the chosen husband of stella etheridge
and you will be the lady trevor and future countess of wyndward i
never prophesy in vain my lady i never prophesied more confidently
than i do now goodnight
she did not return his greetingscarcely looked at him but glided
quietly into the darkness
chapter xxvii
sleep kept afar off from stellas eyelids that night the momentous
morrow loomed before her at one moment filling her with a nameless
dread at another suffusing her whole being with an equally nameless
ecstasy
could it be possible that tomorrowin a few hoursshe would be
leycesters wife there was enough in the reflection to banish sleep
for a week
let us do her justice love and not ambition was the sentiment that
moved and agitated her it was not the thought of the title and the
wealth which awaited her not the future wyndward coronet which set her
trembling and her heart throbbing but the reflection that leycester
her lover her ideal of all that was great and noble and manfully
beautiful would be her own all her own
at an early hour she heard frank wandering up and down outside her
door and at last he knocked
are you getting up stel he asked in a whisper
stella opened the door and stood before him in her plain stuff dress
which frank was wont to declare became her better than the satins and
silks of a duchess and he looked up at her with an admiring nod
thats right he said ive been up ages ive taken my bag and
hidden it in the lane is yours ready
she gave him a small handbaggave it with a certain reluctance that
hung about her still but he took it eagerly
thats a good girl it isnt too big i can carry both of them keep
up your spirits stel he added smiling encouragingly as he stole
off with the bag
the warning was not altogether unnecessary for stella when she came
down stairs and found the old man standing before his easel his white
locks stirred by the light wind which came through the open window
felt very near tears
it was a great blot on her happiness that she could not go to him
and throw her arms round his neck and say uncle today i am to be
married to lord leycester give me your blessing
as it was she went up to him and kissed him with more than her usual
caressing tenderness
how quietly happy you always are dear she said with a little
tremulous undertone in her voice you will always be happy while you
have your art uncle
eh he said patting her arm and letting his eye wander over her
face yes art is long life is short stella happy yes but i like
to have you as well as my art two good things in life should make a
man content
you have frank too she said as she poured out his coffee and drew
him to the table
frank came in and breakfast proceeded they were all very silent the
old man rapt in dreams as usualthe two young ones stilled by the
weight of their guilty secret
once or twice frank pressed stellas feet under the table
encouragingly and when they rose and stella went to the window he
followed her and whispered
good news stel
she turned her eyes upon him
ive just learned that the fellow adelstone has gone to london i was
half afraid that he might turn up at the last moment and spoil our
plans but the groom at the vicarage whom i just met told me that
jasper adelstone had been summoned to london on business
stella felt a sense of relief though she smiled
mr adelstone is your bte noire frank she said
he nodded
id rather have his room than his company any day then after a
pause he added i dont think wed better start together stel
ill walk on directly and you can follow whatever you do avoid a
collision with mrs penfold her eyes are sharp and theres something
in your face this morning that would set her curiosity on the qui
vive
a few moments afterward he left the room and stella was left alone
her heart beat fast and try as she would she could not keep her eyes
from the silent patient figure at the easel and at last she went up
and stood beside him
you seem restless this morning my child he said meditating any
secret crime and he smiled
stella started guiltily
i wonder what you would say what you would think uncle she
murmured with a little laugh that bordered on the hysterical if i
were to do anything wrongif i were to deceive you in anything
he stepped back to look at his picture
i should say my dear that the last shred of faith and trust in women
to which i have clung had given way and landed me in despair
no no dont say that she said quickly
he looked at her with a sad smile
my dear he answered i do not speak without cause i have reason to
be incredulous as to the faith and honesty of women but my trust in
you is as limitless as the sky yonder i dont think you will destroy
it stella and he turned to his picture again
the tears came into stellas eyes and she clung to his arm in silent
remorse
uncle she said brokenly then she stopped
the clock chimed the halfhour it was time that she started if she
intended to obey leycester
unconsciously the old man helped her
you look pale this morning my dear he said patting her shoulder
go and run in the meadows and get some color on your cheeks i miss
it
stella took up her hat which was generally lying about ready to be
snatched up and kissed him without a word and left the room
five minutes afterward she passed out into the lane and hurried toward
the road
frank was waiting for her with boyish impatience
i thought you were never coming he exclaimed we havent over much
time and he slung the two bags together and led the way but stella
paused a moment to look back with a pang at her heart and it was not
until frank seized her arm that she moved toward the railway station
but once there when the tickets were taken the excitement buoyed her
up frank with the two bags was perpetually on the alert watching
for someone they knew and preparing to meet them with some excuse
but no one of the village people appeared on the platform and much to
franks relief the train drew up
with all the pride of a chief conspirator and guardian he put stella
into a carriage and was stepping in after her when a groom came up to
the door and touched his hat
mr etheridgemr frank etheridge sir he said respectfully
frank stared but the man seemed prepared for some little hesitation
and without waiting for an answer thrust a note into franks hand
from lord guildford sir he said
the train moved off and frank tore open the envelope
why stella he exclaimed in an excited whisper though they were
alone in the carriage it is from lord leycester look here he wants
us to get out at the station before londonat vauxhallhe has changed
his plans slightly and he held the note out to her
stella took it it was written on paper bearing the wyndward crest the
handwriting was exactly like that of lord leycester no suspicion of
its genuineness crossed her mind for a moment but yet she said
butfrankisnt lord leycester in london
frank thought a moment
yes he said but he must have sent this down to lord guildford
sent it down by special messengerspecial train perhaps it wouldnt
matter to him what trouble or expense he took and yet how careful he
is he asks us to destroy it at once tear it up stella and throw it
out of the window
stella read the note again and then slowly and reluctantly tore it
into small fragments and dropped it out of the window
of course we must stop said frank i think i know what it is
something had prevented him from meeting us and he thought you would
rather get out at a nearer station than go through the crowd at the
terminus isnt it thoughtful and considerate of him
he is always thoughtful and considerate said stella in a low voice
then frank launched forth in a pan of praise
there was nobody like leycester nobody so handsome and so brave or
noble
youll be the happiest girl in the whole world stel he exclaimed
his blue eyes alight with excitement think of it and stella you
will let me see you sometimes you will let me come and stay with you
and stella with a moist look about her eyes put her hand on his arm
and murmured
where my home may be there will be a sisters welcome for you frank
dont be afraid i shall be a nuisance stel he said i shant bore
you for long i shall only want to come and see you and share your
happiness and i dont think lord leycester will mind
and stella smiled as she thought in her innermost heart how sure she
was of lord leycester not minding
the train was an express one and stopped at very few stations
but when those stoppages occurred frank in his character of
guardian always drew the curtains and kept a watch for intruders
notwithstanding that he had told the guard to lock the door
you see it isnt as if you were an ordinary looking girl he
explained a man wouldnt get a glimpse of you without wanting to take
second and its best to be careful im engaged to watch over you and
i must do it
he was so happy so boyishly gratified at his own importance that
stella could not help laughing
i believe you are thoroughly enjoying the wickedness of the thing
frank she said with a little sigh that had not much of unhappiness
no he said but i want to hear lord leycester say thank you
frank and to see him smile when he says it do you think he will let
me go with you or will he send me back stel
stella shook her head
i do not know she answered i feel like a person groping in the
dark go with us yes you must go with us she added frank you
must go with me
ill stay with you till doomsday and go to the end of the world with
you he responded if he will let me
it seemed a long journey to both of them to frank in his impatience
to stella in the whirl of excited and conflicting emotions but at
last they reached vauxhall
frank got the door unlocked and gave up the tickets then he stepped
out on to the platform telling stella to remain in the carriage for a
moment while he examined the ground
but there was not much need for caution as he stepped out a thin
strangelooking old man came up to him
mr etheridge he asked
frank replied in the affirmative
the old man nodded
all right sir the brougham is waiting then he looked round
expectantly and frank went and got stella out
the old man just glanced at her not curiously but in a mechanical
sort of way as if he were a machine and he turned toward the carriage
and took up the bags
stella laid her hand on franks arm with a questioning gesture it was
not exactly one of fear or of suspicion but a strange instinctive
commingling of both sensations
ask him frank she murmured
frank nodded understanding her in a moment and stopped the strange
old man
wait a moment he said you come from
the man looked round
better not mention names here sir he said i am obeying my orders
the brougham is waiting outside
it is all right answered frank he knows my name he is quite right
to be careful
they followed the man down the stairs a brougham was in waiting as he
had said and he put the bags inside and held the door open for them to
enter
stella pausedeven at that moment she paused with the same instinctive
feeling of distrustbut frank whispered be quick and she entered
the old man closed the door
you know where to drive said frank in a low voice
i know sir he said in the same expressionless apathetic fashion
and mounted to the box
stella looked at the crowded streets through which they drove at a
rapid pace and a strange feeling of helplessness took possession
of her she would not own to herself that she was disappointed at
leycesters not meeting her but his absence filled her with a vague
alarm and disquietude which she mentally assured herself were foolish
and unwomanlike
but the vastness and strangeness of the great city overwhelmed her
do you know where bruton street is she asked in a low voice
no said frank but it must be in the westend somewhere of course
he must be going to leycesters rooms i wonder what prevented him from
meeting us
stella wondered too little dreaming that leycester was pacing up and
down the platform at waterloo at that moment and impatiently awaiting
the arrival of the train that was he thought to bring his love
i expect said frank that something turned up at the last
momentsomething to do with the ceremony
a sudden dash of color came into stellas face but it went again the
next moment and she leant back and watched the people hurrying along
the streets with eyes that scarcely saw them
the brougham a well appointed one driven by a man in plain livery
seemed to wind about a great deal and cover a long stretch of ground
but at last it drove under an archway and into a quiet square and
stopped before one of a series of tall and dingylooking houses
frank let down the window as the old man opened the door
is this bruton street said frank
yes sir said the man quietly
frank stepped out and looked around
these are lawyers offices he said
quite right sir was the response the gentleman is waiting for
you
you mean said frank inquiringly
lord leycester wyndward he replied
frank turned to stella
it is all right he said in a low voice
stella got out and looked round the air of quietude and gloomy
depression seemed to strike her but she put her hand on franks arm
and then followed the man into the doorway
come as gently as you can sir he muttered its better the young
lady shouldnt be seen
frank nodded and they passed up the stairs frank threw a glance at
the numerous doors
they are lawyers chambers he said in a low voice i think i
understand it is somethingsome deed or otherleycester wants you to
sign
stella did not speak the chill which had fallen on her as she alighted
seemed to grow keener
suddenly the man stopped before a door the name on which had been
covered over with a sheet of paper
could they have seen through it and read the name of jasper adelstone
there would have been time to draw back but unsuspectingly they
followed the man in the door closed and unseen by them was locked
this way sir said scrivell and he opened the inner door and
ushered them in
if youll take a seat for a moment sir he said putting two chairs
forward and addressing frank i will tell him you have arrived and
he went out
stella sat down but frank went to the window and looked out then he
came back to her restlessly and excitedly
i wonder where he iswhy he does not come he said impatiently
stella looked up her lips were trembling
there dont look like that he exclaimed with a smile it is all
right
as he spoke he drew near the table aimlessly and as aimlessly glanced
at the piles of papers with which it was strewn
i am making you nervous with my excitement he stopped suddenly
and snatched up one of the papers it was a folded brief and bore upon
its surface the name of jasper adelstone written in large letters
he stared at it for a moment as if it had bitten him then with an
inarticulate cry he flung it down and sprang toward her
stella we have been trapped come quick
stella sprang to her feet and instinctively moved to the door but
before she had taken a couple of steps the door opened and jasper
adelstone stood before them
chapter xxviii
jasper adelstone closed the door behind him and stood looking at them
his face was very pale his lips were tightly compressed and there was
that peculiar look of decision and resolution which stella had often
remarked
true it struck her as ominousa chill cold and awesome ran through
herbut she stood and confronted him with a face that though as
pale as his own showed no sign of fear her eyes met his own with a
haughty questioning gaze
mr adelstone she said in low clear indignant tones what does
this mean
before he could make any reply frank stepped between them and with
crimson face and flashing eyes confronted him
yes what does this mean mr adelstone he echoed why have you
brought us hereentrapped us
jasper adelstone just glanced at him then looked at stellapale
beautiful and indignant
i fear i have offended you he said in a low clear voice his eyes
fixed with concentrated watchful intentness on her face
offended echoed stella with mingled surprise and anger there is
no question of offense mr adelstone thisthis that you have done is
an insult
and her face flushed hotly
he shook his head gravely and his hands clasped themselves behind his
back where they pecked at each other in his effort to remain calm and
selfpossessed under her anger and scorn
it is not an insult it was not intended as an insult stella
my name is etheridge mr adelstone stella broke in calmly and
proudly be good enough to address me by my title of courtesy and
surname
i beg your pardon he said in slow tones miss etheridge i am
aware that the step i have takenand i beg you to mark that i do not
attempt to deny that it is through my order that you are here
we know all that interrupted frank fiercely we dont wish for any
verbiage from you we only want my cousin and i a direct answer to
our question why have you done this when you have answered it we
will leave you as quickly as possible if you dont choose to answer
we will leave you without in fact stellaand he turned with a
glance of contempt and angry scorn at the tall motionless figure with
the pale face and compressed lipsin fact stella i dont think we
much care to know we had better go i think and leave it to someone
else to demand an explanation and reparation
jasper did not look at him took no notice whatever of the boyish scorn
and indignation he had borne stellas the boys could not touch him
after hers
i am ready to afford you an explanation he said to stella with an
emphasis on the you
stella was silent her eyes turned away from him as if the very
thought of him were distasteful to her
go on we are waiting exclaimed frank with all a boys directness
i said that i would afford you miss etheridge said jasper i
think it would be better if you were to hear me alone
what shouted frank drawing stellas arm through his
alone repeated jasper it would be better for youfor all of us
he repeated with a significance in his voice that sank to stellas
heart
i wont hear of it exclaimed frank i am here to protect her i
would not leave her alone with you a moment you are quite capable of
murdering her
then for the first time jasper noticed the boys presence
are you afraid that i shall do you harm he said with a cold smile
he knew stella
the cold sneer stung her
i am not afraid of those i despise she said hotly go frank you
will come when i call you
i shall not move he responded earnestly this manthis jasper
adelstonehas already shown himself capable of an illegal a criminal
act for it is illegal and criminal to kidnap anyone and he has
kidnapped us i shall not leave you you know and he turned his eyes
reproachfully on stella i am responsible for you
stellas face flushed then went pale
i know she said in a low voice and she pressed his arm
butbuti think it is better that i should listen to him you
seeand her voice dropped still lower and grew tremulous so that
jasper adelstone could not hear ityou see that we are in his power
we are his prisoners almost and he will not let us go till i have
heard him it will be more prudent to yield think frank who is
waiting all this time
frank started and appeared suddenly convinced
very well he whispered call me the moment you want me and mind
if he is impertinenthe can be you knowcall at once
then he moved to the door but paused and looked at jasper with all the
scorn and contempt he could summon up into his boyish face
i am going mr adelstone but remember it is only because my cousin
wishes me to you will say what you have to say quickly please and
say it respectfully too
jasper held the door for him calmly and stolidly and frank passed out
into the outer office there he put on his hat and made for the door
struck by a sudden bright idea he would drive to bruton street and
fetch lord leycester but as he touched the door old scrivell rose from
his seat and shook his head
doors locked sir he said
frank turned purple
what do you mean he exclaimed let me out at once immediately
the old man shrugged his shoulders
orders sir orders he said in his dry voice and resumed his work
deaf to all the boys threats entreaties and bribes
jasper closed the door and crossing the room laid his hand on a chair
and signed respectfully to stella to sit down but without a word she
drew a little away and remained standing her eyes fixed on his face
her lips tightly pressed together
he inclined his head and stood before her one white hand resting on
the table the other thrust into his vest
miss etheridge he said slowly and with intense earnestness i beg
you to believe that the course which i have felt bound to adopt has
been productive of as much pain and grief to me as it can possibly have
been to you
stella just moved her hand with scornful impatience
your feelings are a matter of supreme indifference to me mr
adelstone she said icily
i regret that i regret it with pain that amounts to anguish he
said and his lips quivered the sentiments ofof devotion and
attachment which i entertain for you are no secret to you
i cannot hear this she said impatiently
and yet i must urge them he said for i have to urge them as an
excuse for the libertythe unpardonable liberty as you at present deem
itwhich i have taken
it is unpardonable she echoed with suppressed passion there is no
excuseabsolutely none
and yet he said still quietly and insistently if my devotion were
less ardent my attachment less sincere and immovable i should have
allowed you to go on your way to ruin and disaster
stella started and looked at him indignantly
he moved his hand slightly deprecatory of her wrath
i will not conceal from you that i knew of your destination of your
appointment
you acted the spy she articulated
i acted rather the guardian he said what kind of love how poor
and inactive that would be which could remain quiescent while the
future of its object was at stake
stella put up her hand to silence him
i do not carei will not listen to your fine phrases they do not
move me mr adelstone to your devotion andand attachment i am
indifferent i refuse to accept them i await your explanations if
you have none to give i will go and she made a movement as if to
depart
wait i implore i advise you
stella stopped
hear me to the end he said you will not permit me to allude to
the passionate love which is my excuse and my warranty for what i have
done so be it i will speak of it no more if i can so control myself
as to refrain from doing so i will speak of yourself andand of the
man who plots your ruin
stella opened her lips but refrained from speech and merely smiled a
smile of pitiless scorn
i speak of lord leycester wyndward said jasper adelstone the name
leaving his lips as if every word tortured them it is true is it
not that this lord leycester has asked you to meet him at a place in
londonat bruton street his lodgings it is true that he has told you
that he was prepared to make you his wife
and you will say that it is a lie and ask me to believe youyou
against him she broke in with a laugh that cut him like a whip
no he said i will admit that it may be truei think that it is
possible that it may be true and yet you see i have braved your
wrath and far worse your scorn and balked him
for a time she said almost beneath her breathfor a time a short
time i fear mr adelstone that he will demand reparation heavy
reparation at your hands for such balking
to save her life she could not have suppressed her threat
i do not fear lord leycester or any man he said where you are
concerned i fear onlyyourself
do you intend giving me the explanation sir she demanded
impetuously
i have stepped in between him and his prey he went on still
gravely because i thought i hoped that were time given you though
it were at the last moment that you would see the danger which lay
before you and draw back
thanks she said scornfullythat is your explanation having
afforded it be kind enough to open that door and let me depart
stay he said and for the first time his voice broke and showed
signs of the storm that was raging within him stay stellai
implore i beseech of you think consider for one moment to what doom
your feet are carrying you the man proposeshas the audacity to
proposea clandestine elopement a secret marriage he treats you as
if you were not worthy to be his wife as if you were the dirt under
his feet do you think dare you blinded as you are by a momentary
passion dare you hope that any good can spring from such an union
that any happiness can follow such a shameful marriage dare you hope
that this mans lovelovewhich will not brave the temporary anger
and contempt of his relations can be strong enough to last a lifetime
think stella he is ashamed of you already he the heir to wyndward
is ashamed to make you his bride before the world he must lower and
degrade you by a secret ceremony what is his love compared with
minewith mine and in the fierce emotion of the moment he put his
hand upon her arm and held her
with a fierce angry scorn which no one who knew stella etheridge
could have thought her capable of she flung his hand from her and
confronted him her beautiful face looking lovely in its scorn and
wrath
silence she exclaimed her breast heaving her eyes darting
lightning youyou coward you dare to speak thus to me a weak
defenseless girl whom you have entrapped into listening to you i
dare you to utter them to himhim the man you traduce and slander
you speak of love you know not what it is you speak of shame
she paused the word seemed to overcome her shame she repeated
struggling for breath and composure you do not know what that is
shall i tell you i have never felt it until now i feel it now
because i have been weak enough to remain and listen to you it is
shameful that your hand should have touched me it is shameful that i
should have listened to your protestations of lovelove you speak of
the shame which he would bring upon me well thenlisten for once
and allif such shame were to befall me from his hand i would go
to meet it yes and welcome it rather than take from yours all the
honor which you could extend to me you say that i am going to ruin and
unhappiness so be it i accept your wordsto silence you learn from
my own lips that i would rather bear such shame and misery with him
than happiness and honor with you have ihave i she panted spoken
plainly enough and she looked down at him with passionate scorn he
was white white as death his hands hung at his side clinched and
burning his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth and
render speech impossible
her scorn lashed him every word fell like the thong of a knout and
cut into his heart and all the while his eyes rested on hers with
anguished entreaty
spare me he cried hoarsely at last spare me i have tried to
spare you
youspare me she retorted with a short contemptuous laugh
yes he said wetting his lips i have tried to spare you i tried
argument entreaty all to no purpose nownow you compel me to use
force
she glanced at the door though she seemed to know instinctively that
he did not mean physical force
i would have saved you without this last step he said slowly
almost inaudibly i call upon you to remember this in the aftertime
that not until you had repulsed all my efforts to turn you from your
purposenot until you had lashed me with your scorn and contempt
did i take up this last weapon if in using itthough i use it as
mercifully as i canit turns and wounds you bear this in mind that
not until the last did i direct it against you
stella put her hand to her lips they were trembling with excitement
i will not hear another word she said i care as little for your
threatthis is a threat
it is a threat he said with deadly calmness
as i do for your entreaties you cannot harm me
no he said but i can harm those you love
she smiled and moved to the door
stay he said for their sakes remain and hear me to the end
she paused
you speak of shame he said and fear it as naught you do not
know what it means andandi forget the fearful words that stained
your lips but there are others those you love for whom shame means
deathworse than death
she looked at him with a smile of contemptuous disbelief she did not
believe one word of the vague threat not one word
believe me he said there hangs above the heads of those you love
a shame as deadly and awful as that sword which hung above the head of
damocles it hangs by a single thread which i and i alone can sever
say but the word and i can cast aside that shame turn from me to
himto himand i cut the thread and the sword falls
stella laughed scornfully
you have mistaken your vocation she said you were intended for the
stage mr adelstone i regret that i have no further time to waste
upon your efforts permit me to go
go then he said and the misery of those dear to you be upon your
hands for you will have dealt it not i go but mark me before you
have reached the man who has ensnared you that shame will have fallen
a shame so bitter that it will yawn like a gulf between you and him a
gulf which no time can ever bridge over
itit is a lie she breathed her eyes fixed upon his white face
but she paused and did not go
he inclined his head
no he said it is true an awful shameful truth you will wait and
listen
she looked at him for a moment in silence
i will wait five minutesjust five minutes she said and she
pointed to the clock and i warn youit is i who warn you nowthat
by no word will i attempt to screen you from the punishment which will
meet this lie
i am content he said and there was something in the cold tone of
assured triumph that struck to her heart
chapter xxix
five minutes said stella warningly and she turned her face from
him and kept her eyes fixed on the clock
it will suffice said jasper i have to ask you to bear with me
while i tell you a short history i will mention no namesyou yourself
will be able to supply them all i have to ask of you further is that
you will hear me to the end the history is of father and son
stella did not move she thought that he referred to the earl and
leycester she had determined to listen calmly until the five minutes
were expired and then to goto go without a word
the father was an eminent painterstella started slightly but kept
her eyes fixed on the clocka man who was highly gifted of a rare
and noble mind and possessed of undeniable genius even as a young man
his gifts were meeting with acknowledgment he married a woman above
him in station beautiful and fashionable but altogether unworthy
of him as might have been expected the marriage turned out ill the
wife having nothing in common with her highsouled husband plunged
into the world and was swallowed up in its vortex i do not wish to
speak of her further she brought him shame
stella paled to the lips
shame so deep that he cast aside his ambition and left the world
casting away his old life and separating himself entirely from
itseparating himself from the child which the woman who had
betrayed him had born to himhe settled in a remote country village
forgotten and effaced the son was brought up by guardians appointed
by the father who could never bring himself to see him this boy
went to school to college was launched so to speak on the world
without a fathers care the evil results which usually follow such a
starting followed here the boy left to himself or at best to the
hired guardianship of a tutor plunged into life he was a handsome
highspirited boy and found as is usual ready companionship
follyi will not say viceworked its usual charm the boy alone and
uncared for was led astray in an unthinking moment he committed a
crime
stella white and breathless turned upon him
it is false she breathed
he looked at her steadily
committed a crime it was done unthinkingly on the spur of the
moment but it was done irrevocably the punishment for the crime was
a heavy onehe was doomed to spend the best part of his life as a
convict
stella moaned and put up her hand to her eyes
it is not true
doomed to a felons expiation think of it a handsome highborn
highspirited perhaps gifted lad doomed to a felons a convicts
fate can you not picture him working in chains clad in yellow
branded with shame
stella leaned against the door and hid her face
it is falsefalse she moaned but she felt that it was true
from that doomoneone whom you have lashed with your scornstepped
forward to save him
you
i he saideven i
she turned to him slightly
you did this
he inclined his head
i did it he repeated but for me he would be at this moment
working out his sentence the just sentence of the outraged law
stella was silent regarding him with eyes distended with horror
and hehe knew it she murmured brokenly
no he said he did not know it he does not know it even now
stella breathed a sigh then shuddered as she remembered how the boy
frank had insulted and scorned this silent inflexible man who had
saved him from a felons fate
he did not know it she said forgive him
he smiled a strange smile
the lad is nothing to me he said i have nothing to forgive one
does not feel angered at the attack of a gnat one brushes the insect
off or lets it remain as the case may be this lad is nothing to
me so far as he is concerned i might have allowed him to take his
punishment i saved him not for his sake but for anothers
stella leaned against the door she was beginning to feel the meshes of
the net that was drawing closer and closer around her
for another he continued i saved him for your sake
she moistened her parched lips and raised her eyes
ii am very grateful she murmured
his face flushed slightly
i did not seek your gratitude i did not desire that you should even
know that i had done this thing neither he nor you would ever have
known it butbut for this that has happened it would have gone down
with me into my gravea secret it would have done so although you
had refused me your love although you should have given your heart to
another ifand he pausedif that other had been a man worthy of
you stellas face flushed and her eyes flashed but she remembered
all that he had done and averted her gaze from him if that other
had been one likely to have insured your happiness i would have gone
my way and remained silent but it is not so this man this lord
leycester is one who will effect your ruin one from whom i musti
willsave you it is he who rendered this disclosure necessary
he was silent and stella stood her eyes bent on the ground even yet
she did not realize the power he held over herover those she loved
i am very grateful she said at last i am fully sensible of all
that you have done for us and i am sorry thatthat i should have
spoken as i did thoughand she raised her eyes with a sudden frank
wistfulnessi was much provoked
what was i to do he asked she shook her head could i stand idle
and see you drift to destruction
i shall not go to destruction she said with a troubled look you
do not know lord leycesteryou do not knowbut we will not speak
of that she broke off suddenly i will go now please i am very
grateful andandi hope you will forgive all that has passed
he looked at her
i will forgive allall he emphasized if you will turn back if
you will go back to your home and promise that this thing which he has
asked you to do shall not come to pass
she turned upon him
you have no right then she stopped smitten with a sudden fear
by the expression of his face i cannot do that she said in a
constrained voice
he closed his hands tightly together
do not force me he said you will not force me to compel you
she looked at him tremblingly
force
yes force you speak of gratitude but i do not rely on that if you
were really grateful to me you would go back but you are not i cannot
trust to gratitude then he came closer to her and his voice dropped
stella i have sworn that this shall not bethat he shall not have
you i cannot break my oath do you not understand
she shook her head
no i know that you cannot prevent me
i can he said you do not understand i saved the boy but i can
destroy him
she shrank back
with a word he said almost fiercely his lips trembling one word
and he is destroyed you doubt see and he drew a paper from his
pocketbook the crime he committed was forgeryforgery here is the
proof
she shrank back still further and held up her hands as if to shut the
paper from her sight
do not deceive yourself he said in his intense voice his safety
lies in my handsi hold the sword it is for you to say whether i
shall let it fall
spare him she breathed pantingspare me
i will spare himi will save both him and you stella say but the
word say to me here now jasper i will marry you and he is safe
with a low cry she sank against the door and looked at him
i will not she panted like some wild animal driven to bay
i will not
his face darkened
you hate me so much
she was silent regarding him with the same fearful hunted look
you hate me he said between his teeth but even that shall not
prevent me from having my way you will learn to hate me lessin time
to love me
she shuddered and he saw the shudder and it seemed to lash him into
madness
i say you shall such love as mine cannot exist in vain cannot be
repelled it must it must win love in return i will chance it when
you are my wifedo not shrink mine you must and shall beyou will
grow to a knowledge of the strength of my devotion and admit that i
was justified
no never she panted
he drew back and let his hand fall on the back of the chair
is that answer final he said hoarsely
never she reiterated
remember he said in that word you pronounce the doom of this lad
by that word you let fall the sword you darken the few remaining years
of an old mans life with shame
white and breathless she sank on to the floor and so kneltabsolutely
kneltto him with outstretched hands and imploring eyes
he looked at her his heart beating his lips quivering and his hand
moved toward the bell
if i ring this it is to send for a constable if i ring this it is to
give this lad into custody on a charge of forgery it is impossible for
him to escape the evidence is complete and damning
his hand touched the bell had almost pressed it when stella uttered a
word
stay she said and so hoarse so unnatural was the sound of her
voice that it went to his heart like a stab
slowly with the movement of a person numbed and almost unconscious
she rose and came toward him
her face was white white to the lip her eyes fixed not on him but
beyond him she had every appearance of one moving in a dream
stay she said do not ring
his hand fell from the bell and he stood regarding her with eager
watchful eyes
youyou consent he asked hoarsely
without moving her eyes she seemed to look at him
tell me she said in slow mechanical tones tell me allall that
you wish me to do all that i must do to save them
her agony touched him but he remained inflexible immovable
it is soon told he said say to me jasper i will be your wife
and i am content in return i promise that on the day the hour in
which you become my wife i will give you this paper upon it the boys
fate depends once this is destroyed he is safeabsolutely
she held out her hand mechanically
let me look at it
he glanced at her scarcely suspiciously but hesitatingly for a
moment then placed the paper in her hands
she took it shuddering faintly
show me
he put his finger on the forged name stellas eyes dwelt upon it with
horror for a moment then she held out the paper to him
hehe wrote that
he wrote it he answered it is sufficient to send him
she put up her hand to stop him
andand to earn the paper i mustmarry you
he was silent but he made a gesture of assent
she turned her head away for a moment then she looked him full in the
eyes a strange awful look
i will do it she said every word falling like ice from her white
lips
a crimson flush stained his face
stella my stella he cried
she put up her hand she did not shrink back but simply put up her
hand and it was he who shrank
do not touch me she said calmly oror i will not answer for
myself
he wiped the cold beads from his brow
ii am content he said i have your promise i know you too well
to dream that you would break it i am content in timewell i will
say no more
then he went to the table and pressed the bell
she looked up at him with a dull numbed expression of inquiry which he
understood and answered
you will see i have thought of everything i foresaw that you would
yield and have planned everything
the door opened as he spoke and scrivell came in followed by
frank who hurled scrivell out of the way and sprang before jasper
inarticulate with rage
but before he could find breath for words his eyes fell upon stellas
face and a change came over him
what does this mean he stammered what do you mean mr adelstone
by this outrage do you know that i have been kept a prisoner
jasper interrupted him calmly quietly with an exasperating smile
you are a prisoner no longer my dear frank
how dare you exclaimed the enraged boy and he raised his cane
it would have fallen across jaspers face for he made no attempt to
ward it but stella sprang between them and it fell on her shoulder
frank she moaned rather than cried youyou must not
stella he exclaimed stand away from him i think i shall kill him
she laid her hand upon his arm and looked up into his face with ah
what an anguish of sorrowful pity and love
frank she breathed pressing her hand to her bosom listen to me
hemr adelstone waswas right he has done all forfor the best
youyou will beg his pardon
he stared at her as if he thought that she had taken leave of her
senses
what what do you say he cried below his breath are you mad
stella
she put her hand to her brow with a strange weird smile
i wishi almost think i am no frank not another word you must not
ask why i cannot tell you only this thatthat mr adelstone has
explained and thatthather voice falteredwe must go back
go back not go to leycester he demanded incredulous and
astonished do you know what you are saying
she smiled a smile more bitter than tears
yes i know bear with me frank
bear with you what does she mean do you mean to say that you have
allowed yourself to be persuaded by thisthis hound
frank frank
do not stop him came the quiet overstrained voice of the hound
this hound i said repeated the boy bitterly has he persuaded you
to break faith with leycester it is impossible you would not could
not be soso bad
stella looked at him and the tears sprang to her eyes
have pity andandsend him away she said without turning to
jasper
he went up to frank who drew back as he approached as if he were
something loathsome
you are making your cousin unhappy by this conduct he said it is
as she says she has changed her mind
it is a lie retorted frank fiercely you have frightened her and
tortured her into this but you shall not succeed it is easy for you
to frighten a woman as easily as it is to entrap her but you will
sing a different tune before a man stella come with me you must you
shall come we will go to lord leycester
it is unnecessary cried jasper quietly his lordship will be here
in a few minutes
stella started
no no she said and moved to the door frank staring at jasper
caught and held her
is that a lie too he demanded if notif it be truethen we
will wait we shall see how much longer you will be able to crow mr
adelstone
let us go frank implored stella you will let me go now and she
turned to jasper
frank was almost driven to madness by her tone
what has he said and done to change you like this he said you
speak to him as if you were his slave
she looked at him sadly
jasper shook his head
wait he saidit will be better that you wait trust me i will
spare you as much as possible but it will be better that he should
learn all that he has to learn from your lips here and now
she bowed her head and still holding franks arm sank into a chair
the boy was about to burst out again but she stopped him
hush she said do not speak every word cuts me to the heart not a
word dearnot another word let us wait
they had not long to wait
there was a sound of footsteps hurried and noisy on the stairsan
impatient resolute voice uttering a questionthen the door was thrown
open and lord leycester burst in
chapter xxx
leycester looked round for a moment eagerly then utterly disregarding
jasper he hurried across to stella who at his entrance had made an
involuntary movement towards him but had then recoiled and stood with
white face and tightlyclasped hands
stella he exclaimed why are you here why did you not come to
waterloo why did you send for me
she put her hand in his and looked him in the facea look so full of
anguish and sorrow that he stared at her in amazement
it was i who sent for you my lord said jasper coldly
leycester just glanced at him then returned to the study of stellas
face
why are you here stella
she did not speak but drew her hand away and glanced at jasper
that glance would have melted a heart of stone but his was one of fire
and consumed all pity
will you not speak great heaven what is the matter with you
demanded leycester
jasper made a step nearer
leycester turned upon him not fiercely but with contempt and
amazement then turned again to stella
has anything happened at hometo your uncle
mr etheridge is well said jasper
then leycester turned and looked at him
why does this man answer for you he said i did not put any
question to you sir
i am aware of that my lord said jasper his small eyes glittering
with hate and malice and smoldering fury the sight of the handsome
face the knowledge that stella loved this man and hated him jasper
maddened and tortured him even in his hour of triumph i am aware
of that lord leycester but as your questions evidently distress and
embarrass miss etheridge i take upon myself to answer for her
leycester smiled as if at some strange conceit
you do indeed take upon yourself he retorted with great scorn
perhaps you will kindly remain silent
jaspers face whitened and winced
you are in my apartment lord leycester
i regret to admit it i more deeply regret that this lady should be
here i await her explanation
and what if i say she will not gratify your curiosity said jasper
with a malignant smile
what will happen do you mean asked leycester curtly well i
shall probably throw you out of the window
stella uttered a low cry and laid her hand upon his arm she knew him
so well and had no difficulty in reading the sudden lightning in the
dark eyes and the resolute tightening of the lips she knew that
it was no idle threat and that a word more from jasper of the same
kind would rouse the fierce impetuous anger for which leycester was
notorious
in a moment his anger disappeared
i beg your pardon he murmured with a loving glance i was
forgetting myself i will remember that you are here
now sir and he turned to jasper you appear anxious to offer some
explanation be as brief and as quick as you can please he added
curtly
jasper winced at the tone of command
i wished to spare miss etheridge he said i have only one desire
and that is to insure her comfort and happiness
you are very good said leycester with contemptuous impatience
but if that is all you have to say we will rid you of our presence
which cannot be welcome i would rather hear an account of these
extraordinary proceedings from this ladys lips at first at any rate
afterwards i may trouble you and his eyes darkened ominously
then he went up to stella and his voice dropped to a low whisper
come stella you shall tell me what this all means and he offered
her his arm
but stella shrank back with a piteous look in her eyes
i cannot go with you she murmured as if each word cost her an
effort do not ask me
cannot he said still in the same low voice stella why not
ii cannot tell you do not ask me was her prayer go nowgo and
leave me
lord leycester looked from her to frank who shook his head and glared
at jasper
i dont understand it lord leycester it is no use looking to me i
have done as you asked meat least as far as i was able until i was
prevented we got out at vauxhall as you wished us to do
i said leycester not loudly but with an intense emphasis i i
did not ask you to do anything of the kind i have been waiting for you
at waterloo and thinking that i had missed you and that you had gone
on toto the place i asked you to go to i hurried there a manmr
adelstones servant i presumewas waiting and told me stella was
here waiting for me i came herethat is all
frank glared at jasper and raised an accusing finger which he pointed
threateningly
ask him for an explanation he said
leicester looked at the white defiant face
what jugglery is this sir he demanded am i to surmise thatthat
this lady was entrapped and brought here against her will
jasper inclined his head
you are at liberty to surmise what you will he said if you ask me
if it was through my instrumentality that this lady was led to break
the assignation you had arranged for her i answer that it was
soh
it was all leycester said but it spoke volumes
that i used some strategy to effect my purpose i dont for a moment
deny i used strategy because it was necessary to defeat your scheme
he paused leycester stood upright watching him
go on he said in a hard metallic voice
i brought her here that i her uncles and guardians friend might
point out to her the danger which lay in the path on which you would
entice her i have made it clear to her that it is impossible she
should do as you wish
he paused again and leycester removed his eyes from the pale face and
looked at stella
is what this man says true he asked in a low voice has he
persuaded you to break faith with me
stella looked at him and her hands closed over each other
dont ask her broke in frank she is not in a fit state to answer
this fellow this jasper adelstone has bewitched her i think he has
frightened her out of her senses by some threat
frank hush oh hush broke from stella
lord leycester started and eyed her scrutinizingly but he saw only
anguish and pity and sorrownot guiltin her face
it is true declared frank this is what she has said and this only
since i came back into the room and i cant get any more out of her i
think lord leycester you had better throw him out of the window
leycester looked from one to the other there was evidently more in the
case than could be met by following franks advice
he put his hand to his head for a moment
i dont understand he said almost to himself
it is not difficult to understand said jasper with an illconcealed
sneer the lady absolutely refuses to keep the appointment you
madeyou forced upon her she declines to accompany you she
silence said leycester in a low voice that was more terrible than
shouting then he turned to stella
is it so he asked
she raised her eyes and her lips moved
yes she said
he looked as if he could not believe the evidence of his senses the
perspiration broke out on his forehead and his lips trembled but he
made an effort to control himself and succeeded
is what this man says true stella
ii cannot go with you she trembled with downcast eyes
leycester looked round the room as if he suspected he must be dreaming
what does it mean he murmured stella and now he addressed her as
if he were oblivious of the presence of others stella i implore i
command you to tell me consider what my position is iwho have been
expecting you asas you know wellfind you here and here you with
your own lips tell me that all is altered between us so suddenly so
unreasonably
it must be so she breathed if you would only go and leave me
he put his hand on the back of a chair to steady himself and the chair
shook
jasper stood gloating over his emotion
great heaven he exclaimed can i believe my ears is this
you stellaspeaking to me in these words and in this fashion
whywhywhy
and the questions burst forth from him passionately
she clasped her hands and looked up at him
do not ask mei cannot tell spare me
leycester turned to frank
will youwill you leave us my dear frank he said hoarsely
frank went out slowly then leycester turned to jasper
hear me he said you have given me to understand that the key of
this enigma is in your possession you will be good enough to furnish
me with it there must be no more mystery understand once for all and
at once that i will have no trifling
leycester
he put up his hand to her gently reassuringly
do not fear this gentleman has no need to tremble this matter
lies between us threeat present rather it lies between you two
i want to be placed on an equality that is all and he smiled a
fiercelybitter smile now sir
jasper bit his lips
i have few words to add to what i have already said i will say them
and i leave it to miss etheridge to corroborate them you wish to know
the reason why she did not meet you as you expected and why she is
here instead and under my protection
leycester moved his hand impatiently
the question is easily answered it is because she is my affianced
wife said jasper quietly
leycester looked at him steadily but did not show by a sign that he
had been smitten as his adversary had hoped to smite him instead he
seemed to recover coolness
i have been told he said quietly and incisively that you are
a clever man mr adelstone i did not doubt it until this moment
i feel that you must be a fool to hope that i should accept that
statement
jaspers face grew red under the bitter scorn he raised his hand and
pointed tremblingly to stella
ask her he said hoarsely
leycester turned to her with a start
for forms sake he said almost apologetically i will ask you
stella is this true
she raised her eyes
it is true she breathed
leycester turned white for the first time and seemed unable to
withdraw his eyes from hers for a moment then he walked up to her and
took her hands
look at me he said in a low constrained voice do you know that i
am hereiamherethat i came here to protect you that whatever
this man has said to force this mad avowal from your lips i will make
him answer for stella stella if you do not wish to drive me mad
look at me and tell me that this is a lie
she looked at him sadly sorrowfully
it is truetrue she said
of your own free willyou hesitate ah
she flung her hands before her eyes for a moment to gain strength to
deal him the blow then with white constrained face she said
of my own free will
he dropped her hands but stood looking at her
jaspers voice aroused him from the stupor which fell upon him
come my lord he said in a dry cold voice you have received
your answer let me suggest that you have inflicted more than enough
pain upon this lady and let me remind you that as i am her affianced
husband i have the right to request you to leave her in peace
leycester turned to him slowly but without speaking to him went up to
stella
stella he said and his voice was harsh and hoarse for the last
time i ask youfor the last timeis this true have you betrayed me
for this man have you promised to behis wife
the answer came in a low clear voice
it is true i shall be his wife
he staggered slightly but recovered himself and stood upright his
hands clasped the veins on his forehead swelling
it is enough he said you tell me that it is of your own free will
i do not believe that i know that this man has some hold upon you
what it is i cannot guess i feel that you will not tell me and that
he would only lie if i asked him but it is enough for me stellai
call you so for the last timeyou have deceived me you have kept this
thing hidden from me may heaven forgive you i cannot
then he took his hat and turned to leave the room
as he did so she swayed toward him and almost fell at his feet but
jasper glided toward her and held her and as leycester turned he saw
her leaning on jasper her arm linked in his
without a word leycester opened the door and went out
frank sprang toward him but leycester put him back with a firm grasp
oh lord leycester he cried
leycester paused for a moment his hand on the boys arm
go to her he said she has lied to me there is something between
her and that man i have seen her for the last time and before the
boy could find a word of expostulation or entreaty leycester pushed
him aside and went out
chapter xxxi
leycester went down the stairs with the uncertain gait of a drunken
man and having reached the open air stood for a moment staring round
him as if he were bereft of his senses as indeed he almost was
the shock had come so suddenly that it had deprived him of the power
of reasoning of following the thing out to its logical conclusion
as he walked on threading his way along the crowded thoroughfare
and exciting no little attention and remark by his wild distraught
appearance he realized that he had lost stella
he realized that he had lost the beautiful girl who had stolen into
his heart and absorbed his love and the manner of his losing her made
the loss so bitter that a man that such a creature as this jasper
adelstone should come between them was terrible if it had been any
other who was in some fashion his own equalcharlie guildford for
instance a gentleman and a noblemanit would have been bad enough
but he could have understood it he would have felt that he had been
fairly beaten but jasper adelstone
then it was so evident that love was not altogether the reason of her
treachery and desertion there was something else some secret which
gave that man a hold over her he stopped short in the most crowded
part of the strand and put his hand to his brow and groaned
to think that his stella his beautiful childlove whom he had deemed
an angel for innocence should share a secret with such a man and
what was it was there shame connected with it he shuddered as the
suspicion crossed his mind and smote upon his heart what had she done
to place her so utterly in jasper adelstones hands what was it the
question harassed and worried him to the exclusion of all other sides
of the case
was it something that had occurred before he leycester had met her
she had known this jasper adelstone before she knew leycester but he
remembered her speaking of him as a conceited selfopinioned young
man he remembered the light scorn with which she had described him
no it could not have happened thus early when then and where was
it he could find no solution to the question but the terrible result
remained that she had delivered herself body and soul into the
hands of jasper adelstone and was lost to him leycester
striking along careless of where he was going he found himself
at last in pall mall he entered one of his clubs and went to the
smokingroom there he lit a cigar and took out the marriage license
and looked at it long and absently if all had gone right stella would
have been his if not by this time a very little later and they would
have gone to italy they two together and alonewith happiness
but now it was all changedthe cup had been dashed from his lips at
the last moment and byjasper adelstone
he sat with the unsmoked cigar in his fingers his head drooped
upon his breast the nightmare of the secret mystery pressing on his
shoulders it was not only the loss of stella it was the feeling that
she had deceived him that was so bitter to bear it was the existence
of the secret understanding between the two that so utterly overwhelmed
him he could have married stella though she had been a beggar in the
streets but he could have no part or lot in the woman who shared a
secret with such a one as jasper adelstone
the smokingroom footman hovered about glancing covertly and curiously
at the motionless figure in the deep armchair acquaintances sauntered
in and gave him goodbye but leycester sat brooding over his sorrow
and disappointment and made no response
a more miserable young man it would have been impossible to find in all
london than this viscount and heir to an earldom with all his immense
wealth and proud hereditary titles
the afternoon came hot and sultry and to him suffocating the
footman beginning to be seriously alarmed by the quiescence of the
silent figure was just considering whether it was not his duty to
bring him some refreshment or rouse him by offering him the paper
when leycester rose much to the mans relief and walked out
within the last few minutes he had decided upon some course of action
he could not stay in london he could not remain in england he would
go abroadgo right out of the way and try and forget he smiled to
himself at the word as if he should ever forget the beautiful face
that had lain upon his breast the exquisite eyes that had poured the
lovelight into his the sweet girlvoice that had murmured its maiden
confession in his ear
he called a cab and told the man to drive to waterloo caught a train
threw himself into a corner of the carriage and gave himself up to the
bitterness of despair
dinner was just over when his tall figure passed along the terrace and
the ladies were standing under the drawingroom veranda enjoying the
sunset a little apart from the rest stood lenore she was leaning
against one of the iron columns her dress of white cashmere and satin
trimmed with pearls standing out daintily and fairylike against the
mass of ferns and flowers behind her
she was leaning in the most graceful air of abandon her sunshade
lying at her feet her hands folded with an indolent air of rest on
her lap there was a serene smile upon her lips a delicate languor in
her violet eyes an altogether atpeacewithalltheworld expression
which was in direct contrast with the faint expression of anxiety which
rested on the handsome face of the countess
every now and then as the proud and haughty woman but anxious mother
chatted and laughed with the women around her her gaze wandered to the
open country with an absent almost fearful expression and once as
the sound of a carriage was heard on the drive she was actually guilty
of a start
but the carriage was only that of one of the guests and the countess
sighed and turned to her duties again lenore with head thrown back
watched her with a lazy smile she was suffering likewise but she had
something tangible to fear something definite to hope the mother knew
nothing but feared all things
presently lady wyndward happened to come within the scope of lenores
voice
you look tired tonight dear she said
the countess smiled wearily
i will admit a little headache she said then she looked at the
lovely indolent face you look well enough lenore
lady lenore smiled curiously
do you think so she answered suppose i also confessed a headache
i should outdo you even then said the countess with a sigh for i
have a heartache
lenore put out her hand white and glittering with pearls and diamonds
and laid it on the elder womans arm with a little caressing gesture
peculiar to her
tell me dear she whispered
the countess shook her head
i cannot she said with a sigh i scarcely know myself i am quite
in the dark but i know that something has happened or is happening
you know that leycester went suddenly yesterday
lady lenore moved her head in assent
the countess sighed
i am always fearful of him
lenore laughed softly
so am i but i am not fearful on this occasion wait until he comes
back
the countess shook her head
when will that be i am afraid not for some time
i think he will come back tonight said lenore with a smile that
was too placid to be confident or boastful
the countess smiled and looked at her
you are a strange girl lenore she said what makes you think that
lenore turned the bracelet on her arm
something seems to whisper to me that he will come she said look
and she just moved her hand toward the terrace leycester was coming
slowly up the broad stone steps
lady wyndward made a move forward but lenores hand closed over her
arm and she stopped and looked at her
lenore shook her head smiling softly
better not she murmured scarcely above her breath not yet leave
him alone something has happened as you surmised i have such keen
eyes you know and can see his face
so could lady wyndward by this time and her own turned white at sight
of the pale haggard face
do not go to him whispered lenore do not stop him leave him
alone it is good advice
lady wyndward felt instinctively that it was and so that she might not
be tempted to disregard it she turned away and went into the house
leycester came along the terrace and raising his eyes heavy and
clouded saw the ladies but he only raised his hat and passed on
then he came to where the figure in white glimmering with pearls and
diamonds leaned against the column and he hesitated a moment but
there was no look of invitation in her eyes only a faint smile and he
merely raised his hat again and passed on but half unconsciously he
had taken in the loveliness and grace of the picture that she made and
that was all that she desired for the present
with heavy steps he crossed the hall climbed the stairs and entered
his own room
his man oliver who had been waiting for him and hanging about came in
softly but stole out again at sight of the dusky figure lying wearily
on the chair but presently leycester called him and he went back
get a bath ready oliver he said and pack a portmanteau we shall
leave tonight
very good my lord was the quiet response and then he went to
prepare the bath
leycester got up and strode to and fro though she had never entered
his rooms the apartments seemed full of her from the easel stared the
disfigured venus which he had daubed out on the first night he had seen
her on the table in an etruscan vase of crystal were some of the
wild flowers which her hand had plucked her lips had pressed these he
tooknot fiercely but solemnlyand threw out of the window
suddenly there floated upon the air the strains of solemn music he
started he had almost forgotten lilian the great sorrow and misery
had almost driven her from his memory he sat the vase down upon the
table and went to her room she knew his knock and bade him come in
still playing
but as he entered she stopped suddenly and the smile which had flown
to her face to welcome him disappeared
ley she breathed looking up at his pale haggard face and
darkrimmed eyes what has happened what is the matter
he stood beside her and bent and kissed her his lips were dry and
burning
ley ley she murmured and put her white arm round his neck to draw
him down to her what is it
then she scanned him with loving anxiety
how tired you look ley where have you been sit down
he sank into a low seat at her feet and motioned to the piano
go on playing he said
she started at his hoarse dry voice but turned to the piano and
played softly and presently she knew rather than saw that he had
hidden his face in his hands
then she stopped and bent over him
now tell me ley she murmured
he looked up with a bitter smile that cut her to the heart
it is soon told lil he said in a low voice and it is only an
old old story
ley
i can tell youi could tell only you lilin a very few words i
have lovedand been deceived
she did not speak but she put her hand on his head where it lay like a
peaceful benediction
i have staked my all all my happiness and peace upon a cast and have
lost i am very badly hit and naturally i feel it very badly for a
time
ley she murmured reproachfully you must not talk to me like
this speak from your heart
i havent any left lil he said there is only an aching void where
my heart used to be i lost it weeks agoor was it months or years i
cant tell which nowand she to whom i gave it she whom i thought
an angel of purity a dove of innocence has thrown it in the dirt and
trampled upon it
ley ley you torture me of whom are you speaking
of whom should i be speaking but the one woman the world holds for me
lenore she murmured incredulously
lenore and he laughed bitterly no she did not pronounce her name
so i am speaking and thinking of stella etheridge
her hand trembled but she did not withdraw it
stella
yes he said and his lips twitched a star a star that will shine
in another mans bosom not in mine as i fool that i was dreamed
that it would lil i believe that there is only one good woman in the
world and she sits near me now
oh ley leybut tell me
there is so little to tell he said wearily i cannot tell you all
this will suffice that tonight i expected and hoped to have been able
to call her my wife insteadwell you see i am sitting here
your wife she murmured stella etheridge your wife was thatthat
wise ley
wise what have i to do with wisdom he retorted i loved herloved
her passionately madly as i never nor shall ever love another
woman heaven help me i love her now dont you see that is the worst
part of it i know as surely as i am sitting here that my life has
gone it has gone to pieces on the rocks like a goodly ship and there
is an end of it
there was silence for a moment then she spoke and womanlike her
thoughts were of the woman
but she ley how is it with her
he laughed again and the gentle girl shuddered
dont ley she murmured
she will be all right he said women are made like thatall
excepting one and he touched her dress
and yetand yet she murmured troubled and sorrowful now i look
back i am sure that she loved you ley i remember her face the look
of her eyes the way she spoke your name oh ley she loved you
she didperhaps she loves me now so well that on our
weddingdayweddingdayshe allows a man to step in between us and
claim her as his own
maddened by the memory which her words had called up he would have
risen but she held him down with a gentle hand
a man what man ley
one called jasper adelstone a lawyer a man it would be gross
flattery to call even a gentleman think of it lil picture it i wait
to receive my bride and instead of it happening so i am sent for to
meet her at this mans chambers there i am informed that all is over
between us and that she is the affianced wife of mr jasper adelstone
but the reasonthe reason
there is none he exclaimed rising and pacing the room i am
vouchsafed no reason the bare facts are deemed sufficient for me i am
cast adrift as something no longer necessary or needful without word
of reason or even of rhyme and he laughed
she was silent for a moment then a murmur broke from her lips
poor girl
he stooped and looked down at her
do not waste your pity lil he said with a grim smile with her
own lips she declared that what she did she did of her own free will
with this man standing by her side
he started then he shook his head
i know what you mean he said hoarsely and do you not see that
that is the worst of it she is in his power there is some secret
understanding between them can i marry a woman who is in another mans
power so completely that she is forced to break her word to me to jilt
me for himcan i
his voice was so hoarse and harsh as to be almost inarticulate and he
stood with outstretched appealing hands as if demanding an answer
what could she say for a moment she was silent then she put out her
hand to him
and you have left her with him ley
the question sent all the blood from his face
yes he said wearily i have left her with her future husband
possibly probably by this time she has become his wife one man can
procure a marriage license as easily as another
you did that what would papa and my mother have said she murmured
he laughed
what did what should i care i tell you i loved her madly you do not
know cannot understand what such love means know then lil that i
would rather have died than lose herthat having lost her life has
become void and barren for methat the days and hours until i forget
her will be so much time of torture and regret and vain useless
longing i shall see her face hear her voice wherever i may be in
the day or in the night and no pleasure no pain will efface her from
my memory or my heart
oh leymy poor ley
thus it is with me and now i have come to say goodbye
goodbye you are goingwhere
where he echoed with the same discordant laugh i neither know nor
care i am afraid all places will be alike for awhile the whole earth
is full of her there is not a wild flower that will not remind me of
her not a sound of music that will not recall her voice if i meet
a woman i shall compare her with my stellamy stella no jasper
adelstones oh heaven i could bear all but that if she were dead i
should have at least one comfortthe consolation of knowing that she
had belonged to no other manthat in some other remote world we might
meet again and i might claim her as mine but that is denied to me my
white angel is stained and besmirched and is mine no longer
worn out by the passion of his grief he dropped on the seat at her
feet and hid his face in his hands
she put her arm round his neck but spoke no word words at such
moments are like gnats round a woundthey can only irritate they
cannot heal
they sat thus motionless for some minutes then he rose calmer but
very white and worn
this is weak of me worse than weak inconsiderate lil he said
with a wan smile you have so much of your own sorrows that you should
be spared the recital of other peoples woes i will go now goodbye
lil
oh what can i do for you she murmured my dear my dear
he stooped and kissed her and looked down at her pale face so full of
sorrow for his sorrow and his heart grew calmer and more resigned
nothing lil he said
yes she said in a low voice if i can do nothing else i can pray
for you ley
he smiled and stroked her hair
you are an angel lil he said softly if all women were made like
you there would be no sin and little sorrow in the world in the
future that lies black and drear before me i shall think of you yes
pray for me lil goodbye and he kissed her again
she held him to the last then when he had gone she buried her face in
her hands and cried but suddenly she sat up and touched the bell that
stood near her
crying will do no good for my ley she murmured i must do more
than that oh if i could be strong and hale like other girls for an
hour one short hour but i will i must do something i cannot see him
suffer so and do nothing
her one special maid a girl who had been with her since her childhood
and knew every mood and change in her came in and hurried to her side
at the sight of her teardimmed eyes
oh lady lilian what is the matter you have been crying
a little jeanette she said smiling through her tears i am in
great troublelord leycester is in great trouble
i have just met him my lady looking so ill and worried
yes jeanette he is in great trouble and i want to help him and
then with fear and trembling she announced an intention she had
suddenly formed jeanette was aghast for a time but at last she
yielded and hurried away to make the preparation for the execution of
her beloved mistresss wishes
chapter xxxii
as the door closed on lord leycester stellas heart seemed to leave
her bosom it was as if all hope had fled with him and as if her doom
was irrevocably fixed for a moment she did not realize that she was
leaning upon jasper adelstone for support but when her numbed senses
woke to a capacity for fresh pain and she felt his hand touching hers
she shrank away from him with a shudder and summoning all her presence
of mind turned to him calmly
you have worked your will she said in a low voice what remains
what other commands have you to lay upon me
he winced and the color struggled to his pale face
in the future he said in a low voice it will be your place to
command mine to obey those commands willingly cheerfully
stella waved her hand with weary impatience
i am in your hands she said what am i to do now where am i to go
no i know that i will go back then she stopped and a look of
pain and fear came upon her beautiful face as she thought of the alarm
with which her uncle would discover her flight and the explanation
which he would demand how can i go back what can i say
i have thought of that he said in a low voice i had foreseen the
difficulty and i have provided against it i know that what i have
done may only increase your anger but i did it for the best
what have you done asked stella
i have telegraphed to your uncle to say that i had tempted you and
frank to run up to town and that i would bring you back this evening
i knew he would not be anxious then seeing that frank was with you
stella stared at the firm selfreliant face he had provided for every
contingency had foreseen everything and had evidently felt so assured
of the success of his plans she could not refrain a slight shudder as
she realized what sort of a man this was who held her in his power she
felt that it were as useless to attempt to escape him as it would be
for a bird to flutter against the bars of its cage
have i done wrong he asked standing beside her his head bent his
whole attitude one of deference and humility
she shook her head
no i suppose not it does not matter if he can be spared pain
he shall be he responded i will do all in my power to render both
him and you and frank happy
she looked at him with a pitiful smile
happy
yes happy he repeated with low but intense emphasis remember
that though i have won you by force i love you that i would die for
you yes die for you if need were
she roseshe had sunk into a chairand put her hand to her brow
let me go now please she said wearily
he put on his hat but stopped her with a gesture
frank he said
she knew what he meant and inclined her head
jasper went to the door and called him by name and he entered jasper
laid his hand on his shoulder and kept it there firmly notwithstanding
the boys endeavor to shrink away from him
frank he said in his low quiet voice i want to say a few words
to you let me preface them with the statement that what i am going to
say your cousin stella fully endorses
frank looking at stellahe had not taken his eyes from her facesaid
is that so stella
she inclined her head
i want you said jasperwe want you we ask you my dear frank to
erase from your memory all that has occurred here this morning and
before that remember only that your cousin stella is my affianced
wife i am aware that the suddenness of the thing causes you surprise
as is only natural but get over that surprise and learn as soon as
possible to recognize it as an inevitable fact of all that has passed
betweenbetweenhe hesitated at the hated name and drew a little
breathlord leycester and stella nothing remainsnothing we will
forget all that will we not stella
she made the same gesture
and we ask you to do the same
but exclaimed frank white with suppressed excitement and
indignation
jasper glanced at stella almost with an air of command and stella
went over to frank and laying her hand on his arm bent and kissed him
it must be so dear she said in a low tremulous whisper do not ask
me why but believe it it is as he has said inevitable every word
from you in the shape of a question will add to my miswill only pain
me do not speak dear for my sake
he looked from one to the other then he took her hand with a curious
expression in his face
i will not ask he said i will be silent for your sake
she pressed his hand and let it drop
come said jasper with a smile that is the right way to take it my
dear frank now let me say a word for myself it is this that you do
not possess a truer friend and one more willing and anxious to serve
you than jasper adelstone is that not so and he looked at stella
yes she breathed
frank stood with his eyes cast down he raised them for a moment and
looked jasper full in the face then lowered them again
and now said jasper with a smile and in a lighter voice you must
take some refreshment and he went to the cupboard and brought out
some wine frank turned away but stella nerving and forcing herself
took the glass he extended to her and put the edge to her lips
jasper seemed satisfied though he saw that she had not touched a drop
let me see he said taking out his watch there is a train back in
half an hour shall we catch that
are you coming back with us said frank in a quiet voice
jasper nodded
if you will allow me my dear frank he said calmly i wont keep
you a moment
he rang the bell as he spoke and scrivell entered
there was no sign of any kind either in his face or his bearing that
he was conscious of anything out of the ordinary having happened he
came in with his young old face and colorless eyes and stood waiting
patiently jasper handed him some letters and gave him instructions in
a business tone then asked if the brougham was waiting
yes sir said scrivell
come then said jasper and scrivell held the door open and bowed
with the deepest respect as they passed out
it was so sudden a change from the storm of passion that had just
passed over them all that frank and stella felt bewildered and
benumbed which was exactly as jasper wished them to feel
his manner was deferential and humble but fully selfpossessed he put
stella in the brougham and insisted quietly upon frank sitting beside
her he himself taking the front seat
stella shrank back into the corner and lowered her veil frank sat
staring out of the window and avoiding even a glance at the face
opposite him jasper made no attempt to break the silence but sat his
eyes fixed on the passersby the calm inscrutable expression on his
face never faltering though a triumph ran through his veins
the train was waiting and he put them into a carriage lowered the
window and drew the curtain for stella and at the last moment bought a
bunch of flowers at the refreshmentbar and laid it beside her then
he got in and unfolded a newspaper and looked through it
scarcely a word was spoken during the whole journey it was an express
train but it seemed ages to stella before it drew up at wyndward
station
jasper helped her to alight she just touching his hand with her gloved
fingers and they walked across the meadow as they came in sight of
the hall shining whitely in the evening sunlight stella raised her
eyes and looked at it and a cold hand seemed to grasp her heart as if
he knew what was passing in her mind jasper took her sunshade and put
it up
the sun is still hot he said and he held it so as to shut the hall
from her sight
they came to the laneto the spot where stella had stood up on the
bank and looked down at the upturned eyes which she had learned to
love she breathed a silent prayer that she might never see them again
jasper opened the gate and a smile began to form on his lips
prepare for a scolding he said lightly you must put all the blame
on me
but there was no scolding the old man was seated in his armchair and
eyed them with mild surprise and anxiety
stella he said where have you been we have been very anxious how
pale and tired you look
jasper almost stepped before her to screen her
it is all my fault my dear sir he said lay the blame on me i
ought to have known better i admit but i met the young people on
their morning stroll and tempted them to take a run to town it was
done on the spur of the moment you must forgive us
mr etheridge looked from one to the other and patted stellas arm
you must ask mrs penfold he said with a smile she will be
difficult to appease im afraid we have been very anxious it
waswell unlike you stella
i hope i shall be able to appease mrs penfold said jasper i want
her good word i know she has some influence with you sir
he paused and the old man looked up struck by some significance in
his tone
jasper stood looking down at him with a little smile of pleading
interrogation
i have come as a suppliant for your forgiveness on more accounts than
one he continued i have dared to ask stella to be my wife sir
stella started but still looked out beyond him at the green hills and
the water glowing in the sunset mr etheridge put his hand on her head
and turned her face
stella
you wish to know what she has answered sir said jasper to spare
stella making any reply with a joy i cannot express i am able to say
that she has answered yes
is that so my dear murmured the old man
stellas head drooped
thisthissurprises me he said in a low voice but if it is
so if you love him my dear i will not say no heaven bless you
stella and his hand rested upon her head
there was silence for a moment then he started and held out his other
hand to jasper
you are a fortunate man jasper he said i hope i trust you will
make her happy
jaspers small eyes glistened
i will answer for it with my life he said
chapter xxxiii
oh my love my love
she stood with her arms outstretched toward the white walls of the
hall the moon shining over meadow and river the night jay creaking in
silence
in all her anguish and misery in all her passionate longing and
sorrow these were the only words that her lips could frame all was
still in the house behind her frank worn out with excitement had
gone to his own room the old man sat smoking dreaming and thinking
of his little girls betrothal jasper had gonehe was too wise to
prolong the strain which he knew she was enduringand she had crept
out into the little garden and stood leaning against the gate her
eyes fixed on the great house which at that moment perhaps held
himleycesterwho a few short hours ago was hers and in a low
voice the cry broke from her lips
oh my love my love
it was a benediction a farewell a prayer in one all her soul seemed
melting and flowing toward him in the wail all the intense longing
of her passionate nature to fly to his protecting arms and tell him
allto tell him that she still loved him as the flowers love the sun
the hart the waterbrookwas expressed in the words then as she
remembered he could not hear themthat it would avail nothing if he
could hear them her face dropped into her hands and she shut out the
hall from her hot burning eyes she had not yet shed one tear if she
could but have wept the awful tightening round her brain the burning
fire in her eyes would have been assuaged but she could not weep she
was held in thrall benumbed by the calamity that had befallen her
she who was to have been leycesters bride was now the betrothed
ofjasper adelstone
and yet as she stood there alone in her misery she knew that were it
to be done again she would do it to keep shame and disgrace from the
old man who loved her as a fatherthe boy who loved her as a brother
she would have laid down her life but this was more than life the
sacrifice demanded of her and which she had yielded was worse than
death
death she looked up at the blue vault of heaven with aching longing
eyes if she could but diedie there and then before jasper could lay
his hand upon her if she could but die so that he leycester might
come and see her lying cold and white but still hishis he would
know then that she loved him that without him she would not accept
even life he would look down at her with the odd light in his dark
eyes perhaps stoop and kiss herand now he would never kiss her again
how often have blind mortals clamored to the gods for this one boon
which they will not yield when sorrow comes the cry goes upgive us
death but the gods turn a deaf ear to the prayer live they say
the cup is not yet drained the task is not yet done
and she was young she thought with a sigh so young and so strong
she might live forfor years oh the long dreary vista of years
that stretched before her down which she would drag with tired feet
as jasper adelstones wife no thought of appealing to him to his
mercy ever occurred to her she had learned to know him during that
short hour in london so well as to know that any such appeal would be
useless the sphinx rearing its immovable head above the dreary desert
could not be more steadfast more unyielding than this man who held her
in his grasp
no she murmured i have taken up this burden i must carry it to
the end would to heaven that end were nigh
she turned with dragging step toward the house scarcely hearing
utterly heedless of the sound of approaching wheels even when they
stopped outside the gate she did not notice but suddenly a voice
cried in low and tremulous accents stella and she turned with her
hand pressed to her bosom she knew the voice and it went to her heart
like a knife it was not his but so like so like
she turned and started for there standing in the moonlight leaning
on the arm of her maid was lady lilian
the two stood for a moment regarding each other in silence then stella
came nearer
lady lilian held out her hand and stella came and took her by her arm
wait for me in the lane jeanette said lady lilian you will let me
lean on you stella she added softly
stella took her and led her to a seat and the two sat in silence
stella with her eyes on the ground lilian with hers fixed on the pale
lovely facemore lovely even than when she had last seen it flushed
with happiness and loves anticipation a pang shot through the tender
heart of the sick girl as she noted the dark rings under the beautiful
eyes the tightly drawn lips the wan weary face
stella she murmured and put her arm round her
stella turned her face it was almost hard in her effort at
selfcontrol
lady lilian
lilianonly lilian
you have come hereso late
yes i have come stella she murmured and the tears sprang to her
eyes drawn thither by the sound of the other voice so sad and so
hopeless i could not rest dear you would have come to me stella
if i hadif it had happened to me
stellas lips moved
perhaps
lilian took her handhot and feverish and restless
stella you must not be angry with me
a wan smile flickered on the pale face
angry look at me there is nothing that could happen tonight that
would rouse me to anger
oh my dear my dear you frighten me
stella looked at her with awful calm
do i then her voice dropped i am almost frightened at myself why
have you come she asked almost sharply
because i thought you needed mesome one some girl young like
yourself do not send me away stella you will hear what i have come
to say
yes i will hear said stella wearily though no words that can be
spoken will help me none
stella ii have heard
stella looked at her and her lips quivered
you have seen himhe has told you she breathed
lilian bent her head
yes dear i have seen him oh stella if you had seen him as i have
doneif you had heard him speak his voice
stella put up her hand
dontspare me she uttered hoarsely
but whywhy should it be murmured lilian clinging to her hand
why stella you cannot guess how he loves you there never was love
so deep so pure so true as his
a faint flush broke over the pale face
i know it she breathed then with a sharp almost fierce energy
have you come to tell me thatme who know him so well was it worth
while do you think i do not know what i have lost
you promised not to be angry with me stella
forgive meii scarcely know what i am saying you did not come for
that what then
to hear from your own lips stella the reason for this bear with me
dear remember that i am his sister that i love him with a love only
second to yours that all my life i have loved him and that my heart
is breaking at the sight of his unhappiness i have come to tell you
thisto plead for himto plead with you for yourself do not turn a
deaf ear a cold heart to me stella do not do not and she clung to
the hot hands and looked up at the white face with tearful imploring
eyes
you say you know him you may do so but not so well as i his sister
i know every turn of his natuream i not of the same flesh and blood
stella he is not like other menquick to change and forget he will
never bend and turn as other men stella you will break his heart
stella turned on her like some tortured animal driven to bay
do i not know it is it not this knowledge that is breaking my
heartthat has already broken it she retorted wildly do you think
i am sorrowing for myself alone do you think me so mean so selfish
listen lady lilian ifif this separation were to bring him happiness
i could have borne it with a smile if you could come to me and say
he will forget you and his love in a weeka montha year i would
welcome you as one who brings me consolation and hope who am i that
i should think of myself alonei the miserable insignificant girl
whom he condescended to bless with his love i amnothing nothing
save what his love made me if my life could have purchased his
happiness i would have given it lady lilian you do not know me
the tempest of her passion overawed the other weak and trembling girl
you love him so she murmured
stella looked at her with a smile
i love him she said slowly i will never say it again never i
say it to you that you may know and understand how deep and wide is the
gulf which stretches between usso wide that it can never never be
overpassed
no no you shall not say it
stella smiled bitterly
i think i know why you have come lilian you think this a mere
lovers quarrel that a word will set straight quarrel how little you
know either him or me there never could have been a quarrel between
usone cannot quarrel with oneself his word his wish were law to
me if he had said do this i should have done itif he had said
go thither i should have gone but once he laid his command on me
and i obeyed there is nothing i would not have donenothing if he
had bidden me i know it nowi know now that i was like a reed in his
hands now that i have lost him
lilian put her hand upon her lips
you shall not say it she murmured hoarsely nothing can part
younothing can stand against such love you are right i never knew
what it meant until tonight stella you cannot mean to send him
awayyou will not let anything save death come between you
stella looked at her with aching eyes that unlike lilians were dry
and tearless
death she said there are things worse than death
stella
words one cannot mention lest the winds should catch them up and
spread them far and wide not even death could have divided us more
effectually than we are divided
lilian shrank back appalled
what is it you say she breathed stella look at me you will you
must tell me what you mean
stella did look at her with a look that was awful in its calm despair
i was silent when he bade me speak do you think that i can open my
lips to you
lilian hid her face in her hand tremblingly
oh what is itwhat is it she murmured
there was silence for a moment then stella laid her hand on lilians
arm
listen she said solemnly i will tell you this much that you may
understand how hopeless is the task which you have undertaken ifif
i were to yield if i were to say to him come back i am yours take
me youyou who plead so that my heart aches at your wordswould
in the coming time when the storm broke and the cost of my yielding
had to be paidyou would be the first to say that i had done wrong
weakly selfishly you would be the first because you are a woman
and know that it is a womans duty to sacrifice herself for those she
loves have i made it plain
lilian raised her head and looked at her and her face went white
isis that true
it is so true that if i were to tell you what separates us you would
go without a word no you would utter that word in a prayer that i
might remain as firm and unyielding as i am
so utterly hopeless were the words the voice that they smote on the
gentle heart with the force of conviction she was silent for a moment
then with a sob she held out her arms
oh my dear my dear stella stella she sobbed
stella looked at her for a moment then she bent and kissed her
do not cry she murmured no tear in her own eye i can not cry i
feel as if i shall never shed another tear go now go and she put her
arm round her
lilian rose trembling and leant upon her looking up into her face
my poor stella she murmured hehe called you noble i know now
what he meant i think i understandi am not sure even now but i
think andand yes i will say it i feel that you are right but
oh my dear my dear
hush hush breathed stella painfully do not pity me
pity it is a poor a miserable word between us i love i honor you
stella and she put her arm round stellas neck kiss me dear once
stella bent and kissed her
onceand for the last time she said in a low voice henceforth we
must be strangers
not that stella that is impossible knowing what we do
yes it must be was the low calm response i could not bear it
there must be nothing to remind me ofhim and her lips quivered
lilians head drooped
oh my poor boy she moaned stella she said in a pleading
whisper give me one word to comfort himone word
stella turned her eyes upon her they had reached the gate the
carriage was in sight
there is no word that i can send she said almost inaudibly no
word but thisthat nothing he can do can save us that any effort will
but add to my misery and that i pray we may never meet again
i cannot tell him that not that stella
it is the best wish i can have said stella i do wish itfor
myself and for him i pray that we never meet again
lilian clung to her to the last even when she had entered the
carriage and to the last there was no tear in the dark sorrowful
eyes white and weary she stood looking out into the night worn out
and exhausted by the struggle and the storm of pentup emotion but
fixed and immovable as only a woman can be when she has resolved on
selfsacrifice
a few minutes later lilian stood on the threshold of leycesters room
she had knocked twice scarcely daring to use her voice but at last
she spoke his name and he opened the door
lilian he said and he took her in his arms
shut the door she breathed
then she sank on to his breast and looked up at him all her love and
devotion in her sorrowful eyes
oh my poor darling she murmured
he started and drew her to the light
what is it where have you been he asked and there was a faint
sound of hope in his voice a faint light in his haggard face as she
whispered
i have seen her
seen herstella
and his voice quivered on the name
yes oh ley ley
his face blanched
well he said hoarsely
ley my poor ley there is no hope
his grasp tightened on her arm
no hope he echoed wearily
she shook her head
ley i do not wonder at you loving her she is the type of all that is
beautiful and noble
youyou torture me he said brokenly
so good and true and noble she continued sobbing and because she
is all this and more you must learn to bear it ley
he smiled bitterly
you must bear it ley even as she bears it
tell me what it is he broke in hoarsely give me something
tangible to grapple with andwell then talk to me of bearing it
i cannotshe cannot she replied earnestly solemnly even to
me heart to heart she could not open her lips ley fate is against
youyou and her there is no hope no hope i feel it i who would not
have believed it did not believe it even from you there is no hope
ley
he let her sink into a chair and stood beside her a look on his face
that was not good to see
is there not he said in a low voice you have appealed to her
there is still one other to appeal to i shall seek him
she looked up not with alarm but with solemn conviction
do not she said unless you wish to add to her sorrow no ley if
you strike at him the blow must reach her
she told you that
yes by word by look no ley there is no hope there you cannot
reach him except through her and you will spare her that tell him
she said that any effort he makes will add to my misery tell him
that i pray we may never meet again she paused a moment ley i
know no more of the cause than you but i know this that she is right
he stood looking down at her his face working then at last he
answered
you are a brave girl lil he said you must go now even you cannot
help me to bear this pray that we may never meet again and this was
to have been our marriage day
chapter xxxiv
i have carefully avoided describing lord leycester wyndward as a
good man if to be generous singleminded impatient of wrong and
pitiful of the wronged if to be blessed cursed with the capacity for
loving madly and passionately if to be without fear either moral or
physical be heroic then he was a hero but i am afraid it cannot be
said that he was good
before many weeks had elapsed since his parting with stella the world
had decided that he was indeed very bad it is scarcely too much to say
that his name was the red rag which was flourished in the eyes of those
righteous indignant bulls whose mission in life it is to talk over
their fellowcreatures ill deeds and worry them
one mad exploit after another was connected with his name and it soon
came to pass that no desperate thing was done within the circle of the
higher class but he was credited with being the ringleader or at
least with having a hand in it
it was said that at that select and notorious club the rookery
lord leycester was the most desperate of gamblers and persistent of
losers rumor went so far as to declare that even the wyndward estates
could not stand the inroads which his losses at the gaming table were
making it was rumored and not contradicted that he had plunged on
the turf and that his stud was one of the largest and most expensive
in england
the society papers were full of insinuating paragraphs hinting at the
wildness of his career and prophesying its speedy and disastrous
termination he was compared with the lost characters of past
generationslikened to lord norbury the marquis of waterford and
similar dissipated individuals his handsome face and tall thin but
still stalwart figure had become famous and people nudged each other
and pointed him out when he passed along the fashionablyfrequented
thoroughfares
his rare appearance in the haunts of society occasioned the deepest
interest and curiosity
one enterprising photographer had managed by the exercise of vast
ingenuity to procure his likeness and displayed copies in his window
but they were speedily and promptly withdrawn
there was no reckless hardihood with which he was not credited men
were proud of possessing a horse that he had ridden because their
capability of riding it proved their courage
scandal seized upon his name and made a hearty and neverending meal
of it and yet by some strange phenomenal chance no one heard it
connected with that of a woman
some said that he drank hard rode hard and played hard and that he
was fast rushing headlong to ruin but no one ever hinted that he was
dragging a member of the fair sex with him
he was seen occasionally in drags bound to richmond or at bohemian
parties in st johns wood but no woman could boast that he was her
special conquest
it was even said that he had suddenly acquired a distinct distaste for
female society and that he had been heard to declare that but for the
women the world would still be worth living in
it was very sad society was shocked as well as curious dismayed as
well as intensely interested mothers with marriageable daughters
openly declared that something ought to be done that it was impossible
that such a man the heir to such a title and estates should be
allowed to throw himself away the deepest pity was expressed for lady
wyndward and one or two of the aforesaid mammas had ventured with
some tremors to mention his case to that august lady but they got
little for their pains save a calm dignified and haughty rebuff
never by word look or sign did the countess display the sorrow which
was imbittering her life
the stories of his illdoings could not fail to reach her ears seeing
that they were common talk but she never flushed or even winced she
knew when she entered a crowded room and a sudden silence fell to be
followed by a spasmodic attempt at conversation that those assembled
were speaking of her son but by no look or word did she confess to
that knowledge
only in the secrecy of her own chamber did she let loose the floodgates
of her sorrow and admit her despair the time had come when she felt
almost tempted to regret that he had not married the little girlthe
painters niece and settled down in his own way
she knew that it was broken off she knew or divined that some plot
had brought about the separation but she had asked no questions not
even of lenore who was now her constant companion and chosen friend
between them leycesters name was rarely mentioned not even from her
husband would she hear aught of accusation against the boy who had ever
been the one darling of her life
once old lady longford had pronounced his name had spoken a couple
of words or so but even she could not get the mother to unburden her
heart
what is to be done the old lady had asked one morning when the
papers had appeared with an account of a mad exploit in which the
wellknown initials lord y w had clearly indicated his
complicity
i do not know she had replied i do not think there is anything to
be done
do you mean that he is to be allowed to go on like this to drift
to ruin without a hand to stay him demanded the old lady almost
wrathfully and the countess had turned on her angrily
who can do anything to stay him have you yourself not said that it is
impossible that he must be left alone
i did yes i did admitted the old countess but things were not so
bad then not nearly all this is different there is a woman in the
case ethel
yes said the countess bitterly there is and she felt tempted to
echo the assertion which leycester had been reputed to utter that if
there had been no women the world would have been worth living in
then lady longford had attempted to get at leycester through his
companion lord charles but lord charles had plainly intimated his
helplessness
going wrong he said shaking his head if leycesters going wrong
so am i because dont you see im bound to go with him always did
you know and cant leave him now too late in the day
and so youll let your bosom friend go to the dogsthe old lady had
almost used a stronger wordrather than say a word to stop him
say a word retorted lord charles ruefully ive said twenty only
yesterday i told him the pace couldnt last but he only laughed and
told me that was his business and that it would last long enough for
him
lord charles you are a fool exclaimed the old lady
and lord charles had shook his head
i daresay i am he said not a whit offended i always was where
leycester was concerned
the one creature in the worldexcepting stellawho could have
influenced him knew nothing of what was going on
the excitement of her visit to stella and her terrible interview
during it had utterly prostrated the delicate girl and lilian lay
in her room in the mansion in grosvenor square looking more like the
flower namesake than ever
the doctor had insisted that no excitement of any kind was to be
permitted to approach her and they had kept the rumors and stories of
leycesters doings from her knowledge
he came to see her sometimes and even in the darkened room she could
see the ravages which the last few months had made with him but he was
always gentle and considerate toward her and in response to her loving
inquiries always declared that he was wellquite well stellas name
by mutual consent was never mentioned between them it was understood
that that page of his life was closed for ever but after every visit
when he had left her she lay and wept over the knowledge that he had
not forgotten her she could see it in his eyes hear it in his voice
as stella had said leycester was not one to love and unlove in a
dayin a weekin a month
so the summer had crept on to the autumn not one word has he heard of
stella though she was in his thoughts day and night alike in the hour
of the wildest dissipation and in the silent watches of the night
he had heard no word of her all his efforts were directed towards
forgetting her and yet if he picked up a paper or a book and chanced
to come upon her namestellaa pang shot through his heart and the
blood fled from his face
the autumn had come and london was almost deserted but there were
some who clung on still there are some to whom the shady side of pall
mall and their clubs are the only paradise and the cardrooms of the
rookery are by no means empty
in the middle of september when half the town was in the country
popping at the birds leycester and lord charles were still haunting
pall mall
better go down and look at the birds said lord charles one night
morning rather for it was in the small hours what do you say to
running down to my place ley
my place was vernon grange a noble elizabethan mansion standing
right in the center of one of the finest shooting districts the grange
was at present shut up the birds running wild the keepers in despair
all because lord leycester could not forget stella and his friend
would not desert him
suppose we start tomorrow morning went on lord charles struggling
into his light overcoat and yawning we can take some fellows
downplenty of birds you know had a letter from the head keeper
yesterday fellow quite brokenhearted give you my word come on
ley im sick of this i am indeed i hate the place and he glanced
sleepily at the dimly lit hall of the rookery whats the use of
playing ecarte and baccarat night after night it doesnt amuse you
even if you win
leycester was striding on scarcely appearing to hear but the word
amuse roused him
nothing amuses charles he said quietly nothing everything is
a bore the only thing is to forget and the cards help me to do that
for a little while at leasta little while
lord charles nearly groaned
theyll make you forget youve anything to lose shortly he said
weve been going it like the very deuce lately ley
leycester stopped and looked at him wearily absently
i suppose we have charles he said why dont you cut it i dont
mind it it is a matter of indifference to me but you you can cut it
you shall go down tomorrow morning and ill stay
thanks said the constant friend im in the same boat ley and
ill pull while you do when you are tired of this foolery well come
to shore and be sensible human beings again i shant leave the boat
till you do
youll wait till it goes down
yes i suppose i shall was the quiet response if down it must go
leycester walked on in silence for a minute
what a mockery it all is he said with a half smile
yes assented lord charles slowly some people would call it by a
stronger name i suppose i dont see the use of it the usewhy its
the very ruination ley you are killing yourself
and you
no said lord charles coolly im all rightive got nothing on my
mind im bored and usedup while it lasts but when its over i can
turn in and get to sleep you cantor you dont
leycester thrust his hands in his pockets in silence he could not deny
it
i dont believe you sleep one night out of three said lord charles
youve got the mad fever ley i wish it could be altered
leycester walked on still more quickly
you shall go down tomorrow charles he said i dont think ill
come
why not
leycester stopped and put his hand on his arm and looked at him with a
feverish smile on his face
simply because i cannoti cannot i hate the sight of a green field
i hate the country heaven go down there charlie you know dogs cant
bear the sight of water when they are queer youve got a river down
there havent you well the sight of that river the sound of that
stream would drive me mad i cannot go but you shall
lord charles shook his head
very well where now let us go home
leycester stopped short
goodnight he said go home dont be foolish charliego home
and you
leycester put his hand on his arm slowly and looked round
not home he saidnot yet im wakeful tonight
and he smiled grimly
the thought of the meadow and the river has set me thinking ill go
back to the rookery
lord charles turned without a word and they went back
the tables were still occupied and the entrance of the two men was
noticed and greeted with a word here and there lord charles dropped on
to a chair and called for some coffeea great deal of coffee was drank
at the rookerybut leycester wandered about from table to table
presently he paused beside some men who were playing baccarat
they had been playing since midnight and piles of notes and gold and
i o us told pretty plainly of the size of the stakes
leycester stood leaning on the back of a chair absently watching the
play but his thoughts were wandering back to the meadows of wyndward
and he stood once more beside the weir stream with the lovely face
upon his breast
but suddenly a movement of one of the players opposite him attracted
his attention and he came back to the present with a start
a young fellowa mere boythe heir to a marquisate lord bellamythe
reader will not have forgotten himhad dropped suddenly across the
table his outstretched hands still clutching the cards there was an
instant stir the men started to their feet the servants crowded up
all stood aghast
leycester was the first to recover presence of mind and hurrying
round the table picked the boy up in his strong arms
whats the matter bell he said then as he glanced at the white
face with the dark lines round the eyes he said in his quiet
composed voice he has fainted fetch a doctor some of you
and lifting him easily in his arms he carried him in to an adjoining
room
lord charles followed with a glass of water but leycester put it aside
with the one word
brandy
lord charles brought some brandy and closed the door the others
standing outside aghast and frightened leycester poured some of the
spirit through his closed teeth and the boy came back to lifeto what
was left for him of lifeand smiled up at him
the room was hot bell said leycester in his gentle way he could
be gentle even now i wanted you to go home twothreehours ago why
didnt you go
youstayed gasped the boy
leicesters lips twitched
i he said that is a different matter
the boys head drooped and fell back on leycesters arm
tell them not to stop the game he said let somebody play for me
then he went off again
the doctor came a fashionable hardworked man a friend both of
leycesters and guildfords and bent over the lad as he lay
its a faint said lord charles nervously nothing else eh
doctor
the doctor looked up
my brougham is outside he said i will take him home
leycester nodded and carried the slight frame through the hall and
placed it in the brougham the doctor followed the cool air revived
the boy and he made an effort to sit up looking round as if in search
of something at last his wandering sight fell on leycesters and he
smiled
thats right bell said leycester you will be well tomorrow but
mind no more of this and he took the small white hand
the heir to a marquisate clung to the hand and smiled again
no there will be no more of it leycester he breathed painfully
there will be no more of anything for me i have seen the last of the
rookeryand of you all leycester i am dying
leycester forced a smile to his white face
nonsense bell he said
the boy raised a weak trembling finger and pointed to the doctors
face
look at him he said he never told a lie in hislife ask him
tell them to drive on my lord said the doctor
the boy laughed an awful laugh then his face changed and even as the
brougham moved on he clung to leycesters hand and bending forward
panted
leycestergoodbye
leycester stood white and motionless as a statue for the space of a
minute then he turned to lord charles who stood biting his pale lips
and looking after the brougham
i will go with you tomorrow he said hoarsely
chapter xxxv
timewhich lord leycester had been so recklessly wasting in riotous
livingpassed very quiet indeed in the thames valley beneath the
white walls of wyndward hall
during the months which elapsed since that fearful parting between the
two lovers life had gone on at the cottage just as before with the
one great exception that jasper adelstone had become almost a daily
visitor and that stella was engaged to him
that was all the difference but what a difference it was
lord leycester goneher tried her first lover the man who had won
her maiden heartand in his place this man whom shehated
but yet she fought the battle womanfully she had made a bargainshe
had sacrificed herself for her two loved ones had given herself freely
and unreservedly and she strove to carry out her part of the compact
she looked a little pale a little graver than of old but there was no
querulous tone of complaint about her if she did not laugh the frank
lighthearted laugh that her uncle used to declare was like the voice
of sunlight she smiled sometimes and if the smile was rather sad
than mirthful it was very sweet
the old man noticed nothing amiss he thought she had grown quieter
but set the change down to her betrothal he went on painting absorbed
in his work scarcely heeding the world that ran by him so merrily so
sadly and was quite content jaspers quiet lowtoned voice did not
disturb him and he would go on painting while they were talking near
him dead to their presence since that last blow his boys crime had
struck him he had lived more entirely and completely in his art than
ever
of the two frank and stella perhaps it was frank who seemed the
most changed he had grown thinner and paler and more girlish and
delicatelooking than ever
it had been arranged that he should go up to the university for the
next term but mr hamilton the old doctor who had been called in to
see to a slight cough which the boy had started had hummed and hawed
and advised that the varsity should be shelved for the present
was he ill stella had asked anxiouslyvery anxiously for
womanlike she had grown to love with a passionate devotion the boy
for whom she had sacrificed herself
no not ill the old doctor had said certainly not ill and he
went on to explain that frank was delicatethat all boys with fair
hair and fair complexions were more or less delicate
but he has such a beautiful color said stella nervously
yes a nice color said the old man and that was all she could get
out of him
but the cough did not go and as the autumn mists stole up from the
river and covered the meadows with a filmy veil beautiful to behold
the cough got worse but the beautiful color did not go either and so
stella was not very anxious
as for frank himself he treated his ailments with supreme indifference
do i take any medicine he said in answer to stellas questioning
yes i take all the old womani beg his pardonthe doctor sends
it isnt very unpleasant and though it doesnt do me much good
apparently it seems to afford you and the aforesaid old woman some
satisfaction and so we are pleased all round
you dont seem to take any interest in things frank said stella
one morning when she had come into the garden to look at the trees
that drew a long line of gold and brown and yellow along the river
bank and had found him leaning on the gate his hands clasped before
him his eyes fixed on the hall very much as she had first seen him
the night he had come home
he looked round at her and smiled faintly
why dont you go and try the fish she said ororgo for a ride
you only wander about the gardens or in the meadows
he looked at her curiously
why do not you he said slowly his large blue eyes fixed on her
face which grew slowly blushred under his regard you do not seem to
take much interest in things stel you dont go and fish orortake
a drive or anything you only wander about the garden or in the
meadows
the long lashes swept her cheeks and she struggled with a sigh his
words had told home
butbut she said falteringly i am not a boy girls should stay at
home and attend to their duties
and walk and move as if they were in a dreamas if their hearts and
souls were divorced from their bodiesand miles miles away he said
waving his thin white hand in the air slowly
her lips quivered and she turned her face away but only for a moment
it was back upon him with a smile again
you are a foolish fanciful boy she said putting her hand on his
shoulder and caressing his cheek
perhaps so he said my fancies are more than all the world to me
says the poet you know he added bitterly
stellas heart ached
are you angry with me frank she said dont be
he shook his head
no not angry he said looking out at the mist that was rising
she smothered a sigh she understood his reproach not a moment of the
day but he accused her in his heart of betraying lord leycester if he
could but have known why she had done it but that he never would know
you are a fanciful boy she said with a forced lightness what are
you dreaming about now i wonder
i was wondering too he answered without looking at her i was
wonderingshall i tell you
she answered yes with her hand against his cheek
i was wondering where lord leycester was and how
her hand dropped to her side and pressed her heart the sudden mention
of the name had struck her like a blow
he glanced round
i beg your pardon he said i forgot his name was never to be
mentioned was it i will not sin againin word in thoughtone cant
help ones thoughts stel
no she murmured almost inaudibly
thoughts are free he said mine are not however they are always
flying after himafter him the best and noblest of men the man who
saved my life you see though i may not speak of him it would be
ungrateful to forget him
frank
at her tone of piteous supplication and almost reproach he turned and
put his hand on her arm
forgive me stel i didnt mean to hurt you butbutwell it is
so hard to understand so hard to bear to feel to know that he is
far away and suffering while that man jasper adelstonei beg your
pardon stel there i will say no more
do not she murmured her face white and strained but resigneddo
not besides you are wrong he has forgotten by this time
he turned and looked at her with a sudden anger then he smiled as the
exquisite beauty of her face smote him
you wrong him and yourself no stel men do not forget such a girl as
you
no more she said almost in a tone of command
he shook his head and the cough came on and silenced him
she put her arm round his neck
that cough she said you must go in dear look at the mist come
come in
he turned in silence and walked beside her for a few steps then he
said tremulously
stella let me ask one question and then i will be silentfor
always
well she said
have you heard from himdo you know where he is
she paused a moment to control her voice then she said
i have heard no word i do not know whether he is alive or dead
he sighed and his head dropped upon his breast
let us go in he said then he started for his ears particularly
sharp had caught the sound of a wellknown footstep
there isjasper he said with a pause before the name and he drew
his arm away and walked away from her stella turned with a strange set
smile on her face the set smile which she had learnt to greet him with
he came up the path with his quick and peculiar suppressed step his
hand outstretched he would have taken her in his arms and kissed
herif he had dared but he could not with all his determination and
resolution he dared not there was something some mysterious halo
about his victim which kept him almost at arms length it was as if
she had surrounded herself by a magic circle which he could not pass
he took her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it his eyes
drinking in her beauty and grace with a thirsty wistfulness
my darling he murmured in his soft low voice out so late will
you not catch cold
no she said and like her smile her voice seemed set and tutored
i shall not catch cold i never do under any circumstance but i have
just sent frank in he has been coughing terriblyhe does not seem at
all strong
he frowned with swift impatience
frank is all right he said and there was a touch of jealousy in his
voice are you not unduly anxious about the boyyou alarm yourself
without cause
alarm myself she repeated ready to be alarmed at the suggestion
idont think i hope i am not alarmed why should i be she said
anxiously
the jealousy grew more pronounced
there is no reason whatever he said shortly the boy is all
right he has been getting his feet wet and caught cold that is all
stella smiled
yes that is all she said of course but it is strange dr
hamilton doesnt get rid of it for him
perhaps he doesnt help the doctor he retorted boys always
are careless about themselves but dont let frank absorb all the
conversation he said let us talk of ourselves and he kissed her
hand again
yes said stella obediently
he kept her hand in his and pressed it
i have come to speak to you tonight stella about ourselves
darling i want you to be very good to me
she looked forward at the lighted room with the same set expression
waiting patiently obediently for him to proceed there was no
response in her touch or in her face he noticed ithe never failed to
notice it and it maddened him he set his teeth hard
stella i have been waiting month after month to say what i am going
to say now but i couldnt wait any longer my darling my own i wish
the marriage to take place
she did not start but she turned and looked at him and her face
shone whitely in the darkness and he felt a faint shudder in the hand
imprisoned in his
will you not speak he said after a moment almost angry because
of the tempest of passion and breathed tenderness that possessed him
have you nothing to say or will you say no i almost expect it
i will not say no she said at last and her voice was cold and
strained you have a rightthe right i have given youto demand the
fulfillment of our bargain
good heaven he broke in passionately why do you talk like this
shall i never never win you to love me will you never forget how we
came together
do not ask me she said almost pleaded and her face quivered
indeedindeed i try trytry hard to forget the past and to please
you
it was piteous to hear and see her and his heart ached but it was for
himself as well as for her
do you doubt my love he said hoarsely do you think any man could
love you better than i do does that count as nothing with you
yes yes she said slowly sadly it does count ii then she
looked down why will you speak of love between us she said ask
metell me to do anything and i will do it but do not speak of love
he bit his lip
well he said with an effort i will not i see i cannot touch your
heart yet but the time will come you cannot stand against a love like
mine and you will let our marriage be soon
yes she said simply
he raised her hand to his lips and kissed it hungrily and she forced
back the shudder which threatened to overmaster her
by soon he murmured as they walked toward the house i mean quite
soonbefore the winter
stella did not speak
let it be next month darling he murmured i shall not feel sure
of you until you are my very own once you are mine beyond question i
will teach you to love me
stella looked at him and a strange despairing smile more bitter and
sad than tears shone on her pale lips teach her to love him as if
love could be taught
i am not afraid he said answering her smile no one could
withstand itnot even you though your heart were adamant
it is not that she said in a low voice as she thought of the dull
aching which was its pittance by day and night
they went into the house mr etheridge was wandering about the
room smoking his pipe his head upon his breast buried in thought
as usual frank was lying back in the old armchair he looked
wearilyfragile and delicate but the beautiful color shone in his face
he looked up and nodded as jasper entered but jasper was not satisfied
with the nod and went over to him and laid a hand upon his shoulder
at which the boy winced and shrank faintly he never could bear jasper
to touch him and always resented it
well frank he said with his faint smile hows the cold tonight
frank murmured something indistinctly and shifted in his seat
not so well eh said jasper it seems to me that a change would do
you good what do you say to going away for a little while
the boy looked up at stella with a glance of alarm leave stella
i dont want to go away he said shortly i am quite well i hate a
change
stella came up to his chair and knelt beside him
it would do you good dear she said in her low musical voice
he bent near her
do you meanalone he asked i dont want to go alonei wont in
fact
no not alone certainly said jasper with his smile i think some
one else wants a change too
and he looked at stella tenderly
ill go if stella goes said frank curtly
what do you say sir said jasper to the old man
he stared and the proposal had to be put to him in extenso he had
not heard a word of what had been said
go away yes if you like but why franks cold i dont suppose any
other place is better for a cold is it it is very well then you
dont want me to come i suppose
well said jasper
i couldnt do it exclaimed the old man almost with alarm i should
be like a fish out of water i couldnt paint away from the river and
the meadows oh its impossible besides you dont want an old man
pottering about and he looked at stella and smiled grimly
i couldnt go without you said stella quietly
nonsense he said theres the other old woman mrs penfold take
her she can go it will do her good though she hasnt a cold
then he stopped in front of the boy and looked at him with the strange
reserved almost sad expression which always came upon his race when
he regarded him
yes he said in a low voice he wants a change i havent noticed
he looks thin and unwell yes you had better go where will you go
stella shook her head with a smile but jasper was ready
let me see he said thoughtfully we dont want a cold place the
change would be too great and we dont want too hot a place what do
you say to cornwall
the old man nodded
stella smiled again
i havent anything to say she said would you like cornwall frank
he looked from one to the other
what made you think of cornwall he asked jasper suspiciously
jasper laughed softly
it seemed to me just the place to suit you it is mild and clear and
just what you want besides i remember a little place near the sea a
sheltered village in a baycarlyon they call itthat would just do
for us what do you say let me see where is the map
he went and got a map and spreading it out on the table called to
stella
this is it he said then in a low voice he whispered there is a
pretty secluded little church there stella why should we not be
married there
she started and her hand fell on the map
i am thinking of you my darling he said for my part i should like
to be married here
no not here she faltered as she thought of standing before the
altar in the wyndward church and seeing the white walls of the hall as
she uttered her marriage vow not here
i understand he said then why not there your uncle could come
down for that i think
she did not speak and with a smile of satisfaction he folded the map
it is all settled he said we go to carlyon you will come down for
a little while i hope sir we shall want you
the old man pushed the white hair off his forehead
eh he asked what for
to give stella away replied jasper she has promised to marry me
there
the old man looked at her
why not here he asked naturally but stella shook her head
very well he said it is a strange fancy but girls are fanciful
off you go then and dont make more fuss than you can help
so stellas fate was settled and the day the fatal day loomed darkly
before her
chapter xxxvi
lord charles was too glad to gain leycesters consent to leave town to
care where they went and to prevent all chance of leycesters changing
his mind this stanch and constant friend went with him to his rooms
and interviewed the patient oliver
go away sir said that faithful and longsuffering individual
im glad of it his lordshipand you too begging your pardon my
lordought to have gone long ago its been terrible hot work these
last few weeks i never knew his lordship so wild and where are we
going my lord
that was the question leycester rendered no assistance whatever
beyond declaring that he would not go where there was a houseful of
people he had thrown himself into a chair and sat moodily regarding
the floor bellamys sudden illness and prophetic words had given him
a shock he was quite ready to go anywhere so that it was away from
london which had become hateful to him since the last hour
lord charles lit a pipe and oliver mixed a sodaandbrandy for him
and they two talked it over in an undertone
ive got a little place in the doone valley devonshire you know
said lord charles talking to oliver quite confidentially its a mere
boxjust enough for ourselves and we should have to rough it rough
it awfully but theres plenty of game and some fishing and its as
wild as a march hare
thats just what his lordship wants said oliver i know him so
well you see my lord i must say that ive taken the way weve been
going on lately very serious it isnt the money that dont matter my
lord and it isnt altogether the wildness weve been wild before my
lord you know
lord charles grunted
but that was only in play like and there is no harm in it but this
sort of thing thats being going on hasnt been play and it aint
amused his lordship a bit why hes more down than when we came up
thats so oliver assented lord charles gloomily
i dont know what it was and it isnt for me to be curious my lord
continued the faithful fellow but its my opinion that something went
wrong down at the hall and that his lordship cut up rough about it
lord charles remembering that letter and the beautiful girl at the
cottage nodded
perhaps so he said well well go down to the doone valley
better pack up tonight or rather this morning ill go home and get a
bath and well be off at once fish out the train will you
oliver who was a perfect master of bradshaw turned over the leaves
of that valuable compilation and discovered a train that left in the
afternoon and lord charles broke it to leycester
leycester accepted their decision with perfect indifference
i shall be ready he said in a dispassionate indifferent way tell
oliver what you want
its a mere box in a jungle said lord charles
a jungle is what i want said leycester grimly
with the same grim indifference he started by that afternoon train
smoking in silence nearly all the way down to barnstaple and showing
no interest in anything
oliver had telegraphed to secure seats in the coach that leaves that
ancient town for the nearest point to the valley and early the next
morning they arrived
a couple of horses and a dogcart had been sent onhow oliver managed
to get them off was a mystery but his command of resources at most
times amounted to the magicaland they drove from teignmouth to the
valley and reached the hut as it was called
it was in very truth a mere box but it was a box set in the center of
a sportsmans paradise lonely and solitary it stood on the edge of the
deer forest within sound of a babbling troutstream and in the center
of the best shooting in devonshire
oliver with the aforesaid magic procured a couple of servants and
soon got the little place in order and here the two friends lived
like hermits in a dell
they fished and shot and rode all day returning at night to a plain
late dinner and altogether led a life so different to that which they
had been leading as it was possible to imagine
lord charles enjoyed it he got brown and as fit and as hard as
nails as he described it but leycester took things differently the
gloom which had settled upon him would not be dispelled by the mountain
air and the beauty of the exquisite valley
always and ever there seemed some cloud hanging over him spoiling his
enjoyment and witching the charm from his efforts at amusement while
charles was killing trout in the stream or dropping the pheasants in
the moors leycester would wander up and down the valley gun or rod
in hand using neither his head drooping his eyes fixed in gloomy
retrospection
in simple truth he was haunted by a spirit which clung to him now as it
had clung to him in those days of feverish gayety and dissipation
the vision of the slim beautiful girl whom he loved was ever before
him her face floated between him and the mountains her voice mingled
with the stream he saw her by day he dreamed of her by night
sometimes he would wake with a start and fancy that she was still
his own and that they were standing by the weir her hand in his
her voice whispering leycester i love you distance only lent
enchantment to her beauty and her grace in a word he could not forget
her
sometimes he wondered whether he had been right in yielding her up
to jasper adelstone so quietly but as he recalled that morning and
stellas face and words he felt that he could not have done otherwise
yes he had lost her she had gone forever yet he could not forget
her it seemed very strange even to himself after all there were so
many beautiful women he could have chosen some he had been almost in
love with and yet he had forgotten them what was there about stella
to cling to him so persistently he remembered every little unconscious
trick of voice and manner the faint little smile that curved her lip
the deep light in the dark eyes as they lifted to his asking taking
his love there was a special little trick or mannerism she had a way
of bending her head and looking at him half over her shoulder that
simply haunted him she camethe vision of herto the side of his
chair and his bed and looked at him so and he could see the graceful
curve of the delicate neck ah me ah me it was very weak and
foolish perhaps that a strong man of the world should be held in such
thrall by a simple girl just a girl but men are made so and will so
be held when they are strong and true till the world ends
it was very slow for charlievery slow and very rough but he was
one of those rare friends who stick close in such a time he fished
and shot and rode and walked and was always cheerful and never
obtrusive but though he never made any remark he could not but notice
that leycester was in a bad way he was getting thinner and older
looking and the haggard lines which the wild town life had begun to
draw deepened
lord charles was beginning to be afraid that the doone valley also
would fail
ever hear anything of your people ley he asked one night as they
sat in the living room of the hut the night was warm for the time of
year and they sat by the open window smoking their pipes and clad in
their shooting suits of woolen mixture
leycester was leaning back his head resting on his hand his eyes
fixed on the starlit sky his long knickerbockered legs outstretched
my people he replied with a little movement as of one waking from a
dream no i believe they are in the country somewhere
didnt leave any address for them
leycester shook his head
no i have no doubt they know it however oliver is engaged to
lilians maid jeanette and doubtless writes to her
charles looked at him
getting tired of this old man he asked quietly
no said leycester not at all i can keep it up as long as you
like if you are tired we will go dont imagine that i am insensible
to the boredom you are undergoing charlie but i advised you to let me
go my way alone did i not
thats so was the cheerful response but i didnt choose did i
and i dont now but all the same i should like to see you look a
little more chippy ley
leycester looked up at him and smiled grimly
i wonder whether you were ever in any trouble in your life charlie
he said
lord charles drained the glass of whisky and water that stood beside
him
yes he said but im like a duck it pours off my back and there i
am again
i wish i were like a duck said leycester with bitter selfscorn
charlie you have the misfortune to be tied to a haunted man i am
haunted by the ghost of an old and lost happiness and i cant get rid
of it
charlie looked at him and then away
i know he said i havent said anything but i know well i am not
surprised she is a beautiful creature and one of the sort to stick in
a mans mind im very sorry old man there isnt any chance of its
coming right
none whatever said leycester and that is why i am a great fool in
clinging to it
he got up and began to pace the room and the color mounted to his
haggard face
i cannoti cannot shake it off charlie i despise myself and yet
no no to love her once was to love her for alwaysto the end
theres another man of course said lord charles didnt it occur
to you towell to break his neck or put a bullet through him or get
him appointed governor of the cannibal islands ley that used to be
your style
leycester smiled grimly
this man cannot be dealt with in any one of those excellent ways
charlie he said
if its the man i suppose that fellow jasper addled eggno
adelstone i should have tried the first at any rate said lord
charles emphatically
leycester shook his head
its a bad business he said curtly and there is no way of making
it a good one i will go to bed what shall we do tomorrow and he
sighed
lord charles laid his hand on his arm and kept him for a moment
you want rousing ley he said rousing thats it lets have the
horses tomorrow and take a big spin anywhere nowhere it doesnt
matter well go while they can
ley nodded
anything you like he said and went out
lord charles called to oliver who was standing outside smoking a
cigarhe was quite as particular about the brand as his master
where did you say the earl and countess were oliver he asked
at darlingford court my lord
how far is it from here can we do it tomorrow with the nags
oliver thought a moment
if they are taken steadily my lord not as his lordship has been
riding lately as if the horse were cast iron and his own neck too
lord charles nodded
all right he said well do it lord leycester wants a change
again oliver
oliver nodded
well run over there neednt say anything to his lordshipyou
understand
oliver quite understood and went off to the small stable to see about
the horses and lord charles went to bed chuckling over his little plot
when they started in the morning leycester asked no questions and
displayed the supremest indifference to the route and lord charles
affecting a little indecision made for the road to which oliver had
directed him
the two friends rode almost in silence as was their wont leycester
paying very little attention to anything excepting his horse and
scarcely noticing the fact that lord charles seemed very decided about
the route
once he asked a question it was when the evening was drawing in and
they were still riding as to their destination but lord charles
evaded it
we shall get somewhere i expect he said quietly there is sure to
be an innor something
and leycester was content
about dusk they reached the entrance to darlingford there was no
village no inn leycester pulled up and waited indifferently
what do we do now he asked
lord charles laughed but rather consciously
look here he said i know some people who have got this place wed
better ride up and get a nights lodging
leycester looked at him and smiled suddenly
isnt this rather transparent charlie he said calmly of course
you intended to come here from the very start very well
well i suspect i did said lord charles you dont mind
leycester shook his head
not at all they will let us go to bed i suppose you can tell them
that you are traveling keeper to a melancholy monomaniac and theyll
leave me alone mind we start in the morning
all right said lord charles chuckling inwardlyof course quite
so come on
they rode up the avenue and to the front of a straggling stone
mansion and a groom came forward and took their horses lord charles
drew leycesters arm within his
we shall be sure of a welcome
and he walked up a broad flight of steps
but leycester stopped suddenly for a figure came out of one of the
windows and stood looking down at them
it was a woman gracefully and beautifully dressed in some softlyhued
evening robe he could not see her face but he knew her and turned
almost angrily to lord charles but lord charles had slipped away
muttering something about the horses and leycester went slowly up
lenoreit was sheawaited his approach all unconsciously she could
not see him as plainly as he saw her and she took him for some strange
chance visitor
but as he came up and stood in front of her she recognized him and
with a low cry she moved toward him her lovely face suddenly smitten
pale her violet eyes fixed on him yearningly
leycester she said and overcome for the moment by the suddenness of
his presence she staggered slightly
he could do no less than put his arm round her for he thought she
would have fallen and as he did so his heart reproached him for the
one word leycester and the tone told her story his mother was
right she loved him
lenore he said and his deep grave musical voice trembled
slightly she lay back in his arms for a moment looking up at him with
an expression of helpless resignation in her eyes her lovely face
revealed in the light which poured from the window full upon her
lenore he said huskily whatwhat is this
her eyes closed for a moment and a faint thrill ran through her
then she regained her composure and putting him gently from her she
laughed softly
it was your fault she said the exquisite voice tremulous with
emotion why do you steal upon us like a thief in the night orlike
a ghost you frightened me
he stood and looked at her and put his hand to his brow he was but
mortal was but a man with a mans passions a mans susceptibility to
womans loveliness and he knew that she loved him
i he said then stopped i did not know charlie brought me
here who are here
they are all here she said her eyes downcast i will go and tell
them lest you frighten them as you frightened me and she stole away
from him like a shadow
he stood his hands thrust in his pockets his eyes fixed on the ground
she was very beautiful and she loved him why should he not make her
happy make one person happy at least not only one person but his
mother and lilianall of them as for himself well one woman was as
good as another seeing that he had lost his darling and this other
was the best and rarest of all that were left
leycester
it was his mothers voice he turned and kissed her she was not
frightened she did not even kiss him but she put her hand on his
arm and he felt it tremble and the way she spoke the word told of all
her past sorrow at his absence and her joy at his return
you have come back to us she said and that was all
yes i have come back he said with something like a sigh
she looked at him and the mothers heart was wrung
have you been ill leycester she asked quietly
ill no he said then he laughed a strange laugh do i look so
seedy my lady
you look she began with sad bitterness then she stopped come
in
he followed her in but at the door he paused and looked out at the
night as he did so the vision of the slim graceful girl of his
lost darling seemed to float before him with pale face and wistful
reproachful eyes he put up his hand with a strange despairing
gesture and his lips moved
goodbye he murmured oh my lost love goodbye
chapter xxxvii
lord charles little plot had succeeded beyond his expectation he had
restored the prodigal and shared the fatted calf as he deserved to do
although it was known all over the house in five minutes that lord
leycester the heir had returned there was no fuss only a pleasant
little simmer of welcome and satisfaction
the countess had gone to the earl who was dressing for dinner to tell
him the news
leycester has returned she said
the earl started and sent his valet away
what
yes he has come back to us she said sinking into a seat
where from he demanded
she shook her head
i dont know i dont want to know he must be asked no questions
lord charles brought him i always loved charles guildford
so you ought out of pity said the earl grimly seeing that your
son has almost led him to ruin
then the countess fired up
there must be no talk of that kind she said you do not want to see
him go again no word must be said unless you want to drive him away
he has been ill
i am not surprised said the earl still a little grimly a man
cant lead the life he has been leading and keep his health moral or
physical
but that is all past said the countess confidently i feel that is
all past if you do not worry him he will stay and all will go well
oh i wont worry his imperial highness said the earl with a smile
that is what you want me to say i suppose and the girlwhat about
her
i dont know said the countess with all a mothers supreme
indifference for the fate of any other than her son she is past too
i am sure of that how thankful i am that lenore is here
ah said the earl who could be sarcastic when he liked so she is to
be sacrificed as a thankoffering for the prodigals return is she
poor lenore i am almost sorry for her she is too good for him
for shame exclaimed the countess flushing no one is too good for
him andand she will not deem it a sacrifice
no i suppose not he said fumbling at his necktie it is well to
be born with a handsome face and a daredevil temper because all
women love you then and the best and fairest think it worth while to
offer themselves up poor lenore well ill be civil to his highness
notwithstanding that he has spent a small fortune in two months
and declined to honor my house with his presence there he added
touching her cheek and smiling dont be alarmed we will kill the
fatted calf and make merrytill he goes off again
the countess was satisfied with this and went down to find leycester
and lord charles standing near the fire though they had only rented
the place for a month curtains were up on all the doors and there was
a fire in all the sittingrooms and in the earls apartments
the countess held out her hand to lord charles
i am very glad to see you charlie she said with her rare smile
you can give me a kiss if you like and charlie as he blushed and
kissed the white forehead knew that she was thanking him for bringing
her son back to her
but weve got to go back at once he said with a laugh
we cant sit down in this rig out and he looked ruefully at his
riding suit
the countess shook her head
you shall sit down in a smock frock if you like she said but there
is no occasion i have brought leycesters things down andits not
the first time you have borrowed suits from each other i expect
not by a many laughed lord charles ill go and dress where is
ley
leycester had gone out of the room quietly and was then sitting beside
lilian his hand in hers her head upon his breast
you have come back to us ley she said caressing his hand it has
been so long and weary waiting you will not go again
he paused a moment then he looked at her
no he said in a low voice no lil i shall not go again
she kissed him and as she did so whispered anxiously
andandstella ley
his face contracted with a frown of pain and trouble
that is all past he said using his mothers words and she kissed
him again
how thin and worn you look oh ley she murmured with sorrowful
loving reproach
he smiled with a touch of bitterness
do i well i will wax fat and grow mirthful for the future he said
rising there is the dinner bell
come to me afterward ley she pleaded as she let him go and he
promised
there was to be no fuss but it was noteworthy that several of
leycesters favorite dishes figured in the menu and that there was a
special indian curry for lord charles
leycester did not descend to the diningroom till ten minutes after the
time and the greeting between father and son was characteristic of the
two men the earl put out his thin white hand and smiled gravely
how do you do leycester he said will you have the lafitte or the
chateau margaux the weather is fine for the time of year
and leycester said quietly
i hope you are well sir the margaux i suppose charles yes we
have had some good weather
that was all
he went to his place and sat down quietly and composedly as if he had
dined with them for months without a break and as if the papers had
not been chronicling his awful doings
the earl could not suppress a pang of pity as he glanced across at the
handsome face and saw how worn and haggard it looked and he bent his
head over his soup with a sigh
leycester looked round the table presently and then turned to the
countess
where is lenore he asked
the countess paused a moment
she has rather a bad headache and begged to be excused she said
leycester bent his head
i am sorry he remarked
then the countess talked and lord charles helped her he was in the
best of spirits the dinner was excellent and the curry admirable
considering the short notice and he was delighted with the success of
his maneuver he rattled on in his humorous style told them all about
the hut and represented that they lived somewhat after the manner of
savages
eat our meals with a hunting knife dont we leycester i hope youll
excuse us if we dont hold our forks properly i daresay we shall soon
get into the way of it again
all this was very well and the earl smiled and grew cheerful but the
countess watching the haggard handsome face beside her saw that
leycester was absorbed and preoccupied he passed dish after dish and
the margaux stood beside him almost untouched she was still anxious
and fearful and as she rose she threw a glance at the earl half of
entreaty half of command that he would not say anything
it is nice to get back to the old wine said charlie leaning back
in his chair and eying his glass with complacent approval whisky
and water is a fine drink but one tires of it now this and he
reached the claret jug expressively
the earl talked of politics and the coming hunting season and still
leycester was silent eying the white cloth and fingering the stem of
his wine glass
will you hunt this year leycester said the earl addressing him at
last
he looked up gravely
i dont know sir only a day a week if i do
we shall go to leicestershire of course said the earl i shall
have to be up for the season but you can take charge if you will
leycester inclined his head
will you see to the horses asked the earl
leycester thought a moment
i shall only want two he said the rest will be sold
do you mean the stud asked the earl with a faint air of surprise
yes said leycester quietly i shall sell them all i shall not
race again
the earl understood him the old wild life was to come to an end but
he put in a word
is that wise he said
i think so said leycester quite enough money has been spent yes
i shall sell
very well assented the earl who could not but agree with the remark
respecting money after all i imagine one tires of the turf i always
thought it a great bore
so it isso it is said lord charles cheerfully everything is a
bore
the earl smiled
not everything he said leycester you are not touching the wine
he added graciously
leycester filled his glass and drank it and then to charles surprise
refilled it not once only but twice and thrice as if he had suddenly
become thirsty
presently the earl after vainly pushing the decanter to them rose
and they followed him into the drawingroom
the countess sat at her teatable and beside her was lenore she was
rather paler than usual and the beautiful eyes were of a deep violet
under the long sweeping lashes she was exquisitely dressed but there
was not a single jewel about her a spray of white orchid nestled on
her bosom and shone in her golden hair showing the exquisite delicacy
of the fair face and throat leycester glanced at her but took his cup
of tea without a word and lord charles made all the conversation as
at the dinnertable
presently leycester put down his cup and walked to the window and
drawing the curtain aside stood looking out at the night there was a
flush of color in his face owing perhaps to the margaux and a strange
light in his eyes what did he see in the darkness was it the spirit
of stella to whom he had said farewell he stood wrapt in thought the
buzz of conversation and the occasional laugh of charlie behind him
then suddenly he turned and went up to the silent figure with the while
flower in its bosom and its hair and sat down beside her
are you better he asked
she just glanced at him and smiled slowly
yes i am quite well it was only a headache
are you well enough to come on to the terracethere is a terrace is
there not
a balcony
will you come it is quite warm
she rose at once and he took up a shawl and put it round her and
offered her his arm
she just laid her fingertips on it and he led her to the window she
drew back and smiled over her shoulder
it is a capital offence to open a window at night
i forgot he said you see i am so great a stranger that i fail to
remember the habits of my own people will you show me the way round
this way she said and opening a small door she took him into a
conservatory and thence to the balcony
they were silent for a moment or twohe looking at the stars she
with eyes bent to the ground he was fighting for resolution and
determination she was silently waiting knowing what was passing in
his heart and wondering with a throbbing heart whether her hour of
triumph had come
she had stooped to the very dust to win him to snatch him from that
other girl who had ensnared him but as she stood now and glanced at
himat the tall graceful figure and the handsome face all the
handsomer in her eyes for its haggardnessshe felt that she could
have stooped still lower if it had been possible her heart beat with
expectant passionshe longed for the moment when she could rest upon
his breast and confess her love why did he not speak
he turned to her at last and spoke
lenore he said and his voice was deep and earnest almost solemn
i want to ask you a question will you answer me
ask it she said and she raised her eyes to his with a sudden flash
when you saw me tonight when i came in unexpectedly you
weremoved was it because you were glad to see me
she was silent a moment
is that a fair question she murmured
yes he said yes lenore we will not trifle with each other you
and i if you were glad to see me do not hesitate to say so it is not
idle vanity that prompts the question
she faltered and turned her head away
why will you press me she murmured in a low tremulous voice do
you wish to see me ashamed then she turned to him suddenly and the
violet eyes met his with a light of passionate love in their depths
but i will answer it she said yes i was glad
he was silent for a moment then he drew closer to her and bent over
her
lenore will you be my wife
she did not speak but looked at him
will you be my wife he repeated almost fiercely her supreme
loveliness was telling upon him the light in her eyes was sinking to
his heart and stirring his pulses tell me lenore do you love me
her head drooped then she sighed
yes i love you she said and almost imperceptibly swayed toward him
he took her in his arms his heart beating his brain whirling for the
memory of that other love seemed to haunt him even at that moment
you love me he murmured hoarsely looking back on the night of the
past can it be true lenore you
she nestled on his breast and looked up at him and from the pale face
the dark eyes gleamed passionately
leycester she breathed you know i love you you know it
he pressed her closer to him then a hoarse cry broke from him
god forgive me
it was a strange response at such a moment
why do you say that she asked looking up at him his face was
haggard and remorseful anything but as a lovers face should be but
he smiled gravely and kissed her
it is strange he said as if in explanationstrange that i should
have won your love i who am so unworthy while you are so peerless
she trembled a little with a sudden qualm of fear if he could but know
of what she had been guilty to win him it was she who was unworthy
but she put the fear from her she had got him and she did not doubt
her power to hold him
do not speak of unworthiness she murmured lovingly we have both
passed through the world leycester and have learned to value true
love you have always had mine she added in a faint whisper
what could he do but kiss her but even as he took her in his arms and
laid his hand on the shapely head with its golden wealth a subtle
pain thrilled at his heart and he felt as if he were guilty of some
treachery
they stood for some time almost in silenceshe was too wise to disturb
his moodside by side then he put her arm in his
let us go in he said shall i tell my mother tonight lenore
why not she murmured leaning against him and with the upturned
eyes glowing into his with suppressed passion and devotion why not
will they not be glad do you think
yes he said and he remembered how differently stella had spoken
after all he thought with a sigh i shall make a great many
persons happy and comfortable very well he said i will see them
he stooped to kiss her before they passed into the light and she did
not shrink from his kiss but put up her lips and met it with one in
return
there were men and not a few who would have given some years of their
life for such a kiss from the beautiful lenore but he leycester took
it without a thrill without an extra heartbeat
there was not much need to tell them what had happened the countess
knew in a moment by lenores facepale but with a light of triumph
glowing in itthat the hour had come and that she had won
in her graceful manner she went up to the countess and bent over to
kiss her
i am going up now dear she said in a whisper i am rather tired
the countess embraced her
not too tired to see me if i come she said in a whisper and lady
lenore shook her head
she put her hand in leycesters for a moment as he opened the door for
her and looked into his face but he would not let her go so coldly
and raising her hand to his lips said
goodnight lenore
the earl started and stared at this familiar salutation and lord
charles raised his eyebrows but leycester came to the fire and stood
looking into it for a minute in silence
then he turned to them and said in his quiet way
lenore has promised to be my wife have you any objection sir
the earl started and looked at him and then held out his hand with an
emphatic nod
objection it is about the wisest thing you ever did leycester
leycester smiled at him strangely and turned to his mother she did
not speak but her eyes filled and she put her hand on his shoulder
and kissed him
my dear leycester i congratulate you exclaimed charlie wringing
his hand and beaming joyously pon my word this is thethe happiest
thing weve come across for many a day by george
and having dropped leycesters hand he seized that of the earl and
wrung that and would in turn have seized the countesss had she not
given it to him of her own free will
we have to thank you in some measure for this charles she said in
a low voice and with a grateful smile
leycester leant against the mantelshelf his hands behind him his
face set and thoughtful almost absent indeed he had the appearance
of a man in a dream
the earl roused him with a word or two
this is very good news leycester
i am very glad you are pleased sir said leycester quietly
i am more than pleased i am delighted responded the earl in his
quiet way i may say that it is the fulfillment of a hope i have
cherished for some time i trust more i believe you will be happy
if you are not he added with a smile it will be your own fault
leycester smiled grimly
no doubt sir he said
the old earl passed his white hands over each otherjust as he did in
the house when he was about to make a speech
lenore is one of the most beautiful and charming women it has been my
fate to meet she has been regarded by your mother and i may say by
myself as a daughter the prospect of receiving her at your hands as
one in very truth affords me the most intense pleasure
thank you sir said leycester
the earl coughed behind his hand
i suppose he said with a glance at the haggard face there will be
no delay in making your happiness complete
leycester almost started
you mean
i mean your marriage said the earl staring at him and wondering
why he should be so dense and altogether grim of course of course
your marriage the sooner the better my dear leycester there will
be preparations to make and they always take time i think if you
can persuade lenore to fix an early date i would see harbor and
harborthe family solicitorsat once i need hardly say that
anything i can do to expedite matters i will do gladly i think you
always had a fancy for the place in scotlandyou shall have that
and as to the house in town well if you havent already thought of a
place there is the house in the square
leycesters face flushed for a moment
you are very good to me sir he said and for the first time his
voice showed some feeling
nonsense said the earl cordially you know that i would do
anything everything to make your future a happy one talk it over with
lenore
i will sir said leycester i think i will go up to lilian now she
expects me
the earl took his hand and shook it as he had not shaken it for many a
day and leycester went upstairs
the countess had left the room but he found her waiting for him
goodnight mother he said
oh leycester you have made meall of usso happy
ay he said and he smiled at her i am very glad heaven knows i
have often enough made you unhappy mother
no no she said kissing him this makes up for allfor all
leycester watched her as she went downstairs and a sigh broke from
him
not one of them understands not one he murmured
but there was one watching for him who understood
leycester she said holding out her hands to him and almost rising
he sat on the head of the couch and put his hand on her head
mamma has just told me ley she murmured i am so glad so glad i
have never been so happy
he was silent his fingers caressing her cheek
it is what we have all been hoping and praying for ley she is so
good and sweet and so true
yes he said little guessing at her falsity
and leyshe loves you so dearly
aye he said with almost a groan
she looked up at him and saw his face and her own changed color her
hand stole up to his
oh ley ley she murmured piteously you have forgotten all that
he smiled not bitterly but sadly
forgotten no he said such things are not easily forgotten but it
is past and i am going to forget now lil
even as he spoke he seemed to see the loving face with its trusting
smile floating before him
yes ley dear ley for her sake for lenores sake
yes he said grimly for hers and for my own
you will be so happy i know it i feel it no one could help loving
her and every day you will learn to love her more dearly and the past
will fade away and be forgotten ley
yes he said in a low absent voice
she said no more and they sat hand in hand wrapped in thought even
when he got up to go he said nothing and his hand as it held hers was
as cold as ice
chapter xxxviii
it had come so suddenly as to almost overwhelm her the great gift of
the gods that she had been waiting aye and plotting for had fallen
to her at last and her cup of triumph was full to overbrimming but at
the same time she as lord charles would have put it kept her head
she thoroughly understood how and why she had gained her will she
could read leycester as if he were a book and she knew that although
he had asked her to be his wife he had not forgotten that other girl
with the brown hair and dark eyesthat stella the painters niece
this was a bitter pang to her a drop of gall to her cup but she
accepted it
just as jasper said of stella so she said of leycester
i will make him love me she thought the time shall come when he
will wonder how he came to think of that other and be filled with
selfcontempt for having so thought of her and she set about her work
well some women in the hour of their triumph would have shown their
delight and so worried or perhaps disgusted their lover but not so
did lady lenore
she took matters with an ineffable calm and serenity and never for
one moment allowed it to be seen how much she had gained on that
eventful evening
to leycester her manner was simply charming she exerted herself to win
him without permitting the effort to be even guessed at
her very beauty seemed to grow more brilliant and bewitching she moved
about the place like a poem as lord charles declared her voice
always soft and musical with unexpected harmonies that charmed by
their very surprises was like music and more important still it was
seldom heard she exacted none of the privileges of an engaged woman
she did not expect leycester to sit with her by the hour or walk about
with her all day or to whisper tender speeches and lavish secret
caresses indeed she almost seemed to avoid being alone with him in
fact she humored him to the top of his bent so that he did not even
feel the chain with which he had bound himself
and he was grateful to her gradually the charm of her presence the
music of her voice the feeling that she belonged to him told upon him
and he found himself at times sitting watching and listening to her
with a strange feeling of pleasure he was only mortal and she was not
only supremely beautiful but supremely clever she had set herself to
charm him and he would have been less or more than man if he had
been able to resist her
so it happened that he was left much to himself for charlie thinking
himself rather de trop and in the way had taken himself off to join
his shooting party and leycester spent most of his time wandering
about the coast or riding over the hills generally returning at
dinnertime tired and thoughtful and very often expecting some word or
look of complaint from his beautiful betrothed
but they never came exquisitely dressed she always met him with the
same serene smile in which there was just a suggestion of tenderness
she could not express and never a question as to where he had been
after dinner he would come and sit beside her leaning back and
watching her too often absently and listening to her as she talked
to the others to him she very seldom said much but if he chanced to
ask her for anythingto play or to singshe obeyed instantly as if
he were already her lord and master it touched him her simpleminded
devotion and thorough comprehension of himtouched him as no display
of affection on her part would have done
heaven help her she loves me he thought often and often and i
one evening they chanced to be alone togetherhe had come in after
dinner having eaten some sort of meal at a shooting lodge on the
adjoining estateand found her seated by the window her white hands
in her lap a rapt look on her face
she looked so supremely lovely so rapt and solitary that his heart
smote him and he went up to her his step making no sound on the thick
carpet and kissed her
she started and looked up with a burning blush which transfigured her
for a moment then she said quietly
is that you leycester have you dined
yes he said with a pang of selfreproach why should you think of
that i do not deserve that you should care whether i dine or not
she smiled up at him her eyebrows arched themselves
should it not but i do care very much have you
he nodded impatiently
yes you do not even ask me where i have been
no she murmured softly i can wait until you tell me it is for
you to tell me and for me to wait
such submission such meekness from her who was pride and hauteur
personified to others amazed him
by heaven lenore he exclaimed in a low voice there never was a
woman like you
no she said i am glad you will have something that is unique then
yes he said i shall then he said suddenly when am i to
possess my gem lenore
she started and turned her face from him
he looked down at her and put his hand on her shoulder white and warm
and responsive to his touch
lenore let it be soon we will not wait why should we let us make
ourselves and all the rest of them happy
will it make you happy she asked
it was a dangerous question but the impulse was too strong
yes he said and indeed he thought so can you say the same
lenore
she did not answer but she took his hand and laid it against
her cheek it was the action of a slavea beautiful and
exquisitelygraceful woman but a slave
he drew his hand away and winced with remorse
come he said bending over her let me tell them that it shall be
next month
so soon she murmured
yes he said almost impatiently why should we wait they are all
impatient i am impatient naturally but they all wish it let it be
next month lenore
she looked up at him
very well she said in a low voice
he bent over her and put his arm round her and there was something
almost desperate in his face as he looked up at her
lenore he said in a low voice i wish to heaven i wish i were
worthy of you
hush she whispered you are too good to me i am quite content
leycesterquite content
then as her head rested on his shoulder she whispered there is only
one thing leycester i should like
she paused
what is it lenore
it is about the place she said you will not mind where it takes
place will you i do not want to be married at wyndward
this was so exactly in accordance with his own wishes that he started
not at wyndward he said hesitating why
she was silent a moment
fancy she said with a little rippling laugh fancies are permitted
one at such times you know
yes yes he said i know my mother and father would wish it to be
thereor in london
nor in london she said almost quickly leycester why should it
not be here
he was silent this again would be in accordance with his own desire
i should like a quiet wedding she said oh very quiet
you he exclaimed incredulously you whose marriage would at
any time have so much interest for the world in which you have
movedreigned rather
she laughed again
it has always been one of my daydreams to steal away to church with
the man i loved and be married without the usual fuss and formality
he looked at her with a gleam of pleasure and relief in his eyes
little dreaming that it was for his sake she had made the proposal
how strange he muttered itwell it is unlike what one fancies of
you lenore
perhaps she said with a smile but it is true nevertheless if i
may choose i would like to go down to the little church there and be
married like a farmers daughter or if not that exactly as quietly
as possible
he rose and stood looking out of the window thoughtfully
i shall never understand you lenore he said but this pleases me
very much indeed it has always been my daydream as you call ithe
smothered a sigh certainly it shall be as you wish why should it not
be
very well she said then that is agreed no announcements no fuss
no st georges hanover square and no bishop and she rose and
laughed softly
he looked at her and smiled
you appear in a new light every day lenore he said if you had
expressed my own thoughts and desires you could not have hit them off
more exactly what will the mother say
the countess had a great deal to say about the matter she declared
that it was absurd that it was worse than absurd it was preposterous
it is all very well to talk of a farmers daughter my dear but you
are not a farmers daughter you are lady lenore beauchamp and he is
the next earl the world will say you have both taken leave of your
senses
lenore looked at her with a sudden gleam in her violet eyes
do you think i care she said in a low voiceleycester was not
present i would not care whether we were married in westminster
abbey by the archbishop himself with all the court in attendance or
in a village chapel it is not i though i say so it is for him say
no more about it dear lady wyndward his lightest wish is law to me
and the countess obeyed the passionate devotion of the haughty beauty
astonished even her who knew something of what a womans love can be
capable of
my dear she murmured do not give way too much
the beauty smiled a strange smile
it is not a question of giving way she retorted with suppressed
emotion it is simply that his wish is my law i have but to obeyit
will always be so always then she slipped down beside the countess
and looked up with a sudden pallor
do you not understand yet how i love him she said with a smile
no i do not think anyone can understand but myselfbut myself
the earl offered no remonstrance or objection
what does it matter he said the place is of no consequence the
marriage is the thing the day leycester is married a heavy load of
care and apprehension and i shall be divorced let them be married
where they like in heavens name
so harbor and harbor were set to work and the principal of that
oldestablished and aristocratic firm came all the way down to
devonshire and was closeted with the earl for a couple of hours and
the settlement deeds were put in hand
lady lenores fortune which was a large one was to be settled upon
herself supplemented by another large fortune from the hand of the
earl so large that the lawyer ventured on a word of remonstrance but
the earl put it aside with a wave of the hand
it is the same amount as that which was settled upon the countess he
said why should my sons wife have less
quiet as the betrothal had been and quietly as the nuptials were to
be rumors had spread and presents were arriving daily if lenore
could have found any particular pleasure in precious gems and
goldfitted dressingbags and ivory prayerbooks there they were in
endless variety for her delight but they afforded her none beyond the
fact of their being evidence of her coming happiness
one present alone brought her joy and that was leycesters and that
not because the diamonds of which the necklet was composed were large
and almost priceless but for the fact that he fastened the jewels
round her neck with his own hands
these are my necklets she murmured taking his hands as they touched
her neck and pressing them
how could he resist her
and yet as the time moved on with that dogged obstinacy which it
assumes for us while we would rather have it pause awhile something
of the old moodiness seemed to take possession of him the long walks
and rides grew longer and often he would not return until late in the
night and then weary and listless at such times it was lenore who
made excuses for him if by chance the countess uttered a word of
comment or complaint
why should he not do as he likes she said with a smile it is i
who am the slave not he
but alone in her chamber where already the signs of the approaching
wedding were showing themselves in the shape of new dresses and wedding
trousseau the anguish of unrequited love overmastered her pacing
to and fro with clasped hands and pale face she would utter the old
moan the old prayer which the gods have heard since the world was
young
give me his lovegive me his love take all else but let his heart
turn to me and to me only
if stella could have known it she was justly avenged already not even
the anguish she had endured surpassed that of the proud beauty who had
helped to rob her and who had given her own heart to the man who had
none to give her in return
chapter xxxix
it certainly must have been made a hundred years after the rest of
the world said mr etheridge where on earth did you hear of it
jasper
they were standing the painter jasper and stella on the little
stretch of beach that fronted the tiny village of carlyon with its
cluster of roughstone cottages and weatherbeaten church the whole
nestling under the shadow of the cornish cliffs that kept the east
winds at bay and offered a stern face to the wild seas which so often
roared and raged at its base
jasper smiled
i cant exactly say sir he answered i met with it by chance and
it seemed to me just the place for our young invalid you like it
stella i hope and he turned to stella with a softened smile
stella was leaning on the old mans arm looking out to sea with a
faraway expression in her dark eyes
yes she said quietly i like it
stella likes any place that is far from the madding crowd remarked
mr etheridge gazing at her affectionately you dont appear to have
got back your roses yet my child however
i am quite well she said not so wearily as indifferently i am
always well it is frank who is ill you know uncle
ay ay he said with the expression of gravity which always came
upon him when the boy was mentioned he looks very pale and thin poor
boy
stella sighed but jasper broke in cheerfully
better than when he first came he said i noticed the difference
directly i saw him he will pick up his strength famously you will
see
stella sighed again
you must make sketches of this coast said jasper as if anxious to
get away from the subject it is particularly picturesque especially
about the cliffs there is one view in particular which you should not
fail to take you get it from the top of the cliff there
rather a dangerous perch said mr etheridge shading his eyes and
looking up
yes it is assented jasper i have been trying to impress the fact
upon stella it is her favorite haunt she tells me and i am always in
fear and trembling when i see her mounting up to it
the old man smiled
you will soon have the right to protect her he said glancing at the
church have you made all the arrangements
jaspers face flushed as he answered but stellas remained pale and
set
yes everything is ready the clergyman is a charming old gentleman
and the church is a picture inside i tell stella that one could not
have chosen a more picturesque spot
and he glanced toward her with the watchful smile
stella turned her face away
it is very pretty she said simply shall we go in now frank will
be expecting us
you must know said jasper that we are leading the most rustic of
livesdinner in the middle of the day tea at five oclock
i see said mr etheridge quite a foretaste of arcadia but after
all he added perhaps remembering the long journey which he had been
compelled to take and which he disliked i cant see why you should
not have been married at wyndward
jasper smiled
and risk the chance of lord leycester turning up at the last moment
and making a scene he might have answered if he had replied
candidly but instead he said lightly
oh that would have been too commonplace for such a romantic man as
your humble servant sir
mr etheridge eyed him in his usual grave abstracted way
you are the last person i should have accused of a love of the
romantic he said
then there was frank added jasper in a lower voice but not too
low to reach stella for whom the addition was intended he wanted a
change and he would not have come without stella
they entered the cottage in the tiny sittingroom of which mrs
penfold had already set the tea
frank was lying on a sofa whose metallic hardness had been mitigated by
cushions and pillows and certainly if he was pulling up his strength
as jasper asserted it was at a very slow rate
he looked thinner than ever and there was a dark ring under his eyes
which made the hectic flush still more beautiful by contrast than when
we saw him last he greeted their entrance with a smile at stella and
a cold evasive glance at jasper she went and smoothed the pillow at
his head but as if ashamed that the other should see his weakness he
rose and walked to the door
the old man eyed him sadly but smiled with affected cheerfulness
well frank how do you feel tonight you must be well to the front
tomorrow you know or you will not be the best man
frank looked up with a sudden flush then set down without a word
i shall be very well tomorrow he said there is nothing the matter
with me
jasper as usual cut in with some remark to change the subject and
as usual did all the talking stella sat silent her eyes fixed on the
distant sun sinking slowly to rest the word tomorrow rang in her
ears this was the last day she could call her own tomorrow and all
after tomorrows would be jaspers all the past full of its sweet
hopes and its passionate love had gone by and vanished and tomorrow
she would stand at the altar as jasper adelstones bride it seemed
so great a mockery as to be unreal and at times she found herself
regarding herself as another person in whom she took the merest
interest as a spectator
it could not be that she whom leycester wyndward had loved should be
going to marry jasper adelstone then she would look at the boy so
thin and wan and fading and love would give her strength to carry
out her sacrifice
tonight he was very dear to her and she sat holding his hand under
the table the thin frail hand that closed with a spasmodic gesture of
aversion when jaspers smirkish voice broke in on the conversation it
was wonderful how the boy hated him
presently she whisperedyou must go and lie down again frank
no not here he said let me go outside
and she drew his hand through her arm and went out with him
jasper looked after them with a smile
quite touching to see franks devotion to stella he said
the old man nodded
poor boy he saidpoor boy
jasper cleared his throat
i think he had better come with us on our wedding trip he said it
will give stella pleasure i know and be a comfort to frank
the old man nodded
you are very kind and considerate he said
not at all responded jasper i would do anything to insure stellas
happiness bytheway speaking of arrangements i have executed a
little deed of settlement
was that necessary asked mr etheridge she comes to you penniless
i am not a rich man said jasper meekly but i have secured a
sufficient sum upon her to render her independent
the old man nodded gratefully
you have behaved admirably he said i have no doubt stella will be
happy you will bear with her i hope jasper and not forget that she
is but a girlbut a girl
jasper inclined his head for a moment in silence bear little did the
old man know how much he jasper had to bear
they sat talking for some little time jasper listening as he talked
to the two voices outsidethe clear low musical tones of stella the
thin weak voice of the boy presently the voices ceased and after a
time he went out frank was sitting in the sunset light his head on
his hands
where is stella asked jasper almost sharply
frank looked up at him
she has escaped he said sardonically
jasper started
what do you mean
she has gone on the cliffs for a stroll said frank with a little
smile at the alarm he had created and intended to create
jasper turned upon him with a suppressed snarl he was battling with
suppressed excitement tonight
what do you mean by escaped he demanded
the hollow sunken eyes glared up at him
what did you think i meant he retorted you need not be frightened
she will come back and he laughed bitterly
jasper glanced at him again and after a moment of hesitation turned
and went into the house
meanwhile stella was climbing the steep ascent to the bit of tableland
on the cliff she felt suffocated and overwhelmed tomorrow
tomorrow seemed to ring in her ears was there no escape as she
looked down at the waves rolling in beneath her and beating their
crested heads against the rocks she almost felt as if she could drop
down to them and so find escape and rest so strong was the feeling
the temptation that she shrank back against the cliff and sank down
on dry and chalky turf trembling and confused suddenly as she thus
sat she heard a mans step coming up the cliff and thinking it was
jasper rose and pushed the hair from her face with an effort at
selfcommand
but it was not jasper it was a straighter more stalwart figure and
in a moment as he stood to look at the sea she knew him it was
leycester and with a low inarticulate cry she shrank back against
the cliff and watched him he stood for a while motionless leaning
on his stick his back turned from her then he took up a pebble and
dropped it down into the depths beneath sighed and to her intense
relief went down again
but though he had not spoken the sight of him his dearlyloved
presence so near her shook her to her center white and breathless
she leaned against the hard rock her eyes strained to catch the last
glimpse of him then she sank on to the ground and hiding her face in
her hands burst into tears
they were the first tears that she had shed since that awful day and
every drop seemed of molten fire that scorched her heart as it flowed
from it
if ever she had persuaded herself that the time might come when she
would cease to love him she knew now that she had seen him again
that she could not so hope again never while life was left to her
should she cease to love him and tomorrow tomorrow
oh my love my love she murmured stretching out her hands as she
had done that night in the garden come back to me i cannot let you
go i cannot do it i cannot
nerved by the intensity of her grief she sprang to her feet and
swiftly descended the cliff near the bottom there were two paths
one leading to the village the other to the open country beyond
instinctively she took the one leading to the village and so missed
leycester for he had gone down the other
had she but made a different choice had she turned to the right
instead of the left how much would have been averted but she sped
almost breathlessly to the left and instead of leycester found jasper
waiting for her
with a low cry she stopped short
where is he she asked almost unconsciously let me go to him
jasper stared at her then he grasped her arm
you have seen him he said not roughly not fiercely but with a
suppressed fury
there was a rough seat cut out of the stone beside her and she sank
into it shrinking away from his eager watching in quest of that other
you have seen him he repeated hoarsely do not deny it
the insult conveyed in the words recalled her to herself
yes she said meeting his gaze steadily i have seen him why
should i deny it
no he said and you will not deny that you were running after him
when ii stopped you you will admit that i suppose
yes she answered with a deadly calm i was following him
he dropped her arm which he had held and pressed his hand to his heart
to still the pang of its throbbing
youyou are shameless he said at last hoarsely
she did not speak
do you realize what tonight is he said glaring down at her this
is our marriage eve do you hearour marriage eve
she shuddered and put up her hands to her face
did you plan this meeting he demanded with a fierce sneer you
will admit that i suppose it is only a mere chance that i did not
find you in his arms is that so curse him i wish i had killed him
when i met him just now
then the old spirit roused itself in her bosom and she looked up at
him with a scornful smile on her beautiful wasting face
you she said
that was all but it seemed to drive him mad for a moment he stood
breathless and panting
the sight of his fury and sufferingfor the suffering was
palpablesmote her
her mood changed suddenly with a cry she caught his arm
oh jasper jasper have pity on me she cried have pity you wrong
me you wrong him he did not come to see me he did not know i was
here we have not spokennot a word not a word and she moaned but
as i stood and watched him and saw how changed he was and heard him
sigh i knew that he had not forgotten andand my heart went out to
him ii did not mean to speak to follow him but i could not help
it jasper you seeyou see it is impossibleour marriage i mean
have pity on me and let me go for your own sake let me go think
think what satisfaction what joy can you hope for ii have tried to
love you jasper butbut i cannot all my life is his let me go
he almost flung her from him then caught her again with an oath
by heaven i will not he cried fiercely once for all i will not
take care you have made me desperate it is your fault if i were to
take you at your word
he paused for breath then his rage broke out again more deadly for
its sudden unnatural quietude
do you think i am blind and bereft of my senses not to see and
understand what this means do you think you are dealing with a child
you have waited your time and bided your chance and you think it has
come would you have dared to do this a month ago no there was no
certainty of the boys death then but nownow that you see he will
die you think my power is at an end
with a cry she sprang to her feet and confronted him terror in her
face an awful fear and sorrow in her eyes as the cry left her lips
it seemed to be echoed by another close behind them but neither of
them noticed it
frankdie she gasped no no not that tell me that you did not
mean it that you said it only to frighten me
he put her imploring hand away with a bitter sneer
you would make a good actress he said do you mean to tell me that
you were not counting on his death do you mean to tell me that you
would not have wound up the scene by begging for more timetime to
allow you to escape as you would call it you think that once the
boy is dead you can slip from your bargain and laugh at me you are
mistaken since the bargain was struck i have strove as no man ever
strove to make it easy for you to win your love because i loved you
i love you no longer but i will not let you go love you as there is
a heaven above us i hate you tonight but you shall not go
she shrank from him cowering as he towered above her like some
beautiful maiden in the old myths shrinking from some devouring monster
listen to me he said hoarsely tomorrow i either give this
paperand he snatched the forged bill from his breast pocket and
struck it viciously with his quivering handi either give it into
your hands as my wife or i give it to the nearest magistrate the boy
will die it rests with you whether he dies at peace or in a jail
white and trembling she sat and looked at him
this is my answer to your pretty prayer he said with a bitterness
incredible it is for you to decidei use no further argument soft
speeches and loving words are thrown away upon you besides the time
has passed for them there is no love no particle of love in my heart
for you tonighti simply stand by my bond
she did not answer him she scarcely heard him she was thinking of
that sad face that had appeared to her for a moment as if in reproach
and vanished ghostlike and it was to it that she murmured
oh my lovemy love
he heard her and his face quivered with speechless rage then he
laughed
you made a great mistake he said with a sneera very great
mistake if you are invoking lord leycester wyndward he may be your
love but you are not his it is a matter of small momentit does not
weigh a feather in the balance between usbut the truth is your
love is now lady lenore beauchamps
stella looked up at him and smiled wearily
a lie no he said shaking his head tauntingly i have known it for
weeks past it is in every london paper but that is nothing as between
you and mei stand by my bond tomorrow the boys fate lies in your
hands or in that of the police i have no more to sayi await your
answer i do not even demand it tonightno doubt you would be
she arose white and calm her eyes fixed on him
i say i await your answer till tomorrow acts not words i
require fulfill your part of the bargain and i will fulfill mine
as he spoke he folded the forged bill which in his excitement had
blown open and put it slowly into his pocket again then he wiped his
brow and looked at her biting his lip moodily
will you come with me now he said or will you wait and consider
your course of action
his question seemed to rouse her she raised her head and disregarding
his proffered arm went slowly past him to the house
he followed her for a few steps then stopped and with his head on
his breast went toward the cliffs his fury had expended itself and
left a confused bewildering sensation behind for the time it really
seemed as he said that his baffled love had turned to hate but as he
thought of her recalling her beauty his hate shrank back and returned
to its old object
curse him he hissed it is he who has done this if he had not come
tonight this would not have happened curse him from the first he has
stood in my path let her go to him never no tomorrow she shall be
mine in spite of him she cannot draw back she will not
then his brain cleared he began to upbraid himself for his violence
fool fool he muttered hoarsely as he climbed the path scarcely
heeding where he went i have lost her love forever why did i not
bear with her a few hours longer i have borne with her so long that
i should have borne with her to the end it was that cry of hers that
maddened me heaven to think that she should love him so that she
should have clung to him so persistently him whom she had not seen for
months and keep her heart steeled against me who have hung about her
like a slave but i will be her slave no longer tomorrow makes me her
master
as he muttered this sinister threat he found that he had reached
the end of the cutting that had been made in the cliff and turned
mechanically the wind was blowing from the sea and the sound of the
waves rose from the depths beneath crying hoarsely and complainingly
as if in harmony with his mood he paused a moment and looked down
abstractedly
i would rather have her lying dead there he muttered than that
there should be a chance of her going back to him no he shall never
have her tomorrow shall set that fear at rest forever tomorrow
with a long breath he turned from the edge of the cliff to descend
but as he did so he felt a hand on his arm and looking up he saw the
thin frail figure of the boy standing in the path
he was so wrapt in his own thoughts that he was startled and made a
movement to throw the hand off roughly but it stuck fast and with an
effort to command himself he said
well what are you doing up here
as he put the question he saw by the fading light that the boys face
was deathly whitethat for once the beautiful fatal flush of red was
absent
you are not fit to be out at this time of night he said harshly
what are you doing up here
the boy looked at him still retaining his hold and standing in his
path
i have come to speak to you jasper he said and his thin voice was
strangely set and earnest
jasper looked down at him impatiently
well he said roughly what is it couldnt you wait until i came
in
the boy shook his head
no he said and there was a strange light in his eyes which never
for a moment left the others face i wanted to see you alone
well i am aloneor i wish i were retorted jasper brutally what
is it then he put his hand on the boys shoulder and looked at him
more closely oh i see he said with a sneer youve been playing
eavesdropper well and he laughed cruelly listeners hear no good of
themselves though you heard no news
a slight contraction of the thin lips was the only sign that the fell
shaft had sped home
yes he said calmly and sternly i have been eavesdropping i have
heard every word jasper
jasper nodded
then you can indorse the truth of what i said my dear frank and he
smiled evilly i have no doubt you have not forgotten your little
escapade
i have not forgotten was the response
very good then i should advise you if you care for your own safety
and your cousins welfare to say nothing of the family honor to
advise her to come to termsmy terms you have heard them no doubt
i have heard about them said the boy i have he stopped a second
to cough but his hold on jaspers sleeve did not relax even during
the paroxysmi have heard them i know what a devil you are jasper
adelstone i have long guessed it but i know now
jasper laughed
thanks and now you have discharged yourself of your venom my young
asp we will go down take your hand from my coat if you please
wait said the boy and his voice seemed to have grown stronger i
have not done yet i have followed you here jasper for a purpose i
have come to ask you forfor that paper
calmly and dispassionately the request was made as if it were the
most natural in the world to say that jasper was astonished does not
describe his feelings
youmust be mad he exclaimed then he laughed
you will not give it to me was the quiet demand
jasper laughed again
do you know what that precious piece of handwriting of yours cost
me my dear frank one hundred and fifty pounds that i shall never see
again unless your friend holiday takes to paying his debts
i see said the boy slowly and his voice grew reflective you
bought it from him nowith a sudden flash of inspirationhe was a
gentleman by hook or by crook you stole it
jasper nodded
never mind how i got it i have got it and he struck his breast
softly
the sunken eyes followed the gesture as if they would penetrate to the
hidden paper itself
i know he said in a low voice i saw you put it there
and you will not see it again until i hand it to stella tomorrow
or give it to the magistrate before whom you will stand my dear lad
charged with forgery
the word had scarcely left his lips but the boy was upon him his
long thin armsendued for a moment as it seemed with a madmans
strengthencircling jaspers neck not a word was uttered but the
thin white face lit up by the gleaming eyes spoke volumes
jasper was staggered not frightened but simply surprised and
infuriated
youyou young fool he hissed take your arms off me
give it to me give it to me panted the boy in a frenzy give it
to me the paper the paper and his clutch tightened like a band of
steel
jasper smothered an oath the path was narrow unconsciously or
intentionally the frenzied lad had edged them both while talking to
the brink and jasper was standing with his back to it in an instant
he realized his danger yes danger for absurd as it seemed the
grasp of the weak dying boy could not be shaken off there was danger
frank he cried
give it me broke in the wild cry and he pressed closer
with an awful imprecation jasper seized him and bore him backward but
as he did so his foot slipped and the boy falling upon him thrust a
hand into jaspers breast and snatched the paper
jasper was on his feet in a moment and flying at him tore the paper
from his grasp the boy uttered a wild cry of despair crouched down
for a moment and then with that one wild prayer upon his lips give
it me hurled himself upon his foe for quite a minute the struggle
so awful in its inequality raged between them his opponents strength
so amazed jasper that he was lost to all sense of the place in which
they stood in his wild effort to shake the boy off he unconsciously
approached the edge of the cliff unconsciously on his part but the
other noticed it even in his frenzy and suddenly as if inspired he
shrieked out
look leycester he is there behind you
jasper started and turned his head the boy seized the moment and the
next the narrow platform on which they had stood was empty a wild
hoarse shriek rose up and mingled with the dull roar of the waves
beneath and then all was still
chapter xl
leycester had reached carlyon on foot he had left the house in the
morning simply saying that he was going for a walk and that they
were not to wait any meal for him during the last few days he had
wandered in this way seemingly desirous of being alone and showing no
inclination toward even charlies society lady wyndward half feared
that the old black fits was coming on him but lenore displayed no
anxiety she even made excuses for him
when a man feels the last hour of his liberty approaching he
naturally likes to use his wings a little she said and the countess
had smiled approvingly
my dear you will make a model wife just the wife that leycester
needs
i think so i do indeed responded lenore with her frank charming
smile
so leycester was left alone to his own wild will during those last
few days while the dressmakers and upholsterers were hard at work
preparing for the day
he could not have told why he came to carlyon he did not even know
the name of the little village in which he found himself with his
handsome face rather grave and wearylooking he had tramped into the
inn and sunk down into the seat which had supported many a generation
of carlyon fisherman and many seacoast travelers
this is carlyon sir said the landlord in answer to leycesters
question eying the tall figure in its knee breeches and shooting
jacket yes sir this is carlyon have you come from st michaels
sir
leycester shook his head he scarcely heard the old man
no he answered but i have walked some distance and he mentioned
the place
the old man stared
phew thats a long walk sir a main long walk and what can i get
you to eat sir
leycester smiled rather wearily he had heard the question so often in
his travels and knew the results so perfectly
anything you like he said
the landlord nodded in approval at so sensible an answer and went out
to consult his wife who had been staring at the handsome traveler from
behind the halfopen door of the common living room presently he came
out with the result the gentleman could have a bit of fish and a chop
and some falmouth potatoes
leycester nodded indifferentlyanything would do
both the fish and the chop were excellent but leycester did anything
but justice to them a strange feeling of restlessness seemed to have
taken possession of him and when he had lit his cigar instead of
sitting down and taking it comfortably he felt compelled to get up and
wander to the door the evening was drawing in there were a fairish
number of miles between him and homeit was time for him to start but
still he leant against the door and looked at the sea and cliffs that
rose in a line with the house
at last he paid his reckoning supplemented it with a halfcrown for
the landlord in his capacity of waiter and started but not homeward
the cliff seemed to exercise a strange fascination for him and obeying
the impulse which was almost irresistible he set off for the path that
ascended to the summit and strode upward
a great peace was upon the scene a great unrest and unsatisfied desire
was in his heart all the air seemed full of stella her voice mingled
for him in the plash of the waves thinking of her with a deep
sorrowful wistfulness he climbed on andpassed her
stood within reach of her as she cowered and shrank against the wall of
chalk and all unconscious of her nearness he turned and came down the
evening had grown chilly and keen but his walk had made him hot and
he turned into the inn to get a glass of ale
the landlord was surprised to see him again and said so and leycester
stood with the glass in his hand explaining that he had been up the
cliff to look at the view
aye sir and a grand view it is said the old man with pardonable
pride man and boy ive growed under the shadow of that cliff and
i know every inch of it top and bottom mighty dangerous it is too
sir he added reflectively its not one or two but nigh upon a
score o accidents as ive known on that cliff
the path is none too wide said leycester
no sir and in the dark he stopped suddenly and started what
was that he exclaimed
what is the matter leycester asked
the old man caught his arm suddenly and pointed to the cliff
leycester looked up and the glass fell from his hand there on the
giddy height clearly defined against the sky were two figures locked
together in what appeared a deadly embrace
look exclaimed the old man the glassgive me the glass
leycester caught up a telescope that stood on a seat beside them and
gave it to him he himself did not need a glass to see the dark
struggling figures they were all too plain for one second they stood
as if benumbed and then the echo of the shriek smote upon their ears
and the cliff was bare the old man dropped the telescope and caught
leycesters arm as he made a bound toward the path
no no sir he exclaimed no use to go up there the boat the
boat and he ran to the beach leycester followed him like a man in a
dream and tearing off his coat seized an oar mechanically
there was not a soul in sight the peace of the autumn evening rested
on sea and shore but in leycesters ears the echo of that awful
deathshriek rung as plainly as when he had first heard it the
landlord of the inn an old sailor rowed like a young man and the
boat rose over the waves and cleaved its way round the bay as if a
dozen men were pulling
not a word was spoken the great beads of sweat stood on their
foreheads their hearts throbbed in unison with every stroke presently
leycester saw the old man relax his stroke and bend peering over the
boat and suddenly he dropped his oar and sprang up pointing to a dark
object floating on the top of the waves leycester rose too calm and
acute enough now and in another minute jasper adelstone was lying at
their feet
leycester uttered no cry as his eyes fell upon the pale set face but
he sank down in the boat and put his hands to his eyes
when he looked up he saw the old man quietly putting his oar into its
place
yes sir he said gravely answering leycesters glance he is dead
stone dead row back sir
but the other said leycester in a whisper
the old man shook his head and glanced upward at the cliff
he is up there sir alive or dead he is up there he didnt fall
into the sea or we should have met him
thenthen said leycester his voice struggling for calm he may be
alive
we shall soon see sir row for life or death
leycester needed no further prompting and the boat sped back by the
time they had gained the shore a crowd had collected and leycester
felt rather than saw that the motionless lifeless form that had
haunted him from its place at the bottom of the boat was carried
offfelt rather than was conscious that he was speeding up the cliff
followed by the landlord and halfadozen fishermen
silent and breathless they gained the top and stood for a moment
uncertain then leycester saw one of them step forward with a rope
now mates the old man said which of us goes down
there was a moments silence then leycester stepped forward and took
up the rope
i he said
it was but a word but no one ventured to dispute his decision
quietly and calmly they fastened the rope round his waist leaving a
loop lower down he had left his coat in the boat and stood bareheaded
for a moment the old man stood beside him calm and grave
hold tight sir he said and ififyou find him sling the rope
round him and give the word
leycester nodded held up his hand and the next moment was swinging in
the air slowly and steadily inch by inch they lowered him down the
awful depths amidst a deathlike silence suddenly his voice broke it
coming up to them in one word
stop
breathless they waited then they felt the rope jerk and they pulled
up a great sob of relief rather than a cheer rose as he appeared
bearing on his arm the slight figure of poor frank
gently but swiftly they unwound the ropes and laid him down at
leycesters feet and the old man knelt beside him
leycester did not speak but stood panting and pale the old man looked
up
give me a hand boys he said slowly and sternly he is alive
alive said leycester hoarsely
alive repeated the old man yes sir you have saved him but
leycester followed them down the cliff followed them to the inn then
as the thin wasted figure disappeared within the house he sank on to
the bench at the door and covered his face with his hands
was it an awful dreamwould he awake presently and find himself at
home and this dreadful nightmare vanished
suddenly he felt a hand upon his arm and looking up saw a staid
elderly man with doctor written plainly on his face
i beg your pardon sir he said you know this poor lad
leycester nodded
so i understood from a word you let drop on the cliff as that is the
case perhaps you would not mind breaking it to his friends
his friends asked leycester mechanically
the doctor nodded
they are staying at that cottage he said pointing they should be
here at once
leycester rose dazed for a moment then he said in a low voice
i understand yes i will do it
without another word he strode off it was no great distance but
he had not to traverse it short as it was at the turn of the road
a slight girlish figure came flitting toward him it was stella he
stopped irresolute but at that moment she had no thought even for
him without hesitating she came toward him her face pale her hands
outstretched
leycester where is he
without thinking he put his arm round her and she rested on his breast
for a moment
stella my stella be brave
she uttered a little inarticulate cry and hid her face for a moment
then she raised her head and looked at him
take me to him she moaned take me to him oh my poor boy my poor
boy
in silence he led her to the inn and she passed up the stairs the
fishermen gathered round the door drew back and turned their eyes from
him with respectful sympathy and he stood looking out at the sea the
minutes passed years they seemed to him then he heard the doctors
voice
will you go upstairs my lord
leycester started and slowly ascended the stairs
stretched on a small bed lay the poor erring boy white and deathlike
already in the shadow of death beside him knelt stella her hand
clasping his her face lying beside his
he looked up as leycester entered and raised a thin white hand to
beckon him near instinctively leycester knelt beside him
you want to see me frank
the boy raised his eyelids heavily and seemed to make a great struggle
for strength
leycester he said ii have something to give you youyou will
understand what it means it was the charm that bound her to him i
have broken itbroken it it was for my sake she did it for mine i
did not know it till tonight take it leycester and slowly he drew
from his breast the forged paper
leycester took it deeming the boy delirious and frank seemed to read
his thought
you will understand he panted iiforged it and he knew it
and held the knowledge and the paper over her head you saved my life
leycester i give you something better than life leycester i give
youherstella
his lips quivered and he seemed sinking but he made a last effort
ii am dying leycester i am glad very very glad i dont wish to
live it is better that i should die
frank broke from stellas white lips
dont cry stella while i lived hehe would have held you bound now
i am dying then his voice failed and his eyes closed but they saw
his lips move and stella bending over him heard the wordsforgive
forgive
with a loud cry she caught him in her arms but he had passed away
even beyond her love and the next moment she fell fainting still
holding him to her bosom as a mother holds her child
an hour afterward leycester was pacing the beach his arms folded
across his breast his head bent a storm of conflicting emotions
raging within the boy had spoken truly the time had come when he
understood fully the lads words he had gleaned much from the forged
bill which all torn and stained lay hidden in his pocket but the
full meaning of the mystery had been conveyed to him by the delirious
words of stella who lay in a high fever
he had just left her and was now waiting for the doctor waiting for
his verdictlife or death life or death he had often heard often
used the words but never until this moment knew their import
presently the doctor joined him and leycester uttered the one word
well
she will live he said
leycester raised his head and drew a long breath the doctor continued
yes i think i may say she will pull through i shall know more
tomorrow you see she has undergone a severe strain i do not allude
to the tragic incidents of the evening those in themselves are
sufficient to try a young girl but she has been laboring under extreme
nervous pressure for months past
leycester groaned
come come my lord said the doctor cheerfully you may depend
upon me i should not hold out hope unless i had good reason for so
doing we shall save her i trust and believe
leycester inclined his head he could not speak the doctor looked at
him gravely
if you will permit me my lord he said i would suggest that you
should now take some rest you are far from strong yourself
leycester smiled grimly
far from strong repeated the doctor emphatically and there is a
great deal more endurance before you be advised and take some rest my
lord
the landlord has been speaking to me sir about the unfortunate man
you found it seems that there are papers and valuablesjewelry and
such like will your lordship take charge of them until the police
arrive i understand that you knew him
yes i knew him said leycester he had in truth almost forgotten
jasper adelstone i will take charge of the things if you wish it
follow me then said the doctor
they went to the inn and up the stairs with that quiet subdued step
with which men approach the presence of grim death and stood beside
the bed upon which lay all that remained of the man who had so nearly
wrecked two lives
leycester looked down at the white face calm and
expressionlesslooked down with a solemn feeling at his heart and the
doctor drew some papers from the coat
these are them he said if your lordship will take charge of them
leycester took them and as he did so he glanced mechanically at them
as they lay in his hand and uttered an exclamation
there in his hand lay the note which lenore had written bidding jasper
adelstone meet her in the wood he knew the writing in a moment and
before he had time to prevent it had read the few pregnant words
the doctor turned round
what is the matter
leycester stood and for the first time that awful night trembled
the idea of treachery and deceit so connected with lenore utterly
unnerved him he knew he felt as if by instinct that he held in his
hand a link in the chain of cunning and chicanery which had so nearly
entangled him and the thought that her name would become the prey of
the newspapers was torture
doctor he said and his voice trembled i have seen by accident
a letter written to this unfortunate man it consists of a few lines
only it will compromise a lady whose good name is in my keeping
the doctor held up his hand
your lordship will be guided by your sense of honor he said
leycester inclined his head and put the note in his pocket
then they went down and the doctor strode off to the cottage and left
leycester still pacing the beach
yes the boy had spoken truly he saw it all now he knew how it had
been brought to pass that stella had been entrapped into jaspers
chambers he saw the unscrupulous hand of a woman weaving the threads
of the net in which they had been entangled minute details were not
necessary that little note in the dainty handwriting told its own
story jasper adelstone and lady lenore beauchamp had been in league
together death had squared the reckoning between him and the man but
he had still to settle the tragic account with the woman
the night passed and the dawn broke and the little doctor returning
weary and exhausted found the tall figure still pacing the beach
chapter xli
lenore sat in her dainty room her long golden hair flooding her
white shoulders her fair face reflected in the venetian mirror with
its edging of antique work and trimming of lace not even a venetian
mirror could have desired to hold a fairer picture youth beauty and
happiness smiled from its surface the rich delicately curved lips
smiled tonight with an ineffable content and serene satisfaction
there was a latent gleam of triumph in the violet eyes eloquent
of triumph and victory she had conquered the desire of her life
was nearly within her grasp two daysfortyeight hoursmore and
leycester wyndward would be hers an ancient name an historic title
an immense estate were to be hers to do her justice at this moment
she thought neither of the title nor the estate it was of the man of
the man with his handsome face and musical voice and debonnaire
manner that she thought if they had come and told her there where she
sat that it had been discovered that he was neither noble nor rich
she would not have cared it would not have mattered it was the man
it was leycester himself for whom she had plotted and schemed and she
would have been content with him alone
even now as she looked at the beautiful reflection in the mirror it
was with no thought of her own beauty all her thoughts were of him
and the smile that crossed the red lips was called up by no spirit of
vanity but by the thought that in fortyeight hours the wish and the
desire of her life would be gratified
in silence the maid brushed out the wealth of golden tresses of which
she was almost as proud as the owner herself she had heard a whisper
in the servants hall but it was not for her to speak it was a rumor
that something had happened to lord leycester that he had not returned
yet and that one of the wild fits with which all the household were
familiar had seized him and that he was off no one knew where
it was not for her to speak but she watched her beautiful mistress
covertly and thought how quickly she could dispel the smile of
serenity which sat upon the fair face
quiet as the wedding was intended to be there was necessarily some
stir the society papers had got hold of it and dilated upon it in
paragraphs in which lenore was spoken of as our reigning beauty
and leycester described as the son of a wellknown peer and a man of
fashion quite an army of upholsterers had been at work at the house
in grosvenor square and another army of milliners and dressmakers
had been preparing the brides trousseau a pile of imperials and
portmanteaus stood in the dressingroom each bearing the initials i
with the coronet
one or two of the beauchamps the present earl and a brothertogether
with three young lady cousins who were to act as bridesmaidshad been
invited and were to arrive the following evening certainly there
must be some slight fuss and lenore as she thought of leycesters
absence ascribed it to his dislike to the aforesaid fuss and his
desire to escape from it
the maid went at last and lenore with a happy sigh went to sleep
at that time leycester was pacing the beach at carlyon and jasper
and poor frank were lying dead surely if dreams come to warn one of
impending trouble lady lenore should have dreamed tonight but she
did not she slept the night through without a break and rose fresh
and beautiful with only twentyfour hours between her and happiness
but when she entered the breakfastroom and met the pale anxious face
of the countess and the grave one of the earl a sudden spasm of fear
scarcely fear but apprehension fell upon her
what is the matter she asked gliding to the countess and kissing
her
nothingreally nothing dear she said attempting to speak lightly
where is leycester she asked
that is it replied the countess pouring out the coffee and keeping
her eye fixed on the cup the foolish boy hasnt returned yet
not returned echoed lenore and a faint flush came into her face
where did he go
i dont know my dear lenore and i cannot find out he didnt tell
you
lenore shook her head and fastened a flower in her dress with a hand
that quivered faintly
no i did not ask him i saw him go
was he on foot or riding asked the earl
on foot said lenore he was in his shooting clothes and i thought
he was going for a walk on the hills
the earl broke his piece of toast with a little irritable jerk
it is annoying he said it is extremely inconsiderate of him
extremely today of all others he should have remained at home
he will be here presently said lenore calmly
the countess sighed
nothingof course nothing could have happened to him
she merely made the suggestion in a suppressed hushed anxious voice
lenore laughedactually laughed
happened to him to leycester she said with proud contempt what
could have happened to him leycester is not the sort of man to meet
with accidents pray do not be uneasy dear he will come in directly
very tired and very hungry and laugh at us
i give him credit for better manners said the earl curtly
he was angry and annoyed as he had said to the countess before lenore
came in he had hoped and believed that leycester had given up this
sort of boyish nonsense and intended to act sensibly as became a man
who had settled to marry
there was a moments pause while the earl buttered his toast still
irritably then lady wyndward said almost to herself
perhaps lilian knows
no said lenore quickly she does not or she would have told me i
saw her last night the last thing and she did not know he was out do
not tell her
the countess glanced at her gratefully
she would only be anxious and fret said lenore while i am not and
shall not be she added with a smile i am not afraid that leycester
has run away from me
she looked up as she spoke and flashed her beauty upon them as it
were and smiled and the mother felt reassured certainly it did not
seem probable that any man would run away from her
she herself felt no fear not even when the morning grew to noon and
the noon to evening she went about the house superintending the
packing of the multitudinous things arranging the epergnes playing
the piano even and more than once the light air from the french opera
floated through the room
lord beauchamp and the rest of the visitors were to arrive about seven
just in time to dress for dinner and the stir that had reigned in the
house grew accentuated as the time approached lenore went to her room
at six to dress she meant to look her best tonight as well indeed
as she meant to look on the following day and her maid knew by the
attention which her mistress had paid to the wardrobe that every care
would be expected from her ministering hands just before she went to
her room she met the countess on the stairs they had not seen very
much of each other during the day there was a great deal to do and
the countess notwithstanding her rank was a housekeeper in something
more than name
lenore she said then stopped
the beauty bent over from her position on a higher step and kissed her
i know dearhe has not come yet well he will be here by
dinnertime why are you so anxious i am not
and she laughed
it certainly encouraged the countess and she even called up a smile
what a strange girl you are lenore she said one would have
thought that you before all of us would have been uneasy
lenore shook her head
no dear i feeli feel that he will come now see if my prophecy
comes true
and she went up the stairs casting a serene and confident smile over
her shoulder
i will wear that last blue dress of worths and the pearls she said
to her maid and the girl started the dress had just arrived and was
supposed to be reserved for future london triumphs
the last my lady
lenore nodded
yes i want to look my best tonight and if i were not afraid of
being thought too pronounced i would wear my diamonds
the girl arranged the beautiful hair in its close curls of gold and
fastened the famous pearls upon the white wrists and round the dainty
throat and lenore surveyed herself in the venetian mirror a smile of
satisfaction slowly lit up her face
well she said over her shoulder
beautiful breathed the girl who was proud of her mistresss
loveliness oh beautiful my lady but isnt it a pity to wear it
tonight
lenore shook her head
i would wear a better if i had it she said softly now go
downstairs and tell me when lord leycester returns
the girl stared and then smiled after all then they had been worrying
themselves about nothing her ladyship had received a message from him
and knew when to expect him she went down and crowed over them in the
servants hall and watched for lord leycester
seven oclock chimed from the stables and the carriage that had been
sent to meet the guests returned lord beauchamp was a tall stately
old gentleman who hated traveling as he hated anything else that gave
him any trouble or inconvenience and the rest were tired and dusty
and generally pining for soap and water the earl and countess met them
in the hall and in the bustle and fuss leycester was not missed
do not hurry lord beauchamp said the poor countess we will make
the dinner halfpast eight and she wished in her heart that she could
postpone it altogether for leycester had not come
what shall we dowhat shall we do she exclaimed as the earl stood
at her dressingroom door with his coat in his hand
do he retorted go on without him this comes of humoring an only
son till he develops into a lunatic poor lenore i pity her and he
went out frowning
he has not come my lady murmured the maid entering lenores room a
few minutes afterwards lord beauchamps party have arrived but lord
leycester has not come
lenore was standing by the open window and she turned with a sudden
smile the sound of horses feet had struck upon her ear
yes he has she said he is here now and she closed the window
and sat down calmly
leycester rode into the courtyard on the horse that he had borrowed
from the doctor and throwing the bridle to a groom ascended the
stone steps and made his way through the hall
excepting some of the servants there was no one about they had all
gone to their dressingrooms and he went up the stairs in silence and
uninterrupted with bent head and dragging step for the long vigil and
hours of excitement had told upon him he stood before lilians room
it was worthy of notice that in this awful coming back of his he went
to her first as a matter of course and knocking gently went in
it was dark and the lamp was burning softly but she accustomed to
the dim light saw plainly that something had happened
leycester she exclaimed whyhow is this dear where have you
been all day and all last night you did not come to me and she
stopped as he sat down beside her and put his hand upon her head the
hand was burning hot his face was white and haggard and worn and yet
in some way strangely peaceful with a faraway dreamy expression upon
itleycester where have you been
he bent and kissed her
lil he said and there was a great peace in his voice though it was
weary and husky you will be a brave good girl while i tell you
ah leycester was all she murmured
well lil i have found heri have got her backmy poor stella
her hand closed on his and her delicate face went white as ivory
got her back
yes he said in low tones i have found out the mysteryno not i
it was solved for me by a mightier hand than any human oneby death
lil
death leycester she is not dead oh stellastella
heaven forbid he breathed no no she is alive though fearfully
near death still i left her lying white and still and weak as a broken
lilymy poor sweet darlingbut she is alive thank heavenshe is
alive and now can you bear to hear what separated us lil
tell me she said
sitting there with her loving sympathizing heart beating against
his he told her the strange story sobs low and moving broke from
her as he told of the boys death and an awful chill fell on her as
he spoke as shortly as he could of the fate that had befallen jasper
adelstone but when he came to speak of that short damning note that he
had foundthat note in the handwriting of lenore and hinted at her
share in the conspiracythe gentle heart grew cold and terrified and
she hid her face for a moment then she looked up and clasped her hands
round his neck
oh ley ley deal gently with her forgive her we all need
forgiveness forgive her she did it out of her love for you and has
suffered and will suffer deal gently with her
he bit his lip and his brow darkened
ley ley the gentle creature pleaded think of her now waiting for
you think of her who was to be your wife she loved you ley she
loves you still and that will be her punishment ley you will not be
hard with her
her prayer prevailed he drew a long breath
no lil he said in a low voice i will not be hard with her but
as for love true love does not stand by and see its beloved suffer
as i have suffered not true love there is a passion which men libel
by calling lovethat is what she has borne for me love think of
her yes i will think of her but how am i to forget my beautiful
suffering darling lying so white and wan and broken and he hid his
face in his hands presently he rose and kissed her
i am going to her he said do not fear i have given you my word i
will deal gently with her
she let him go without another word and he went straight to lenores
sittingroom travelstained and haggard and unrefreshed
the maid heard his knock and opened the door and passed out as he
entered and stood in the middle of the room there was a faint rustle
in the adjoining room and then she came floating toward him in all her
loveliness the faint ethereal blue making her white skin to shame the
rare and costly pearls she was dazzling in her supreme loveliness
and at any other time he would have been moved but now it was as if
a deadly venomous serpent glorious in its scaly beauty lay coiled
before him
she came forward her hands outstretched her eyes glowing with a
passionate welcome and then stopped not a word passed for a moment
the two she in all her costly attire and loveliness he in his stained
cord suit and with his haggard face confronted each other she read
her doom at a glance but the proud haughty spirit did not quail
well she said at last
chivalrous to the last even in this moment he pointed to a seat
but she made a gesture of refusal and stood her white hands clasped
tightly her head erect her eyes glowing well you have come back
yes i have come back lady lenore he said his voice dry and hoarse
she smiled bitterly at the lady
you are late she said was it worth while coming back
it was a proud and insolent question but he bore with her
i came back for your sake he said
for mine and she smiled incredulously she could smile still though
an icy hand was closing round her heart and wringing the life blood
out of it
for yours it was not fitting that you should hear from other lips
than mine that from this hour you and i are as far apart as pole from
pole
she inclined her head
so be it there is no appeal from such a sentence but may i ask you
to explain dare i venture so far and her lip curled
do you think you dare he said sternly
she inclined her head his sternness struck her like a blow
you have come to tell me have you not she said where have you
been
i have come from carlyon he said
from whom
from the girl from whom your base scheming separated me he said
sternly
ah she breathed but her eyes opened with a wild stare youyou
have gone back to her
he waved his hand
let there be no word of her between us he said your lips shall not
profane her name
she turned white and her hand went to her heart
forgive me he said hoarsely had he not promised to deal gently
with her i have not come to utter reproachesi came to shield you
if that were possible
to shieldfrom what she demanded in a low murmur
from the consequences of your crime he said what that is i have
only learnt tonight but for a chance accident the world would know
tomorrow that lady lenore beauchamp had stooped so low as to become
the accomplice of jasper adelstone in a vile conspiracy
she waved her hand
he dare not speak i defy him
leycester held up his hand
he is beyond your defiance he saidjasper adelstone is dead
she made a gesture of contemptuous indifference
what is that to me she said hoarsely why do you speak to me of
him or any other man is it not enough that i have failed have you
come to gloat over me what is it that you want
he thrust his hand in his breast and drew forth the note
i have come to restore this to you he said i took it from the dead
mans bosomtook it to save your reputation the story it told me i
have heard in fact from the lips of the girl you have plotted against
and wronged it is at her bidding that i am herehere to save you from
scandal and to cover if possible your retreat
at hersat stella etheridges she breathed as though the name
would choke her
he waved his hand
you will leave this house tonight i have made all arrangements
necessary and you will start in an hours time
she laughed discordantly
and if i say i will not
he looked at her sternly
then i will tell the story to my mother and you shall hear your
dismissal from her lips choose
she dropped into a chair and made a gesture of scorn
tell whom you please she said i am your affianced wife my people
are under your roof at this moment go to them and tell them that you
have deserted me for a lowborn girl
he turned and strode to the door but ere he had reached it the
reaction had come with a low cry she flew to him and sank at his
feet her hands clasped on his arm her face upturned with an awful
imploration
leycester leycester do not leave me do not go leycester i was
wrong wicked base vile but it was all for youfor you leycester
listen to me you will not go do not fling me from you look at me
leycester
he did look at her lovely in her abandon and despair and then averted
his eyes it horrified him to see her so low and degraded
you will not look at me she wailed you will not oh heaven am
i so changed am i old ugly hideous leycester you have called
me beautiful a hundreda thousand times and now you will not look
at me you will leave me you shall not i will hold you like this
foreverforever ahfor he had made a movement to disengage
himselfyou will not hurt me yes kill me kill me here at your
feet i would rather die so than live without you i cannot leycester
listen i love you i love you twenty thousand times better than that
wretched girl can do leycester i will give my life for you see i am
kneeling here at your feet you will not spurn me you cannot repel me
leycester oh my darling my love do what you will with me but do
not spurn me oh my love my love
it was piteous it was awful to see and hear her and the strong man
trembled and turned pale but his heart was stone and ice toward her
the white wan face of his darling came between them and made the
flushed passiondistorted face at his feet seem hideous and repellant
rise he said sternly
no no i will not she moaned i will die at your feet leycester
you will kill me i have lost all for your sake pride and honor and
now my fair name for you cannot shield me and you will thrust me
aside leycester you cannot you cannot oh my love my love do not
spurn me from you and still on her knees she bent her head upon his
arm and poured a storm of passionate broken kisses upon his hand
that roused him with an exclamation of abhorrence he threw her grasp
off and stood with his hand on the door
she sprang to her feet and white and breathless looked at him as if
she would read his soul then throwing her hands above her head she
fell to the ground
he stood for a moment or two bending over her thinking her senseless
but it was simply mental and physical exhaustion and when he strode to
the bell she opened her eyes and held up her hand to stop him
no she murmured let no one see me go now go
he went to the door and she rose and supported herself against a chair
goodbye leycester she said i have lost youand all all
it was the last words he heard her utter for many and many a year
chapter xlii
after all there is nothing like english scenery this is very
beautiful i dont suppose you could get a greater variety of opal
tints in one view than lies before us now but there is something
missing it is all too beautiful too rich too gorgeous one finds
ones breath coming too quickly and one longs for just a dash of
english gloom to tone down the brilliant colors and give a relief
it was mr etheridge who spoke he was standing beside a low rustic
seat which fronted the worldfamous view from the piazza at nice the
sun was dropping into the horizon like a huge ball of crimson fire
the opal tints of the sky stretched far above their heads and even
behind them it was one blaze of glory in which a slim girlish figure
leaning far back in the seat seemed bathed
she was pale still was this stella this little girl heroine of
ours but the dark look of trouble and leaden sorrow had gone and
the light of youth and youthful joy had come back to the dark eyes
the faint ever ready smile hovered again about the red mobile lips
sorrow says goethe is the refining touch to a womans beauty
and it refined stellas she was lovely now with that soft ethereal
loveliness which poets sing of and artists paint and we poor penman
so vainly strive to describe
she looked up with a smile
homesick uncle she murmurs
the old man strokes his beard and glances at her
i plead guilty he says you cannot make a hermit crab happy if you
take him out of his shell and the cottage is my shell stella
she sighed softly not with unhappiness but with that tender
reflectiveness which women alone possess
i will go back when you please dear she says
hem he grunts there is someone else to consult mademoiselle
that someone else seems particularly satisfied to remain where we are
but then i suppose he would be contented to remain anywhere so that a
certain palefaced insignificant chit of a girl were near him
a faint blush a happy flush spreads over the pale face and the long
lashes droop over the dark eyes
at any rate we must ask him says the old man we owe him that
little attention at least seeing how much longsuffering patience he
has and continues to display
dont uncle murmurs the halfparted lips
it is all very well to say dont retorts the old man with a grim
smile seriously dont you think that you are to use an americanism
playing it rather low down on the poor fellow
iidont know what you mean she falters
permit me to explain then he says ironically
ii dont want to hear dear
it is fitting that girls should be made to hear sometimes he
says with a smile what i mean is simply this that as a man with
something approaching a conscience and a fellow feeling for my kind i
feel it my duty to point out to you that perhaps unconsciously you
are leading leycester the sort of life that the bear who dances on hot
bricksif any bear ever doesis supposed to lead here for months
after no end of suffering
i have suffered too she murmurs
exactly he assents in his gentlygrim way but that only makes
it worse after months of suffering you allow him to dangle at
your heels you drag him at your chariot wheels tied him at your
apron strings from france to italy from italy to switzerland from
switzerland back to france again and gave him no more encouragement
than a cat does a dog
the faint flush is a burning crimson now
hehe need not come she murmurs panting he is not obliged
the moththe infuriated moth is not obliged to hover about the
candle but he does hover and generally winds up by scorching his
wings i admit that it is foolish and unreasonable but it is none the
less true that leycester is simply incapable apparently of resting
outside the radius of your presence and therefore i say hadnt you
better give him the right to remain within that radius and
she put up her hand to stop him her face a deeper crimson still
permit me he says obstinately and puffing at his pipe to
emphasize once more the unfortunate wretch is on tenterhooks he is
dying to take possession of you and afraid to speak up like a man
because possibly you have had a little illness
oh uncle and you said yourself that you thought i should have died
he coughs
ahem one is inclined to exaggerate sometimes he is afraid to speak
because in his utter sensitiveness he will insist upon considering you
an invalid still whereas you are about as strong and healthy now as
to use another americanism they make em now stella if you mean
to marry him say so if you dont mean to say so and for goodness
sake let the unfortunate monomaniac go
leycester is not a monomaniac uncle she retorts in a low
indignant voice
yes he is he says he is possessed by a mania for a little chit
of a girl with a pale face and dark eyes and a nose that is nothing to
speak of if he wasnt an utterly lost maniac he would have refused
to dangle at your heels any longer and gone off to someone with some
pretension to a regular facial outline he stops for there comes the
sound of a firm manly tread upon the smooth gravel path and the next
instant leycesters tall figure is beside them
he bends over the slight slim graceful figure a loving reverential
devotion in his handsome face a faint anxiety in his eyes and in his
voice as he says in that low musical undertone which has charmed so
many womens ears
have you no wrap on stella these evenings are very beautiful but
treacherous
there isnt a breath of air says stella with a little laugh
yes yes he says and puts his hand on the arm that rests on the
seat you must be careful indeed you must my darling i will go and
get you a
blanket and a suit of sables broke in the old man with good
humorous banter allow me i am young and full of energy and you are
old and wasted and wearied watching over a sick and perhaps dying
girl who eats three huge meals a day and can outwalk weston i will
go and he goes and leaves them stellas soft laughter following him
like music
leycester stands beside her looking down at her in silence for him
that rustic seat holds all that is good and worth having in life and
as he looks the passionate love that burns so steadily in his heart
glows in his eyes
for weeks for months he has watched herwatched her patiently as
nowwatched her from the shadow of death into the world of life
and though his eyes and the tone of his voice have spoken love often
and often he has so tutored his lips as to refrain from open speech
he knows the full measure of the shock which had struck her down
and in his great reverence and unfathomable love for her he has
restrained himself fearing that a word might bring back that terrible
past but now tonight as he sees the faint color tinting the clear
cheekssees the sunset light reflected in her bright eyeshis heart
begins to beat with that throb which tells of longsuppressed passion
clamoring for expression
maidenlike she feels something of what is passing through his mind
and a great shyness falls upon her she can almost hear her heart beat
wont you sit down she says at last in that little low murmuring
voice which is such sweet music in his ears and she moves her dress
to make room for him
he comes round and sinks in the seat beside her
can you not feel the breeze now he asks i wish i had brought a
wrap with me on the chance of your having forgotten it
she looks round at him with laughter in her eyes and on her lips
did you not hear what uncle said she asks dont you know that
he was laughing actually laughing at me when will you begin to
believe that i am well and strong and ridiculously robust dont you
see that the people at the hotel are quite amused with your solicitude
respecting my delicate state of health
i dont care anything about the people at the hotel he says in that
frank simple way which speaks so plainly of his love i know that i
dont mean you to catch cold if i can help it
youyou are very good to me she says and there is a slight tremor
in her voice
he laughs his old short curt laugh softened in a singular way
am i you might say that a man was particularly good because he
showed some concern for the safety of a particularly precious stone
her eyes droop and perhaps unconsciously her arm draws a little
nearer to him
you are good she says but i am not a precious stone by any means
you are all that is rare and precious to me my darling he says
you are all the world to me stella he stops alarmed lest he
should be alarming her but his arm slides round her and he ventures
to draw her nearer to him
it is the only embrace he has ventured to give her since that night
when she fell into his arms at the cottage door at carlyon and he half
fears that she will shrink from him in the new strange shyness that
has fallen upon her but she does not instead she lets her head droop
until it rests upon his breast and the strong mans passion leaps full
force and masterful in a moment
stella he murmurs his lips pressed to hers which do not swerve
may i speak will you let me you will not be angry
she does not look angry her eyes fixed on his have nothing but
submissive love in them
i have waitedit seems so longbecause i was afraid to trouble you
but i may speak now stella and he draws her closer to him will you
be my wifesoonsoon
he waits his handsome face eloquent in its entreaty and anxiety and
she leans back and looks up at him then her gaze falters a little
quiver hovers on her lips and the dark eyes droop
is it yes if so he alone could have heard it
my poor darling he murmurs and he takes her face in his hands and
turns it up to him oh my darling if you knew how i loved youhow
anxiously i have waited and it shall be soon stella my little wife
my very own
yes she said and as in the old time she raises herself in his
arms and kisses him
                                   
andand the countess and all of them she murmurs but with a
little quaint smile
he smiles calmly not tonight darling do not let us talk of the
outside world tonight but see if all of them as you put it are
not exactly of one mind one of them is and he takes out a letter
from his pocket
from lilian she says guessing instinctively
leycester nods
yes take it and read you will find your name in every line stella
it was this letter that gave me courage to speak to you tonight a
woman knows a woman after allyou will read what she says are you
still afraid ley she writes ask her and i have asked and now
all the past will be buried and we shall be happy at last at last
stella wherewhere shall it be
she is silent but she lifts the letter to her lips and kisses it
what do you say to paris he asks
paris she echoes flushing
yes he says i have been talking to the old doctor and he thinks
you are strong enough to have a little excitement now and thinks that
a tour in paris would be the very thing to complete things what do
you say he goes on trying to speak in a matteroffact voice but
watching her with eager eyes if we start at the end of the week that
will give you time to make your preparations wont it
oh no no
then say the beginning of next he returns magnanimously and we
will be married about wednesdayshe utters a faint exclamation and
turns pale and red by turns but he is steadfastand then we can have
a gay time of it before we settle down
settle down she says with a little longing sigh how sweet it
soundsbut next week
it is a cruel time to wait he declares drawing her nearer to him
cruelnext week it is months years ages
hush she says struggling gently away from him here is uncle
it is uncle but he is innocent of wraps
going to stay out all night he asks with fine irony
why where are the wraps demands leycester
eh oh nonsense says the old man do you want to commit suicide
together by suffocation its as warm as an oven oh for my little
garden and the cool room
you shall have it in a week or two says leycester with a smile of
ineffable satisfaction we are going to take you to paris and then
will come and stay with you
oh will you and who asked you mr jackanapes
why you wouldnt refuse shelter to your nieces husband retorts
leycester laughing
oh thats it says the old man allow me to wish you goodnight
ill leave you to your midsummer madnessno to your autumn wisdom
for upon my word its the most sensible word ive heard you utter for
months past
and he goes but before he goes he lays his hand upon the sleek head
and whispers
thats a good girl now be happy
                                   
they were married in paris very quietly very happily lord charles
came over from scotland leaving the grouse and the salmon to act
as best man and it was an open question which of the two men looked
happiesthe or the bridegroom lord charles had never heard of that
forged note and his inadvertent share in the plot that had worked so
much harm and he never would hear of it and furthermore he never
quite understood how it was that stella etheridge and not lady lenore
became leycesters wife but he was quite satisfied and quite assured
that it was the best of all possible arrangements
leycesters the happiest man in the world and he used to be the most
wretched and so theres an end of it he declared whenever he spoke
of the match and he would add the man who could have the moral
cheek to be anything but absurdly happy with such an angel as lady
stella wouldnt be fit to be anywhere out of a lunatic asylum
they were married and charlie went back to the grouse and the painter
went back to the cottage and mrs penfold leaving the young couple to
have their gay time of it in the gayest city of the world it was not
particularly gay after all but it was ecstatically joyous they went
to the theaters and concerts and enjoyed themselves like boy and girl
and leycester found himself continually amazed at the youthfulness
which remained in him
i have begun to live for the first time he declared one day i only
existed before
as for stella the days went by in a sort of ecstatic dream and only a
little cloud lined the golden skythe earl and countess still hardened
their hearts
though not a week passed without bringing a letter full of love
and longing from lilian the old people made no sign in the proud
countess eyes her sons wife was still stella etheridge the painters
niece and she could not forgive her formaking leycester happy it
would have made stella miserable if anything could have done so but
leycesters love and watchful care often kept the cloud backfor a
time
they stayed in paris until a little bijou place in park lane was ready
then they went home and took quiet possession
it was the most charming of little nestsleycester had given jackson
and graham carte blancheand formed a fitting casket for the
beautiful young viscountess
after all ley she said as she sat upon his knee on their first
evening and looked round her exquisite room it is almost as good as
the little laborers cottage i used to picture for myself
yes it only needs that i should sit in my shirt sleeves and smoke a
long pipe doesnt it he said laughing
for some weeks they did almost lead an isolated life they were always
together never tired or wearied of each other of stella with her
exquisite variety with her ever changing mirth and rare delicate
wit it would certainly have been difficult for any man to tire and
what woman would have wearied of the devoted attention of such a man
as leycester they lived quietly for a little time but as the season
commenced people got scent of them and soon the world swooped down
upon them
stella protested at first but she was powerless to resist and
soon the names of lord and lady trevor appeared in the fashionable
lists then came a surprise like lord byron she woke one morning to
find herself famous the world had pronounced her a beauty and had
elected her to one of its thrones men almost fought for the honor of
inserting their names upon her ballcards women copied her dress
and envied her the photographers would have hung her portraits in
their windows if she had not been too wary to have one taken she had
become a reigning queen leycester did not mind he knew her too well
to be afraid that it would spoil her and it amused him to find that
the world was rowing in the same boat with himhad gone mad over his
little stella
now it was a gay time but still the countess made no sign the
wyndwards were away on the continent in the winter and in the spring
they went down to the hall letters came from lilian regularly and she
grew more pathetic as time rolled on she was pining for leycester
stella urged him to sink his pride and go down to the hall but he
would not
where i go i take my wife he said in his quiet way and stella knew
that it was useless to urge him
but one day when it chanced that stella was at home resting after a
grand ball at which she had reigned supreme a brougham drove up to
the door and while she was just preparing to say not at home the
servant opened the door of the boudoir and there stood the tall
graceful ladylike figure of lilian
stella sprang forward and caught her in her arms with a cry that
brought leycester bounding upstairs
the two girls clung to each other for at least five minutes crying
softly and uttering little piteous monosyllables after the manner of
their kind then lilian turned to leycester
oh ley dont be angry ive come she cried
so i see lil he said kissing her and how glad we are i need not
say
and she shall never go again shall she exclaimed stella with her
arm round the fragile form
why i dont mean to said lilian piteously you wont send me
away will you stella i cant live without him i cant indeed you
will let me stay wont you i shant be in the way ill creep into a
corner and efface myself and i shant be very much trouble because i
am so much stronger now andoh you will let me stay
there is no need to set down in hard cold black letters their answer
there is only one thing more i want to make my happiness complete
said stella and they knew that she meant the reconciliation of
leycester with the old people
so lilian stayed and made an additional sunshine and joy in the little
house and it amused leycester to see how soon she too fell at the feet
of the new beauty and worshipped her
if any one could be too good for you ley she said stella would be
that one
well time passed the season was at its height and the countess came
to town the earl had been in his place in the upper house from the
beginning of the season of course but the countess had remained at
the hall nursing her disappointment she came up in time for one of
the state balls at which her presence was indispensable it was the
great official ball of the season and crowded to excess the countess
arrived with the earl just before the small hours and after the usual
ceremonies and exchanges of salutations with the great world which she
had left for so many months she had time to look round the room she
did so with a little inward tremor for she knew that leycester and
his wife were to be present to her reliefand disappointmentthey
had not arrived for all her pride and hauteur the mothers heart ached
but if they were not there their reputation had preceded them she
heard stellas name every five minutes heard the greatest in the land
regretting her absence and wondering what kept her away
presently toward two oclock there was a perceptible stir in the
magnificent salon and the murmur went up
lord and lady trevor
the countess turned pale for a moment then looked toward the door
and saw a beautiful womanor a girl stillentering leaning upon
leycesters arm society does for a man or woman what a lapidary does
for a precious stone it was precious when it first came into his
hands but when it leaves them it is polished stella had become if
the word is allowable when applied to her the pink of refinement and
delicacy polished she had learnt unconsciously to wear diamonds
and that with princes as she came in now a crowd of the best people
came round her and did homage and the countess looking on saw with
her own eyes what she had heard rumored that this daughterinlaw of
hers this penniless niece had become a power in the land it amazed
her at first but as she watched she lost her wonder it was only
natural and reasonable there was no more beautiful or noble looking
woman in the room
the band began to play a waltz the crowds began to move dancing and
promenading the countess sat amongst the dowagers pale and smiling
but with an aching heart where was leycester presently four persons
approached her charlie with stella on his arm leycester with another
lady suddenly not seeing her charlie stopped and stella turning
found herself face to face with the countess
for a moment the proud woman melted then she hardened her heart and
turned her head aside
leycester who been been watching passed in front of her and he put
his hand out
leycester
but he drew stellas arm within hisshe was white and tremblingand
looking his mother in the face sternly passed on with stella
take me home leycester she moaned oh take me home how can she
be so cruel
but he would not
no he said this is your place as much as hers my poor mother i
pity her oh pride pride you must stay
of course the incident had been noticed and remarked and amongst the
persons who had seen it was a prince of the blood
this distinguished individual was not only a prince but a
gentlehearted man and as princes can take things as they please he
disregarded the best name on his ball programme and walking straight up
to stella begged with that grand humility which distinguishes him for
the honor of her hand
stella pale and beautifully pathetic in her trouble faltered an
excuse an excuse to a royal command
but he would not take it
a few turns only lady trevor i implore i will take care of her
leycester he added in a murmur and he led stella away
they took a few turns then he stopped
you are tired he said will you let me take you into the cool
he drew her arm through his but instead of taking her into the cool
as he phrased it in his genial way he marched straight up to the
countess
lady wyndward he said and his clear musical voice was just audible
to those around your daughter has been too gracious to her devoted
adherents and tired herself in the mazy dance i resign her to your
maternal care
stella would have shrunk back but the countess who knew what was due
to royalty rose and took the fair round arm in her matronly one
come she said his royal highness is rightyou must rest
all in a dream stella allowed herself to be led into a shaded recess
all fresh with ferns and exotica then she woke and murmuring
thank you was for flying but the countess held out her arms
suddenly and for the first timewell for many yearsburst into
tears not noisy sobbing but quiet flooding tears
oh my dear she murmured brokenly forgive me i am only a proud
wicked old woman
stella was in her arms in an instant and thus leycester found them
when old lady longford heard of this scene she was immensely amused in
her cynical way
it would have served you right my dear she told the countess if
she had turned round and said yes you are a very wicked old woman
and walked off
so stellas cup of happiness was full to the brim
it is not empty yet and will not be while love stands with upraised
hand to replenish it
she is a girl still even now that there is a young leycester to run
about the old mans studio and upset the pictures and add to the
litter and it is the old painters oft expressed opinion that she will
be a girl to the end of the chapter
stella you see he is fond of remarking whenever he hears her
sweet voice carolling about the little cottageand it is as often
heard there as at the hallstella you see was born in italy and
italiansgood italiansnever grow old they manage to keep a heart
alive in their bosoms and laughter on their lips at a period when
people of colder climes are gloomy and morosely composing their own
epitaphs there is one comfort for you leycester you have got a wife
who will never grow old
the end
great stories by a great author
the new fiction series
issued quarterly
letters of congratulation have been showered upon us from all over the
country by enthusiastic readers who say that had we not announced that
mr cook wrote all of these stories it would have been very difficult
to determine it
the reason is that mr cook is a widely traveled man and has
therefore been enabled to lay the plot of one of his stories in the
land of little rain another on the high seas another in spain and
spanish america and to write a railroad story that a reader of thirty
years experience decided must have been written by a veteran railroad
man if stories of vigorous adventure are wanted stories that are
drawn true to life and give that thrill which all really good fiction
ought to give the books listed here are what you want
 all titles always in print
