preliminary revision of the north american species
of cactus anhalonium and lophophora
prefatory note
in the fall of 1890 dr george vasey then botanist of the
department of agriculture arranged with me to prepare a revision
of north american cactaceae  owing to the peculiar difficulty of
preserving material the family was poorly represented even in
our leading herbaria  to secure a large amount of additional
material in the way of specimens and field notes the department
authorized me to visit the region of the mexican boundary during
the summer of 1891  preliminary to this exploration it was
necessary to examine the engelmann collection of cactaceae in
the possession of the missouri botanical garden  this
collection supplemented by the continual additions made at the
garden is by far the largest collection of skeletons and living
specimens in this country and also contains the large majority
of our types
in march 1891 i visited this collection and made such notes as
seemed necessary for use in the field and in june accompanied
by mr w h evans and mr g c nealley i began field work in
the neighborhood of el paso tex  after ten days of exploration
it was necessary for me to leave the field work in charge of mr
evans who with mr nealley continued work westward during
july and a part of august to southern california along the
southern pacific railway  as a result a large number of complete
plant bodies was secured but very few of them were in flower and
the field notes indicated little besides collection stations
during the following fall and winter preliminary determinations
of this material were made by mr evans
in the fall of 1892 critical study of this and other collections
was begun in connection with my assistants dr elmon m fisher
and mr edwin b uline who have ever since rendered constant and
most import assistance in the examination of material and
bibliography which alone has made the work possible in the midst
of other pressing duties
in the spring of 1893 these two gentlemen spent several weeks at
the missouri botanical garden in the critical study of its rich
material and during the latter part of their stay i assisted in
the work  dr william trelease the director of the garden had
hastened the arrangement of the engelmann material and had
mounted in convenient form the large mass of notes left by dr
engelmann  these notes contained not only critical remarks upon
known species but also the diagnoses of many unpublished species
which had come into his hands notably those collected by mr
william gabb in 1867 in lower california  the collections that
have thus far been studied are
1 those of the missouri botanical garden and thanks are
especially due to dr trelease for his generous cooperation in
the use of this material without which the work would have been
impossible
2 those of the department of agriculture including the results
of several recent explorations for the use of which i am
indebted to mr frederick v coville
3 those of the gray herbarium at harvard university which dr
b l robinson kindly placed at my disposal
4 those of the california academy of sciences notably rich in
forms from lower california and the adjacent islands kindly
loaned by mr t s brandegee
5 those of dr louis eschanzier of san luis potosi mexico
who send a large series of mexican forms collected in 1891
6 numerous small sets from different correspondents who have
given both time and material in aiding the work
it is needless to say that dr george engelmann the great
pioneer student of this difficult family has opened the paths in
which we must follow and it was exceedingly unfortunate that he
was not able to complete the final revision that he had in mind
the difficulties which beset the critical study of this group can
not be easily exaggerated  such scanty material as has been
collected has been for the most part very incomplete consisting
of plant bodies without flower or fruit flower or fruit without
plant bodies and bunches of spines without either  the species
are displayed also in the most inaccessible regions and their
culmination is found in the still poorly known regions of mexico
on account of their singular forms and often brilliant flowers
they have long been extensively cultivated especially in europe
these cultivated forms have formed the basis of original
descriptions in almost all of the european publications and in
very rare cases have any types been preserved  as a result the
bibliography of cactaceae is appalling and it is questionable
whether satisfactory conclusions can be reached in the case of
hundreds of published names  the earlier descriptions were not
only meager but were based upon what are now regarded very
insufficient characters and in the absence of types it is not
only unsafe but impossible to venture an opinion concerning
their identity  in view of these facts i have thought it
advisable to present a preliminary revision of the order which
shall contain the results of the study of material confessedly
insufficient  with such knowledge as we possess brought
together it is hoped that the study of this very interesting and
much neglected group will be stimulated and that more critical
exploration of our southwestern territory and adjacent mexico
will make a more satisfactory presentation possible  it would be
useless to notice the vast number of reputed species that are not
represented by actual specimens in our possession
in the proposed preliminary account of the family of which the
present paper is the first part only those genera are considered
which form a part of the flora of the united states and those
species which i have been able to examine and to identify with
reasonable certainty  all forms credited to the united states
have been studied and the account of these species may be
considered fairly complete but the far more numerous mexican
species are but scantily represented  the mexican boundary is so
unnatural a dividing line in the distribution of cactaceae that
it has been disregarded and all the species studied have been
arranged in a lineal series of uniform prominence  so far as
known the subject of geographical distribution is considered but
it will be seen how meager is our knowledge of this subject  it
is to be hoped that this preliminary presentation will provoke
exploration and study and that species will not only be
collected but all the facts of their distribution noted  it is
more than probable that our present notion of species in this
group must be much modified and doubtless many forms are at
present kept specifically distinct which will prove to be but
different phases of a single species
in the matter of generic delimitation we are in still greater
uncertainty and several generic lines at present recognized must
be regarded as purely arbitrary a fact which must become still
more evident with additional material  the whole group is to be
regarded as made up of poorly differentiated forms and only long
observation under cultivation can determine the possibilities of
specific variation under the influence of environment of age of
inherent tendencies  for instance that these plants change in
form and in spine characters with increasing age and after they
have begun to flower can not be doubted but what described forms
have thus been separated in descriptions can only be guessed at

the linnaean genus cactus of 1753 included 22 species and was
coextensive with the present order  in 1812 the species were
separated by haworth into five genera the original generic name
cactus being discarded  among these species c mamillaris seems
to have stood as the type not only of the linnaean genus cactus
but also of haworths mamillaria and as such should retain the
original generic name  besides mamillaria was used as the
generic name of an alga in 1809  cactus mamillaris l is the

from one point of view the two sections of the genus
eumamillaria and coryphantha deserve generic separation for
the character of grooveless and grooved tubercles seems to hold
without exception and the sections are separated with more
certainty than are certain species of coryphantha and
echinocactus  if genera are simply groups of convenience the
separation should be made

the central spines are quite variable in number and arrangement
in case there are two they are vertically placed and are either
erect and parallel or widely divergent  even three centrals may
occur in the same vertical plane but more usually the three or
four centrals are arranged about a center and are widely
divergent  the tubercles are apt to persist and to become naked
and corky with age  the axillary wool and the capillary radials
are also apt to be more or less persistent thus giving the whole
plant a woolly appearance

dr engelmann regarded this species as possibly only a variety
of c heyderi to which it is certainly very closely allied
through var hemisphaerica but the different tubercles and
fewer stouter spines serve so well to distinguish it that it
seems best to retain its specific rank
in reference to the citation of the original description an
explanation seems necessary which will apply to numerous similar
cases  the pacif r rep iv 27 1856 syn cact 263

as the original publication  the confusion has arisen from the
fact that in both the publications of 1856 the description in the
rep mex bound is referred to and in that report the plant
is fully described as sp nov  however the publication of
the boundary report was long delayed on account of the
preparation of the plates and in the meantime both the
publications of 1856 had appeared in each one of which the
species is distinctly characterized and reference made to the

the plants densely covered above with delicate ashygray spines
and with naked tuberculate base are readily recognized  it still
remains an open question whether the flowers are developed from
the axils of tubercles of the same season or the last ones of the
preceding season  dr engelmann inclined to the latter view as
all the other characters of the plant associate it with the
lateralflowered species and in the absence of definite
observation we have retained it there  if the nearly central
flowers indicate that they are produced from growth of the same
season the species would seem to be allied to coryphantha in
which group its small flowers and small tubercles would be
anomalous

that it is impossible to separate sharply the variety from the

suggest differences that an examination of fruit and seed

in all references to the fruit of this species it is described as
oval and green except in ives report where dr engelmann
describes its real character as the ordinary fruit of
eumamillaria  the immature fruit is oval and green but with
maturity it becomes clavate and scarlet  the utah specimens of
parry show an exceptional character in their 30 to 33 scabrous
radial spines but otherwise they are quite normal  m
microcarpa engelm emorys rep 156 f 3 should be dropped as
a synonym of this species at least as to figure and description
in all probability cgrahami is one of the forms of the mexican
c schelhasii pfeiff  except that in c grahami the radial
spines are apt to be more numerous and longer and the centrals
much darker and in c schelhasii the 3 centrals seem to be
always present and sometimes all hooked the descriptions suggest
no difference  in the absence of authentic specimens of the
latter species however and with its fruit and seed entirely
unknown such a reference of c grahami must be deferred

in his notes mr gabb describes the flower as large 3 to 35
inches long bellshaped of a beautiful purplish red color
concerning which dr engelmann remarks this would indicate a
coryphanth but the tubercles show no trace of a groove and
moreover a withered remnant of a flower laterally attached say
18 to 20 mm long so that i have no doubt that mr gabbs
statement is founded on some error  it is very probable that
the flowers are scarlet and larger than dr engelmann suggests
the species is closely allied to c roseanus but differs in its
shorter tubercles and much longer spines  about a dozen stems
rise in a clump about a foot high covering an area of 2 or 3
feet  these two species represent a very distinct lower
californian group of cylindrical and hooked eumamillarias  both
probably have showy scarlet flowers and may attain considerable
length when growing upon rock ledges so as to become pendent

younger parts and show but a single long and hooked central  the
san borgia specimens show mostly 3 or 4 centrals the lowest one
hooked and becoming remarkably long and often variously twisted

may be due to age

obtained from the description of prince salmdyck in cact hort
dyck which seemed to indicate a smaller form with fewer spines
than the texan form  however when visiting the collections of
prince salmdyck dr engelmann found original specimens of c
scheerii which were exactly his var valida  so far as
collections show the texan form seems to be more robust than the
mexican but the material is too scanty to justify such a
generalization  dr engelmann speaks of this species as a
stately plant by far the largest of the northern mamillariae

even in the absence of the type i have ventured to refer
mamillaria pectinata engelm to this species  dr engelmann had
concluded that the two were not sufficiently distinct and the
examination of mexican forms which pass as c radians abundantly
confirms this conclusion  besides every character in the
original description of c radians applies exactly to these
mexican plants and to our texan specimens as well  aside from
the fact that the mexican specimens are apt to be more robust i
can discover no difference whatever for discussion of
relationships see under c scolymoides

afterwards reduced to a variety was based upon fewer radial
spines and no central  as the central is occasionally wanting in
connection with the most numerous radials and present with the
fewest such a form would have to be separated solely on the
absence of the central spine and even in the original
description of impexicoma the central spine is only said to be
sometimes wanting  it has been impossible for me to separate
the forms it should be said that the fruit and seed characters
given above were taken front a specimen whose few radials and no

specimens collected by mrs anna b nickels across the rio grande
from laredo texas and showing neither flower nor fruit seem to
intergrade between c scolymoides and c scolymoides sulcatus
the habit is that of the former the tubercles are those of the
latter while the spines are somewhat different from either  the
number of central spines in these specimens is very hard to
determine as on the adult tubercle they all assume a radial
position  the usual adult arrangement is an apparent absence of
central spines 10 to 12 rigid spreading and more or less
recurved radials increasing in length from the lowest which
are mostly white or the upper more or less dusky and above just
behind the radial row 2 or 3 stout recurvedascending spines
which are white with tips more or less reddishblack one of the
spines usually much stouter and longer than the others  this
form may represent a distinct species but it seems very unsafe
to add species to the c scolymoides group without the fullest
information
prince salmdyck refers c scolymoides to m daimonoceras lem
cact gen nov p 5 but no mention of such a name can be
found in the work referred to  labouret refers c corniferus to
the same name and reference  if m daimonoceras was anything
more than a garden or herbarium name used by lemaire i have been
unable to find it and dr engelmanns notes indicate that his
search met with the same result  it is possible that the name
was applied loosely to this assemblage of closely related forms
that seem to cluster about c corniferus
a most perplexing question of relationship is presented by the
forms that have been called pectinatus scolymoides sulcatus
calcaratus echinus and the mexican forms radians
impexicomus corniferus  it may be that they are all merely
varieties of one strong polymorphic type but our knowledge of
corniferus is so incomplete and material of other forms is so
scanty that i can not venture to make such an assertion
however it seems probable that radians pectinatus scolymoides
sulcatus and echinus all have green fruit while in impexicomus
and corniferus it is red  it has also seemed proper to merge
radians and pectinatus also impexicomus and corniferus and to
refer sulcatus to scolymoides as a variety  these seven forms
are thus reduced at least to four species

this species shows an interesting transition from coryphantha to
echinocactus  the woolly groove of the coryphantha extends from
the spinebearing areola to the axil of the tubercle where it
expands into the flowerbearing areola  in c macromeris the
groove extends only about half way down the tubercle and gives
origin to the flowerbearing areola on the side of the tubercle
while in echinocactus the flowerbearing areola becomes adjacent
to the spinebearing areola and the flower appears at the summit
of the tubercle
artificial key to the species
it seems impossible to make a simple artificial key that will
serve as a useful guide to each individual species and variety
our knowledge of so many of the species is imperfect that no set
of characters can be applied throughout  however as no plants
are collected in such fragmentary condition it will be useful to
construct a key based upon such characters as are always likely
to be present even if specific distinctions are not always
reached  in many cases species are so closely and differently
related to each other that the complete descriptions will have to
be consulted to determine the differences and in such cases the
artificial key can only indicate the group  even the full
descriptions are very compact all characters not necessary for
discrimination having been eliminated  no attempt need be made
to determine any species by means of the flowers alone  in most
cases more or less of the plant body will be available
presenting spine and tubercle characters and these are used in
the following key  the distinction between eumamillaria and
coryphantha on the basis of grooveless and grooved tubercles
should always be made out easily  it may be useful to suggest as
a caution however that often tubercles in drying develop folds
which simulate grooves and especially is this true in
quadrangular tubercles  in such cases it is necessary to restore
the original plumpness of the tubercle by boiling before the
presence or absence of the groove can be definitely determined
the species and varieties are indicated only by their specific or
varietal names in the following key and the numbers refer to the
serial numbers of the synoptical presentation  forms occurring

               geographical distribution
it is only possible to deal with the forms that occur within the
borders of the united states as even individual stations of
common mexican forms are little if at all known  these united
states forms represent a northern extension of an abundant
mexican display  the group eumamillaria containing twelve of
the thirtyone forms defined as occurring north of the rio
grande makes the feeblest extension northward at no place being
found far from the boundary and all the twelve are mexican forms
which extend but slightly into the united states  only five of
the forms are found east of the pecos heyderi the most widely
distributed eumamillaria extending from the southeastern border
of texas westward along the whole mexican boundary except in
california hemisphaericus extending through southern texas and
southern new mexico meiacanthus also along the mexican border
of texas and new mexico texanus a low ground form of the rio
grande valley extending from the mouth of the river to el paso
and suggesting a connection with the west indian stellatus and
sphaericus another low ground valley form of similar range but
apparently only extending up the rio grande to the region of
eagle pass
the pecos forms the eastern boundary of five other eumamillaria
forms micromeris extending northward from coahuila and
chihuahua apparently only in the mountains between the pecos and
el paso wrightii of similar narrow northward extension but
ranging further northward on the high plains of the upper pecos
in new mexico denudatus also with a narrow northward extension
west of the pecos lasiacanthus extending from chihuahua with a
northern limit between the pecos and arizona and grahami a
sonoran type which has spread between the pecos and southeastern
california
the ten preceding forms have evidently entered our borders from
the highlands of sonora and chihuahua with the exception of the
rio grande valley forms texanus and sphaericus  another
species tetrancistrus is also a sonoran type which has reached
the eastern slopes of the mountains of southeastern california
and extended through western arizona to southern nevada and
southern utah the most extended northern range of any
eumamillaria  the twelfth form goodrichii is lower
californian and extends into california only in san diego
county  a summarized statement of the distribution of our twelve
eumamillaria would be that two of them have extended from the low
grounds of coahuila and chihuahua and spread along the valley of
the rio grande nine have come from the high grounds of chihuahua
and sonora four of which have extended eastward to the low
levels of southeastern texas four have kept to the highlands
west of the pecos and one has kept to the colorado valley and
its tributaries while one has a short northern extension from
lower california
the nineteen forms of coryphantha are decidedly more northern in
their distribution and are our characteristic representatives of
the genus cactus  ten of these however are but northern
extensions of mexican forms and six of the ten have simply that
tonguelike northern extension in the mountains between the pecos
and the upper rio grande above el paso viz dasyacanthus
tuberculosus scheerii which has also spread somewhat east of
the pecos and the three pectinate and closely related forms
radians echinus and scolymoides  of the four remaining mexican
forms macromeris is a low ground rio grande valley form
extending from above el paso well towards the lower rio grande
potsii just crosses the border in the neighborhood of laredo and
radiosus and neomexicanus have by far the greatest northern
extension stretching from sonora and chihuahua to southern utah
and central colorado and eastward to the guadalupe river of
texas
the nine remaining coryphanths are distinctly forms of the united
states occupying two wellmarked regions viz the northern
plains and the desert region of western arizona and adjacent
california nevada and utah  in the former region is found the
widespread viviparus which extends from the southern borders of
british america to the plains of eastern colorado and western
kansas and even crosses the rocky mountain divide into northern
idaho and northeastern washington and missouriensis which also
ranges from the high prairies of the upper missouri to the same
southern limit and is continued southward into texas in its
varieties similis and robustior
in the arizona desert region four distinct but closely allied
forms have become differentiated from the strong radiosus stock
viz arizonicus deserti alversoni and chloranthus all of
which might be regarded as distinct species  in southeastern
texas is found an isolated form sulcatus occurring between the
brazos and nueces rivers  that viviparus must be regarded as a
strong northern extension of the radiosus stock can not be
doubted as the low depressed cespitose northern form seems to
merge southward so gradually into the simple more robust ovate to
cylindrical forms of radiosus as to suggest the propriety of
regarding them all as specifically identical
the result of a closer inspection of the distribution of these
nearly related forms is worthy of note  c viviparus extends
from british america and the upper missouri to eastern colorado
and western kansas neomexicanus the form most nearly related
to viviparus extends from central colorado and southern utah
into mexico at the southeastern edge of this range begins
radiosus and extends eastward through southern texas from the
western edge of neomexicanus the form arizonicus extends
westward into southern california touching chloranthus at its
utah limit and at its california extension reaching alversoni
and deserti the latter of which extends northward into the
desert region of southeastern california and adjacent nevada
taking this type as of mexican origin it seems to have entered
the united states from sonora and chihuahua and to have spread
in three directions viz eastward through southern texas
westward and northwestward into southern california and southern
utah and northward to the head waters of the missouri and
british america though we would limit the northern extension of
the present specific type to central colorado and would regard
the still more northern forms as of the same origin but entitled
to specific rank
           2 anhalonium  lem cact gen nov 1839
depressed or flattened simple unarmed plants covered with
peculiar imbricated tubercles above and their scalelike remains
below tubercle with lower and upper parts very different lower
part comparatively thin and flat upper exposed part triangular
in outline and divergent very thick and hard the lower surface
smooth and keeled the upper surface plane or convex smooth or
tuberculate or variously fissured with a broad woolbearing
groove or simply a more or less evident tomentulose apical
areola spinebearing areola obsolete flowerbearing areola at
the summit of the lower pedunclelike portion of the very young
tubercle thus appearing axillary with reference to the exposed
part of the tubercle and bearing a dense penicellate tuft of
long soft hairs which conceals the lower part of the flower and
the entire fruit and persists about the apical region of the
plant as matted and apparently axillary wool ovary naked seeds
large black and tuberculate embryo obovate straight
according to the present views concerning generic limitations in
cactaceae anhalonium must certainly be kept distinct from
mamillaria and to such a view dr engelmann had finally come
the generic distinction is based upon such characters as 1 the
complete suppression of the spinebearing areolae 2 the strong
differentiation of the tubercles into two very distinct regions
3 the production of the flower at the apex of the basal or
pendunclelike portion which becomes flattened and expanded at
maturity of a very young tubercle and 4 the large tuberculate
seeds
in the case of engelmanni the broad woolly groove of the upper
portion of the tubercle expands below into the flowerbearing
areola but terminates blindly above just behind the sharp apex
in prismaticum and furfuraceum the groove is obliterated but
there usually remains a small more or less tufted areola and
depression just behind the apex to mark its upper extremity
this apical areola therefore does not represent a spinebearing
areola but the closed upper extremity of a tubercle groove
it seems evident that anhalonium is a much modified cactus and
that its affinity is with the coryphanths through such a species
as c macromeris in which the flower becomes extraaxillary  if
in macromeris with the flower standing well up on the tubercle
the portions of the tubercle above and below the flower should
become very different from each other the upper portion being so
much modified as to cause the spinebearing areola to be
obliterated the condition of things in anhalonium would be
obtained

very closely related to prismaticum but triangular portion of
tubercle acuminate and shorter having an irregularly mamillate
upper surface and the acumination ending abruptly in a
cartilaginous depression containing a tomentose pulvillus
flowers 25 to 3 cm long white or pinkish the sepals brownish
type pringle 2580 in gray herb

specimens examined coahuila pringle 2580 of 1889
the type of this species was not among the collections received
from cambridge but a specimen of the same distribution from the
national herbarium shows tubercle dimensions different from those
recorded in dr watsons description  in that description the
triangular terminal surface is said to be about an inch broad by
onehalf inch which is decidedly different from the equilateral
surface of the tubercle of prismaticum  in the national
herbarium specimen of furfuraceum however of the same
distribution the surface is almost equilateral measuring 15 mm
long by 18 mm wide at base  without the acuminate upper portion
the breadth of the triangular portion would be about double its
length  the lower rim of the cuplike depression which
terminates the tubercle and contains the pulvillus is sometimes
slightly prolonged into a tooth which in prismaticum becomes the
sharp tip of the tubercle  the minutely
furfuraceouspunctulate character of the tubercle is common to
all the species of anhalonium i have seen and simply represents
the external openings of the remarkably long cuticular
passageways to the stomata

this seems to be a third grooveless mexican species  i have seen
no specimens but judge from the description that it differs from
the two preceding species chiefly in its less crowded and more
elongated tubercles triangular portion 5 cm long by 25 cm
broad at base which are covered at apex with a tomentose
pulvillus
                    geographical distribution
this curious genus is strictly mexican and so far as at present
recorded is characteristic of coahuila but a single species

the great bend
                      3 lophophora  gen nov
depressedglobose proliferous and cespitose tuberculateribbed
unarmed plants tubercles at first conical and bearing at summit
a flowerbearing areola with a dense tuft or short pencil of
compact erect hairs when mature becoming broad and rounded with
the remnant of the penicellate tuft as a persistent pulvillus in
a small central depression and coalescing into broad convex
vertical ribs spine bearing areolae obsolete flowers borne at
the summit of nascent tubercles ovary naked that is free from
scales but often downy fruit and seed unknown
these forms have been variously referred to anhalonium and
echinocactus but seem to deserve generic distinction  they
differ from anhalonium in the entire suppression of the upper
highly differentiated portion of the tubercle in the broad and
rounded development of the lower portion and in the coalescence
of the enlarged tubercles into broad vertical ribs  in fact in
young specimens the plant appears almost smooth with shallow
furrows radiating from the depressed apex  the genus differs
from echinocactus in the suppression of the spinebearing
areolae and the naked ovary  in the examination of developing
tubercles the relation to anhalonium is evident  in the latter
genus the young tubercle bears on the summit of its pedicellike
lower portion the tufted flowerbearing areola the modified upper
portion of the tubercle at that time appearing as a bract beneath
the flower  in lophophora there is the same condition of things
except that the bractlike upper portion is wanting  from this
point of view it would appear that the differences between
lophophora and echinocactus are intensified by the fact that the
flowerbearing areola in the former genus is to be regarded as
really lateral on a tubercle the upper part of which has
disappeared  this genus occurs abundantly in southeastern texas
extending southward into mexico  mrs a b nickels reports that
the indians use the plants in manufacturing an intoxicating
drink also for breaking fevers and that the tops cut off and
dried are called mescal buttons
