preface
the editor of the theosophical forum in april 1901 noted the
death of mr thomas e willson in the previous month in an
article which we reproduce for the reason that we believe many
readers who have been following the chapters of ancient and
modern physics during the last year will like to know something
of the author  in these paragraphs is said all that need be said
of one of our most devoted and understanding theosophists
in march 1901 the theosophical forum lost one of its most
willing and unfailing contributors  mr te willson died
suddenly and the news of his death reached me when i actually
was in the act of preparing the concluding chapter of his
ancient and modern physics for the april number
like the swan who sings his one song when feeling that death is
near mr willson gave his brother coworkers in the theosophical
field all that was best ripest and most suggestive in his
thought in the series of articles the last of which is to come
out in the same number with this
the last time i had a long talk with te willson he said
for twenty years and more i was without a hearing yet my
interest and my faith in what i had to say never flagged the
eagerness of my love for my subject never diminished
this needs no comment  the quiet and sustained resistance to
indifference and lack of appreciation is truly the steady
ballast which has prevented our theosophical ship from aimless
and fatal wanderings though of inclement weather and adverse
winds we had plenty
for many long years mr willson was the librarian of the new york
world  in the afternoons he was too busy to see outsiders
but beginning with five oclock in the afternoon until he went
home somewhere in the neighbourhood of midnight he always was
glad to see his friends  he had a tiny little room of his own
very near the top of the tremendous building his one window
looking far above the roofs of the tallest houses in the
district  there he sat at his desk generally in his shirt
sleeves if the weather was at all warm always busy with some
matter already printed or going to be a quiet yet impressive
and dignified figure
the elevated isolation both figuratively and literally speaking
in which te willson lived and worked in the midst of the most
crowded thoroughfares of new york always made me think of
professor teufelsdrockh on the attic floor of the highest
house in the wahngasse  the two had more than one point of
resemblance  they shared the loftiness of their point of view
their sympathetic understanding of other folks their loneliness
and above all their patient even humorous resignation to the
fact of this loneliness
yet in his appearance mr willson was not like the great
weissnichtwo philosopher  in fact in the cast of his features
and in his ways mr willson never looked to me like a white man
in british india i have known brahmans of the better type exactly
with the same sallow complexion same quick and observant brown
eye same portly figure and same wideawakeness and agility of
manner
last summer i heard on good authority that mr willson had
thought himself into a most suggestive way of dealing with the
problems of matter and spirit a way which besides being
suggestive bore a great resemblance to some theories of the same
nature current in ancient india  consequently mr willson was
offered for the first time in his life a chance of expressing
his views on matter and spirit in as many articles and in as
extensive a shape as he chose  the way he received this tardy
recognition of the fact that he had something to say was highly
instructive  he did not put on airs of unrecognized greatness
though i own the occasion was propitious  he did not say i
told you so  he simply and frankly was glad in the most
childlike way
and now that i have used the word it occurs to me that
childlike is an adjective the best applied to this man in
spite of his portliness and his three score and more winters
many a pleasant hour i have spent in the small bookroom of the
great world building  with mr willson talk never flagged  we
discussed the past and the future of our planetary chain we
built plans for the true and wholesome relation of sexes we
tried to find outand needless to say never didthe exact
limit where matter stopped being matter and became spirit  we
also read the latest comic poems and also from time to time we
took a header into the stormy sea of american literature in order
to find out what various wise heads had to say consciously or
unconsciously in favour of our beloved theosophical views  and
all this being interrupted every three minutes or so by some
weary apparition from some workroom in the world with some such
question  mr willson how am i to find out the present
whereabouts of this or that russian manofwar  mr willson
what is the melting point of iron  mr willson when was hms
pinafore produced for the first time etc etc  and every
time mr willson got up in the leisurely manner peculiar to him
reached for some book from the shelves that lined the room gave
the desired information and as leisurely returned to the pranic
atom or to come and talk man talk willy or to whatever our
subject chanced to be at the time
mr willsons gratitude to the theosophical forum for its
recognition was disproportionately great  as he wrote to the
editor  give me any kind of work writing for you reviewing
manuscript or proof reading i shall do anything i shall
undertake any job even to taking editorial scoldings in all good
nature only give me work  his devotion to theosophical thought
and work in all their ramifications was just as great as was his
freedom from vanity his perfectly natural and unaffected
modesty
at the news of his death many a heart was sincerely sad but none
so sad as the heart of the editor of the theosophical forum  for
a friend and coworker like te willson ever ready to give
material help and moral encouragement is not easily replaced
for a soul so pure of any kind of selfishness the transition from
the turmoil of life to the bright dreams of death must have been
both easy and enviable

chapter one
the physical basis if metaphysics
the hindu system of physics on which the metaphysical thought of
the east is based does not in its beginnings differ widely from
the latest physics of the west  but it goes so much farther that
our physics is soon lost sight of and forgotten  the hindu
conception of the material universe taken from the upanishads
and some open teaching will serve for an illustration  they
divide physical matter into four kindsprakriti ether prana
and manasawhich they call planes  these differ only in the
rate of vibration each plane vibrating through one great octave
with gulfs of lost octaves between  the highest rate of
vibration of prakriti is measured by the thousand the lowest of
the ether by trillions and the lowest of prana bynever mind
they have and we have not the nomenclature
the earth they teach is a globe of prakriti floating in an
ocean of ether which as it has the sun for its center of
gravity must necessarily be a globe  this etheric sunglobe has
a diameter of over 300000000000 miles  all the planets
revolve around the sun far within its atmosphere  the etheric
sunglobe revolves on its axis once in about 21000 years and
this revolution causes the precession of the equinoxes  this
etheric sunglobe is revolving around alcyone with other etheric
globes having suns for their centers and solar systems of
prakritic globes within them in a great year of 5640000000 of
our common years  its orbit has a diameter of
93000000000000000 miles
beyond the etheric globes and between them is a third form of
matter called prana as much rarer and finer than the ether as
the ether is rarer and finer than prakriti  as this prana has
alcyone for a center of gravity it is necessarily a globe  and
there are many of these pranic globes floating in a vast ocean of
manasaa form of matter as much finer than prana as prana is
finer than ether or ether than prakriti  with this manasa
which is a globe the material or physical universe ends  but
there are spiritual globes beyond  the material universe is
created from manasa downward but it does not respond to or
chord with the vibration of the globes above except in a special
instance and in a special way which does not touch this inquiry
the physical universe of the ancient and modern hindu physicist
was made up of these four kinds or planes of matter distributed
in space as globes within globes
professor lodge in 1884 put forth the theory that prakriti
physical matter as we call it was in its atoms but whirls of
ether  since then speculative science has generally accepted the
idea that the physical atom is made up of many cubic feet of
ether in chemical union as many quarts of oxygen and hydrogen
unite chemically to make a drop of water  this is an old story
to the hindu sage  he tells his pupils that the great globe of
manasa once filled all space and there was nothing else
precisely as on this earth we have our elementary substances that
change from liquids into solids and gases so on this manasic
globe there were elementary substances that took the form of
liquids solids and gases  its manasic matter was differentiated
and vibrated through one octave as the prakritic matter does on
the earth  its substances combined as that does
one combination produced prana  the prana collected and formed
globes  on these pranic globes the process was repeated with
ether as the result and the etheric globes formed  then the
process was repeated on the etheric globes as the modern
scientists have discovered and prakriti and prakritic globes
came into being
the true diameter of the earth the ancient hindu books say is
about 50000 miles  that is to say the true surface of the
earth is the line of twentyfourhour axial rotation  the line
where gravity and apergy exactly balance  where a moon would
have to be placed to revolve once in 86400 seconds  within that
is prakriti  without is ether  it is also the line of no
friction which does exist between matter of different planes
there is friction between prakriti between ether between prana
but not between ether and prana or ether and prakriti  friction
is a phenomenon confined to the matter of each plane separately
we live at the bottom of this gaseous oceanon its floor
21000 miles from the surface and only 4000 miles from the
center  here in a narrow skin limited to a few miles above
and below us is the realm of phenomena where solid turns into
liquid and liquid into gas or vice versa  the lesson impressed
upon the pupils mind by hindu physics is that he lives far
within the earth not on it
there is a comparatively narrow skin of and for phenomena
within the etheric sunglobe say the eastern teachers where the
etheric solids liquids and gases meet and mingle and
interchange  within this skin are all the planetsthe
gaseous atmosphere of the etheric globe stretching millions of
miles beyond the outermost planetary orbit  the earth is in this
skin or belt of etheric phenomena and its ether is in touch with
the ether in manifestation on the etheric globe  the sun and
other etheric globes are within the corresponding skin of
phenomena of the pranic globes  the prana manifesting as solid
liquid and gas or in combination and in forms is in perfect
touch with that of the etheric globe and through that with the
prana of the earth  that our prana is in touch with that on the
pranic globe in all its manifestations means much in metaphysics
the same is true of the manasic globe and of our manasa
the great lesson the eastern physics burns into the pupil is that
we are living not only within the prakritic earth but within
each of the other globes as well in identically the same way and
subject to the same laws  our lives are not passed on one globe
but in four globes  it is as if one said he lived in buffalo
erie county new york united states  that he was a citizen of
each and subject to the laws of each
this question of the four globes of the four planes of matter
of the four skins and of the four conditions or states of all
matter and necessarily of all persons from the purely material
standpoint is not only the foundation of oriental physics but
the very essence of oriental metaphysicsits startingpoint and
cornerstone  to one who carries with him consciously or
unconsciously the concrete knowledge of the physics the
abstract teaching of the metaphysics presents no difficulty  it
is as clear as crystal  but without the physical teaching the
metaphysical is not translatable
our western physics teaches that physical matter is divided into
two kinds prakriti commonly called physical matter and ether
that the differences of each of the elementary prakritic
substances iron copper sulphur oxygen are in their
molecules the fundamental atom being the same  that each of
these elementary substances vibrates only through one octave
though on different keys  that it changes from solid to liquid
and gas as the rate of vibration is increased and from gas to
liquid and solid as its vibration is decreased within its octave
that the ether obeys identical laws  that it has elementary
substances vibrating through one octave only and that these are
solids liquids or gases on the etheric plane as prakriti is on
this  that these etheric substances change and combine in every
way that prakriti does  and that while all our prakritic
substances vibrate within say fifty simply octaves the lowest
vibration of etheric matter begins over one thousand octaves
beyond our highest making a gulf to leap  the eastern physics
presents this with a wealth of detail that dazes the western
student and then adds  but beyond the etheric plane or
octave of vibration for matter there is a third plane or
octave of vibration called prana and beyond that a fourth called
manasa  what is true of one plane is true of the other three
one law governs the four  as above so below  there is no real
gulf  there is perfect continuity
the western scientist teaches as the foundation of modern physics
that each and every atom of prakritic matter is the center of an
etheric molecule of many atoms  that no two prakritic atoms
touch although their etheric envelopes or atmospheres do touch
and that all physical phenomena are caused by the chording
vibration of the prakritic atom and its envelope of ether each
sounding the same note hundreds of octaves apart  the solid
earth with its atmosphere represents the atom with its ether
as all the oxygen and hydrogen do not combine to make the drop of
water some remaining in mechanical union to give it an
atmosphere and about onefourth of its bulk being gas so the
atom formed of the ether does not use all the ether in its
chemical union retaining some in mechanical union for its
envelope or atmosphere
the hindu physics goes much farther along this road  it says
that when the pranic globes were formed each atom of prana had
its manasic envelopewas the center of a manasic molecule
when the etheric globes formed each atom of ether was the center
of a pranic molecule each atom of which was surrounded with
manasa  when the prakriti was formed from the ether each and
every atom of prakriti had the triple ethericpranicmanasic
envelope  each and every prakritic atom is the center of an
etheric molecule says our western science  but that of the
east adds this  and each atom of that etheric molecule is the
center of a pranic molecule and each atom of prana in that
pranic molecule is the center of a manasic molecule  the four
great globes of matter in the material universe are represented
and reproduced in each and every atom of prakriti which is in
touch with each one of the four globes and a part of it  the
same is true of any aggregation of prakritiof the earth itself
and of all things in it including man  as there are four
atoms in each one so there are four earths four globes
consubstantial one for each of the four elements and in touch
with it  one is formed of prakritic atomsthe globe we know
another of the ether forming their envelopes  another of the
prana envelopes of ether and a fourth of the manasa around the
pranic atom  they are not skins  they are consubstantial
and what is true of atoms or globes is true of animals  each has
four material bodies with each body on the corresponding globe
whether of the earth or of the universe  this is the physical
basis of the famous chain of seven globes that is such a
stumblingblock in hindu metaphysics  the spirit passes through
four to get in and three to get outseven in all  the hindu
understands without explanation  he understands his physics
the hindu physics teaches with ours that the ether is the
source of all energy but it adds as prana is the source of
all life and manasa of all mind
when the prakritic atom is vibrating in chord with its etheric
envelope say our textbooks we have physical phenomena
light heat electricity  yes says the hindu teacher  but
when the atom and its ether and its prana are vibrating in chord
we have life and vital phenomena added to the energy  when the
atom and its ether prana and manasa are vibrating in chord we
have mind and mental phenomena added to the life and energy
each atom has energy life and mind in posse  in the living
leaf the prakriti ether and prana are sounding the threefold
silver chord of life  in the animal the manasa is sounding the
same note with them making the fourfold golden chord of mind
  even in the plant there may be a faint manasic overtone for
the potentiality of life and mind is in everything  this unity
of the physical universe with the physical atom and with all
things createdearth animal or crystalis the physical
backbone of oriental metaphysics  prakriti ether prana and
manasa are in our vernacular the earth air fire and water of
the old philosophersthe four elements
the oriental physics has been guarded most jealously  for many
thousands of years it has been the real occult and esoteric
teaching while the oriental metaphysics has been open and
exoteric  it could not be understood without the key and the
key was in the physics known only to the tried and approved
disciple  a little has leaked outenough to whet the appetite
of the true student and make him ask for more
chapter two
the two kinds of perception
to the savage matter appears in two formssolid and liquid
as he advances a step he learns it has three formssolid
liquid and gas  he cannot see the gas but he knows it is there
a little further on he learns that matter as he knows it is only
a minute portion of the great universe of matterthe few chords
that can be struck on the five strings of his senses and limited
to one octave or key
whether the particular matter he investigates has a solid a
liquid or a gaseous form depends upon its rate of vibration  if
it is a liquid by raising its rate of vibration one third it
becomes a gas  by reducing it one third it becomes a solid
each kind of matter has vibration only through one octave  it is
known to us only by its vibration in that octave  each kind of
matter has a different octaveis set on a higher or lower key
so to speak but all octaves of vibration are between the highest
of hydrogen gas and the lowest of carbon
in mechanical compounds such as air or brass the rate of
vibration of the compound is the least common multiple of the two
or more rates  in chemical compounds such as water or alcohol
the rate is that of the highest the others uniting in harmonic
fractions
all matter as we know it through our sensesprakriti as it is
called in the secret doctrine to distinguish it from nonsensual
matteris the vibration of an universal something we do not
know what through these different octaves  the elementary
substances socalled are one and the same thingthis
somethingin different keys and chords of vibration  keys that
run into one another producing all sorts of beautiful harmonies
taking any one of these elements or any of their compounds all
we know of it is limited strictly to its changes during vibration
through one octave  what happens when the vibration goes above
or below the octave has not yet been treated hypothetically
while some elements are vibrating on higher and some on lower
keys we can consider them all as vibrating within one great
octave that octave of the universal something which produces
sensual matter or prakriti
but matter is not confined we know to this great octave
although our sensual knowledge of it is strictly confined to it
how do we know it
knowledge comes to us in two ways and there are two kinds of
knowledge
1 that which comes through our senses by observation and
experience  this includes reasoning from relation
2 that which comes through intuitionor as some writers
inaccurately say through the formal laws of thought
all the observation and experience of the rising and the setting
of the sun for a thousand centuries could only have confirmed the
first natural belief that it revolved daily around the earth
nor by joining this experience with other experiences could any
deduction have come from our reason that would have opposed it
not our reason but our intuition said that the sun stood still
and the earth revolved daily  the oldest books in existence tell
us that this axial revolution of the earth was not only known in
the very dawn of time but that it has been known to every race
except our own of european savages from before the time thought
was first transmitted by writing
ask the ablest living geographer or physicist to prove to you
that the earth revolves daily and he will reply that it would be
the job of his life  it can be done at great expense and great
labor but that is because we know the answer and can invent a
way of showing it not because there are any observations from
which a deduction would naturally follow
nearly if not all our great discoveries have come to us through
intuition and not from observation and experience  when we know
the lines on which to work when intuition has given us the key
then the observation and experience men prize so highly and the
reason they worship so devoutly will fill in the details  the
knowledge that flows from observation and the reasoning from the
facts it records is never more than relatively true it is
always limited by the facts and any addition to the facts
requires the whole thing to be restated  we never know all the
facts  seldom even the more important  and reason grasps only
details
lamarcks theory of evolution known to all asiatic races from
time immemorial was the intuitional and absolute knowledge that
comes to all men when they reach a certain stage of development
reason could never have furnished it from the facts as cuvier
proved in the great debate in the french academy in 1842 when he
knocked lamarck out for the time being because it did not
conform to the facts and did not follow from any relation of the
facts
darwins theory of the survival of the fittest in the struggle
for existence as an explanation of the origin of species was
from observation and experience  it was based on observed facts
but darwin was an evolutionista disciple of lamarck  he held
the key  he used the key  the value of darwins work does not
lie in his discovering that some bugs have been derived from
other bugs and that the intermediate bugs have died off  its
overwhelming value to mankind was in showing that work on the
theory of evolution was correct work and that the theory was
true  when the intuition of man points out the way the reason of
man can follow the path and macadam the road  it usually does
and claims all the credit for itself as the original discoverer
this knowledge through intuition is absolute and exact  it is
not relatively true  it is absolutely and invariably true  no
additional facts will ever modify it or require a restatement
when sir william hamilton based his logic on the dictum that all
knowledge is relative and only relatively true the proposition
was selfevidently false  it was in itself a statement of
absolute knowledge about a certain thing  it was in itself
knowledge that was not relative  all knowledge could not be
relative if this knowledge was not  this knowledge could not
be either absolute or relative without upsetting his whole
proposition for if relative then it was not always true
and if absolute then it was never true
sir william did not know the distinction between the two kinds of
knowledge and what he meant to say was that all knowledge
obtained by observation and experience is relative and only
relatively true
his knowledge of this relativity was not obtained by observation
or from reason  it could not possibly have been obtained in that
way  it came from intuition and it was absolute and exact  a
man may have absolute and exact knowledge and yet not be able to
put it into words that exactly express it to another  hamilton
had this knowledge  but it was not clearly formulated even in
his own mind  he had two separate and distinct meanings for the
word knowledge without being conscious of it
we have yet to coin a proper word to express what comes to us
through intuition  the old english word wisdom originally did
the old verb wis was meant what a man knew without being told
it as ken meant knowledge by experience  try and prove by
reason that a straight line is the shortest distance between two
points or that a part can never be greater than the whole and
your reason has an impossible task  you must take them for
axioms it says  you must take them because you wis them not
because you know ken them
intuitional knowledge must not be confounded with the relative
knowledge that flows through the reason  that if the sum of two
numbers is one and their difference is five the numbers are
minus two and plus three
the point cannot be too strongly enforced that there is a
distinction between the sources of what we know and that while
all we know through our sensations is only relatively true that
which we know from intuition is invariably and absolutely true
this is seen through a glass darkly in theology where intuition
is called inspiration and not differentiated from reason
the false notion that we can only learn by observation and
experience that the concept can never transcend the observation
that we can only know what we can prove to our senses has
wrought incalculable injury to progress in philosophy
because our sensual knowledge of matter begins and ends with
vibration in one octave it does not follow that this ends our
knowledge of it  we may have intuitional knowledge and this
intuitional knowledge is as susceptible to reason as if we had
obtained it by observation
the knowledge that comes through intuition tells us of matter
vibrating in another great octave just beyond our own which
science has chosen to name the etheric octave or plane  the
instant our intuition reveals the cause of phenomena our reason
drops in and tells us it is the chording vibration of the matter
of the two planesthe physical and ethericthat produces all
physical phenomena  it goes further and explains its variations
this knowledge of another octave or plane of matter comes from
the logical relations of matter and its physical phenomena  but
there was nothing in the observation or experience of mankind
that would have led us to infer from reason an etheric plane of
matter  it was revealed truth  but the flash of revelation
having once made the path apparent the light of reason carries
us through all the winding ways  our knowledge of the ether is
not guesswork or fancy any more than our geometry is because
it is based on axioms our reason cannot prove  in both cases the
basic axioms are obtained from intuition  the structural work
from reason  our knowledge of the ether may be as absolute and
exact as our knowledge of prakriti working on physical as we
work on geometrical axioms
the recognition of the two sources of knowledge the work of the
spirit within us and of the mind within us is absolutely
necessary to correctly comprehend the true significance of the
results of modern science and to accept the ancient
chapter three
matter and ether
it is not worthwhile translating homer into english unless the
readers of the translation understand english
it is not worthwhile attempting to translate the occult eastern
physics into the language of our western and modern physics
unless those who are to read the translation understand generally
and broadly what our own modern physics teach  it is not
necessary that they should know all branches of our modern
physics in all their minute ramifications  but it is necessary
that they should understand clearly the fundamental principles
upon which our scientific and technical knowledge of today rests
these fundamental principles have been discovered and applied in
the past fifty yearsin the memory of the living  they have
revolutionized science in all its departments  our textbooks on
chemistry light heat electricity and sound have had to be
entirely rewritten  and in many other departments notably in
medicine and psychology they have yet to be rewritten  our
textbooks are in a transition state each new one going a step
farther to make the change gradual from the old forms of belief
to the new so that even tyndalls textbook on sound is now so
antedated or antiquated that it might have been written in
darkest africa before the pyramids were built instead of twenty
years ago
all this change has flowed from the discovery of faraday that
there are two states or conditions of matter  in one it is
revealed by one of our five senses visible tangible smellable
tastable or ponderable matter  this is matter as we know it
it may be a lump of metal or a flask of gas
the second condition or state of matter is not revealed by either
of our five senses but by the sixth sense or intuition of man
this is the ethersupposed to be matter in a very rarefied
form which permeates all space  so rare and fine is this
matter that it interpenetrates carbon or steel as water
interpenetrates a sponge or ink a blotting pad  in fact each
atom of physical matterby which is meant matter in the first
conditionfloats in an atmosphere of ether as the solid earth
floats in its atmosphere of air
no two physical atoms touch said faraday  each physical atom
is the centre of an etheric molecule and as far apart from every
other atom as the stars in heaven from one another  this is
true of every form of physical matter whether it is a lump of
metal a cup of liquid or a flask of gas  whether it is a
bronze statue or a living man  a leaf a cloud or the earth
itself  each and every physical atom is the centre of an etheric
molecule made up of many atoms of the ether
this duality of matter was a wonderful discovery revolutionizing
every department of science  it placed man in actual touch with
the whole visible universe  the ether in a mans eye and in his
whole body reaches in one unbroken linelike a telegraph wire
from him to the sun or the outermost planet  he is not
separate and apart from space but a part of it  each physical
atom of his physical body is the centre of an etheric molecule
and he has two bodies as st paul said a visible physical and
an invisible etheric body  the latter in actual touch with the
whole universe
faraday went one step further  he demonstrated that all
physical phenomena come from the chording vibration of the
physical atom with the surrounding etheric atoms and that the
latter exercise the impelling force on the former  step into the
sunshine  the line of ether from the sun is vibrating faster
than the ether in the body but the higher impels the lower the
greater controls the lesser and soon both ethers are in unison
the physical atoms must coincide in vibration with their etheric
envelopes and the note is heat  step into the shade where
the ocean of ether is vibrating more slowly and the ether of the
body reduces its vibration  the ether is the origin of all
force and of all phenomena
this etheric matter follows identical laws with prakritic matter
or accurately the laws of our matter flow from the etheric
matter from which it is made  the ether has two hundred or more
elementary substances each atom of our eighty or ninety
elements being the chemical union of great masses of two or
more of the etheric elements or their combinations  these
etheric elementary substances combine and unite  our elementary
substances simply following in their combinations the law which
they inherit from their parents  they take form and shape  they
vibrate through one octave and take solid liquid or gaseous form
in ether as their types here in our world take it in prakriti
as their vibrations are increased or diminished  in short the
ether is the prototype of our physical or prakritic world out of
which it is made and a product of which it is
as this ether is physical matter the same as prakriti one
harmonic law covering both and as this ether fills all space
modern science divides physical matter into two kinds which for
convenience in differentiation are here called prakritic and
etheric
matter is somethingscience does not know or care to know what
in vibration  a very low octave of vibration produces
prakriti  a very high octave of vibration produces ether  the
vibration of prakriti ends in thousands  that of ether begins in
billions  between them there is a gulf of vibrations that has
not yet been bridged  for that reason science divides matter
into two planes or octaves of vibrationthe matter of this
visible and tangible plane being called prakriti and that of the
invisible and intangible plane being called etheric  across this
gulf the two planes respond to each other note for note the
note in trillions chording when the note in thousands is struck
note for note chord for chord they answer one another and the
minutest and the most complex phenomena are alike the result of
this harmonic vibration that of the ether supplying force and
that of the prakriti a medium in which it can manifest
this knowledge of ether is not guesswork or fancy and while it
is as impossible of proof as the axioms of geometry it is worthy
the same credence and honor  we are working on physical axioms
exactly as we work on geometrical axioms
modern science represents each and every prakritic atom as a
globe like the earth floating in space and surrounded by an
atmosphere of ether  the subdivision of prakritic matter until
we reach etheric atoms chemically united to make the physical
unit is the correct definition of an atom  the prakritic
physical atom has length breadth and thickness  and it has an
atmosphere of ether which not only interpenetrates the atom as
oxygen and hydrogen interpenetrate the drop of water but
furnishes it with an envelope as the oxygen and hydrogen furnish
the drop of water with one
each physical atom is the centre of an etheric molecule composed
of many etheric atoms vibrating at a greater or lesser speed and
interpenetrating the atom  each may be considered a miniature
earth with its aerial envelope the air penetrating all parts
of it
the etheric plane of matter not only unites with this prakritic
plane through the atom but it interpenetrates all combinations of
it  beside the atom as well as through the atom  the grain of
sand composed of many prakritic atoms is also composed of many
times that number of etheric atoms  the grain of sand is etheric
matter as well as prakritic matter  it exists on the etheric
plane exactly the same as it exists on the prakritic and it has
etheric form as well as prakritic form
as each atom of this physical world of ourswhether of land or
water or air  whether of solid liquid or gasis the centre
of an etheric molecule we have two worlds not one  a physical
world and an etheric one  a visible world and an invisible
world  a tangible world and an intangible world  a world of
effect and a world of cause
and each animal including man is made in the same way  he has
a prakritic body and an etheric body  a visible body and an
invisible body  an earthly body and one not made with hands
in common touch with the whole universe
chapter four
what a teacher should teach
let us suppose that a certain wise teacher of physics places a
row of bunsen burners under a long steel bar having a daniells
pyrometer at one end and addresses his class substantially as
follows
at our last lecture we found that the matter of the universe
permeated all space but in two conditions which we agreed to
call physical and etheric or tangible and intangible  it is all
the same matter subject to the same laws but differing in the
rate of vibration the physical matter vibrating through one
great octave or plane and the etheric vibrating through another
great octave or plane one degree higherthe chording vibration
of the matter of the two planes in one note producing what we
call energy or force and with it phenomena
this is a bar of steel 36 inches long  it is composed of
physical atoms but no two physical atoms touch  each physical
atom is as far apart from every other atom as the stars in heaven
from one anotherin proportion to their size  the atoms and
the spaces between them are so small to our sight that they seem
to touch  if we had a microscope of sufficient power to reveal
the atom you would see that no two atoms touch and that the
spaces between them are as faraday says very great in
proportion to their size  i showed you last term that what
appeared to be a solid stream of water when magnified and thrown
upon a screen was merely a succession of independent drops that
did not touch  i can not yet give you proof of the bar of iron
being composed of independent atoms but that is the fault of our
instruments and you must take my word for it until the proof is
simplified and made easy of application
each one of these physical atoms is a miniature world  it is
the center of an ocean of ether composed of many atoms  and
while no two physical atoms touch their etheric atmospheres do
touch and any change in the vibration of the etheric atmosphere
of one will be imparted to that of the next  as the vibration of
the physical atom must be in harmony with that of its etheric
atmosphere any change coming to one will be imparted to the
next and the next through the ether surrounding them
you can see that the index at the end of the bar has moved
showing that it is now longer  that means the etheric atoms are
now vibrating faster taking more space and have necessarily
forced each physical atom farther apart  the bar is not only
longer but softer and as the vibrations increase in rapidity
the time will come when it will bend by its own weight and even
when it will become a liquid and a gas
if you put your hand anywhere near the bar you will feel a
sensation called heat and say it has become hot  the reason for
that is that you are in actual and literal touch with the bar or
iron through the ether  it is not alone each atom of the bar of
iron that is surrounded by the ether but each atom of the air
and each atom of your body  their etheric atmospheres are all
touching and the increase in the vibration of the ether
surrounding the atoms of iron is imparted to those of the air
surrounding it and these in turn raise the rate of vibration in
the etheric atoms surrounding the physical atoms of your hand
this rate of vibration in your nerves causes a sensation or
mental impression you call heat  consciousness of it comes
through your sense of touch  but after all it is merely a rate
of vibration which your brain recognizes and names
the bar has now reached a temperature of about 700 degrees and
has become a dull red  why do you say the color has changed and
why do you say red
because the rate of vibration of the etheric atoms in the bar is
now about 412 trillions per second and this rate of vibration
having been imparted to the ether of the air has in turn been
imparted to the ether of your eye and this rate of vibration in
the ether of the nerves of your eye your brain recognizes and
calls red
the heat still continues and increases  you now have both heat
and light  so you see that the ether is not vibrating in a
single note but in two chording notes producing light and heat
there are two kinds of ether around the iron atom  there is
sound also but the note is too high for ones ears  it is a
chord of three notes
professor silliman of yale discovered over twenty years ago
that the ether could be differentiated into the luminiferous or
light ether and the sonoriferous or sound ether
other great scientists since then have found a third etherthe
heat ether
their discoveries show that the atmospheric etheric envelope of
each etheric atom is made up of etheric atoms of different
vibratory powers  as the atmosphere of the earth is made up of
atoms of oxygen and nitrogen and argon so that of an atom is
made up of three kinds of ethers corresponding to three of our
senses  that it consists of five ethers corresponding to our
five senses as the ancient hindus assertwho can say
i mention this subject of the differentiation of the ether
merely that you may not suppose that the ether is a simple
substance  for the present we will treat it as a simple
substance but next year we will take it up as a compound one
this steel bar before you is not one bar but two bars  there
is a visible bar and an invisible bar the visible bar being made
of physical atoms and the invisible bar of etheric atoms  the
etheric bar is invisible but it is made of matter the same as
the visible bar and it is just as real just as truly a bar as
the one we see
more than this  the etheric invisible bar is the source and
cause of all phenomena connected with the bar  it is the real
bar and the one we see is merely the shadow in physical matter
of a real bar  in shape strength color in short in
everything it depends on the invisible one  the invisible
dominates governs disposes  the visible is merely its
attendant shadow changing as the invisible etheric bar changes
and recording for our senses these invisible changes
the invisible change always comes first  the invisible
phenomena invariably precede the visible
in all this physical worldin all this universethere is
nothing not even a grain of sand or an atom of hydrogen that is
not as this bar of iron isthe shadow cast on a visible world
by the unknown and mysterious work of an invisible world
land or water mountain or lake man or beast bird or reptile
cold or heat light or darkness all are the reflection in
physical matter of the true and real thing in the invisible and
intangible world about us  if we have a visible body we have an
invisible one also said saint paul  modern science has proven
he was right and that it is the invisible body which is the real
body
if this earth and all that it is composed ofland or ocean or
air  man or beast  pyramid or pavementcould be resolved into
the physical atoms composing everything in it or on it created by
god or man each atom of this dust would be identical physically
there would not be one kind of atom for iron and another for
oxygen
the differentiation between what are called elementary
substances is first made apparent in the molecule or first
combination of the atoms  it is not in the atom itself unless
it be in the size as may not be improbable  the atoms combine
in different numbers to make differently shaped molecules and it
is from this difference in the shape of the molecule that we get
the difference between gold and silver copper and tin or oxygen
and hydrogen
in all chemical compounds such as water and alcohol the
molecules at the base of the two or more substances break up into
their original atoms and form a new molecule composed of all the
atoms in the two or more things combined  to make this chemical
combination we must change the rate of vibration of one or the
other or both until they strike a common chord  as we saw last
term oxygen and hydrogen have different specific heats and no
two other elements have the same specific heat while heat raises
the rate of vibration  any given amount of heat raises the
vibration of one more than another  apply heat and the rate of
one will rise faster than that of the other until they reach a
common chord  then they fall apart and recombine
if we pass a current of electricity through this sealed jar
containing oxygen and hydrogen in mechanical union the spark
that leaps across the points furnishes the heat and a drop of
water appears and falls to the bottom  a large portion of the
gases has disappeared  it has been converted into water  what
is left of the gases will expand and fill the bottle
the drop of water but for local causes but for a certain
attraction of the earth would float in the centre of the jar at
the centre of gravity as the earth does in space  but the
centre of gravity of the two bodies is far within the earth and
the drop gets as close to it as it can  the earths pull takes
it to the bottom  if the jar were far enough away in space the
drop would float as the earth floats at a point where all pulls
balance and the drop of water would have enough pull of its own
enough gravity within itself to hold all the gas left in the jar
to itself as an atmosphere  it would be a centre of energy a
minature world
the drop of water is not a homogenous mass  about one third of
the bulk of the drop of water is made up of independent oxygen
and hydrogen atoms interspersed through it as any liquid is
through this piece of blotting paper  and it has and keeps by
its own attraction an atmosphere of the gas  each molecule of
water has a thin layer or skin of the gas  even as it comes
from this faucet
let us return again to the physical dust the atom  why should
it form by fives for iron by nines for hydrogen  where did the
atom come from  what is it  we know that like the drop of
water it is a miniature world with an atmosphere of ether  and
the natural inference is that it is made from ether as the drop
of water was made from gas  many things confirm this inference
and it may be accepted as a working hypothesis that it is made
from ether as the drop of water is made from gas by the chemical
union of a large amount of ether of different kinds the etheric
molecules of which consist of 2 and 3 or 5 and 4 etheric atoms
and that the tendency to combine in this or that number in
physical matter is an inherited tendency brought with it from the
etheric world of matter on which or in which each element of
this world is two or more  there is no kind of matter in this
physical world that has not its prototype in the etheric and
the laws of its action and reaction here are laws which it
inherits and brings with it  they are not laws made here  they
are laws of the other worldeven as the matter itself is matter
of the other world
in 1882 professor lodge in a lecture before the royal
institution on the luminiferous ether defined it as
one continuous substance filling all space which can vibrate
as light which can be sheared into positive and negative
electricity which in whirls constitutes matter and which
transmits by continuity and not impact every action and reaction
of which matter is capable
this reads today like babytalk but at that time eighteen years
ago it was considered by many timid conservative scientists as
a daring movement  it is noteworthy in that it was the first
public scientific announcement that the physical matter is a
manifestation or form of the ether  and it was made before
general acceptance of the division of the ether into soniferous
luminiferous and tangiferous
which in whirls constitutes matter  professor lodge believed
that some etheric molecules revolved so rapidly on their axis
that they could not be penetrated  watch the soapbubbles that
i am blowing  each and every one is revolving as the earth
revolves from west to east  what i wish to call your attention
to is the fact that can be proven both mathematically and
theoretically that at a certain rate of speed in the revolution
they could not be penetrated by any rifleball  at a higher rate
of speed they would be harder than globes of solid chilled steel
harder even than carbon  professor lodge believed that the
etheric molecule revolved so rapidly that thin as it was in its
shell it gave us the dust out of which worlds were made  there
is one fatal error in this idea although it is held even now by
many  it is based entirely on gravity and gravity is alone
considered in its problems  there are two great forces in the
universe not one as many scientific people fail to remember
gravity and apergy or the centrifugal and centripetal forces
the pull in is and must be always balanced by the pull out
there is in the universe as much repulsion as attraction and the
former is a force quite as important as the latter  the bubbles
speed kept increasing until apergy the tendency to fly off
overcame gravity and it ruptured
professor lodge failed to take into account this apergic force
this tendency to fly off when he gave such high revolutionary
speed to the etheric molecules a speed in which apergy would
necessarily exceed gravity  the failure to take apergy into
consideration has been the undoing of many physicists
today we know that the ether is matter the same as our own
only finer and rarer and in much more rapid vibration  we know
that this ether has its solids liquids and gases formed from
molecules of its atoms even as our own are formed  we know that
its atoms combine as ours do and while we have but eighty
elementary combinations it must have more than double the
number  we know that every form and shape and combination of
these elements from this plane flows from inherited tendencies
having their root in the etheric world
the two worlds are one worldas much at one with ours as the
world of gas about us is at one with our liquids and solids  it
is continuity not impact  they not only touch everywhere and
in everything but they are one and the same in action and
reaction
thus spake a certain wise teacher of physics  to his wise
utterances we can only add that such as we are today we see
through a glass darkly  yet there will come a day when the
physical bandages will be removed from our eyes and we shall see
face to face the beauty and grandeur and glory of this invisible
world and that in truth it transmits by continuity and not
impact every action and reaction of which matter is capable
forming one continuous chain of cause and effect without a link
missing  there are no gulfs to cross  no bridges to be made
it is here  not there  it is at one with us  and we are at one
with it  one and the same law controls and guides the etheric
atom and the physical atom made from its molecules whether the
latter are made in whirls as at first supposed or by orderly
combination as now believed
in fact this visible world of ours is the perfect product of the
other invisible one having in it its root and foundation the
very sap of its life
chapter five
the four manifested planes
the oriental idea of the universe does not differ fundamentally
in its general conception from that of modern science but it
goes farther and explains more  the physics of the secret
doctrine are based upon a material universe of four planes of
vibration and a spiritual universe of three planes of vibration
beyond matter  this something in vibration may be given the
english name consciousnesswithout entering upon its nature
spirit is consciousness in vibration and undifferentiated
matter is consciousness in vibration and differentiated
as we divide the seven octaves of a piano into treble and bass
for clearness of thought and writing so the hidden knowledge
divides the seven octaves of vibration or planes into spirit
and matter  in their ultimate analysis they are one and the same
thing as ice and water are the same thing  but for study they
must be differentiated
the material and physical universe consists of four planes of
matter or four great octaves of vibration each differentiated
from the other as in our physics prakriti is differentiated from
ether  the material universe the ancient physics teach was
originally pure thought manasa the product of the spiritual
planes above  this manasic world was differentiated a real
world  that is to say it was given elementary substances by the
union of its atoms in different sized molecules  some of its
elements combined and formed prana  the prana gathered and
formed other worlds pranic worlds  then in the pranic world
etheric worlds were formed  and finally in the etheric worlds
prakritic globes like the earth were formed  the earth is the
centre of a prakritic globe revolving in ether around the sun
the sun is the centre of a solar globe of ether revolving in
prana around alcyone  alcyone is the centre of a stellar globe
of prana revolving in manasa around the central and hidden sun of
the great manasic globe  these four conditions of matter
prakriti ether prana and manasa are the earth water fire
air of the ancient metaphysics the four elements of matter and
are present in every atom of prakriti  when the atom of prana
was formed it had an envelope of manasa  when the atom of ether
was formed it had an envelope of pranicmanasic atoms  when the
prakritic atom was formed it had an envelope of ethericpranic
manasic atoms each of its encircling etheric atoms being the
centre of a pranic molecule and each pranic atom of that
molecule being the centre of a manasic molecule
each atom of prakriti was the material universe in miniature  it
held the potentialities of mind life and phenomena  in every
aggregation of atoms there were the four planes each in touch
through the cosmic mind its manasa with other atoms in the
universe with every other globe of whatever kind  as above so
below was the secret keyword  the unity of all the material
universe in its prakriti ether prana and manasa was the corner
stone of this knowledge  the three planes above prakriti were
called astral and in common speech there was the ordinary
division into two planes visible and invisible or spirit as
the invisible was called and matter as the visible was
called  only in the hidden secret doctrine of physics and in
the open metaphysics which were a stumbling block and
foolishness to those who had not the inner light of the
physics were the three divisions of the astral made known and
the true distinction between the spirit of the three higher
planes and the matter of the four lower was kept out of the
metaphysics or only vaguely alluded to
there is no oriental science because the oriental does not
attach the same value to merely physical knowledge that we do
but that must not be understood to imply that there is no
oriental physics  in all the matters that interest us now as
far as principles are concerned the oriental knew all that we
know  he knew it thousands of years ago when our ancestors were
sleeping with the cave bears
that is all the good it did him the scientist says  no  that
is not true  it is perfectly true that the oriental the
babylonian who carved on the black stone now in the british
museum the five moons of jupiter exposing himself to the
derision of our astronomers prior to their own discovery of the
fifth moon in 1898 did not care particularly whether there were
four moons or five and had no sale for any telescopes he might
make for no one else cared particularly  but it was not true
that he did not care for any and all knowledge that would improve
his spiritual condition by giving him correct ideas of the
universe and of his own part in it  to him life was more than
meat and the body more than raiment  he was more afraid of sin
than of ignorance  we are more afraid of ignorance than of sin
he preferred to better mens moral condition  we prefer to
better their physical condition
if one of the sages of the east could be called up and put on the
stand to be questioned he would say substantially
you are right in regard to your ether and to prakriti being
ether that has been dropped a great octave in vibration  your
physical atom is surrounded by a molecule of ether this molecule
containing many atoms of ether  the chording vibration does
produce all physical phenomena
but where did the ether atom come from  how can you explain how
and whence life comes or what it is  this explains physical
but how do you explain vital phenomena
you are wrong in assuming that all the matter of the universe
apart from the earth or planets is ether and only ether  the
etheric world in which you are interested ends with your solar
system  it ends with each solar system to the people of that
system  between each solar system and another there is another
form of matter that is not ether
this etheric solar world of ours is very large many billions of
miles in diameter  but it is not the whole universe  you know
that the sun and all its planets are revolving around the star
alcyone  your astronomers told you that years ago and they have
recently given you the rate of speed as 4838 miles per hour
did you not see and know that if they had this revolution around
a central sun it must be within a solar globe
did you think that the sun and its planets and other suns and
their planets were tearing their way through the ether like so
many fish on a dipsyhook from a marblehead fishing smack running
before the wind
did it never occur to you that the ether of this solar system
must be revolving around this central sun  the whole solar
system ether and planets are revolving around alcyone and the
reason why their minor revolution around the sun is not affected
by it is because the solar system is a vast globe of ether
having a thinner and rarer medium to revolve in the same as our
earth has  it is the motion of a fly in a moving car
now fix your attention on this globe of ether this solar globe
you must do it to get the concept before you  you have known of
it all your life without once really apprehending it for you
have never learned to think or to utilize the knowledge that was
given you  the idea is as new and as strange as if you had never
known it
what lies beyond the surface of the solar globe  something
must  something as much rarer and thinner than the ether as the
ether is rarer and thinner than prakriti  can you not guess
it is prana the life force of the universe  as prakriti is
made from ether so ether is made from prana  it is made in the
same way  each atom of the ether is the centre of a molecule of
prana surrounded by an atmosphere of pranic atoms exactly as
your prakritic atom is surrounded by an atmosphere of etheric
atoms  you say that each atom of prakriti is the centre of a
molecule of ether  so it is  but each atom of that etheric
molecule is the centre of a pranic molecule  each atom of your
physical matter is triple not double
you say that all physical phenomena come from the chording
vibration of the etheric and prakritic atoms of the two planes of
matter  yes  but do you not see that all vital phenomena come
from the chording vibration of the pranic etheric and prakritic
atom of the three planes of matter which are in each atom
in the living leaf the three planes are sounding in chord in each
atom of it  in the dead leaf drying up and falling to pieces
only the lower two are sounding in chord  the silver chord has
been broken
each atom of prakriti you say has the potentiality of some kind
of phenomenon  we add and of life also  the potentialities of
life are in every atom of prakriti  even the atom of iron may
live in the blood  it cannot become a part of any living
organism until its prana is sounding the chord of life in unison
with the ether and prakritithe threefold silver chord
what is the centre of this prana  it is alcyone  there are
other solar globes beside ours circling around alcyone and we
have been considering only our own solar globe of ether  alcyone
is the centre of the prana in which they revolve as the sun is
the centre of our ether in which the planets revolve  as this
prana has a centre around which we revolve with other solar
systems then it must have a center of gravity
then this prana is a globe
the prana does not then fill this material universe  there must
be yet another form of matter rarer and finer than prana from
which prana is made as ether is made from prana and prakriti
from ether  have we any other class of phenomena to explain
except vital and physical  yes there is a very important class
mental  and here we have the explanation if we exercise our
reason
these pranic globes are floating in an ocean of manasa matter
in its rarest form
each atom of prana is formed from manasa exactly as ether was
formed from prana and each pranic atom in the universe is the
centre of a manasic molecule having an atmosphere of manasic
atoms
so we are not exact in giving the prakritic atom three planes or
octaves of vibration  it has four  you merely surround it with
etheric atoms and this is correct so far as it goes  you only
wish to explain physical problems  but there are other problems
to be explained problems of life and mind and the same
knowledge you have explains them as well as the others if you
simply avail yourself of it  that you do not consider the atom
as fourfold instead of twofold is your own fault  i have not
told you anything you did not already know  i have only asked
you to apply your present knowledge of physics to these problems
of life and mind and apply your reasoning powers
the chording vibration in an atom of matter of
the two planes produces force or phenomena
the three planes produces lifethe silver chord
the four planes produces mindthe golden chord
you say there is no gulf between the prakritic and etheric
worlds  that it is one continuous world  and all its phenomena
are by continuity and not impact  that is true but it is not
the whole truth
there is no gulf to cross between the prakritic and etheric
worlds  none to cross between that and the manasic  the four
worlds are one great world continuous interchangeable  through
the four as well as through the two there is continuity and not
impact  whether it is an atom or a world the four are there
nothing no combination of atoms no matter of any kind however
small or large can exist in this prakritic world unless it has
the four elements which from time immemorial our philosophers
have called earth water fire air meaning the four globes or
forms of matter in the universe  we do not have to leave the
earth to live in the etheric globe  it is here  nor do we have
to go millions of miles to reach the pranic globe  it is here
the problems of light and heat are no easier than the problems of
birth and death  the pranic globe is within us  within
everything  so is the manasic
it is here on these higher planes that the chances for worthy
study are greatest  at least we think so though you may not
we live on the manasicpranicetheric globe on precisely the
same terms that we live on this of prakriti and the problems of
the three are equally open to us
if there are any who care to follow up the line of thought i
have opened who care for the questions that interest us of the
east i will talk as long as they care to listen provided they
will not ask for knowledge that will give them power over others
which cannot fail to be used for evil
this is but a glimpse of hindu physics yet it has helped us in
the metaphysics  we now understand the chain of globesin
part  the earth is fourfold  as each atom of the earth is
fourfold so their aggregations give us prakritic earth an
etheric earth a pranic earth and a manasic earthin
coadunition and not like the skin of an onion  they are separate
and distinct globes each on its own plane  it is four down and
three up for the angel entering matter whether from the outmost
boundary of manasic matter or the surface of the earth or the
cover of a baseball  the chain of globes in the secret
doctrine represents the unity of the material universe
the threefold nature of the astral model is revealed and the
unity of all prakritic things  but more than that to many
minds will be the explanation it gives of why there are but four
planes of vibration in matter  that the highest form of
development in prakriti shows only four elements prakriti or
body sensation or force life and mind and that these last
three present in all things in esse become present in posse
when they work together harmonically
chapter six
our place on earth
the next time our wise man from the east was asked to say a few
words and make his own topic he spoke perhaps as follows
how large do you think the earth is  you answer promptly 7912
miles in diameter  you are as far out of the way as you were in
supposing that our sun could be a centre of gravity of a lot of
planets revolving around it and around alcyone without being a
globe of ether  now that it has been mentioned you see very
clearly for yourself that it must be a solar globe of ether  it
follows from one of your physical axioms  when i tell you why
the earth is and must be about fifty thousand miles in diameter
you will see that it must be so and that you knew it all the
time but never stopped to formulate your knowledge  you have
had the knowledge for three centuries without applying it
it was in 1609 that your greatest astronomer john kepler
announced as one of three harmonic laws by which the universe was
governed that the squares of the times of the planets were
proportional to the cubes of their distances from the sun  and
that this law was true in physics and everywhere  no one of your
scientists has had the wisdom to study out what it meant and for
three centuries for 291 years you have repeated his words like
so many parrots instead of using the key he gave you to unlock
the mysteries of the universe  a corollary of his law is that
the planets move in their orbits because they are impelled
thereto between the two forces and move in a mean curve between
them  but it was not until 1896 that you discovered that the
mean between two forces is always a curve and never a straight
line  you have not a text book in a school today that does not
repeat this fundamental and absurd errorwhich you have known
for three centuries to be an errorthat the motion resulting
from a mean between forces is in a straight line  the curves
resulting here are not to be measured easily and are so large
that small segments appear straight lines  and it was not until
carpenter demonstrated it mathematically that any one could
believe it true
there are two great forces in this universe  your grandfathers
called them centripetal and centrifugal forces  your fathers
called them gravity and apergy names which still cling to them
and you call them attraction and repulsion
it was kepler not newton who discovered that attraction or
gravity was in inverse proportion to the square of the distance
you know the meaning of this mystic phrase as the squares of
the distance  you understand that it means the attraction at
two feet is only onefourth the attraction at one foot  at four
feet only onesixteenth  at eight feet only one sixtyfourth
but who knows or cares for keplers great law of repulsion or
apergy  that was that the square of the times are as the cubes
of the distance  it has lain fallow for centuries  no one of
your western physicists has ever studied it or tried to explain
it  it remains just where kepler left it as the mere law of
orbital revolution of the planets only
it is the key to the proper understanding of the universe
the squares of the times are as the cubes of the distance
means that all motion is the result of two forces acting upon
prakriti and that where the two forces are balanced or equal
the result in motion is a circle or ellipse the square of the
repulsion being equal to the cube of the attraction to make them
equal and produce a circle  in other cases they produce
hyperbola and parabola
this is a little drynearly all fundamental knowledge isbut
the reward of patience is great
the orbital speed of the earth is about 60000 miles per hour
the attraction of the sun exactly equals the repulsion created by
the motion  more accurately the speed created by the repulsion
the result of the two forces working together at exact balance is
a circle  an ellipse is a circle bent a little and the ellipse
in which the earth actually moves comes from varying attraction
and repulsion  keplers second law covers that
if the orbital speed of the earth were a mile less per hour or
even a foot less then the earth would wind up around the sun as
a dog gets wound up with his chain around a tree  if this speed
were a mile more per hour then the earth would wind out each
year getting farther and farther away until finally it would be
lost  when the speed is exactly proportional to the pullthat
is when it is as 16 is to 2the result is a circular orbit
the eccentricity of which is caused by certain fluctuations in
the attraction and repulsion
suppose a planet were to be placed so that it would have a time
of two years  its distance from the sun would be 16 that of the
earth  why  because to get the time doubled we would have to
take the square root of 4  and to get the distance the cube root
of the same number 4  if you wish to be very exact the cube
root is 15889 but 16 is near enough for all ordinary work
if you wanted to find out the distance of a planet revolving in
six months you would divide the earths distance by 16
in proportion you get any time or distance you may desire with
absolute accuracy  the distance of any planet from the sun gives
its time or its time gives its distancewhen that of any of
the others is known  this law applies throughout the universe
in everything and everywhere  it is not a law of orbital
revolution alone but a law of all motion
our moon has a time of 29 days and a speed of about 50000 miles
per day  if the speed were greater it would leave us if less it
would wind up falling to the earth in the form of a spiral
at what distance would it have to be to have a time of fourteen
days divide 240000 miles by 16  a sevenday moon would be
16 that distance  and the exact distance for a oneday moon
for a moon that would always be in the same place in the heavens
moving as the earth revolved on its axis would be about 24998
miles
this gives us the line of 24hour axial rotation the true
surface of the earth and the sheerline of prakritic matter
beyond that line is the ether  within that line is prakriti
it is the line of no weight where gravity and apergy exactly
balance  inside that line gravity exceeds apergy and everything
revolving in less time or that time must fall to the centre
it is the true surface of any 24hour globe of this size and
weight  a moon to revolve around the earth in less than one day
must move faster than the earth to develop enough apergy to
overcome the attraction  that phenomenon we see in the moons of
mars which are within its atmosphere  within the planet itself
we of the east learned this true size of the earth over six
thousand years ago from observing the moons of jupiter  the
times of the first three are doubled  we asked ourselves what
this meant and found that their distance was increased by the
cube root of 4 when their times were increased by the square root
of 4  that time was to distance as 16 was to 2  then we
applied the key and found it unlocked many mysteries
the first lesson this taught us was that we did not live on the
earth but within the earth at the line of liquid and gaseous
changes where the three forms of matter meet and mingle and
interchange with each other  we lived at the bottom of a gaseous
ocean 21000 miles above us and 4000 miles from the centre of
the globe  it gave us an entirely new conception of the earth
and of our place in it
we saw that we lived in a narrow belt or skin of the earth
not more than 100 miles thick perhaps not more than ten miles
within this belt the prakritic elementary substances varied their
condition combined and made forms by increasing or decreasing
vibration  it was the creative and destructive zone the
evolutionary motherthe liquid level of the prakritithe
seat of all physical phenomena  fifty miles above the masses of
nitrogen and oxygen and argon were too cold to change their rate
of vibration  fifty miles below the surface of the earth all
things were too hot for changes in vibration  in this kinetic
belt between two static masses our bodies had been made and
also in all probability all combinations of the elementary
substances  it was four thousand miles to the centre of the
static prakritic mass beneath us  twentyone thousand miles to
the surface of the static prakritic mass above us and the small
kinetic belt between was only one hundred miles thick  but we
had one consolation the prakriti we had was all kinetic and the
best in the whole mass
the second lesson it taught us was that as the earth had been
made in the etheric globe in a corresponding skin or plane of
kinetic etheric energy with our ether the best of the solar
output that we ourselves were subject through our ether to the
phenomena of that kinetic solar plane in precisely the same way
we now are to the phenomena of the kinetic prakritic plane  once
rid of the fallacious notion that we were creatures of the
surface of the earth once clearly conscious that we were
creatures of the interior of the bottom of this gaseous ocean
then we could understand not only how the earth could be created
in this etheric globe but how we could be creatures of the solar
globe living on it
when we learned that lesson and learned it well it dawned upon
us that we were living in the pranic globe at the same kinetic
level or plane of that globe the line where its solids and
liquids and gases mingled and passed from one state to another
the kinetic belt in which our solar globe has been made and that
we were living as truly on that globe as we were on this
prakritic globe  our position on each globe was the same
and then the great truth came that we lived in the manasic
globe at the same kinetic level  and that we lived our lives on
the four globes simultaneously  our bodies are fourfold  every
atom is fourfold ready to respond in our minds to the vibrations
of the manasic world in our vitality to the pranic vibrations of
the pranic world in our nerves to the etheric vibrations of the
etheric world and in our prakriti to vibrations of the prakritic
world  each one of our bodies lived on its own earth globe for
there were four globes of this earthin coadunitionin its
corresponding kind of globe
the four earth globes became one globe as our four bodies were
one body  and the chain of four kinds of globes in matter became
one globe as the manasic with the others on it
these four kinds of globes were the beginning and the end of
matter as we distinguish and know matter  they were not the end
of vibration  or of planes of vibration  or of realms beyond
this material universe  but they were the limits of all that is
common to each and every atom of this lower plane of vibration
it is upon this solid and perfect foundation of physics that
accounts for and explains every kind of phenomena we have
constructed our metaphysics  all that belongs to these four
lower planes we consider and treat as physics  all that relates
to the planes beyond we consider metaphysics  can you teach a
child equation of payments before he knows the first four rules
you would not attempt such a task  the first four rules are the
physics of arithmetic  all beyond is the metaphysics of
arithmetic  it flows out of them  can you comprehend our system
of metaphysics until you have clearly and completely mastered our
physics  would you not get into a fog at the very start
there can be no system of metaphysics without a solid foundation
of physics  the idea is unthinkable  the one grows out of the
other  it is its life  its fruit its flower
you have no western system of physics  your physics are without
form and void  patchwork constantly changing  there is no
substantial foundation for any system of metaphysics  what you
say or do in physics is fragmentary or chaotic
it is perfectly true so far as you have gone through the first
invisible world of ether you are much more masters of detail
than we are
we have not cared particularly for the minor details by which
explosives are made or metals obtained from oxides  we have
preferred to push on into realms beyond as fast as we could
seeking first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness
knowing that when it was found all these things would be added
unto us
chapter seven
the four globes
that we live in the earth not on the earth is one of the most
important of the facts of eastern physics in the study of its
metaphysics  the mathematical and physical proof that the
physical earth is 50000 miles in diameter should not be
passed over lightly in our haste to get on for the perfect
understanding of all this fact implies makes easy the
comprehension of how we live etherically in the solar etheric
globe of how we live pranically in the stellar pranic globe and
how we live manasically in the manasic globe
as we live within the narrow skin of phenomena not more than
100 miles thick of this prakritic globe with the whole earth
within the corresponding skin of phenomena of the solar etheric
globe within the kinetic belt in which it was made the ether
which surrounds each prakritic molecule is not merely any and
every kind of ether but that particular kind of kinetic ether
which by changing its rate of vibration through an octave
creates phenomena  the ether of all prakritic matter belongs to
the kinetic or creative belt of the solar etheric globe  it is
not static ether  the ether in our prakriti is in touch with all
the prakritic kinetic ether of the solar globe subject to all
solar laws of change  and all our praksolar laws of change
and all our prakritic matter a mere detail of it is a part of
the solar phenomena  our father the sun or dyaus pitar
heavenly fatherlatin jupiter meant more once than it does
now  then the solar globe was the first heaven and to live
under its laws puttings off the coat of skin was an object
which men believed to be worth striving for  they recognized as
we do not that our prakritic laws were not all they had to obey
that the higher law of the solar globe on which they lived of
which the lower prakritic laws were merely an outcome and detail
was worthy of the closest study  and they recognized that these
higher laws of the etheric globe were metaphysical as well as
physical  that our moral law flows out of the moral law of the
solar etheric world as our physics flow from and out of solar
physics  religion is correct in its assumption of this higher
law of morals  incorrect only in its grasp and explanation
science is correct in holding only in its assumption that it is
physical science  incorrect only in its assumption that it is
physical science of this plane and globe only  there is no
quarrel between science and religion when the full knowledge of
one stands beside the full knowledge of the other  they are
twinsisters
this solaretheric globe in which we are interested revolves
around alcyone within that kinetic belt or skin of prana which is
subject to phenomena or vibration through one octaveelse it
would never have been formed  all prana in the solaretheric
globe is of this particular kind of kinetic prana which creates
life of all kindswhich is subject to vibration through one
octave  the solar globe is a detail of kinetic prana only one
of its phenomena  necessarily all our prana is of this kinetic
kind and our earth a minor detail of it in the alcyone globe
all the changes and combinations possible in kinetic prana on the
pranic globe are possible here in our kinetic prana as all the
phenomena of the etheric world are possible here in our kinetic
ether
as our earth is a globe of ether and a globe of prana as well as
a globe of prakriti  we are actually living on a small cabbage
of that pranic globe and subject to all its laws
in the vast manasic globe that includes this whole material
universe there is the same kinetic belt or skin of phenomena or
vibration similar to that kinetic belt in which we live on the
earth and the manasa which permeates the alcyonic globe the
solar globe and the earth is that kinetic manasa which is
involving and evolving  this involving and evolving kinetic
manasa of the alcyonic globe is that which surrounds every atom
of ether of the solar globe and every atom of prakriti of this
earth globe  in the great manasic globe this earth of ours is a
minute village of helios sun county in the state of alcyone
we are actually and literally living in this manasic globe
precisely as we live in this earth and as in the village we are
subject to all the laws of the manasic world we can study them
here in this village as well as we could elsewhere  we can study
them as easily as we study our prakritic village laws or our
etheric county laws for all the forms of manasa subject to them
anywhere are here with us  we are not limited to a study of the
prakritic laws of the village fathers nor yet to the etheric
laws of the supervisors of helios county as scientists say nor
even to the state laws of alcyone  only the manasic laws of the
universe limit our material studies in that direction  as some
men on this earth never leave their native village and never know
or care for any matters outside of it so in this little earth
village in the kinetic belt of the manasic globe there are men
who do not care to know anything which relate to matters outside
its boundaries  as some men may pass the boundaries of their
village but not of their county caring only for the matters
concerning it so the western scientists of this earth village on
the manasic globe do not pass the boundaries of helios county
caring only for etheric matters  the philosophers and wise men
of the east are broader minded and from time immemorial have
taken greater interest in the pranic affairs of alcyone and the
manasic condition of the universe in which alcyone is a state
than in the rustic murmur of their village or the gossip of their
county
there is nothing lacking in our manasic earthvillage nothing
that is in more abundant measure in our county state and
nation  we are of the best
we of this village may imagine if we like that there is nothing
beyond the village limits and nothing in it but that which
relates to the village  we have the right to be silly if we
wish to be  and it is no sign of wisdom to say that there is a
county beyond but that the county boundaries end all and only
village and county politics may be studied  the european who
believedno asiatic or african or american could have believed
that the earth rested on an elephant and the elephant on
a turtle was wise in comparison  nor is it any sign of
intelligence to say that we may learn something of the village
and county while we live but that to learn anything about the
state and nation we must wait until we are dead  there are too
many in the village who are familiar with both state and nation
and who have studied their laws for this to be anything but
idiotic
chapter eight
the battle ground
each and every one of our eightyodd elementary substances owe
their conditionwhether solid liquid or gasto their rate
of vibration  we have reduced all gases to a liquid and nearly
all to a solid form  conversely we have raised all solids to a
liquid and nearly all to a gaseous condition  this has been done
by reducing or raising the vibration of each within one octave
each one of the eighty odd having a special octave a tone or
halftone different from any other  normally the solids
vibrating in the lower notes gather together under attraction
while the gases vibrating in the higher notes diffuse under
repulsion  between them created by the interchange of these two
forces is our skin of phenomena or kinetics
broadly the attraction of the universe comes from its vibration
at certain centres in the three higher notes  the repulsion
comes from its vibration everywhere else in the three higher
notes  the central note d of the scale represents the battle
ground between the field of kinetics  this in simple
illustration is water turning into gas
this is the great battle ground the only one worth considering
in a general view  there are minor critical stages which the
chemist studies but for us in this broad sketch of the
universe the important battleground is that between solid and
liquid on one side representing gravity and gas on the other
representing apergy
all the solids and liquids of this earth of ours gather at the
centre in a core each of the elements or their combinations
in this core vibrating in their three lower notes producing the
attraction which is in proportion to the mass and which
decreases from the surface of the core as the square of the
substance
around this central core gather all the elements vibrating in the
three higher notes of their octave as gases producing repulsion
which increases by 16 for each doubled time  it is worth while
making this clear  it has never before appeared in print
let the amount of apergy or repulsion or centrifugal force at
the surface of the earth be represented by x  this is the result
of motion at the rate of 1000 miles per hour  make this motion
2000 miles per hour and the apergy is increased 16  four
thousand miles above the surface of this earth the rotation
is at the rate of 2000  it is the globe of 48000 miles in
circumference revolving in 24 hours and the speed is doubled
this apergy has increased by 16  as the apergy increases at
this rate every time the speed is doubled at a distance
of 21000 miles the speed is 7000 miles per hour and the
centrifugal force has been increased nearly four times what it
was at the surface of the ocean  the attraction has been
decreased to about onethirtieth  at the surface it is equal to
120 x  at 4000 miles to onequarter or 30 x  at 16000 miles
to onesixteenth or 7 x  and at 21000 miles to 4 x
if equatorial gravity is about 120 times that of the equatorial
apergy at the ocean level then at the distance of 21000 miles
from it in a revolving globe the two forces would be equal
the pull of each being 4 x and an anchor will weigh no more
than a feather for weight is the excess of gravity or apergy
if the pyramids had been built of the heaviest known material on
the gases 21000 miles above us and so that they should revolve
in the same time 7000 miles per hour they would remain there
all the attraction of the solid core of the earth that could be
exerted on them at that distance would not be enough to pull them
an inch nearer to it through our gaseous envelope  their gaseous
foundation there would be as firm as igneous rock here
the force of repulsion created by the three higher notes of an
octave means just as much at the attraction created by the three
lower notes whether it is in a chemical retort within this
earth or within this universe  the two forces balance and are
exactly equal  they fight only within kinetic zones
given the vast manasic globe of differentiated matter its atoms
uniting in different numbers to form molecules as the bases of
elementary substances manasic substances of course  the thrill
of vibration is sweeping through it from the spiritual plane
above and the elements and their combinations which answer in
the lower notes gather and form a core the invisible central
sun with its attraction  the elements answering in the higher
notes gather around it with their repulsion  so the two opposing
forces were born with a vast kinetic skin for a battleground
between them
the attraction of the invisible central sun manifests itself to
us in prakriti as light  the repulsion of its covering or the
higher static vibration of manasa manifests itself to us as
darkness  the first creative act in or on matter was the
creation of light and its separation from the darkness  the next
creative act was the establishment of a kinetic skin or zone
between them a firmament in which the two forces of light and
darkness could strive for mastery  and god called the firmament
heaven  the third creative act was the gathering of the solids
and liquids together and the beginning of the kinetic work in
the creation of forms and shapes by the cross play of the two
forces in their combinations of solid with gases
all this had to happen before the manasa combined and dropped in
vibration to pranaand before the pranic globes were formed and
the light could be manifested to us through them  it may be well
to read the first chapter of genesis over and ask forgiveness for
our ignorance from the writer who records this creation of the
pranic globes as the fourth act of creation and the creation of
the etheric sun and prakritic moon to follow that  that record
is mutilated fragmentary  but the writer of it knew the facts
if we had the full story instead of a sentence here and there
taken from an older story not to tell of creation but to hide
another tale for the priest the writer of genesis would laugh
last
but let us return to the kinetic skin of energy between light and
the darknessthe firmament which god calls heaventhe battle
ground for gravity and apergy or attraction and repulsion or
good and evil or the powers of light and darkness  this skin is
like that of an onion thickest at the equator and thinnest at
the polesnot only on this earth but in the solar alcyonic
and manasic globes  the equatorial belt where phenomena are
richest in the manasic globes we call the milky way  in the
solar globe we call it the plane of the ecliptic  and on the
earth the tropics  modern science has not yet found it in
alcyonic globebecause it has never thought of looking for it
this division of the light from the darkness was all that was
required for evolution on the manasic globe within the kinetic
belt  this evolution was not confined to the making of a few
alcyonic or pranic globes  it was and is a great and wonderful
evolution beyond words and almost beyond imagination  it is the
heaven which mankind has longed to see and know  the writer of
genesis mixed it with the creation of this earth using earthly
metaphors  before finding fault we should better his language
we have not the words in physics to do it and must wait for our
metaphysics  but of one thing we may be sure that the pranic
alcyonic globes here and there at the sea level of the manasic
globein what god calls heavenamount to no more on that
globe or in heaven than so many balls of thistledown blown
across a meadow do on this earth of ours  everything that can be
created in thought must be there  it is in thought only but in
thought it is differentiated as sharply as anything in prakriti
the manasic world the heaven of the bible is as real as our own
world can possibly be  in fact more real for when ours is
resolved back into its final elements it will be but the dust
of the ground of the manasic world
the pranic globes created in this manasic skin by sound or the
logos or vibration evolved in identically the same waywith a
central static core and an outer static envelope of low and high
vibration in prana creating attraction and repulsion or gravity
and apergy  the kinetic skin between in which these forces play
in the pranic world makes a real not an imaginary pranic world
though but a faint reflection of the manasic  when our father
the central invisible sun transfers his attraction to these
alcyonic suns the light has something in which to manifest
itself and we see this manifesting core and call it alcyone
and its manifestation light  but light in its last material
analysis is but the static mind or thought vibrating in the three
lower notes of the octave
chapter nine
the dual man
within the alcyonic globes of differentiated pranicmanasic atoms
the vibration divided them also into solidliquid cores and
gaseous envelopes and a kinetic skin of phenomena  and then a
new worlda world of life came into material existence  all
the atoms of thought or manasa surrounding each and every pranic
atom and making its molecule of energy so to speak were that
particular kind of kinetic manasa ready to change its rate of
vibration within an octave and the forms prana assumes from the
action of thought within the kinetic belt were living and
thinking  each pranic globe which was a small state of product
of the manasic consisted of two globes in coadunitiontwo in
one  each pranic atom was the centre of a manasic molecule and
represented the universe  all things were two in one created by
harmonic vibration between them and existence by the greater
strength of the lower notes or attraction  it was at once less
and more wonderful than the manasic worlda specialized form of
it
when within this kinetic belt of the prana the etheric solar
globes formed here and there they were three fold each atom of
the new plane of matter having its surrounding envelope of prana
manasaa specialization of the pranic world in which what we
call force had been added to life and mind  the static ether
vibrating in each of its elements through one octave divided
into central core our sun and other suns and outer covering
with a skin or belt of kinetic energy as above which developed
an etheric world  all things on this etheric world were caused
by the harmonic vibration between the etheric atoms and their
surrounding envelopes except that while all things in this
etheric world must have life not all need have mind  the chord
of three was not necessary to create  the chord of two was
enough and the manasic atoms might cease to vibrate in chord
with the prana and ether without affecting the creation  only in
the etheric world and below it could there be living mindless
ones  to the etheric globes the stellar pranic cores transferred
their light which manifested itself in the solid static ether as
attraction and in the gaseous static ether as repulsion within
the kinetic skin of each etheric world more specialized and less
varied than the pranic
our sun is not of prakriti but of static ether composed of the
separate and individual elementary substances of the ether and
their compounds vibrating in the lower notes of their octaves
it is our father not our elder brother  its envelope of static
ether in which the planet revolves is composed of the elementary
substances and combinations vibrating in the higher notes of
their octave  the light transferred to this etheric globe from
its mother alcyone manifests itself in the lower vibration of
the sun as attraction  in the higher vibrations of its envelope
as repulsion and within the kinetic skin wherein these forces
play the prakritic globes planets were born
take our earth  each atom is fourfoldwhether of the static
core or of the static gaseous envelope  creation on it is
limited to the kinetic skin wherein the attraction of the lower
and repulsion of the higher notes in each octave of vibration
have full play  all things on it must have come from the
chording vibrations of the atoms of the prakritic elementary
substances and their envelope of ether  they may or may not have
life or mind the ether atom may have lost its chord with its
pranic envelope or the pranic envelope may have lost its chord
with the manasic  but the combination must have force or energy
within it  it may have lost mind and life in acquiring it or
after acquiring it  but it had to have life before it could
become prakriti
all things in the prakritic world flow from the life of the
etheric and the mind of the pranic worlds  everything in the
etheric world has life and our unconscious personification or
vivification of etheric life transferred into fauna or flora
or into force of any kind has a natural explanation  the
thrill of vibration in one octave through the differentiated
consciousness of the universe by which the light was separated
from the darkness the lower from the higher was all that was
required to create each star and sun and world and all that in
them is  and it was all good
each thing on every lower world was but the translation into form
of the type of the next world or plane above  as each element
on this prakritic type so each combination of those elements
into crystal or tree or animal is but the translation  the
normal earth from the crystal to the animal man was pure and
clean and holy  sin had not entered
how did it come
on the vast manasic world there was a special creationthat
of the angel man  the three planes of spirit above were
undifferentiated consciousness but they were in different
octaves of vibration and these working on the three highest
forms of differentiated consciousness manasic matter brought
them to chording vibration so that when they combined and reached
their highest point in evolution they created the angel or
manasic man  he was the product in kinetic manasa of the three
spiritual planes above him precisely as the animal man was the
product in kinetic prakriti of the three material planes above
him  the latter was the shadow of the other
the angelman had a material manasic body but his energy life
and mind were spiritual  the animal man had a prakritic body
with energy life and mind that were material
so far all was good
the animal man has four bodiesone of prakriti one of ether
one of prana and one of manasa  it may be true and probably
is that his manasic body is not sounding in chord with his
prakritic body but only with those atoms of it which are in his
brain and nerves  but that is immaterialfor future
consideration
the angel man had but one body of manasa in which the spirit
dwelt  but that body was identical in substance with the body
that made the mind of the animal man  his manasic body joined
the manasic body of the animal man joined with it by entering
into the animal mans mind as easily as water from one glass is
added to water in another glass and the animal man became a
living soul endowed with speech while the angelman was given
a skin coat
the prakritic body of the animal man was the result in prakriti
of an ethericpranicmanasic or astral body formed in
accordance with the universal law  for what he was by nature he
could not be blamed  he stood naked and not ashamed before the
radiance  he did not make his astral body  he was the mere
translation of it into prakriti as all other created things
were and that invisible astral self figuratively stood at his
right hand moulding and shaping him
but when the angelman entered his mind all this was changed
he knew good from evil  to his mind of manasa had been added
the spiritthe atmabuddhis consciousness of the three
spiritual planes  he has become as one of us said the angel
men of the firmament of heaven  he now held the seven planes
and was a creator  each thought and desire that when an animal
only fell harmless now created on the pranic and etheric world
soon beside him at his left hand figuratively there grew up a
second etheric or astral body that of his desires  and his
prakritic body was no longer the product of the astral body on
his right hand  it was the joint product of the lefthand kamic
astral body he had created and the right hand normal astral
body  he was no longer in harmony with the radiance  he could
no longer face it  he had created discordsin
the pretty legend of the two angels one on the right hand and
one on the left has its physical basis in this truth but of
course as a matter of actual fact the normal and abnormal
astral bodies are in mechanical union  it is the kamic selfmade
astral body that remains from one incarnation to another
producing in joint action with a new normal astral body a new
physical body for the innerself or angel taking the pilgrimage
through the lower world
all the angelmen did not enter the animal men on the pranic
ethericprakritic globes  only a few  it was a pilgrimage
through matter in which those who make it are meeting many
adventures but the legends are many and have no place in the
physics although the legends are all founded on the facts of the
physics
of the number of monads willing to undertake the pilgrimage
only a few of those within the kinetic belt of the manasic globe
have reached the pranic  only a few of those within the pranic
kinetic belts reached the etheric  and of all who have reached
this earth only a few may win their way back before the great
day bewithus
the problem of man and his relations to the universe are an
entirely different line of study from that of the spiritual
monad the oversoul of every prakritic atom  each prakritic
atom has what may be called a soul its threefold astral cause
and an oversoul or the threefold spiritual archetype or
causeless cause
every combination of these atoms whether a knife a leaf an
animal an earth a sun or a star has this soul and oversoul
once the idea of what is meant by these terms becomes clear the
difficulty in understanding them vanishes  the study of man is
physical in its lower branches  metaphysical only in its highest
and last analysis  the study of the monad is metaphysical from
start to finish  the two studies are apt to be confused because
metaphysically they are often joined for study the teacher
taking it for granted that the pupil fully understands the simple
and easy physics of the problem of humanity
this in crude and bold outline is the story of creation to the
fall of man according to the ancient physics translated into the
words and phrases of modern physics  the latter in the latest
discoveries of modern science seem to have stolen a shive
from the ancient loaf in the expectation that it would not be
detected  each and every step forward that modern science has
made in the past twenty years each and every discovery of every
kind in the physical field has been but the affirmative of some
ancient doctrine taught in the temples of the east before cain
took unto himself a wife
chapter ten
the septenary world
in the physical universe we have the four informing physical
globes so that as a whole or in its parts it is a string of
seven globes reaching from the highest spirit to the lowest
matter  the awakened universal consciousness in vibration
undifferentiated in the three globes above differentiated in
the four globes belowin its last analysis is all one  but there
is a gulf between matter and spirit radically dividing them and
in the physical universe we are concerned only with physics and
physical laws until we reach its outmost boundaries and come in
touch with the spiritual planes beyond
this is the view of the universe at first glance as in the
smaller universe of this earth we at first see only its solid and
liquid globes  and even after the discovery of the gas we do
not apprehend its important work in and behind the others until
it has been pointed out to us  nor do we at first apprehend the
work of the spiritual in the material and the object of
metaphysics is to show through the physics the connection
between them that the spirit works through matter  that where we
can see but four there are seven beads on each material string
and that the last bead of each string is itself a chain of beads
the chain of seven applying only to the seventh manifestation
or prakriti while the strings apply to the way in which they
come
on each unraveled string leading from our central sun down to a
planet there are seven beads corresponding to the seven globes in
the chain of each planet each to each yet not the same  there
is a distinction and it is no wonder there should have been
confusion at first and a mixing of strings with chains  the
physics as they progress will clear this confusion away
in the manasic globe which is the first differentiation of that
which forms the spiritual globes above the resulting mind or
manasa is mainly the differentiated divine mind of the highest
it has a chain of two globes only itself and the divine mind
globe although its string of globes is four
it is the perfected differentiation of the buddhi in manasa
that causes the formation of the pranic globes which have
chains of four and strings of five and the full and perfect
differentiation of the atma in manasaprana that causes the
formation of the etheric globes which have chains of six and
strings of six  consciousness buddhi and atma are practically
the same as the manasa prana and ether each to each only the
latter are differentiated and the former are not
each of the three astral globes is the reflection in matter of
the three spiritual globes beyond each to each and all to all
the difference between matter and spirit is a difference in
motion only  both are vibrating so that both are in mechanical
motion from force without like the waves of the ocean but only
the matter has what we may properly call motion of its own or
that produced from withinfrom the atom and each organism of it
up to the all as the vibration is from the all down to the atom
it is this centre of force in an atom this motion outside of
vibration or rather beside it which we call differentiation
brintons daring psychological speculation that mind was
coextensive with motion from organization was but a repetition
of one of the most ancient axioms
take our solar etheric globe  it has two other globes of matter
consubstantial  a globe of prana and a globe of manasa  they
are not beyond it or beside it but one with it atom for atom
but what are they in reality  globes of atma buddhi and
consciousness in which the atoms having organized are in
motion are they not
let this motion in this material universe cease and matter would
melt away and resolve into spirit  from spirit it came to
spirit it belongs and to spirit it returns
behind each and every astral globe whether the globe be but an
astral atom or an astral planet or an astral world  beyond its
physics there is a metaphysical globe its cause and that
is the real globe of which the astral is but a temporary
phenomenon  take a spiritual globe and differentiate it  the
motion resulting produces a material astral globe  stop the
motion  bring it to a state of rest  the astral shadow
disappears  it was merely spiritual phenomena
each and every astral atom is a model in miniature of the
material and spiritual universe  each and every prakritic atom
is the joint result of spirit and matter united and working
togetherof physics and metaphysics  and in its last analysis
pure spirit  pure metaphysics
behind each and every prakritic atom of our earth there are six
other atoms or globes three material shadows and three
spiritual realities so that it is a string of seventhe whole
universe in miniaturematerial and spiritual  and all things
combined and formed on a prakritic base are a chain of seven
whether a peach or a planet
the chain belongs to the prakritic plane  the lines of descent
from the light through the star and sun to planet are strings
the chains are beads of the same size strung on a thread  the
strings are beads of different sizes strung on a thread  the
beads of the chain are in coadunitionin the same space as gas
in water and the water in a sponge
in metaphysics this earth can only be regarded as a chain of
seven globes its three astral globes in coadunition having their
three spiritual doubles  of course no one of the higher globes
can be seen by the prakritic eye but that is not to say the
astral world cannot be seen by the astral eye in sleep or by the
person who qualifies himself for the astral world through the
development of his astral body  no upper globes of any chain in
the solar system can be seen says hp blavatsky in the secret
doctrine vol i p 187 yet she means by astronomers not by
sages  and she does not mean the upper globes in the stellar
system of alcyone and its companions
in pure physics the earth can only be regarded as a chain of four
globes consubstantial and in coadunitionfour in and three out
this makes seven and the metaphysician when talking physics uses
the metaphysical terms interchangeably and speaks of the chain
of seven globes meaning in one sentence the four material globes
making this earth  in another meaning the line of descent or
string of beads of different sizes reaching down from the divine
consciousness  and in still another the seven beads or globes of
the same size in coadunition to form this earth chain  to the
student who is thoroughly grounded in the eastern physics this
interweaving of the physical and metaphysical presents no
difficulties  but to the western mind just beginning the study
it is a tangle
we can now see what is meant by illusion or maya and understand
why such stress is laid upon it by every teacher
take the physical side first  the motion of a top gives it bands
of color to our eyes that it does not have at rest  they are
temporary and not permanent a result of motion merely  illusion
and not reality
the motion of the material atoms of the four planes in harmony
with their vibration a motion the spiritual world does not have
produces all material phenomena  this is of course within the
kinetic belts for above or below them there is no change and
its phenomena are the mere change in relation of one atom to
another caused by motion  the changes are not real  they
disappear when the motion stops  they have no existence in
matter above or below the belt
all phenomena of every kind are as much an illusion as the
supposed bands of colour around the top  the illusion is the
result of changes of relation in differentiated atoms caused by
their motion  without this motion the four material globes would
dissolve into the atomic dust of the manasic world with all that
is within them  the whole material universe is all illusion  a
mere temporary relation of its atoms through motion without
reality or permanence
what then is real  what is not illusion  that which is beyond
the physical that which is its cause and root  broadly the
metaphysical which is not the result of differentiated atoms
through relation  what was real in the top is real here  what
was illusion in the top is illusion here
the metaphysical or spiritual the terms are interchangeable
does not have to pass beyond the manasic globe to get on the
solid ground of reality  the spiritual world is here in every
physical atom and in every aggregation of them  in every planet
sun and star  for they are seven each and every one not four
behind the illusion of one atom or many whether here or on
alcyone there is reality and permanency in the undifferentiated
cause the spiritual archetype the three higher beads on the
string which are the proper study of metaphysics
chapter eleven
stumbling blocks in eastern physics
the western student of the ancient eastern physics soon meets
serious stumblingblocks  and one at the very threshold has in
the last half century turned many back  in beginning his study
of the solar system the pupil is told
the first three planetsmercury venus and the moonare dead
and disintegrating  evolution on them has ceased  the proof of
this is found in the fact that they have no axial rotation
mercury and venus always presenting the same surface to their
father the sun and the moon the same surface to its daughter
the earth
this is a concrete statement of physical fact at which the
western student protests  if in the whole range of western
astronomical science there is any one fact that he has accepted
as absolutely proved it is that mercury revolves once in 24h
5m 305s and venus once in 23h 21m 22s  he would as soon
credit a statement that the earth has no axial rotation as that
mercury or venus has none  and if he continues his study of
eastern physics it is with no confidence in its accuracy and as
a matter of curiosity
the statement that mercury venus and the moon are dead
and disintegrating the former two always presenting the
same surface to the sun is the basis for an elaborate
superstructure both in the physics and the metaphysics of the
east  it is used in physics to explain how the evolutionary
wave came to an end at the perfection of the mineral on mercury
with the loss of its axial rotation  how the wave then passed
on to venus with the seed of the vegetable kingdom where the
vegetable evolution ended with the loss of axial rotation
how from venus it leaped to the moon mother of animals and
controller of animal life with the seed of animal life in the
vegetable  and how finally it came to the earth when the moon
ceased to revolve bringing in the animal the seed of man  here
man will be evolved and perfected  man has not yet been born
on this earth they say  he is still in a prenatal or embryonic
condition within the animal
the lunar pitris the menseed have a physical reason for being
if this evolutionary theory be true  none if it is not  axial
rotation is necessary in evolution the ancient physics teaches
which must cease with it  the reasons for this are too lengthy
to give here  briefly the rotation makes the electrical flow
and a thermopilic dynamo of each planet
the ancient astronomical teaching is absolutely true  there will
not be a work on astronomy published in europe or the united
states this year or hereafter that will not state that mercury
and venus revolve on their axes in the same time that they
revolve around the sun which is another way of saying that
they have no axial rotation always presenting the same face to
the sun and an inaccurate way of presenting the truth  the
screw that holds the tire at the outer end of the spoke does not
revolve once on its axis each time the wheel revolves  run a
cane through an orange and swing it around the orange has not
revolved once on its axis  nor does the stone in a sling
revolve once on its axis for each revolution around the hand
the motion of mercury is identically that of the impaled orange
or the stone in the sling  it has no axis and no axial rotation
the modern astronomers detected in pretenses to knowledge they
never possessed let themselves down easy
this discovery of no axial rotation by the interior planets
made by schiaparelli and confirmed by flammarion in 1894 has
since been fully verified by our western astronomers  all the
new astronomies accept it  but the admission of astronomical
error to speak politely comes too late for the student it
turned back from his study of eastern physics  he cannot regain
his lost faith and lost ground
thirty years ago proctor made it clear to western students that
the orbit of the moon was a cycloidal curve a drawnout spring
around the sun the earths orbit being coincident with its axis
and that the moon was astronomically and correctly a satellite
of the sun not a satellite of the earth  this has been the
eastern view and teaching from time immemorial
the eastern distinction between father sun and mother moon and
the classification of the latter as a planet did not disturb the
western student  he understood that  it was the absolute
accuracy of modern astronomers in regard to the length of the
day on mercury or venus which the astronomers declared had
been corrected down to the fraction of a second that made it
impossible for him to accept the eastern physics when the latter
squarely contradicted his own
this was but the first of many similar stumblingblocks in the
path of the student of eastern physics
     few were the followers straggling far
     that reached the lake of vennachar
and when they did this was what they had to face
the planets absorb and use nearly all the solar energyall
except the very small amount the minor specks of cosmic dust may
receive  there is not the least particle of the suns light or
heat or any one of the seven conditions of the solar energy
wasted  except for the planets it is not manifested  it is
not  there is no light no heat no form of solar energy except
on the planets as it is transferred from the laya center of each
in the sun to them  the etheric globe is cold and dark except
along the lines to themthe paths of fohat solar energy
six laya centers are manifested in the sun  one is laid aside
though the wheels planets around the one eye be seven this
alludes to the moon whose laya center in the sun is now also
that of the earth  but it is considered as a planet  what each
receives that it also gives back  there is nothing lost
that settles it says one student  and the others agree  of
the hundred who started
     the foremost horseman rode alone
before the next step was won
in the light of the tardy but perfect justification of the first
stumblingblock this statement may be worth following out to
see what it means and how absurd it can be  an etheric
globe  cold as absolute zero dark as erebus with here and
there small pencils of light and heat from the sun to the planets
just rays and nothing moreis a very different one from the
fiery furnace at absolute zero of the modern physicist
on a line drawn from the center of the earth to the center of the
moon there is a point where the weights of the two bodies are
said in our physics exactly to balance and it lies says our
physics 2900 miles from the center of the earth and 1100
miles from the surface  this is the earths laya center of
the eastern physics  it is of great importance in problems of
life  but it may be passed over for the present
between the earth and the sunprecisely speaking between this
laya center and the sunthere is a point of balance which
falls within the photosphere of the sun  this point in the sun
is the earths solar laya the occult or hidden earth of the
metaphysics
a diagram will make this clearer  draw a line from the laya
center in the sun to that in the earth  draw a narrow ellipse
with this line as its major axis and shade it  at each end of
the axis strike the beginning of an ellipse that will be tangent
if positive energy is along the shaded ellipse negative energy
is in each field beyondearth and sun  this is a very crude
illustration of a fundamental statement elaborated to the most
minute detail in explanation of all astronomical phenomena  but
for the moment it will do
the point is that along this axial line connecting the
laya centers play all the seven solar forceslight heat
electricity etcthat affect the earth and on every side of
this line is the electric field of these forces  to this line
any escaping solar energy is drawn as the electricity of the air
is drawn to a live wire or magnet  but there is little or none
to escape  from the laya point in the sun to the laya point in
the earth the solar energy is transferred as sound is carried
along a beam of light photophone or electricity from one point
to another without a wire
to the advanced student of electricity the ancient teaching is
easily apprehended  to others it is difficult to make clear
these laya centers it says are the transforming points of
energy  from the earth laya to the solar laya centre the
energy we may say is positive  beyond both the solar and the
earth laya centre in the fields touching at them it is negative
or vice versa  the line connecting the layas is the path of
fohatthe personification of solar energy
this is a very crude and brief way of putting many pages of
teaching but the important point is that this line between the
layas is one of solar energy with a dynamic field of solar
energy elliptical in shape connecting with the reverse fields
at the laya points  these dead points are the limits of each
electric field which create we say in electrical work
opposing fields beyond them
each one of these planets has its laya centre inside the suns
photosphere  each planet has a line of solar energy with its
field of solar energynot only a wireless telegraph but a
wireless lighting heating and lifegiving system  these six
solar laya points are the six hidden planets the earth and
moon being one of the ancient metaphysics  the moon is the one
laid aside  in their reception of energy from the sun it is
as if the planet were at the solar laya point or connected with
it by a special pipeline  the position of these six planetary
laya points in the sun is indicated by the position of the
planets in the heavens and they may often influence or modify
one another  if mars jupiter or saturn is anywhere near
conjunction with the earth not only will a part of their
fields be joined but their laya points in the sun will be
modified
the physical basis of the old astrology was the physical
interferences of these fields of solar energy  and what it
depended on mainly in its work was the position of the six hidden
planets or laya centers which was shown by the position of the
planet with reference to the earth  that the planets themselves
affected any one or anything on this earth no real astrologer
ever believed  that their position in the heavens indicated
certain changes and modifications of the flow of solar energy to
the earth they knew from their knowledge of physics  the
twelve houses are in the sun says hermes six in the north and
six in the south  connect them with the zodiac and the
position of the planets shows the interferences of the solar
currents
the one objection to this ancient theory is that it does not
present enough difficulties  the present value to science of the
many theories in relation to the sun is the impossibility of
reconciling any two of them and the fact that no two theorists
can unite to pummel a third  this ancient theory does not call
for any great amount of heat light or energy in any condition
to keep the cosmos in ordernot even enough for two persons to
quarrel over  it merely turns the sun into a large dynamo
connected with smaller dynamos and these with one another with
return currents by which there is nothing lost  in its
details it accounts for all factsneatly simply and without
exclamation points  it is so simple and homespun so lacking in
the gaudiness that makes for example our light and heat less
than the billionth part wasted on space always at absolute zero
that we may have to wait many centuries to have it verified and
confirmed by our western science  that it will be verified
in time even as the first stumblingblock has been removed at
the end of the nineteenth century its students may at least
hope
the lesson if there is one is that the western student of
eastern physics does not ride an auto along asphalted roads
he must own himself and not be owned by another man or even
by modern scienc
