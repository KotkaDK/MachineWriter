the general design of the following sheets is to inlist imagination
under the banner of science and to lead her votaries from the looser
analogies which dress out the imagery of poetry to the stricter ones
which form the ratiocination of philosophy while their particular design
is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of botany by
introducing them to the vestibule of that delightful science and
recommending to their attention the immortal works of the swedish
naturalist linneus
in the first poem or economy of vegetation the physiology of plants
is delivered and the operation of the elements as far as they may be
supposed to affect the growth of vegetables but the publication of this
part is deferred to another year for the purpose of repeating some
experiments on vegetation mentioned in the notes in the second poem or
loves of the plants which is here presented to the reader the sexual
system of linneus is explained with the remarkable properties of many
particular plants
the author has withheld this work excepting a few pages many years
from the press according to the rule of horace hoping to have rendered
it more worthy the acceptance of the publicbut finds at length that
he is less able from disuse to correct the poetry and from want of
leizure to amplify the annotations
in this second edition the plants amaryllis orchis and cannabis are
inserted with two additional prints of flowers some alterations are made
in gloriosa and tulipa and the description of the saltmines in poland
is removed to the first poem on the economy of vegetation
preface
linneus has divided the vegetable world into 24 classes these classes
into about 120 orders these orders contain about 2000 families or
genera and these families about 20000 species besides the innumerable
varieties which the accidents of climate or cultivation have added to
these species
the classes are distinguished from each other in this ingenious system
by the number situation adhesion or reciprocal proportion of the males
in each flower the orders in many of these classes are distinguished
by the number or other circumstances of the females the families or
genera are characterized by the analogy of all the parts of the flower
or fructification the species are distinguished by the foliage of the
plant and the varieties by any accidental circumstance of colour taste
or odour the seeds of these do not always produce plants similar to the
parent as in our numerous fruittrees and garden flowers which are
propagated by grafts or layers
the first eleven classes include the plants in whose flowers both the
sexes reside and in which the males or stamens are neither united nor
unequal in height when at maturity and are therefore distinguished from
each other simply by the number of males in each flower as is seen in
the annexed plate copied from the dictionaire botanique of m bulliard
in which the numbers of each division refer to the botanic classes
class i one male monandria includes the plants which possess but one
stamen in each flower
ii two males diandria two stamens
iii three males triandria three stamens
iv four males tetrandria four stamens
v five males pentandria five stamens
vi six males hexandria six stamens
vii seven males heptandria seven stamens
viii eight males octandria eight stamens
ix nine males enneandria nine stamens
x ten males decandria ten stamens
xi twelve males dodecandria twelve stamens
the next two classes are distinguished not only by the number of equal
and disunited males as in the above eleven classes but require an
additional circumstance to be attended to viz whether the males or
stamens be situated on the calyx or not
xii twenty males icosandria twenty stamens inserted on the calyx or
flowercup as is well seen in the last figure of no xii in the annexed
plate
xiii many males polyandria from 20 to 100 stamens which do not
adhere to the calyx as is well seen in the first figure of no xiii in
the annexed plate
in the next two classes not only the number of stamens are to be
observed but the reciprocal proportions in respect to height
xiv two powers didynamia four stamens of which two are lower than
the other two as is seen in the two first figures of no xiv
xv four powers tetradynamia six stamens of which four are taller
and the two lower ones opposite to each other as is seen in the third
figure of the upper row in no 15
the five subsequent classes are distinguished not by the number of the
males or stamens but by their union or adhesion either by their
anthers or filaments or to the female or pistil
xvi one brotherhood monadelphia many stamens united by their
filaments into one company as in the second figure below of no xvi
xvii two brotherhoods diadelphia many stamens united by their
filaments into two companies as in the uppermost fig no xvii
xviii many brotherhoods polyadelphia many stamens united by their
filaments into three or more companies as in no xviii
xix confederate males syngenesia many stamens united by their
anthers as in first and second figures no xix
xx feminine males gynandria many stamens attached to the pistil
the next three classes consist of plants whose flowers contain but one
of the sexes or if some of them contain both sexes there are other
flowers accompanying them of but one sex
xxi one house monoecia male flowers and female flowers separate but
on the same plant
xxii two houses dioecia male flowers and female flowers separate on
different plants
xxiii polygamy polygamia male and female flowers on one or more
plants which have at the same time flowers of both sexes
the last class contains the plants whose flowers are not discernible
xxiv clandestine marriage cryptogamia
the orders of the first thirteen classes are founded on the number
of females or pistils and distinguished by the names one female
monogynia two females digynia three females trigynia c as is
seen in no i which represents a plant of one male one female and in
the first figure of no xi which represents a flower with twelve males
and three females for where the pistils have no apparent styles the
summits or stigmas are to be numbered and in the first figure of no
xii which represents a flower with twenty males and many females and in
the last figure of the same no which has twenty males and one female
and in no xiii which represents a flower with many males and many
females
the class of two powers is divided into two natural orders into such
as have their seeds naked at the bottom of the calyx or flower cup and
such as have their seeds covered as is seen in no xiv fig 3 and 5
the class of four powers is divided also into two orders in one of
these the seeds are inclosed in a silicule as in shepherds purse
no xiv fig 5 in the other they are inclosed in a silique as in
wallflower fig 4
in all the other classes excepting the classes confederate males and
clandestine marriage as the character of each class is distinguished by
the situations of the males the character of the orders is marked by the
numbers of them in the class one brotherhood no xvi fig 3 the order
of ten males is represented and in the class two brotherhoods no xvii
fig 2 the order ten males is represented
in the class confederate males the orders are chiefly distinguished by
the fertility or barrenness of the florets of the disk or ray of the
compound flower
and in the class of clandestine marriage the four orders are termed
ferns mosses flags and fungusses
the orders are again divided into genera or families which are all
natural associations and are described from the general resemblances of
the parts of fructification in respect to their number form situation
and reciprocal proportion these are the calyx or flowercup as seen in
no iv fig 1 no x fig 1 and 3 no xiv fig 1 2 3 4 second
the corol or blossom as seen in no i ii c third the males or
stamens as in no iv fig 1 and no viii fig 1 fourth the females
or pistils as in no i no xii fig 1 no xiv fig 3 no xv fig
3 fifth the pericarp or fruitvessel as no xv fig 4 5 no xvii
fig 2 sixth the seeds
the illustrious author of the sexual system of botany in his preface to
his account of the natural orders ingeniously imagines that one
plant of each natural order was created in the beginning and that the
intermarriages of these produced one plant of every genus or family and
that the intermarriages of these generic or family plants produced all
the species and lastly that the intermarriages of the individuals of
the species produced the varieties
in the following poem the name or number of the class or order of each
plant is printed in italics as two brother swains one house
contains them and the word secret expresses the class of
clandestine marriage
the reader who wishes to become further acquainted with this delightful
field of science is advised to study the words of the great master and
is apprized that they are exactly and literally translated into english
by a society at lichfield in four volumes octavo
to the system of vegetables is prefixed a copious explanation of all the
terms used in botany translated from a thesis of dr elmsgreen with the
plates and references from the philosophia botannica of linneus
to the families of plants is prefixed a catalogue of the names of plants
and other botanic terms carefully accented to shew their proper
pronunciation a work of great labour and which was much wanted not
only by beginners but by proficients in botany
                                   
proem
gentle reader
lo here a camera obscura is presented to thy view in which are lights
and shades dancing on a whited canvas and magnified into apparent
lifeif thou art perfectly at leasure for such trivial amusement walk
in and view the wonders of my inchanted garden
whereas p ovidius naso a great necromancer in the famous court of
augustus caesar did by art poetic transmute men women and even gods
and goddesses into trees and flowers i have undertaken by similar
art to restore some of them to their original animality after having
remained prisoners so long in their respective vegetable mansions and
have here exhibited them before thee which thou mayst contemplate
as diverse little pictures suspended over the chimney of a ladys
dressingroom connected only by a slight festoon of ribbons and
which though thou mayst not be acquainted with the originals may amuse
thee by the beauty of their persons their graceful attitudes or the
brilliancy of their dress

callitriche l 45 finehair stargrass one male and two females
inhabit each flower the upper leaves grow in form of a star whence it
is called stellaria aquatica by ray and others its stems and leaves
float far on the water and are often so matted together as to bear a
person walking on them the male sometimes lives in a separate flower
collinsonia l 51 two males one female i have lately observed a
very singular circumstance in this flower the two males stand widely
diverging from each other and the female bends herself into contact
first with one of them and after some time leaves this and applies
herself to the other it is probable one of the anthers may be mature
before  the other see note on gloriosa and genista the
females in nigella devil in the bush are very tall compared to the
males and bending over in a circle to them give the flower some
resemblance to a regal crown the female of the epilobium angustisolium
rose bay willow herb bends down amongst the males for several days
and becomes upright again when impregnated
genista l 57 dyers broom ten males and one female inhabit this
flower the males are generally united at the bottom in two sets whence
linneus has named the class two brotherhoods in the genista however
they are united in but one set the flowers of this class are called
papilionaceous from their resemblance to a butterfly as the peablossom
in the spartium scoparium or common broom i have lately observed
a curious circumstance the males or stamens are in two sets one set
rising a quarter of an inch above the other the upper set does not arrive
at their maturity so soon as the lower and the stigma or head of the
female is produced amongst the upper or immature set but as soon as
the pistil grows tall enough to burst open the keelleaf or hood of the
flower it bends itself round in an instant like a french horn and
inserts its head or stigma amongst the lower or mature set of males
the pistil or female continues to grow in length and in a few days
the stigma arrives again amongst the upper set by the time they become
mature this wonderful contrivance is readily seen by opening the
keelleaf of the flowers of broom before they burst spontaneously see
note on collinsonia gloriosa draba
        with rival love for fair collinia sigh
        knit the dark brow and roll the unsteady eye

        and hand in hand the laughing belle address
        alike to all she bows with wanton air
        rolls her dark eye and waves her golden hair
melissa l 60 balm in each flower there are four males and one
female two of the males stand higher than the other two whence the name
of the class two powers i have observed in the ballota and others of
this class that the two lower stamens or males become mature before the
two higher after they have shed their dust they turn themselves away
outwards and the pistil or female continuing to grow a little taller
is applied to the upper stamens see gloriosa and genista
all the plants of this class which have naked seeds are aromatic the
marum and nepeta are particularly delightful to cats no other brute
animals seem pleased with any odours but those of their food or prey
meadia l 61 dodecatheon american cowslip five males and one
female the males or anthers touch each other the uncommon beauty of
this flower occasioned linneus to give it a name signifying the twelve
heathen gods and dr mead to affix his own name to it the pistil is
much longer than the stamens hence the flowerstalks have their elegant
bend that the stigma may hang downwards to receive the fecundating dust
of the anthers and the petals are so beautifully turned back to prevent
the rain or dew drops from sliding down and washing off this dust
prematurely and at the same time exposing it to the light and air as
soon as the seeds are formed it erects all the flowerstalks to prevent
them from falling out and thus loses the beauty of its figure is this
a mechanical effect or does it indicate a vegetable storg to preserve
its offspring see note on ilex and gloriosa
in the meadia the borago cyclamen solanum and many others the
filaments are very short compared with the slyle hence it became
necessary 1st to furnish the stamens with long anthers 2d to lengthen
and bend the peduncle or flowerslalk that the  flower might hang
downwards 3d to reflect the petals 4th to erect these peduncles when
the germ was fecundated we may reason upon this by observing that all
this apparatus might have been spared if the filaments alone had grown
longer and that thence in these flowers that the filaments are the most
unchangeable parts and that thence their comparative length in respect
to the style would afford a most permanent mark of their generic
character

country has four males that of sweden has but two the genus albuca the
bignonia catalpa gratiola and hemlockleaved geranium have only half
their filaments crowned with anthers in like manner the florets which
form the rays of the flowers of the order frustraneous polygamy of the
class syngenesia or confederate males as the sunflower are furnished
with a style only and no stigma and are thence barren there is also
a style without a stigma in the whole order dioecia gynandria the male
flowers of which are thence barren the opulus is another plant which
contains some unprolific flowers in like manner some tribes of insects
have males females and neuters among them as bees wasps ants
there is a curious circumstance belonging to the class of insects which
have two wings or diptera analogous to the rudiments of stamens above
described viz two little knobs are found placed each on a stalk or
peduncle generally under a little arched scale which appear to be
rudiments of hinder wings and are called by linneus halteres or
poisers a term of his introduction at bladh amaen acad v 7 other
animals have marks of having in a long process of time undergone
changes in some parts of their bodies which may have been effected to
accommodate them to new ways of procuring their food the existence of
teats on the breasts of male animals and which are generally replete with
a thin kind of milk at their nativity is a wonderful instance of this
kind perhaps all the productions of nature are in their progress to
greater perfection an idea countenanced by the modern discoveries and
deductions concerning the progressive formation of the solid parts of the
terraqueous globe and consonant to the dignity of the creator of all
things
alcea l 69 flore pleno double hollyhock the double flowers
so much admired by the florists are termed by the botanist vegetable
monsters in some of these the petals are multiplied three or four times
but without excluding the stamens hence they produce some seeds as
campanula and stramoneum but in others the petals become so numerous as
totally to exclude the stamens or males as caltha peonia and alcea
these produce no seeds and are termed eunuchs philos botan no 150
these vegetable monsters are formed in many ways 1st by the
multiplication of the petals and the exclusion of the nectaries as in
larkspur 2d by the multiplication of the nectaries and exclusion of
the petals as in columbine 3d in some flowers growing in cymes the
wheelshape flowers in the margin are multiplied to the exclusion of
the bellshape flowers in the centre as in gelderrose 4th by the
elongation of the florets in the centre instances of both these are
found in daisy and feverfew for other kinds of vegetable monsters see
plantago
the perianth is not changed in double flowers hence the genus or family
may be often discovered by the calyx as in hepatica ranunculus alcea
in those flowers which have many petals the lowest series of the petals
remains unchanged in respect to number hence the natural number of the
petals is easily discovered as in poppies roses and nigella or devil
in a bulb phil bot p 128
iris l 71 flower de luce three males one female some of the
species have a beautifully freckled flower the large stigma or head
of the female covers the three males counterfeiting a petal with its

cupressus l 73 cypress one house the males live in separate
flowers but on the same plant the males of some of these plants which
are in separate flowers from the females have an elastic membrane which
disperses their dust to a considerable distance when the anthers burst
open this dust on a fine day may often be seen like a cloud hanging
round the common nettle the males and females of all the conebearing
plants are in separate flowers either on the same or on different
plants they produce resins and many of them are supposed to supply the

athenians buried the bodies of their heroes in coffins of cypress as
being not subject to decay a similar durability has also been ascribed
to cedar thus horace

plants there are many instances on record where female plants have been
impregnated at very great distance from their male the dust discharged
from the anthers is very light small and copious so that it may spread
very wide in the atmosphere and be carried to the distant pistils
without the supposition of any particular attraction these plants
resemble some insects as the ants and cochineal insect of which the
males have wings but not the female

anthoxanthum l 83 vernal grass two males two females the other
grasses have three males and two females the flowers of this grass give
the fragrant scent to hay i am informed it is frequently viviparous
that is that it bears sometimes roots or bulbs instead of seeds which
after a time drop off and strike root into the ground this circumstance
is said to obtain in many of the alpine grasses whose seeds are
perpetually devoured by small birds the festuca dometorum fescue grass
of the bushes produces bulbs from the sheaths of its straw the allium
magicum or magical onion produces onions on its head instead of seeds
the polygonum viviparum viviparous bistort rises about a foot high
with a beautiful spike of flowers which are succeeded by buds or bulbs
which fall off and take root there is a bulb frequently seen on
birchtrees like a birds nest which seems to be a similar attempt of
nature to produce another tree which falling off might take root in
spongy ground
there is an instance of this double mode of production in the animal
kingdom which is equally extraordinary the same species of aphis is

florets which constitute the disk of the flowers in this class contain
in each five males surrounding one female which are connected at top
whence the name of the class an italian writer in a discourse on the
irritability of flowers asserts that if the top of the floret be
touched all the filaments which support the cylindrical anther will
contrast themselves and that by thus raising or depressing the anther
the whole of the prolific dust is collected on the stigma he adds that
if one filament be touched after it is separated from the floret that it
will contract like the muscular fibres of animal bodies his experiments

the other three stamens bend over and approach the pistil in the
fritillaria persica the six stamens are of equal lengths and the
anthers lie at a distance from the pistil and three alternate ones
approach first and when these decline the other three approach in the
lithrum salicaria which has twelve males and one female a beautiful
red flower which grows on the banks of rivers six of the males arrive
at maturity and surround the female some time before the other six when
these decline the other six rise up and supply their places several
other flowers have in similar manner two sets of stamens of different
ages as adoxa lychnis saxifraga see genista perhaps a difference
in the time of their maturity obtains in all these flowers which have
numerous stamens in the kahnia the ten stamens lie round the pistil like
the radii of a wheel and each anther is concealed in a nich of the corol
to protect it from cold and moisture these anthers rise separately from
their niches and approach the pistil for a time and then recede to
their former situations

flower the viscous material which surrounds the stalks under the
flowers of this plant and of the cucubulus otites is a curious
contrivance to prevent various insects from plundering the honey or
devouring the seed in the dionaea muscipula there is a still more
wonderful contrivance to prevent the depredations of insects the leaves
are armed with long teeth like the antenn of insects and lie spread
upon the ground round the stem and are so irritable that when an
insect creeps upon them they fold up and crush or pierce it to death
the last professor linneus in his supplementum plantarum gives the
following account of the arum muscivorum the flower has the smell of
carrion by which the flies are invited to lay their eggs in the chamber
of the flower but in vain endeavour to escape being prevented by the
hairs pointing inwards and thus perish in the flower whence its name
of flyeater p 411 in the dypsacus is another contrivance for this

        in vain the efforts of your whirring wings
        go seek your gilded mates and infant hives
150  nor taste the honey purchasd with your lives
        when heavens high vault condensing clouds deform
        fair amaryllis flies the incumbent storm
amaryllis l 152 formosissima most beautiful amaryllis six males
one female some of the bellflowers close their apertures at night or
in rainy or cold weather as the convolvulus and thus protect their
included stamens and pistils other bellflowers hang their apertures
downwards as many of the lilies in those the pistil when at maturity
is longer than the stamens and by this pendant attitude of the bell
when the anthers burst their dust falls on the stigma and these are at
the same time sheltered as with an umbrella from rain and dews but as
a free exposure to the air is necessary for their fecundation the style
and filaments in many of these flowers continue to grow longer after the
bell is open and hang down below its rim in others as in the martagon
the bell is deeply divided and the divisions are reflected upwards that
they may not prevent the access of air and at the same time afford
some shelter from perpendicular rain or dew other bellflowers as the
hemerocallis and amaryllis have their bells nodding only as it were or
hanging obliquely toward the horizon which as their stems are slender
turn like a weathercock from the wind and thus very effectually preserve
their inclosed stamens and anthers from the rain and cold many of these
flowers both before and after their season of fecundation erect their
heads perpendicular to the horizon like the meadia which cannot be
explained from meer mechanism
the amaryllis formosissima is a flower of the last mentioned kind and
affords an agreeable example of art in the vegetable economy 1 the
pistil is of great length compared with the stamens and this i suppose
to have been the most unchangeable part of the flower as in meadia
which see 2 to counteract this circumstance the pistil and stamens are
made to decline downwards that the prolific dust might fall from the
anthers on the stigma 3 to produce this effect and to secure it when
produced the corol is lacerated contrary to what occurs in other
flowers of this genus and the lowest division with the two next lowest
ones are wrapped closely over the style and filaments binding them
forceibly down lower toward the horizon than the usual inclination of the
bell in this genus and thus constitutes a most elegant flower there is
another contrivance for this purpose in the hemerocallis flava the long
pistil often is bent somewhat like the capital letter n with design to
shorten it and thus to bring the stigma amongst the anthers

ilex l 161 holly four males four females many plants like many
animals are furnished with arms for their protection these are either
aculei prickles as in rose and barberry which are formed from the
outer bark of the plant or spin thorns as in hawthorn which are an
elongation of the wood and hence more difficult to be torn off than the
former or stimuli stings as in the nettles which are armed with a
venomous fluid for the annoyance of naked animals the shrubs and trees
which have prickles or thorns are grateful food to many animals as
goosberry and gorse and would be quickly devoured if not thus armed
the stings seem a protection against some kinds of insects as well
as the naked mouths of quadrupeds many plants lose their thorns by
cultivation as wild animals lose their ferocity and some of them
their horns a curious circumstance attends the large hollies in
needwoodforest they are armed with thorny leaves about eight feet
high and have smooth leaves above as if they were conscious that
horses and cattle could not reach their upper branches see note on
meadia and on mancinella the numerous clumps of hollies in
needwoodforest serve as landmarks to direct the travellers
across it in various directions and as a shelter to the deer and cattle
in winter and in scarce seasons supply them with much food for when the
upper branches which are without prickles are cut down the deer crop

hollies seems to be a very similar material to the elastic gum or indian

tulipa l 205 tulip what is in common language called a bulbous
root is by linneus termed the hybernacle or winterlodge of the young
plant as these bulbs in every respect resemble buds except in their
being produced under ground and include the leaves and flower in
miniature which are to be expanded in the ensuing spring by cautiously
cutting in the early spring through the concentric coats of a
tuliproot longitudinally from the top to the base and taking them off

lonicera l 243 caprifolium honeysuckle five males one female
nature has in many flowers used a wonderful apparatus to guard the
nectary or honeygland from insects in the honeysuckle the petal
terminates in a long tube like a cornucopiae or horn of plenty and
the honey is produced at the bottom of it in aconitum monkshood the
nectaries stand upright like two horns covered with a hood which abounds
with such acrid matter that no insects penetrate it in helleborus
hellebore the many nectaries are placed in a circle like little
pitchers and add much to the beauty of the flower in the columbine
aquilegia the nectary is imagined to be like the neck and body of a
bird and the two petals standing upon each side to represent wings
whence its name of columbine as if resembling a nest of young pigeons
fluttering whilst their parent feeds them the importance of the nectary
in the economy of vegetation is explained at large in the notes on part
the first
many insects are provided with a long and pliant proboscis for the
purpose of acquiring this grateful food as a variety of bees moths and
butterflies but the sphinx convolvuli or unicorn moth is furnished
with the most remarkable proboscis in this climate it carries it rolled
up in concentric circles under its chin and occasionally extends it to
above three inches in length this trunk consists of joints and muscles
and seems to have more versatile movements than the trunk of the
elephant and near its termination is split into two capillary tubes the
excellence of this contrivance for robbing the flowers of their honey
keeps this beautiful insect fat and bulky though it flies only in the
evening when the flowers have closed their petals and are thence more
difficult of access at the same time the brilliant colours of the moth
contribute to its safety by making it mistaken by the late sleeping
birds for the flower it rests on
besides these there is a curious contrivance attending the ophrys
commonly called the beeorchis and the flyorchis with some kinds of
the delphinium called beelarkspurs to preserve their honey in these
the nectary and petals resemble in form and colour the insects which
plunder them and thus it may be supposed they often escape these hourly
robbers by having the appearance of being preoccupied see note on

flower examined by the microscope some vesicles are perceived from
which a fluid had escaped and that those which still retain it explode
if they be wetted like an eolopile suddenly exposed to a strong heat

the thick downy clothing of some vegetables seems designed to protect
them from the injuries of cold like the wool of animals those bodies
which are bad conductors of electricity are also bad conductors of heat
as glass wax air hence either of the two former of these may be melted
by the flame of a blowpipe very near the fingers which hold it without
burning them and the last by being confined on the surface of animal
bodies in the interstices of their fur or wool prevents the escape of
their natural warmth to which should be added that the hairs themselves
are imperfect conductors the fat or oil of whales and other northern
animals seems designed for the same purpose of preventing the too sudden
escape of the heat of the body in cold climates snow protects vegetables
which are covered by it from cold both because it is a bad conductor of
heat itself and contains much air in its pores if a piece of camphor be
immersed in a snowball except one extremity of it on setting fire to

mimosa i 301 the sensitive plant of the class polygamy one house
naturalists have not explained the immediate cause of the collapsing of
the sensitive plant the leaves meet and close in the night during the
sleep of the plant or when exposed to much cold in the daytime in the
same manner as when they are affected by external violence folding their
upper surfaces together and in part over each other like scales or
tiles so as to expose as little of the upper surface as may be to the
air but do not indeed collapse quite so far since i have found when
touched in the night during their sleep they fall still further
especially when touched on the footstalks between the stems and the
leaflets which seems to be their most sensitive or irritable part now
as their situation after being exposed to external violence resembles
their sleep but with a greater degree of collapse may it not be owing
to a numbness or paralysis consequent to too violent irritation like the
faintings of animals from pain or fatigue i kept a sensitive plant in
a dark room till some hours after daybreak its leaves and leafstalks
were collapsed as in its most profound sleep and on exposing it to the
light above twenty minutes passed before the plant was thoroughly awake
and had quite expanded itself during the night the upper or smoother

near the same coincidence was observed in england by stillingfleet the
word coccux in greek signifies both a young fig and a cuckoo which is
supposed to have arisen from the coincidence of their appearance in greece
perhaps a similar coincidence of appearance in some parts of asia gave
occasion to the story of the loves of the rose and nightingale so much
celebrated by the eastern poets see dianthus the times however of the
appearance of vegetables in the spring seem occasionally to be influenced
by their acquired habits as well as by their sensibility to heat for the
roots of potatoes onions c will germinate with much less heat in the
spring than in the autumn as is easily observable where these roots are
stored for use and hence malt is best made in the spring 2d the grains
and roots brought from more southern latitudes germinate here sooner than
those which are brought from more northern ones owing to their acquired

kalms travels 4th the parts of animals become more sensible to heat
after having been previously exposed to  cold as our hands glow on coming
into the house after having held snow in them this seems to happen to
vegetables for vines in grapehouses which have been exposed to the
winters cold will become forwarder and more vigorous than those which
have been kept during the winter in the house kenedy on gardening this
accounts for the very rapid vegetation in the northern latitudes after the
solution of the snows
the increase of the irritability of plants in respect to heat after
having been previously exposed to cold is further illustrated by an
experiment of dr walkers he cut apertures into a birchtree at
different heights and on the 26th of march some of these apertures bled
or oozed with the sapjuice when the thermometer was at 39 which same
apertures did not bleed on the 13th of march when the thermometer was at
44 the reason of this i apprehend was because on the night of the 25th
the thermometer was as low as 34 whereas on the night of the 12th it was
at 41 though the ingenious author ascribes it to another cause trans

comment de rebus lipsi this circumstance is worth further attention
the colouring materials of vegetables like those which serve the purpose
of tanning varnishing and the various medical purposes do not seem
essential to the life of the plant but seem given it as a defence
against the depredations of insects or other animals to whom these
materials are nauseous or deleterious to insects and many smaller
animals their colours contribute to conceal them from the larger ones
which prey upon them caterpillars which feed on leaves are generally
green and earthworms the colour of the earth which they inhabit
butterflies which frequent flowers are coloured like them small birds
which frequent hedges have greenish backs like the leaves and light
coloured bellies like the sky and are hence less visible to the hawk
who passes under them or over them those birds which are much
amongst flowers as the goldfinch fringilla carduelis are furnished
with vivid colours the lark partridge hare are the colour of the dry
vegetables or earth on which they rest and frogs vary their colour with
the mud of the streams which they frequent and those which live on
trees are green fish which are generally suspended in water and
swallows which are generally suspended in air have their backs the
colour of the distant ground and their bellies of the sky in the colder
climates many of these become white during the existence of the snows
hence there is apparent design in the colours of animals whilst those
of vegetables seem consequent to the other properties of the materials

age the words relaxation and bracing which are generally thought
expressive of the effects of warm and cold bathing are mechanical terms
properly applied to drums or strings but are only metaphors when applied

cause of old age seems to reside in the inirritability of the finer
vessels or parts of our system hence these cease to act and collapse

up by bladders of air which are formed in the duplicatures of its
leaves and forms immense floating fields of vegetation the young
ones branching out from the larger ones and borne on similar little
airvessels it is also found in the warm baths of patavia where the
leaves are formed into curious cells or labyrinths for the purpose of
floating on the water see ulva labyrinthiformis lin spec plant the
air contained in these cells was found by dr priestley to be sometimes
purer than common air and sometimes less pure the airbladders of fish
seem to be similar organs and serve to render them buoyant in the water
in some of these as in the cod and haddock a red membrane consisting
of a great number of leaves or duplicatures is found within the airbag
which probably secretes this air from the blood of the animal monro
physiol of fish p 28 to determine whether this air when first
separated from the blood of the animal or plant be dephlogisticated air
is worthy inquiry the bladdersena colutea and bladdernut
staphyla have their seedvessels distended with air the ketmia has
the upper joint of the stem immediately under the receptacle of the flower
much distended with air these seem to be analogous to the airvessel at
the broad end of the egg and may probably become less pure as the seed
ripens some which i tried had the purity of the surrounding atmosphere
the air at the broad end of the egg is probably an organ serving the
purpose of respiration to the young chick some of whose vessels are
spread upon it like a placenta or permeate it many are of opinion that
even the placenta of the human fetus and cotyledons of quadrupeds are
respiratory organs rather than nutritious ones
the air in the hollow stems of grasses and of some umbelliferous plants
bears analogy to the air in the quills and in some of the bones of
birds supplying the place of the pith which shrivels up after it has
performed its office of protruding the young stem or feather some of
these cavities of the bones are said to communicate with the lungs in
birds phil trans
the airbladders of fish are nicely adapted to their intended purpose
for though they render them buoyant near the surface without the labour
of using their fins yet when they rest at greater depths they are no
inconvenience as the increased pressure of the water condenses the air
which they contain into less space thus if a cork or bladder of air was
immersed a very great depth in the ocean it would be so much compressed
as to become specifically as heavy as the water and would remain there
it is probable the unfortunate mr day who was drowned in a divingship
of his own construction miscarried from not attending to this
circumstance it is probable the quantity of air he took down with him
if he descended much lower than he expected was condensed into so small
a space as not to render the ship buoyant when he endeavoured to ascend

tremella l 427 clandestine marriage i have frequently observed
fungusses of this genus on old rails and on the ground to become a
transparent jelly after they had been frozen in autumnal mornings which
is a curious property and distinguishes them from some other vegetable
mucilage for i have observed that the paste made by boiling wheatflour
in water ceases to be adhesive after having been frozen i suspected
that the tremella nostoc or starjelly also had been thus produced but
have since been well informed that the tremella nostoc is a mucilage
voided by herons after they have eaten frogs hence it has the appearance
of having been pressed through a hole and limbs of frogs are said
sometimes to be found amongst it it is always seen upon plains or by the
sides of water places which herons generally frequent
some of the fungusses are so acrid that a drop of their juice blisters
the tongue others intoxicate those who eat them the ostiacks in siberia

muscarum eaten raw or the decoction of three of them produces
intoxication for 12 or 16 hours history of russia v 1 nichols 1780

sufficiently stewed the oftiacks blister their skin by a fungus found on
birchtrees and use the agiricus officin for soap ib

or vegetable department their animal taste in cookery and their animal
smell when burnt together with their tendency to putrefaction insomuch

interlude
bookseller your verses mr botanist consist of pure description i
hope there is sense in the notes
poet i am only a flowerpainter or occasionally attempt a landskip
and leave the human figure with the subjects of history to abler artists
b it is well to know what subjects are within the limits of your
pencil many have failed of success from the want of this selfknowledge
but pray tell me what is the essential difference between poetry and
prose is it solely the melody or measure of the language
p i think not solely for some prose has its melody and even measure
and good verses well spoken in a language unknown to the hearer are not
easily to be distinguished from good prose b is it the sublimity
beauty or novelty of the sentiments
p not so for sublime sentiments are often better expressed in prose
thus when warwick in one of the plays of shakespear is left wounded on
the field after the loss of the battle and his friend says to him oh
could you but fly what can be more sublime than his answer why then
i would not fly no measure of verse i imagine could add dignity to
this sentiment and it would be easy to select examples of the beautiful
or new from prose writers which i suppose no measure of verse could
improve
b in what then consists the essential difference between poetry and
prose
p next to the measure of the language the principal distinction
appears to me to consist in this that poetry admits of but few words
expressive of very abstracted ideas whereas prose abounds with them and
as our ideas derived from visible objects are more distinct than those
derived from the objects of our other senses the words expressive of
these ideas belonging to vision make up the principal part of poetic
language that is the poet writes principally to the eye the
prosewriter uses more abstracted terms mr pope has written a bad verse
in the windsor forest
  and kennet swift for silver eels renownd
the word renownd does not present the idea of a visible object to the
mind and is thence prosaic but change this line thus
and kennet swift where silver graylings play
and it becomes poetry because the scenery is then brought before the
eye
b this may be done in prose
p and when it is done in a single word it animates the prose so it
is more agreeable to read in mr gibbons history germany was at this
time overshadowed with extensive forests than germany was at this
time full of extensive forests but where this mode of expression
occurs too frequently the prose approaches to poetry and in graver
works where we expect to be instructed rather than amused it becomes
tedious and impertinent some parts of mr burkes eloquent orations
become intricate and enervated by superfluity of poetic ornament which
quantity of ornament would have been agreeable in a poem where much
ornament is expected
b is then the office of poetry only to amuse
p the muses are young ladies we expect to see them dressed though
not like some modern beauties with so much gauze and feather that the
lady herself is the least part of her there are however didactic pieces
of poetry which are much admired as the georgics of virgil masons
english garden hayleys epistles nevertheless science is best delivered
in prose as its mode of reasoning is from stricter analogies than
metaphors or similies
b do not personifications and allegories distinguish poetry
p these are other arts of bringing objects before the eye or of
expressing sentiments in the language of vision and are indeed better
suited to the pen than the pencil
b that is strange when you have just said they are used to bring
their objects before the eye
p in poetry the personification or allegoric figure is generally
indistinct and therefore does not strike us as forcibly as to make us
attend to its improbability but in painting the figures being all much
more distinct their improbability becomes apparent and seizes our
attention to it thus the person of concealment is very indistinct and
therefore does not compel us to attend to its improbability in the
following beautiful lines of shakespear
        she never told her love
        but let concealment like a worm i th bud
        feed on her damask cheek
but in these lines below the person of reason obtrudes itself into our
company and becomes disagreeable by its distinctness and consequent
improbability
        to reason i flew and intreated her aid
        who paused on my case and each circumstance weighd
        then gravely replyd in return to my prayer
        that hebe was fairest of all that were fair
        thats a truth replyd i ive no need to be taught
        i came to you reason to find out a fault
        if thats all says reason return as you came
        to find fault with hebe would forfeit my name
allegoric figures are on this account in general less manageable in
painting and in statuary than in poetry and can seldom be introduced in
the two former arts in company with natural figures as is evident
from the ridiculous effect of many of the paintings of rubens in the
luxemburgh gallery and for this reason because their improbability
becomes more striking when there are the figures of real persons by
their side to compare them with mrs angelica kauffman well apprised of
this circumstance has introduced no mortal figures amongst her cupids
and her graces and the great roubiliac in his unrivalled monument of
time and fame struggling for the trophy of general fleming has only hung
up a medallion of the head of the hero of the piece there are however
some allegoric figures which we have so often heard described or seen
delineated that we almost forget that they do not exist in common life
and hence view them without astonishment as the figures of the heathen
mythology of angels devils death and time and almost believe them
to be realities even when they are mixed with representations of the
natural forms of man whence i conclude that a certain degree of
probability is necessary to prevent us from revolting with distaste from
unnatural images unless we are otherwise so much interested in the
contemplation of them as not to perceive their improbability
b is this reasoning about degrees of probability justwhen sir joshua
reynolds who is unequalled both in the theory and practice of his art
and who is a great master of the pen as well as the pencil has asserted
in a discourse delivered to the royal academy december 11 1786 that
the higher styles of painting like the higher kinds of the drama do
not aim at any thing like deception or have any expectation that the
spectators should think the events there represented are really passing
before them and he then accuses mr fielding of bad judgment when he
attempts to compliment mr garrick in one of his novels by introducing
an ignorant man mistaking the representation of a scene in hamlet for a
reality and thinks because he was an ignorant man he was less liable
to make such a mistake
p it is a metaphysical question and requires more attention than sir
joshua has bestowed upon ityou will allow that we are perfectly
deceived in our dreams and that even in our waking reveries we are
often so much absorbed in the contemplation of what passes in our
imaginations that for a while we do not attend to the lapse of time or
to our own locality and thus suffer a similar kind of deception as in
our dreams that is we believe things present before our eyes which are
not so
there are two circumstances which contribute to this compleat deception
in our dreams first because in sleep the organs of sense are closed or
inert and hence the trains of ideas associated in our imaginations are
never interrupted or dissevered by the irritations of external objects
and can not therefore be contrasted with our sensations on this account
though we are affected with a variety of passions in our dreams as
anger love joy yet we never experience surprizefor surprize is only
produced when any external irritations suddenly obtrude themselves and
dissever our passing trains of ideas
secondly because in sleep there is a total suspension of our voluntary
power both over the muscles of our bodies and the ideas of our minds
for we neither walk about nor reason in compleat sleep hence as the
trains of ideas are passing in our imaginations in dreams we cannot
compare them with our previous knowledge of things as we do in our
waking hours for this is a voluntary exertion and thus we cannot
perceive their incongruity thus we are deprived in sleep of the only
two means by which we can distinguish the trains of ideas passing in our
imaginations from those excited by our sensations and are led by their
vivacity to believe them to belong to the latter for the vivacity of
these trains of ideas passing in the imagination is greatly increased
by the causes abovementioned that is by their not being disturbed or
dissevered either by the appulses of external bodies as in surprize or
by our voluntary exertions in comparing them with our previous knowledge
of things as in reasoning upon them
b now to apply
p when by the art of the painter or poet a train of ideas is suggested
to our imaginations which interests us so much by the pain or pleasure
it affords that we cease to attend to the irritations of common external
objects and cease also to use any voluntary efforts to compare these
interesting trains of ideas with our previous knowledge of things a
compleat reverie is produced during which time however short if it be
but for a moment the objects themselves appear to exist before us this
i think has been called by an ingenious critic the ideal presence of
such objects elements of criticism by lord kaimes and in respect to
the compliment intended by mr fielding to mr garrick it would seem
that an ignorant rustic at the play of hamlet who has some previous
belief in the appearance of ghosts would sooner be liable to fall into
reverie and continue in it longer than one who possessed more knowledge
of the real nature of things and had a greater facility of
exercising his reason
b it must require great art in the painter or poet to produce this
kind of deception
p the matter must be interesting from its sublimity beauty or
novelty this is the scientific part and the art consists in bringing
these distinctly before the eye so as to produce as abovementioned
the ideal presence of the object in which the great shakespear
particularly excells
b then it is not of any consequence whether the representations
correspond with nature
p not if they so much interest the reader or spectator as to induce
the reverie above described nature may be seen in the marketplace
or at the cardtable but we expect something more than this in the
playhouse or pictureroom the further the artists recedes from nature
the greater novelty he is likely to produce if he rises above nature
he produces the sublime and beauty is probably a selection and new
combination of her most agreeable parts yourself will be sensible of the
truth of this doctrine by recollecting over in your mind the works of
three of our celebrated artists sir joshua reynolds has introduced
sublimity even into its portraits  we admire the representation of
persons whose reality we should have passed by unnoticed mrs angelica
kauffman attracts our eyes with beauty which i suppose no where exists
certainly few grecian faces are seen in this country and the daring
pencil of fuseli transports us beyond the boundaries of nature and
ravishes us with the charm of the most interesting novelty and
shakespear who excells in all these together so far captivates the
spectator as to make him unmindful of every kind of violation of time
place or existence as at the first appearance of the ghost of hamlet
his ear must be dull as the fat weed which roots itself on lethes
brink who can attend to the improbablity of the exhibition so in many
scenes of the tempest we perpetually believe the action passing before
our eyes and relapse with somewhat of distaste into common life at the
intervals of the representation
b i suppose a poet of less ability would find such great machinery
difficult and cumbersome to manage
p just so we should be mocked at the apparent improbabilities as in
the gardens of a scicilian nobleman described in mr brydones and in
mr swinburns travels there are said to be six hundred statues of
imaginary monsters which so disgust the spectators that the state had
once a serious design of destroying them and yet the very improbable
monsters in ovids metamorphoses have entertained the world for many
centuries
b the monsters in your botanic garden i hope are of the latter kind

carlina l 7 carline thistle of the class confederate males the
seeds of this and of many other plants of the same class are furnished
with a plume by which admirable mechanism they perform long aerial
journeys crossing lakes and deserts and are thus disseminated far from
the original plant and have much the appearance of a shuttlecock as they
fly the wings are of different construction some being like a divergent
tuft of hairs others are branched like feathers some are elevated from
the crown of the seed by a slender footstalk which gives than a very
elegant appearance others sit immediately on the crown of the seed
nature has many other curious vegetable contrivances for the dispersion
of seeds see note on helianthus but perhaps none of them has more the
appearance of design than the admirable apparatus of tillandsia for this
purpose this plant grows on the branches of trees like the misleto and
never on the ground the seeds are furnished with many long threads on
their crowns which as they are driven forwards by the winds wrap round
the arms of trees and thus hold them fast till they vegetate this it
very analogous to the migration of spiders on the gossamer who are said
to attach themselves to the end of a long thread and rise thus to the
tops of trees or buildings as the accidental breezes carry them

gossypia l 87 gossypium the cotton plant on the river derwent near
matlock in derbyshire sir richard arkwright has created his curious
and magnificent machinery for spinning cotton which had been in vain
attempted by many ingenious artists before him the cottonwool is first
picked from the pods and seeds by women it is then carded by cylindrical
cards which move against each other with different velocities it is
taken from these by an ironhand or comb which has a motion similar to
that of scratching and takes the wool off the cards longitudinally in
respect to the fibres or staple producing a continued line loosely
cohering called the rove or roving this rove yet very loosely
twisted is then received or drawn into a whirling canister and is
rolled by the centrifugal force in spiral lines within it being yet too
tender for the spindle it is then passed between two pairs of rollers
the second pair moving faster than the first elongate the thread with
greater equality than can be done by the hand and is then twisted on
spoles or bobbins
the great fertility of the cottonplant in these fine flexile threads
whilst those from flax hemp and nettles or from the bark of the
mulberrytree require a previous putrefection of the parenchymatous
substance and much mechanical labour and afterwards bleaching renders
this plant of great importance to the world and since sir richard
arkwrights ingenious machine has not only greatly abbreviated and
simplefied the labour and art of carding and spinning the cottonwool
but performs both these circumstances better than can be done by hand
it is probable that the clothing of this small seed will become the
principal clothing of mankind though animal wool and silk may be
preferable in colder climates as they are more imperfect conductors of
heat and are thence a warmer clothing
95    with wiry teeth revolving cards release
        the tanged knots and smooth the ravelld fleece

        with quickend pace successive rollers move
        and these retain and those extend the rove

mulberry was used whence liber signifies a book and the bark of a
tree before the invention of letters mankind may be said to have been
perpetually in their infancy as the arts of one age or country generally
died with their inventors whence arose the policy which still continues
in indostan of obliging the son to practice the profession of his
father after the discovery of letters the facts of astronomy and
chemistry became recorded in written language though the antient
hieroglyphic characters for the planets and metals continue in use at

squares instead of by decimation which might have served the purposes

languages in china they have not yet learned to divide their words

seventy accurate and elegant representations of different vegetables
with the parts of their flowers fructification c according with the
classification of linneus in what she terms papermosaic she began this
work at the age of 74 when her sight would no longer serve her to paint
in which she much excelled between her age of 74 and 82 at which time
her eyes quite failed her she executed the curious hortus ficcus
abovementioned which i suppose contains a greater number of plants
than were ever before drawn from the life by any one person her method
consisted in placing the leaves of each plant with the petals and all
the other parts of the flowers on coloured paper and cutting them with
scissars accurately to the natural size and form and then parting them
on a dark ground the effect of which is wonderful and their accuracy
less liable to fallacy than drawings she is at this time 1788 in her
89th year with all the powers of a fine understanding still unimpaired
i am informed another very ingenious lady mrs north is constructing a
similar hortus ficcus or papergarden which she executes on a ground of

and open their petals at certain hours of the day and thus constitute
what linneus calls the horologe or watch of flora he enumerates 46
flowers which possess this kind of sensibility i shall mention a few of
them with their respective hours of rising and setting as linneus terms
them he divides them first into meteoric flowers which less accurately
observe the hour of unfolding but are expanded sooner or later according
to the cloudiness moisture or pressure of the atmosphere 2d tropical
flowers open in the morning and close before evening every day but the
hour of the expanding becomes earlier or later at the length of the day
increases or decreases 3dly quinoctial flowers which open at a
certain and exact hour of the day and for the most part close at another
determinate hour
hence the horologe or watch of flora is formed from numerous plants of
which the following are those most common in this country leontodon

metamorphose of the corol when the nectaries fall off seems to shew

 interlude ii
bookseller the monsters of your botanic garden are as surprising as
the bulls with brazen feet and the firebreathing dragons which guarded
the hesperian fruit yet are they not disgusting nor mischievous and
in the manner you have chained them together in your exhibition they
succeed each other amusingly enough like prints of the london cries
wrapped upon rollers with a glass before them in this at least they
resemble the monsters in ovids metamorphoses but your similies i
suppose are homeric
poet the great bard well understood how to make use of this kind of
ornament in epic poetry he brings his valiant heroes into the field with
much parade and sets them a fighting with great fury and then after a
few thrusts and parries he introduces a long string of similies during
this the battle is supposed to continue and thus the time necessary for
the action is gained in our imaginations and a degree of probability
produced which contributes to the temporary deception or reverie of the
reader
but the similies of homer have another agreeable characteristic they
do not quadrate or go upon all fours as it is called like the more
formal similies of some modern writers any one resembling feature seems
to be with him a sufficient excuse for the introduction of this kind of
digression he then proceeds to deliver some agreeable poetry on this new
subject and thus converts every simile into a kind of short episode
b then a simile should not very accurately resemble the subject
p no it would then become a philosophical analogy it would be
ratiocination instead of poetry it need only so far resemble the
subject as poetry itself ought to resemble nature it should have so
much sublimity beauty or novelty as to interest the reader and should
be expressed in picturesque language so as to bring the scenery before
his eye and should lastly bear so much verisimilitude as not to awaken
him by the violence of improbability or incongruity
b may not the reverie of the reader be dissipated or disturbed by
disagreeable images being presented to his imagination as well as by
improbable or incongruous ones p certainly he will endeavour to
rouse himself from a disagreeable reverie as from the nightmare and
from this may be discovered the line of boundary between the tragic and
the horrid which line however will veer a little this way or that
according to the prevailing manners of the age or country and the
peculiar associations of ideas or idiosyncracy of mind of individuals
for instance if an artist should represent the death of an officer in
battle by shewing a little blood on the bosom of his shirt as if a
bullet had there penetrated the dying figure would affect the beholder
with pity and if fortitude was at the same time expressed in his
countenance admiration would be added to our pity on the contrary if
the artist should chuse to represent his thigh as shot away by a cannon
ball and should exhibit the bleeding flesh and shattered bone of the
stump the picture would introduce into our minds ideas from a butchers
shop or a surgeons operationroom and we should turn from it with
disgust so if characters were brought upon the stage with their limbs
disjointed by torturing instruments and the floor covered with clotted
blood and scattered brains our theatric reverie would be destroyed by
disgust and we should leave the playhouse with detestation
the painters have been more guilty in this respect than the poets the
cruelty of apollo in flaying marcias alive is a favourite subject with
the antient artists and the tortures of expiring martyrs have disgraced
the modern ones it requires little genius to exhibit the muscles in
convulsive action either by the pencil or the chissel because the
interstices are deep and the lines strongly defined but those tender
gradations of muscular action which constitute the graceful attitudes of
the body are difficult to conceive or to execute except by a master of
nice discernment and cultivated taste b by what definition would you
distinguish the horrid from the tragic
p i suppose the latter consists of distress attended with pity which
is said to be allied to love the most agreeable of all our passions
and the former in distress accompanied with disgust which is allied to
hate and is one of our most disagreeable sensations hence when horrid
scenes of cruelty are represented in pictures we wish to disbelieve
their existence and voluntarily exert ourselves to escape from the
deception whereas the bitter cup of true tragedy is mingled with some
sweet consolatory drops which endear our tears and we continue to
contemplate the interesting delusion with a delight which it is not easy
to explain
b has not this been explained by lucretius where he describes a
shipwreck and says the spectators receive pleasure from feeling
themselves safe on land and by akenside in his beautiful poem on the
pleasures of imagination who ascribes it to our finding objects for the
due exertion of our passions
p we must not confound our sensations at the contemplation of real
misery with those which we experience at the scenical representations of
tragedy the spectators of a shipwreck may be attracted by the dignity
and novelty of the object and from these may be said to receive
pleasure but not from the distress of the sufferers an ingenious
writer who has criticised this dialogue in the english review for
august 1789 adds that one great source of our pleasure from scenical
distress arises from our at the same time generally contemplating one
of the noblest objects of nature that of virtue triumphant over
every difficulty and oppression or supporting its votary under every
suffering or where this does not occur that our minds are relieved
by the justice of some signal punishment awaiting the delinquent but
besides this at the exhibition of a good tragedy we are not only amused
by the dignity and novelty and beauty of the objects before us but
if any distressful circumstances occur too forcible for our sensibility
we can voluntarily exert ourselves and recollect that the scenery is
not real and thus not only the pain which we had received from the
apparent distress is lessened but a new source of pleasure is opened
to us similar to that which we frequently have felt on awaking from a
distressful dream we are glad that it is not true we are at the same
time unwilling to relinquish the pleasure which we receive from the other
interesting circumstances of the drama and on that account quickly
permit ourselves to relapse into the delusion and thus alternately
believe and disbelieve almost every moment the existence of the objects
represented before us
b have those two sovereigns of poetic land homer and shakespear kept
their works entirely free from the horridor even yourself in your
third canto
p the descriptions of the mangled carcasses of the companions of
ulysses in the cave of polypheme is in this respect certainly
objectionable as is well observed by scaliger and in the play of titus
andronicus if that was written by shakespear which from its internal
evidence i think very improbable there are many horrid and disgustful
circumstances the following canto is submitted to the candour of the
critical reader to whose opinion i shall submit in silence

        loves

much celebrated in the mysteries of witchcraft and for the purpose of
raising the devil as its name imports it grows amid the mouldering
bones and decayed coffins in the ruinous vaults of sleafordchurch in
lincolnshire the superstitious ceremonies or histories belonging to some
vegetables have been truly ridiculous thus the druids are said to have
cropped the misletoe with a golden axe or sickle and the bryony or
mandrake was said to utter a scream when its root was drawn from the
ground and that the animal which drew it up became diseased and soon
died on which account when it was wanted for the purposes of medicine
it was usual to loosen and remove the earth about the root and then to
tie it by means of a cord to a dogs tail who was whipped to pull it up
and was then supposed to suffer for the impiety of the action and even
at this day bits of dried root of peony are rubbed smooth and strung
and sold under the name of anodyne necklaces and tied round the necks of
children to facilitate the growth of their teeth add to this that in
prices history of cornwall a book published about ten years ago the
virga divinatoria or divining rod has a degree of credit given to it
this rod is of hazle or other light wood and held horizontally in the
hand and is said to bow towards the ore whenever the conjurer walks over
a mine a very few years ago in france and even in england another
kind of divining rod has been used to discover springs of water in a
similar manner and gained some credit and in the very last year there
were many in france and some in england who underwent an enchantment
without any divining rod at all and believed themselves to be affected
by an invisible agent which the enchanter called animal magnetism

water from laurelleaves is perhaps the most sudden poison we are
acquainted with in this country i have seen about two spoonfuls of it
destroy a large pointer dog in less than ten minutes in a smaller dose
it is said to produce intoxication on this account there is reason to
believe it acts in the same manner as opium and vinous spirit but that
the dose is not so well ascertained see note on tremella it is used

voluntary power both over our muscular motions and our ideas for we
neither walk nor reason in sleep but at the same time many of our
muscular motions and many of our ideas continue to be excited into
action in consequence of internal irritations and of internal sensations
for the heart and arteries continue to beat and we experience variety
of passions and even hunger and thirst in our dreams hence i conclude
that our nerves of sense are not torpid or inert during sleep but that
they are only precluded from the perception of external objects by their
external organs being rendered unfit to transmit to them the appulses of
external bodies during the suspension of the power of volition thus the
eyelids are closed in sleep and i suppose the tympanum of the car is
not stretched because they are deprived of the voluntary exertions of
the muscles appropriated to these purposes and it is probable something
similar happens to the external apparatus of our other organs of sense
which may render them unfit for their office of perception during sleep
for milk put into the mouths of sleeping babes occasions them to swallow
and suck and if the eyelid is a little opened in the daylight by the
exertions of disturbed sleep the person dreams of being much dazzled

when there arises in sleep a painful desire to exert the voluntary

of a saw are all turned towards the point of it as this long awn lies

forwards the barley corn which it adheres to in the day it shortens as
it dries and as these points prevent it from receding it draws up its
pointed end and thus creeping like a worm will travel many feet from
the parent stem that very ingenious mechanic philosopher mr edgeworth
once made on this principle a wooden automaton its back consisted of
soft firwood about an inch square and four feet long made of pieces
cut the crossway in respect to the fibres of the wood and glued
together it had two feet before and two behind which supported the
back horizontally but were placed with their extremities which were
armed with sharp points of iron bending backwards hence in moist
weather the back lengthened and the two foremost feet were pushed
forwards in dry weather the hinder feet were drawn after as the
obliquity of the points of the feet prevented it from receding and thus
in a month or two it walked across the room which it inhabited might

essential oils that of turpentine is recommended by m de thosse
for the purpose of destroying insects which infect both vegetables and
animals having observed that the trees were attacked by multitudes of
small insects of different colours pucins ou pucerons which injured
their young branches he destroyed them all intirely in the following
manner he put into a bowl a few handfuls of earth on which he poured a
small quantity of oil of turpentine he then beat the whole together with
a spatula pouring on it water till it became of the consistence of soup
with this mixture he moistened the ends of the branches and both the
insects and their eggs were destroyed and other insects kept aloof by
the scent of the turpentine he adds that he destroyed the fleas of
his puppies by once bathing them in warm water impregnated with oil of
turpentine mem dagriculture an 1787 trimest printemp p 109 i

abundance of poisons the nauseous or pungent juices of some vegetables
like the thorns of others are given them for their defence from the
depredations of animals hence the thorny plants are in general wholesome
and agreeable food to graminivorous animals see note on ilex the
flowers or petals of plants are perhaps in general more acrid than their
leaves hence they are much seldomer eaten by insects this seems to have
been the use of the essential oil in the vegetable economy as observed

is thus a part of their defence these pungent or nauseous juices of

the vegetable poisons like the animal ones produce more sudden and
dangerous effects when instilled into a wound than when taken into
the stomach whence the families of marfi and psilli in antient rome
sucked the poison without injury out of wounds made by vipers

purpose by the experiments related by beccaria it appears that four
or five times the quantity taken by the mouth had about equal effects

one in four are said to return not only animals of all kinds both
quadrupeds fish and birds but all kinds of vegetables also are

orchis l 259 the orchis morio in the circumstance of the
parentroot shrivelling up and dying as the young one increases is
not only analogous to other tuberous or knobby roots but also to some
bulbous roots as the tulip the manner of the production of herbaceous
plants from their various perennial roots seems to want further
investigation as their analogy is not yet clearly established the
caudex or true root in the orchis lies above the knob and from this
part the fibrous roots and the new knob are produced in the tulip the
caudex lies below the bulb from whence proceed the fibrous roots and the
new bulbs and i suspect the tuliproot after it has flowered dies
like the orchisroot for the stem of the last years tulip lies on the
outside and not in the center of the new bulb which i am informed does
not happen in the three or four first years when raised from seed when
it only produces a stem and slender leaves without flowering in the
tuliproot dissected in the early spring just before it begins to
shoot a perfect flower is seen in its center and between the first and
second coat the large next years bulb is i believe produced between
the second and third coat and between this and the fourth coat and
perhaps further other less and less bulbs are visible all adjoining
to the caudex at the bottom of the motherbulb and which i am told
require as many years before they will slower as the number of the coats
with which they are covered this annual reproduction of the tuliproot
induces some florists to believe that tuliproots never die naturally as
they lose so few of them whereas the hyacinthroots i am informed will
not last above five or seven years after they have flowered
the hyacinthroot differs from the tuliproot as the stem of the last
years flower is always found in the center of the root and the new
offsets arise from the caudex below the bulb but not beneath any of the
concentric coats of the root except the external one hence mr eaton
an ingenious florist of derby to whom i am indebted for most of the
observations in this note concludes that the hyacinthroot does not
perish annually after it has flowered like the tulip mr eaton gave me a
tulip root which had been set too deep in the earth and the caudex had
elongated itself near an inch and the new bulb was formed above the old
one and detached from it instead of adhering to its side
the caudex of the ranunculus cultivated by the florists lies above the
clawlike root in this the old root or claws die annually like the
tulip and orchis and the new claws which are seen above the old ones
draw down the caudex lower into the earth the same is said to happen to
scabiosa or devils bit and some other plants as valerian and greater
plantain the new fibrous roots rising round the caudex above the old
ones the inferior end of the root becomes stumped as if cut off after
the old fibres are decayed and the caudex is drawn down into the earth

that the continent of america was not raised out of the great ocean at
so early a period of time as the other continents one reason for this
opinion was because the great lakes perhaps nearly as large as the
mediterranean sea consist of fresh water and as the seasalt seems to
have its origin from the destruction of vegetable and animal bodies
washed down by rains and carried by rivers into lakes or seas it
would seem that this source of seasalt had not so long existed in that
country there is however a more satisfactory way of explaining this
circumstance which is that the american lakes lie above the level of
the ocean and are hence perpetually desalited by the rivers which run
through them which is not the case with the mediterranean into which a
current from the main ocean perpetually passes

cocoanuts are enumerated by dr tonning amn acad 149 amongst
these emigrant seeds the fact is truly wonderful and cannot be
accounted for but by the existence of under currents in the depths of the
ocean or from vortexes of water passing from one country to another
through caverns of the earth
sir hans sloane has given an account of four kinds of seeds which are
frequently thrown by the sea upon the coasts of the islands of the
northern parts of scotland phil trans abridged vol iii p 540
which seeds are natives of the west indies and seem to be brought
thither by the gulfstream described below one of these is called by
sir h sloane phaseolus maximus perennis which is often also thrown
on the coast of kerry in ireland another is called in jamaica
horseeyebean and a third is called niker in jamaica he adds that
the lenticula marina or sargosso grows on the rocks about jamaica is
carried by the winds and current towards the coast of florida and thence
into the northamerican ocean where it lies very thick on the surface of
the sea
thus a rapid current passes from the gulf of florida to the ne
along the coast of northamerica known to seamen by the name of the
gulfstream a chart of this was published by dr francklin in 1768 from
the information principally of capt folger this was confirmed by the
ingenious experiments of dr blagden published in 1781 who found that
the water of the gulfstream was from six to eleven degrees warmer
than the water of the sea through which it ran which must have been
occasioned by its being brought from a hotter climate he ascribes the
origin of this current to the power of the tradewinds which blowing
always in the same direction carry the waters of the atlantic ocean to
the westward till they are stopped by the opposing continent on the west
of the gulf of mexico and are thus accumulated there and run down the
gulf of florida philos trans v 71 p 335 governor pownal has given
an elegant map of this gulfstream tracing it from the gulf of florida
northward as far as cape sable in nova scotia and then across the
atlantic ocean to the coast of africa between the canaryislands and
senegal increasing in breadth as it runs till it occupies five or six
degrees of latitude the governor likewise ascribes this current to the
force of the tradewinds protruding the waters westward till they are
opposed by the continent and accumulated in the gulf of mexico he very
ingeniously observes that a great eddy must be produced in the atlantic
ocean between this gulfstream and the westerly current protruded by the
tropical winds and in this eddy are found the immense fields of floating
vegetables called saragosa weeds and gulfweeds and some light woods
which circulate in these vast eddies or are occasionally driven out of
them by the winds hydraulic and nautical observations by governor
pownal 1787 other currents are mentioned by the governor in this
ingenious work as those in the indian sea northward of the line which
are ascribed to the influence of the monsoons it is probable that in
process of time the narrow tract of land on the west of the gulf of
mexico may be worn away by this elevation of water dashing against it by
which this immense current would cease to exist and a wonderful change
take place in the gulf of mexico and west indian islands by the
subsiding of the sea which might probably lay all those islands int

interlude iii
bookseller poetry has been called a sisterart both to painting and to
music i wish to know what are the particulars of their relationship
poet it has been already observed that the principal part of the
language of poetry consists of those words which are expressive of the
ideas which we originally receive by the organ of sight and in this it
nearly indeed resembles painting which can express itself in no other
way but by exciting the ideas or sensations belonging to the sense of
vision but besides this essential similitude in the language of the
poetic pen and pencil these two sisters resemble each other if i may
so say in many of their habits and manners the painter to produce a
strong effect makes a few parts of his picture large distinct and
luminous and keeps the remainder in shadow or even beneath its natural
size and colour to give eminence to the principal figure this is
similar to the common manner of poetic composition where the subordinate
characters are kept down to elevate and give consequence to the hero or
heroine of the piece
in the south aile of the cathedral church at lichfield there is an
antient monument of a recumbent figure the head and neck of which lie
on a roll of matting in a kind of niche or cavern in the wall and about
five feet distant horizontally in another opening or cavern in the wall
are seen the feet and ankles with some folds of garment lying also on
a matt and though the intermediate space is a solid stonewall yet the
imagination supplies the deficiency and the whole figure seems to exist
before our eyes does not this resemble one of the arts both of the
painter and the poet the former often shows a muscular arm amidst a
group of figures or an impassioned face and hiding the remainder of
the body behind other objects leaves the imagination to compleat it the
latter describing a single feature or attitude in picturesque words
produces before the mind an image of the whole
i remember seeing a print in which was represented a shrivelled hand
stretched through an iron grate in the stone floor of a prisonyard to
reach at a mess of porrage which affected me with more horrid ideas of
the distress of the prisoner in the dungeon below than could have
been perhaps produced by an exhibition of the whole person and in the
following beautiful scenery from the midsummernights dream in which i
have taken the liberty to alter the place of a comma the description of
the swimming step and prominent belly bring the whole figure before our
eyes with the distinctness of reality
        when we have laughd to see the sails conceive
        and grow bigbellied with the wanton wind
        which she with pretty and with swimming gate
        following her womb then rich with my young squire
        would imitate and sail upon the land
there is a third sisterfeature which belongs both to the pictorial and
poetic art and that is the making sentiments and passions visible as
it were to the spectator this is done in both arts by describing or
portraying the effects or changes which those sentiments or passions
produce upon the body at the end of the unaltered play of lear there
is a beautiful example of poetic painting the old king is introduced as
dying from grief for the loss of cordelia at this crisis shakespear
conceiving the robe of the king to be held together by a clasp
represents him as only saying to an attendant courtier in a faint voice
pray sir undo this buttonthank you sir and dies thus by the
art of the poet the oppression at the bosom of the dying king is made
visible not described in words
b what are the features in which these sisterarts do not resemble
each other
p the ingenious bishop berkeley in his treatise on vision a work of
great ability has evinced that the colours which we see are only a
language suggesting to our minds the ideas of solidity and extension
which we had before received by the sense of touch thus when we view the
trunk of a tree our eye can only acquaint us with the colours or shades
and from the previous experience of the sense of touch these suggest to
us the cylindrical form with the prominent or depressed wrinkles on
it from hence it appears that there is the strictest analogy between
colours and sounds as they are both but languages which do not
represent their correspondent ideas but only suggest them to the mind
from the habits or associations of previous experience it is therefore
reasonable to conclude that the more artificial arrangements of these
two languages by the poet and the painter bear a similar analogy
but in one circumstance the pen and the pencil differ widely from each
other and that is the quantity of time which they can include in their
respective representations the former can unravel a long series of
events which may constitute the history of days or years while the
latter can exhibit only the actions of a moment the poet is happier in
describing successive scenes the painter in representing stationary
ones both have their advantages
where the passions are introduced as the poet on one hand has the
power gradually to prepare the mind of his reader by previous climacteric
circumstances the painter on the other hand can throw stronger
illumination and distinctness on the principal moment or catastrophe of
the action besides the advantage he has in using an universal language
which can be read in an instant of time thus where a great number of
figures are all seen together supporting or contrasting each other and
contributing to explain or aggrandize the principal effect we view
a picture with agreeable surprize and contemplate it with unceasing
admiration in the representation of the sacrifice of jephthas daughter
a print done from a painting of ant coypel at one glance of the eye
we read all the interesting passages of the last act of a wellwritten
tragedy so much poetry is there condensed into a moment of time
b will you now oblige me with an account of the relationship between
poetry and her other sister music p in the poetry of our language
i dont think we are to look for any thing analogous to the notes of the
gamut for except perhaps in a few exclamations or interrogations we
are at liberty to raise or sink our voice an octave or two at pleasure
without altering the sense of the words hence if either poetry or prose
be read in melodious tones of voice as is done in recitativo or in
chaunting it must depend on the speaker not on the writer for though
words may be selected which are less harsh than others that is which
have fewer sudden stops or abrupt consonants amongst the vowels or
with fewer sibilant letters yet this does not constitute melody which
consists of agreeable successions of notes referrable to the gamut or
harmony which consists of agreeable combinations of them if the chinese
language has many words of similar articulation which yet signify
different ideas when spoken in a higher or lower musical note as some
travellers affirm it must be capable of much finer effect in respect to
the audible part of poetry than any language we are acquainted with
there is however another affinity in which poetry and music more nearly
resemble each other than has generally been understood and that is in
their measure or time there are but two kinds of time acknowledged in
modern music which are called triple time and common time the
former of these is divided by bars each bar containing three crotchets
or a proportional number of their subdivisions into quavers and
semiquavers this kind of time is analogous to the measure of our heroic
or iambic verse thus the two following couplets are each of them divided
into five bars of triple time each bar consisting of two crotchets and
two quavers nor can they be divided into bars analogous to common time
without the bars interfering with some of the crotchets so as to divide
them
        3  softwarbling beaks  in each bright blos  som move
          4   and vo  cal rosebuds thrill  the enchanted grove 
in these lines there is a quaver and a crochet alternately in every bar
except in the last in which the in make two semiquavers the e is
supposed by grammarians to be cut off which any ones ear will readily
determine not to be true
        3 life buds or breathes  from indus to  the poles
          4  and the  vast surface kind  les as it rolls 
in these lines there is a quaver and a crotchet alternately in the first
bar a quaver two crotchets and a quaver make the second bar in the
third bar there is a quaver a crotchet and a rest after the crotchet
that is after the word poles and two quavers begin the next line the
fourth bar consists of quavers and crotchets alternately in the last bar
there is a quaver and a rest after it viz after the word kindles
and then two quavers and a crotchet you will clearly perceive the truth
of this if you prick the musical characters above mentioned under the
verses
the common time of musicians is divided into bars each of which
contains four crotchets or a proportional number of their subdivision
into quavers and semiquavers this kind of musical time is analogous to
the dactyle verses of our language the most popular instances of which
are in mr ansties bathguide in this kind of verse the bar does not
begin till after the first or second syllable and where the verse is
quite complete and written by a good ear these first syllables added to
the last complete the bar exactly in this also corresponding with many
pieces of music
        2  yet  if one may guess by the  size of his calf sir
          4   he  weighs about twentythree  stone and a half sir
        2  master  mamozets head was not  finished so soon
          4   for it  took up the barber a  whole afternoon
in these lines each bar consists of a crotchet two quavers another
crotchet and two more quavers which are equal to four crotchets and
like many bars of common time in music may be subdivided into two in
beating time without disturbing the measure
the following verses from shenftone belong likewise to common time
        24 a  river or a sea 
        was to him a dish  of tea
        and a king  dom bread and butter
the first and second bars consist each of a crotchet a quaver a
crotchet a quaver a crotchet the third bar consists of a quaver two
crotchets a quaver a crotchet the last bar is not complete without
adding the letter a which begins the first line and then it consists of
a quaver a crotchet a quaver a crotchet two quavers
it must be observed that the crotchets in triple time are in general
played by musicians slower than those of common time and hence minuets
are generally pricked in triple time and country dances generally in
common time so the verses above related which are analogous to triple
time are generally read slower than those analogous to common time
and are thence generally used for graver compositions i suppose all the
different kinds of verses to be found in our odes which have any measure
at all might be arranged under one or other of these two musical times
allowing a note or two sometimes to precede the commencement of the bar
and occasional rests as in musical compositions if this was attended
to by those who set poetry to music it is probable the sound and sense
would oftener coincide whether these musical times can be applied to the
lyric and heroic verses of the greek and latin poets i do not pretend to
determine certain it is that the dactyle verse of our language when
it is ended with a double rhime much resembles the measure of homer
and virgil except in the length of the lines b then there is no
relationship between the other two of these sister painting and music
p there is at least a mathematical relationship or perhaps i ought
rather to have said a metaphysical relationship between them sir isaac
newton has observed that the breadths of the seven primary colours
in the suns image refracted by a prism are proportional to the seven
musical notes of the gamut or to the intervals of the eight sounds
contained in an octave that is proportional to the following numbers

newtons optics book i part 2 prop 3 and 6 dr smith in his
harmonics has an explanatory note upon this happy discovery as he terms
it of newton sect 4 art 7 from this curious coincidence it has
been proposed to produce a luminous music confiding of successions
or combinations of colours analogous to a tune in respect to the
proportions above mentioned this might be performed by a strong light
made by means of mr argands lamps passing through coloured glasses
and falling on a defined part of a wall with moveable blinds before
them which might communicate with the keys of a harpsichord and thus
produce at the same time visible and audible music in unison with each
other the execution of this idea is said by mr guyot to have been
attempted by father cassel without much success if this should be
again attempted there is another curious coincidence between sounds and
colours discovered by dr darwin of shrewsbury and explained in a paper
on what he calls ocular spectra in the philosophical transactions vol
lxxvi which might much facilitate the execution of it in this treatise
the doctor has demonstrated that we see certain colours not only with
greater ease and distinctness but with relief and pleasure after having
for some time contemplated other certain colours as green after red or
red after green orange after blue or blue after orange yellow after
violet or violet after yellow this he shews arises from the ocular
spectrum of the colour last viewed coinciding with the irritation of
the colour now under contemplation now as the pleasure we receive
from the sensation of melodious notes independent of the previous
associations of agreeable ideas with them must arise from our hearing
some proportions of sounds after others more easily distinctly or
agreeably and as there is a coincidence between the proportions of the
primary colours and the primary sounds if they may be so called he
argues that the same laws must govern the sensations of both in this
circumstance therefore consists the sisterhood of music and painting
and hence they claim a right to borrow metaphors from each other
musicians to speak of the brilliancy of sounds and the light and shade
of a concerto and painters of the harmony of colours and the tone of a
picture thus it was not quite so absurd as was imagined when the blind
man asked if the colour scarlet was like the sound of a trumpet as the
coincidence or opposition of these ocular spectra or colours which
remain in the eye after having for some time contemplated a luminous
object are more easily and more accurately ascertained now their laws
have been investigated by dr darwin than the relicts of evanescent
sounds upon the ear it is to be wished that some ingenious musician
would further cultivate this curious field of science for if visible
music can be agreeably produced it would be more easy to add sentiment
to it by the representations of groves and cupids and sleeping nymphs
amid the changing colours than is commonly done by the words of audible
music
b you mentioned the greater length of the verses of homer and virgil
had not these poets great advantage in the superiority of their languages
compared to our own
p it is probable that the introduction of philosophy into a country
must gradually affect the language of it as philosophy converses in more
appropriated and abstracted terms and thus by degrees eradicates the
abundance of metaphor which is used in the more early ages of society
otherwise though the greek compound words have more vowels in proportion
to their consonants than the english ones yet the modes of compounding
them are less general as may be seen by variety of instances given in
the preface of the translators prefixed to the system of vegetables by
the lichfield society which happy property of our own language rendered
that translation of linneus as expressive and as concise perhaps more so
than the original
and in one respect i believe the english language serves the purpose
of poetry better than the antient ones i mean in the greater ease of
producing personifications for as our nouns have in general no genders
affixed to them in prosecompositions and in the habits of conversation
they become easily personified only by the addition of a masculine or
feminine pronoun as
        pale melancholy sits and round her throws
        a deathlike silence and a dread repose
                                                       popes abelard
and secondly as most of our nouns have the article a or the prefixed
to them in prosewriting and in conversation they in general become
personified even by the omission of these articles as in the bold figure
of shipwreck in miss sewards elegy on capt cook
        but round the steepy rocks and dangerous strand
        rolls the white surf and shipwreck guards the land
add to this that if the verses in our heroic poetry be shorter than
those of the ancients our words likewise are shorter and in respect
to their measure or time which has erroneously been called melody and
harmony i doubt from what has been said above whether we are so much
inferior as is generally believed since many passages which have been
stolen from antient poets have been translated into our language without
losing any thing of the beauty of the versification
b i am glad to hear you acknowledge the thefts of the modern poets
from the antient ones whose works i suppose have been reckoned lawful
plunder in all ages but have not you borrowed epithets phrases and
even half a line occasionally from modern poems
p it may be difficult to mark the exact boundary of what should be
termed plagiarism where the sentiment and expression are both borrowed
without due acknowledgement there can be no doubtsingle words on
the contrary taken from other authors cannot convict a writer of
plagiarism they are lawful game wild by nature the property of all
who can capture themand perhaps a few common flowers of speech may be
gathered as we pass over our neighbours inclosure without stigmatizing
us with the title of thieves but we must not therefore plunder his

this flower is a native of jamaica and veracrux it expands a most
exquisitely beautiful corol and emits a most fragrant odour for a few
hours in the night and then closes to open no more the flower is nearly
a foot in diameter the inside of the calyx of a splendid yellow and the
numerous petals of a pure white it begins to open about seven or eight
oclock in the evening and closes before sunrise in the morning
martyns letters p 294 the cistus labdiniferus and many other
flowers lose their petals after having been a few hours expanded in
the daytime for in these plants the stigma is soon impregnated by the
numerous anthers in many flowers of the cistus lubdiniferus i observed
two or three of the stamens were perpetually bent into contact with the
pistil
the nyctanthes called arabian jasmine is another flower which expands
a beautiful corol and gives out a most delicate perfume during the
night and not in the day in its native country whence its name
botanical philosophers have not yet explained this wonderful property
perhaps the plant sleeps during the day as some animals do and its
odoriferous glands only emit their fragrance during the expansion of
the petals that is during its waking hours the geranium triste has
the same property of giving up its fragrance only in the night the
flowers of the cucurbita lagenaria are said to close when the sun
shines upon them in our climate many flowers as tragopogon and
hibiscus close their flowers before the hottest part of the day comes
on and the flowers of some species of cucubalus and silene viscous
campion are closed all day but when the sun leaves them they expand
and emit a very agreeable scent whence such plants are termed
noctiflora

eight males one female miss e c linneus first observed the tropolum
majus to emit sparks or flashes in the mornings before sunrise during
the months of june or july and also during the twilight in the evening
but not after total darkness came on these singular scintillations were
shewn to her father and other philosophers and mr wilcke a celebrated
electrician believed them to be electric lin spec plantar p 490
swedish acts for the year 1762 pulteneys view of linneus p 220 nor
is this more wonderful than that the electric eel and torpedo should give
voluntary shocks of electricity and in this plant perhaps as in those
animals it may be a mode of defence by which it harrasses or destroys
the nightflying insects which infest it and probably it may emit the same
sparks during the day which must be then invisible this curious subject
deserves further investigation see dictamnus the ceasing to shine of
this plant after twilight might induce one to conceive that it
absorbed and emitted light like the bolognian phosphorus or calcined
oystershells so well explained by mr b wilson and by t b beccari
exper on phosphori by b wilson dodsley the light of the evening
at the same distance from noon is much greater as i have repeatedly
observed than the light of the morning this is owing i suppose to the
phosphorescent quality of almost all bodies in a greater or less degree
which thus absorb light during the sunshine and continue to emit it
again for some time afterwards though not in such quantity as to produce
apparent scintillations the nectary of this plant grows from what is
supposed to be the calyx but this supposed calyx is coloured and
perhaps from this circumstance of its bearing the nectary should rather
be esteemed a part of the coral see an additional note at the end of the
poem

mankind with so small a seed than with the potatoe of mexico or the

birthplace of our european arts was deservedly celebrated amongst their

mr wahlborn observes that as wheat rye and many of the grasses and
plantain lift up their anthers on long filments and thus expose the
enclosed fecundating dust to be washed away by the rains a scarcity of
corn is produced by wet summers hence the necessity of a careful choice
of seed wheat as that which had not received the dust of the anthers
will not grow though it may appear well to the eye the straw of the

        blue sulphurs flame imprisond waters boil
deep in wide caves l 175 the arguments which tend to shew
that the warm springs of this country are produced from steam raised by
deep subterraneous fires and afterwards condensed between the strata of
the mountains appear to me much more conclusive than the idea of their
being warmed by chemical combinations near the surface of the earth for
1st their heat has kept accurately the same perhaps for many centuries
certainly as long as we have been possessed of good thermometers which
cannot be well explained without supposing that they are first in a
boiling state for as the heat of boiling water is 212 and that of the
internal parts of the earth 48 it is easy to understand that the steam
raised from boiling water after being condensed in some mountain and
passing from thence through a certain space of the cold earth must be
cooled always to a given degree and it is probable the distance from the
exit of the spring to the place where the steam is condensed might be
guessed by the degree of its warmth
2 in the dry summer of 1780 when all other springs were either dry or
much diminished those of buxton and matlock as i was well informed on
the spot had suffered no diminution which proves that the sources of
these warm springs are at great depths below the surface of the earth
3 there are numerous perpendicular fissures in the rocks of derbyshire
in which the ores of lead and copper are found and which pass to
unknown depths and might thence afford a passage to steam from great
subterraneous fires

or of conserva soon appears in all basons which contain water dr
priestley found that great quantities of pure dephlogisticated air were
given up in water at the points of this vegetable particularly in
the sunshine and that hence it contributed to preserve the water in
reservoirs from becoming putrid the minute divisions of the leaves of
subaquatic plants as mentioned in the note on trapa and of the gills
of fish seem to serve another purpose besides that of increasing their
surface which has not i believe been attended to and that is to
facilitate the separation of the air which is mechanically mixed or
chemically dissolved in water by their points or edges this appears
on immersing a dry hairy leaf in water fresh from a pump innumerable
globules like quicksilver appear on almost every point for the
extremities of these points attract the particles of water less forcibly
than those particles attract each other hence the contained air
whose elasticity was but just balanced by the attractive power of the
surrounding particles of water to each other finds at the point of each
fibre a place where the resistance to its expansion is less and in
consequence it there expands and becomes a bubble of air it is easy to
foresee that the rays of the sunshine by being refracted and in part
relieved by the two surfaces of these minute airbubbles must impart to
them much more heat than to the transparent water and thus facilitate
their ascent by further expanding them that the points of vegetables
attract the particles of water less than they attract each other is seen
by the spherical form of dewdrops on the points of grass see note on

trapa l 200 four males one female the lower leaves
of this plant grow under water and are divided into minute capillary
ramifications while the upper leaves are broad and round and have
airbladders in their footstalks to support them above the surface of
the water as the aerial leaves of vegetables do the office of lungs by
exposing a large surface of vessels with their contained fluids to the
influence of the air so these aquatic leaves answer a similar purpose
like the gills of fish and perhaps gain from water or give to it a
similar material as the material thus necessary to life seems to abound
more in air than in water the subaquatic leaves of this plant and of
sisymbrium coenanthe ranunculus aquatilis water crowfoot and some
others are cut into fine divisions to increase the surface whilst those
above water are undivided so the plants on high mountains have their
upper leaves more divided as pimpinella petroselinum and others
because here the air is thinner and thence a larger surface of contact
is required the stream of water also passes but once along the gills of
fish as it is sooner deprived of its virtue whereas the air is both

eaten which is well worth further enquiry as they grow spontaneously in

ocymum salinun l 221 saline basil class two powers the abb
molina in his history of chili translated from the italian by the abb
grewvel mentions a species of basil which he calls ocymum salinum he
says it resembles the common basil except that the stalk is round and
jointed and that though it grows 60 miles from the sea yet every
morning it is covered with saline globules which are hard and splendid
appearing at a distance like dew and that each plant furnishes about
half an ounce of fine salt every day which the peasants collect and use
as common salt but esteem it superior in flavour
as an article of diet salt seems to act simply as a stimulus not
containing any nourishment and is the only fossil substance which the
caprice of mankind has yet taken into their stomachs along with their
food and like all other unnatural stimuli is not necessary to people
in health and contributes to weaken our system though it may be useful
as a medicine it seems to be the immediate cause of the seascurvy as
those patients quickly recover by the use of fresh provisions and is
probably a remote cause of scrophula which consists in the want of
irritability in the absorbent vessels and is therefore serviceable to
these patients as wine is necessary to those whose stomachs have been
weakened by its use the universality of the use of salt with our food
and in our cookery has rendered it difficult to prove the truth of these
observations i suspect that fleshmeat cut into thin slices either raw
or boiled might be preserved in coarse sugar or treacle and thus a very
nourishing and salutary diet might be presented to our seamen see note
on saltrocks in vol i canto ii if a person unaccustomed to much salt
should eat a couple of redherrings his insensible perspiration will
be so much increased by the stimulus of the salt that he will find it
necessary in about two hours to drink a quart of water the effects of a
continued use of salt in weakening the action of the lymphatic system may

the pistil or female part of the flower rises like a club is covered

disputes amongst botanists see tourniff malpig dillen rivin c the

the spadix of this plant is frequently quite white or coloured and the
leaves liable to be streaked with white and to have black or scarlet
blotches on them as the plant has no corol or blossom it is probable
the coloured juices in these parts of the sheath or leaves may serve the
same purpose as the coloured juices in the petals of other flowers from
which i suppose the honey to be prepared see note on helleborus i am
informed that those tuliproots which have a red cuticle produce red
flowers see rubia
when the petals of the tulip become striped with many colours the plant
loses almost half of its height and the method of making them thus break
into colours is by transplanting them into a meagre or sandy soil after
they have previously enjoyed a richer soil hence it appears that
the plant is weakened when the flower becomes variegated see note on

the dry harmattan l 324 the harmattan is a singular wind blowing
from the interior parts of africa to the atlantic ocean sometimes for
a few hours sometimes for several days without regular periods it is
always attended with a fog or haze so dense as to render those objects
invisible which are at the distance of a quarter of a mile the sun
appears through it only about noon and then of a dilute red and very
minute particles subside from the misty air so as to make the grass and
the skins of negroes appear whitish the extreme dryness which attends
this wind or fog without dews withers and quite dries the leaves of
vegetables and is said of dr lind at some seasons to be fatal and
malignant to mankind probably after much preceding wet when it may
become loaded with the exhalations from putrid marshes at other
seasons it is said to check epidemic diseases to cure fluxes and
to heal ulcers and cutaneous eruptions which is probably effected by its
yielding no moisture to the mouths of the external absorbent vessels
by which the action of the other branches of the absorbent system is
increased to supply the deficiency account of the harmattan phil

the rev mr sterling gives an account of a darkness for six or eight
hours at detroit in america on the 19th of october 1762 in which
the sun appeared as red as blood and thrice its usual size some rain
falling covered white paper with dark drops like sulphur or dirt which
burnt like wet gunpowder and the air had a very sulphureous smell
he supposes this to have been emitted from some distant earthquake or
volcano philos trans v liii p 63
in many circumstances this wind seems much to resemble the dry fog which
covered most parts of europe for many weeks in the summer of 1780 which
has been supposed to have had a volcanic origin as it succeeded the
violent eruption of mount hecla and its neighbourhood from the
subsidence of a white powder it seems probable that the harmattan has
a similar origin from the unexplored mountains of africa nor is it
improbable that the epidemic coughs which occasionally traverse immense
tracts of country may be the products of volcanic eruptions nor
impossible that at some future time contagious miasmata may be thus
emitted from subterraneous furnaces in such abundance as to contaminate
the whole atmosphere and depopulate the earth

the flowers for the evidence of this wonderful fact see the word
caprification in milnes botanical dictionary the figs of this country
are all female and their seeds not prolific and therefore they can only
be propagated by layers and suckers
monsieur de la hire has shewn in the memoir de lacadem de science
that the summer figs of paris in provence italy and malta have all
perfect stamina and ripen not only their fruits but their seed from
which seed other figtrees are raised but that the stamina of the
autumnal figs are abortive perhaps owing to the want of due warmth mr
milne in his botanical dictionary art caprification says that the
cultivated figtrees have a few male flowers placed above the female
within the same covering or receptacle which in warmer climates perform
their proper office but in colder ones become abortive and linneus
observes that some figs have the navel of the receptacle open which
was one reason that induced him to remove this plant from the class
clandestine marriage to the class polygamy lin spec plant
from all these circumstances i should conjecture that those female
figflowers which are closed on all sides in the fruit or receptacle
without any male ones are monsters which have been propagated for their
fruit like barberries and grapes without seeds in them and that the
caprification is either an ancient process of imaginary use and blindly
followed in some countries or that it may contribute to ripen the fig
by decreasing its vigour like cutting off a circle of the bark from the
branch of a peartree tournefort seems inclined to this opinion who
says that the figs in provence and at paris ripen sooner if their buds
be pricked with a straw dipped in oliveoil plumbs and pears punctured
by some insects ripen sooner and the part round the puncture is sweeter
is not the honeydew produced by the puncture of insects will not
wounding the branch of a peartree which is too vigorous prevent the
blossoms from falling off as from some figtrees the fruit is said to
fall off unless they are wounded by caprification i had last spring six
young trees of the ischia fig with fruit on them in pots in a stove on
removing them into larger boxes they protruded very vigorous shoots and
the figs all fell off which i ascribed to the increased vigour of the

with an elegant coloured drawing by miss maria jackson of tarporly in
cheshire a lady who adds much botanical knowledge to many other elegant
acquirements in the apocynum androsaemifolium one kind of dogs bane
the anthers converge over the nectaries which consist of five glandular
oval corpuscles surrounding the germ and at the same time admit air
to the nectaries at the interstice between each anther but when a fly
inserts its proboscis between these anthers to plunder the honey they
converge closer and with such violence as to detain the fly which thus
generally perishes this account was related to me by rw darwin esq
of elston in nottinghamshire who showed me the plant in flower july
2d 1788 with a fly thus held fast by the end of its proboscis and was
well seen by a magnifying lens and which in vain repeatedly struggled to
disengage itself till the converging anthers were separated by means
of a pin on some days he had observed that almost every flower of this
elegant plant had a fly in it thus entangled and a few weeks afterwards
favoured me with his further observations on this subject
   my apocynum is not yet out of flower i have often visited it and
   have frequently found four or five flies some alive and some dead
   in its flowers they are generally caught by the trunk or proboscis
   sometimes by the trunk and a leg there is one at present only caught
   by a leg i dont know that this plant sleeps as the flowers remain
   open in the night yet the flies frequently make their escape in a

p 136 addition to the note on tropolum in sweden a very curious
phenomenon has been observed on certain flowers by m haggren
lecturer in natural history one evening be perceived a faint flash of
light repeatedly dart from a marigold surprized at such an uncommon
appearance he resolved to examine it with attention and to be assured
that it was no deception of the eye he placed a man near him with
orders to make a signal at the moment when he observed the light they
both saw it constantly at the same moment
the light was most brilliant on marigolds of an orange or flame colour
but scarcely visible on pale ones
the flash was frequently seen on the same flower two or three times in
quick succession but more commonly at intervals of several minutes and
when several flowers in the same place emitted their light together it
could be observed at a considerable distance
this phaenomenon was remarked in the months of july and august at
sunset and for half an hour after when the atmosphere was clear but
after a rainy day or when the air was loaded with vapours nothing of it
was seen
        the following flowers emitted flashes more or less vivid in this
        order
        1 the marigold calendula officinalis
        2 garden nasturtion tropolum majus
        3 orange lily lilium bulbiferum
        4 the indian pink tagetes patula et erecta
sometimes it was also observed on the sunflowers helianthus annuus
but bright yellow or flame colour seemed in general necessary for the
production of this light for it was never seen on the flowers of any
other colour
to discover whether some little insects or phosphoric worms might not
be the cause of it the flowers were carefully examined even with a
microscope without any such being found
from the rapidity of the flash and other circumstances it might be
conjectured that there is something of electricity in this phaenomenon
it is well known that when the pistil of a flower is impregnated the
pollen bursts away by its elasticity with which electricity may be
combined but m haggren after having observed the slash from the
orangelily the anthers of which are a considerable space distant from
the petals found that the light proceeded from the petals only
whence he concludes that this electric light is caused by the pollen
which in flying off is scattered upon the petals obser physque par

description of the poisontree in the island of java translated from
the original dutch of n p foerich
this destructive tree is called in the malayan language bohonupas
and has been described by naturalists but their accounts have been
so tinctured with the marvellous that the whole narration has been
supposed to be an ingenious fiction by the generality of readers nor
is this in the least degree surprising when the circumstances which we
shall faithfully relate in this description are considered
i must acknowledge that i long doubted the existence of this tree until
a stricter enquiry convinced me of my error i shall now only relate
simple unadorned facts of which i have been an eyewitness my readers
may depend upon the fidelity of this account in the year 1774 i was
stationed at batavia as surgeon in the service of the dutch eastindia
company during my residence there i received several different accounts
of the bohon upas and the violent effects of its poison they all then
seemed incredible to me but raised my curiosity in so high a degree
that i resolved to investigate this subject thoroughly and to trust only
to my own observations in consequence of this resolution i applied to
the governorgeneral mr petrus albertus van der parra for a pass to
travel through the country my request was granted and having procured
every information i set out on my expedition i had procured a
recommendation from an old malayan priest to another priest who lives
on the nearest inhabitable spot to the tree which is about fifteen or
sixteen miles distant the letter proved of great service to me in my
undertaking as that priest is appointed by the emperor to reside there
in order to prepare for eternity the souls of those who for different
crimes are sentenced to approach the tree and to procure the poison
the bohonupas is situated in the island of java about twentyseven
leagues from batavia fourteen from soura charta the seat of the
emperor and between eighteen and twenty leagues from tinksor the
present residence of the sultan of java it is surrounded on all sides by
a circle of high hills and mountains and the country round it to the
distance of ten or twelve miles from the tree is entirely barren not
a tree nor a shrub nor even the least plant or grass is to be seen
i have made the tour all around this dangerous spot at about eighteen
miles distant from the centre and i found the aspect of the country on
all sides equally dreary the easiest ascent of the hills is from that
part where the old ecclesiastick dwells from his house the criminals are
sent for the poison into which the points of all warlike instruments are
dipped it is of high value and produces a considerable revenue to the
emperor
account of the manner in which the poison it procured
the poison which is procured from this tree is a gum that issues out
between the bark and the tree itself like the camphor malefactors
who for their crimes are sentenced to die are the only persons who fetch
the poison and this is the only chance they have of saving their lives
after sentence is pronounced upon them by the judge they are asked in
court whether they will die by the hands of the executioner or whether
they will go to the upas tree for a box of poison they commonly prefer
the latter proposal as there is not only some chance of preserving
their lives but also a certainty in case of their safe return that a
provision will be made for them in future by the emperor they are also
permitted to ask a favour from the emperor which is generally of a
trifling nature and commonly granted they are then provided with a
silver or tortoiseshell box in which they are to put the poisonous gum
and are properly instructed how to proceed while they are upon their
dangerous expedition among other particulars they are always told to
attend to the direction of the winds as they are to go towards the tree
before the wind so that the effluvia from the tree are always blown from
them they are told likewise to travel with the utmost dispatch as
that is the only method of insuring a safe return they are afterwards
sent to the house of the old priest to which place they are commonly
attended by their friends and relations here they generally remain
some days in expectation of a favourable breeze during that time
the ecclesiastic prepares them for their future fate by prayers and
admonitions when the hour of their departure arrives the priest puts
them on a long leathercap with two glasses before their eyes which
comes down as far as their breast and also provides them with a pair of
leathergloves they are then conducted by the priest and their friends
and relations about two miles on their journey here the priest repeats
his instructions and tells them where they are to look for the tree he
shews them a hill which they are told to ascend and that on the other
side they will find a rivulet which they are to follow and which will
conduct them directly to the upas they now take leave of each other
and amidst prayers for their success the delinquents hasten away the
worthy old ecclesiastic has assured me that during his residence there
for upwards of thirty years he had dismissed above seven hundred
criminals in the manner which i have described and that scarcely two
out of twenty have returned he shewed me a catalogue of all the unhappy
sufferers with the date of their departure from his house annexed and
a list of the offences for which they had been condemned to which was
added a list of those who had returned in safety i afterwards saw
another list of these culprits at the jail keepers at souracharta
and found that they perfectly corresponded with each other and with the
different informations which i afterwards obtained i was present at some
of these melancholy ceremonies and desired different delinquents to
bring with them some pieces of the wood or a small branch or some
leaves of this wonderful tree i have also given them silk cords
desiring them to measure its thickness i never could procure move than
two dry leaves that were picked up by one of them on his return and all
i could learn from him concerning the tree itself was that it stood on
the border of a rivulet as described by the old priest that it was of a
middling size that five or six young trees of the same kind stood close
by it but that no other shrub or plant could be seen near it and that
the ground was of a brownish sand full of stones almost impracticable
for travelling and covered with dead bodies after many conversations
with the old malayan priest i questioned him about the first discovery
and asked his opinion of this dangerous tree upon which he gave me the
following answer
we are told in our new alcoran that above an hundred years ago the
country around the tree was inhabited by a people strongly addicted to
the sins of sodom and gomorrha when the great prophet mahomet
determined not to suffer them to lead such detestable lives any longer
he applied to god to punish them upon which god caused this tree to
grow out of the earth which destroyed them all and rendered the
country for ever uninhabitable
such was the malayan opinion i shall not attempt a comment but must
observe that all the malayans consider this tree as an holy instrument
of the great prophet to punish the sins of mankind and therefore to
die of the poison of the upas is generally considered among them as an
honourable death for that reason i also observed that the delinquents
who were going to the tree were generally dressed in their best apparel
this however is certain though it may appear incredible that from
fifteen to eighteen miles round this tree not only no human creature can
exist but that in that space of ground no living animal of any kind
has ever been discovered i have also been assured by several persons of
veracity that there are no fish in the waters nor has any rat mouse
or any other vermin been seen there and when any birds fly so near this
tree that the effluvia reaches them they fall a sacrifice to the effects
of the poison this circumstance has been ascertained by different
delinquents who in their return have seen the birds drop down and
have picked them up dead and brought them to the old ecclesiastick
i will here mention an instance which proves them a fact beyond all
doubt and which happened during my stay at java
in the year 1775 a rebellion broke out among the subjects of the massay
a sovereign prince whose dignity is nearly equal to that of the emperor
they refused to pay a duty imposed upon them by their sovereign whom
they openly opposed the massay sent a body of a thousand troops to
disperse the rebels and to drive them with their families out of
his dominions thus four hundred families consisting of above sixteen
hundred souls were obliged to leave their native country neither the
emperor nor the sultan would give them protection not only because they
were rebels but also through fear of displeasing their neighbour the
massay in this distressful situation they had no other resource than to
repair to the uncultivated parts round the upas and requested permission
of the emperor to settle there their request was granted on condition
of their fixing their abode not more than twelve or fourteen miles from
the tree in order not to deprive the inhabitants already settled there
at a greater distance of their cultivated lands with this they were
obliged to comply but the consequence was that in less than two months
their number was reduced to about three hundred the chiefs of those
who remained returned to the massay informed him of their losses
and intreated his pardon which induced him to receive them again as
subjects thinking them sufficiently punished for their misconduct i
have seen and conversed with several of those who survived soon after
their return they all had the appearance of persons tainted with an
infectious disorder they looked pale and weak and from the account
which they gave of the loss of their comrades of the symptoms and
circumstances which attended their dissolution such as convulsions and
other signs of a violent death i was fully convinced that they fell
victims to the poison
this violent effect of the poison at so great a distance from the tree
certainly appears surprising and almost incredible and especially when
we consider that it is possible for delinquents who approach the tree to
return alive my wonder however in a great measure ceased after i had
made the following observations
i have said before that malefactors are instructed to go to the tree
with the wind and to return against the wind when the wind continues to
blow from the same quarter while the delinquent travels thirty or six
and thirty miles if he be of a good constitution he certainly survives
but what proves the most destructive is that there is no dependence on
the wind in that part of the world for any length of timethere are no
regular landwinds and the seawind is not perceived there at all the
situation of the tree being at too great a distance and surrounded by
high mountains and uncultivated forests besides the wind there never
blows a fresh regular gale but is commonly merely a current of light
soft breezes which pass through the different openings of the adjoining
mountains it is also frequently difficult to determine from what part of
the globe the wind really comes as it is divided by various obstructions
in its passage which easily change the direction of the wind and often
totally destroy its effects
i therefore impute the distant effects of the poison in a great
measure to the constant gentle winds in those parts which have not
power enough to disperse the poisonous particles if high winds are more
frequent and durable there they would certainly weaken very much and
even destroy the obnoxious effluvia of the poison but without them the
air remains infested and pregnant with these poisonous vapours
i am the more convinced of this as the worthy ecclesiastick assured me
that a dead calm is always attended with the greatest danger as there is
a continual perspiration issuing from the tree which is seen to rise and
spread in the air like the putrid steam of a marshy cavern
experiments made with the gum of the upas tree
in the year 1776 in the month of february i was present at the
execution of thirteen of the emperors concubines at souracharta
who were convicted of infidelity to the emperors bed it was in the
forenoon about eleven oclock when the fair criminals were led into
an open space within the walls of the emperors palace there the judge
passed sentence upon them by which they are doomed to suffer death by a
lancet poisoned with upas after this the alcoran was presented to them
and they were according to the law of their great prophet mahomet to
acknowledge and to affirm by oath that the charges brought against them
together with the sentence and their punishment were fair and equitable
this they did by laying their right hand upon the alcoran their left
hands upon their breast and their eyes lifted towards heaven the judge
then held the alcoran to their lips and they kissed it
these ceremonies over the executioner proceeded on his business in the
following mannerthirteen posts each about five feet high had been
previously erected to these the delinquents were fastened and their
breasts stripped naked in this situation they remained a short time in
continual prayers attended by several priests until a signal was
given by the judge to the executioner on which the latter produced an
instrument much like the spring lancet used by farriers for bleeding
horses with this instrument it being poisoned with the gum of the upas
the unhappy wretches were lanced in the middle of their breasts and the
operation was performed upon them all in less than two minutes
my astonishment was raised to the highest degree when i beheld the
sudden effects of that poison for in about five minutes after they were
lanced they were taken with a tremor attended with a subsultus
tendinum after which they died in the greatest agonies crying out to
god and mahomet for mercy in sixteen minutes by my watch which i held
in my hand all the criminals were no more some hours after their death
i observed their bodies full of livid spots much like those of the
petechi their faces swelled their colour changed to a kind of blue
their eyes looked yellow c c
about a fortnight after this i had an opportunity of seeing such another
execution at samarang seven malayans were executed there with the same
instrument and in the same manner and i found the operation of the
poison and the spots in their bodies exactly the same
these circumstances made me desirous to try an experiment with some
animals in order to be convinced of the real effects of this poison and
as i had then two young puppies i thought them the fittest objects for
my purpose i accordingly procured with great difficulty some grains of
upas i dissolved half a grain of that gum in a small quantity of arrack
and dipped a lancet into it with this poisoned instrument i made an
incision in the lower muscular part of the belly in one of the puppies
three minutes after it received the wound the animal began to cry out
most piteously and ran as fast as possible from one corner of the room
to the other so it continued during six minutes when all its strength
being exhausted it fell upon the ground was taken with convulsions and
died in the eleventh minute i repeated this experiment with two other
puppies with a cat and a fowl and found the operation of the poison
in all of them the same none of these animals survived above thirteen
minutes
i thought it necessary to try also the effect of the poison given
inwardly which i did in the following manner i dissolved a quarter of
a grain of the gum in half an ounce of arrack and made a dog of seven
months old drink it in seven minutes a retching ensued and i observed
at the same time that the animal was delirious as it ran up and down
the room fell on the ground and tumbled about then it rose again
cried out very loud and in about half an hour after was seized with
convulsions and died i opened the body and found the stomach very much
inflamed as the intestines were in some parts but not so much as the
stomach there was a small quantity of coagulated blood in the stomach
but i could discover no orifice from which it could have issued and
therefore supposed it to have been squeezed out of the lungs by the
animals straining while it was vomiting
from these experiments i have been convinced that the gum of the upas is
the most dangerous and most violent of all vegetable poisons and i am
apt to believe that it greatly contributes to the unhealthiness of that
island nor is this the only evil attending it hundreds of the natives
of java as well as europeans are yearly destroyed and treacherously
murdered by that poison either internally or externally every man of
quality or fashion has his dagger or other arms poisoned with it and in
times of war the malayans poison the springs and other waters with it by
this treacherous practice the dutch suffered greatly during the last war
as it occasioned the loss of half their army for this reason they have
ever since kept fish in the springs of which they drink the water and
sentinels are placed near them who inspect the waters every hour to see
whether the fish are alive if they march with an army or body of troops
into an enemys country they always carry live fish with them which
they throw into the water some hours before they venture to drink it by
which means they have been able to prevent their total destruction
this account i flatter myself will satisfy the curiosity of my readers
and the few facts which i have related will be considered as a certain
proof of the exigence of this pernicious tree and its penetrating
effects
if it be asked why we have not yet any more satisfactory accounts of this
tree i can only answer that the object to most travellers to that part
of the world consists more in commercial pursuits than in the study of
natural history and the advancement of sciences besides java is so
universally reputed an unhealthy island that rich travellers seldom
make any long stay in it and others want money and generally are too
ignorant of the language to travel in order to make enquiries in
future those who visit this island will probably now be induced to make
it an object of their researches and will furnish us with a fuller
description of this tree
i will therefore only add that there exists also a sort of cajoeupat on
the coast of macassar the poison of which operates nearly in the same
manner but is not half so violent or malignant as that of java and
of which i shall likewise give a more circumstantial account in a
description of that islandlondon magazine
