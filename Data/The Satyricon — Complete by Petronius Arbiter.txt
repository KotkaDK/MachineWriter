                           the satyricon of
                           petronius arbiter
          complete and unexpurgated translation by w c firebaugh
          in which are incorporated the forgeries of nodot and marchena
          and the readings introduced into the text by de salas
among the difficulties which beset the path of the conscientious
translator a sense of his own unworthiness must ever take precedence
but another scarcely less disconcerting is the likelihood of
misunderstanding some allusion which was perfectly familiar to the author
and his public but which by reason of its purely local significance
is obscure and subject to the misinterpretation and emendation of a later
generation
a translation worthy of the name is as much the product of a literary
epoch as it is of the brain and labor of a scholar and melmouths
version of the letters of pliny the younger made as it was at a
period when the art of english letter writing had attained its highest
excellence may well be the despair of our twentieth century apostles of
specialization  who today could imbue a translation of the golden ass
with the exquisite flavor of william adlingtons unscholarly version of
that masterpiece  who could rival arthur goldings rendering of the
metamorphoses of ovid or francis hickes masterly rendering of lucians
true history  but eternal life means endless change and in nothing is
this truth more strikingly manifest than in the growth and decadence of
living languages and in the translation of dead tongues into the ever
changing tissue of the living  were it not for this no translation
worthy of the name would ever stand in need of revision except in
instances where the discovery and collation of fresh manuscripts had
improved the text  in the case of an author whose characters speak in
the argot proper to their surroundings the necessity for revision is
even more imperative the change in the cultured speech of a language is
a process that requires years to become pronounced the evolution of
slang is rapid and its usage ephemeral  for example stephen gaselee in
his bibliography of petronius calls attention to harry thurston pecks
rendering of bell um pomum by hes a daisy and remarks
appropriately enough that this was well enough for 1898 but we would
now be more inclined to render it hes a peach  again peck renders
illud erat vivere by that was life but in the words of our lyric
american jazz we would be more inclined to render it that was the
life  but as professor gaselee has said no rendering of this part
of the satyricon can be final it must always be in the slang of the
hour
some writes the immortal translator of rabelais in his preface
have deservedly gained esteem by translating yet not many condescend
to translate but such as cannot invent though to do the first well
requires often as much genius as to do the latter  i wish reader
thou mayest be as willing to do the author justice as i have strove
to do him right
many scholars have lamented the failure of justus lipsius to comment upon
petronius or edit an edition of the satyricon  had he done so he might
have gone far toward piercing the veil of darkness which enshrouds the
authorship of the work and the very age in which the composer flourished
to me personally the fact that laurence sterne did not undertake a
version has caused much regret  the master who delineated tristram
shandys father and the intrigue between the widow wadman and uncle toby
would have drawn trimalchio and his peers to admiration

introduction
of the many masterpieces which classical antiquity has bequeathed to
modern times few have attained at intervals to such popularity few
have so gripped the interest of scholars and men of letters as has this
scintillating miscellany known as the satyricon ascribed by tradition to
that petronius who at the court of nero acted as arbiter of elegance
and dictator of fashion  the flashing wit the masterly touches which
bring out the characters with all the detail of a fine old copper
etching the marvelous use of realism by this its first prophet the
sure knowledge of the perspective and background best adapted to each
episode the racy style so smooth so elegant so simple when the
educated are speaking beguile the reader and blind him at first to the
many discrepancies and incoherences with which the text as we have it
is marred  the more one concentrates upon this author the more apparent
these faults become and the more one regrets the lacunae in the text
notwithstanding numerous articles which deal with this work some from
the pens of the most profound scholars its author is still shrouded in
the mists of uncertainty and conjecture  he is as impersonal as
shakespeare as aloof as flaubert in the opinion of charles whibley
and it may be added as genial as rabelais an enigmatic genius whose
secret will never be laid bare with the resources at our present command
as i am not writing for scholars i do not intend going very deeply into
the labyrinth of critical controversy which surrounds the author and the
work but i shall deal with a few of the questions which if properly
understood will enhance the value of the satyricon and contribute in
some degree to a better understanding of the author  for the sake of
convenience the questions discussed in this introduction will be arranged
in the following order
1  the satyricon
2  the author
     a  his character
     b  his purpose in writing
     c  time in which the action is placed
     d  localization of the principal episode
3  realism
     a  influence of the satyricon upon the literature of the world
4  the forgeries
i
the satyricon  heinsius and scaliger derive the word from the greek
whence comes our english word satyr but casaubon dacier and spanheim
derive it from the latin satura a plate filled with different kinds
of food and they refer to porphyrions multis et variis rebus hoc
carmen refertum est
the text as we possess it may be divided into three divisions the
first and last relate the adventures of encolpius and his companions the
second which is a digression describes the dinner of trimalchio  that
the work was originally divided into books we had long known from
ancient glossaries and we learn from the title of the traguriensian
manuscript that the fragments therein contained are excerpts from the
fifteenth and sixteenth books  an interpolation of fulgentius paris
7975 attributes to book fourteen the scene related in chapter 20 of the
work as we have it and the glossary of st benedict floriacensis cites
the passage sed video te totum in illa haerere quae troiae halosin
ostendit chapter 89 as from book fifteen  as there is no reason to
suppose that the chapters intervening between the end of the cena
chapter 79 and chapter 89 are out of place it follows that this
passage may have belonged to book sixteen or even seventeen but that it
could not have belonged to book fifteen  from the interpolation of
fulgentius we may hazard the opinion that the beginning of the fragments
as we possess them chapters 1 to 26 form part of book fourteen  the
dinner of trimalchio probably formed a complete book fifteen and the
continuation of the adventures of encolpius down to his meeting with
eumolpus end of chapter 140 book sixteen  the discomfiture of eumolpus
should have closed this book but not the entire work as the exit of the
two principal characters is not fixed at the time our fragments come to
an end  the original work then would probably have exceeded tom jones
in length
ii
the author
anot often says studer rheinisches museum 1843 has there been
so much dispute about the author the times the character and the
purpose of a writing of antiquity as about the fragments of the satyricon
of petronius  the discovery and publication of the trau manuscript
brought about a literary controversy which has had few parallels and
which has not entirely died out to this day although the best
authorities ascribe the work to caius petronius the arbiter elegantiarum
at the court of nero  the question as to the date of the narrative of
the adventures of encolpius and his boon companions must be regarded as
settled says theodor mommsen hermes 1878 this narrative is
unsurpassed in originality and mastery of treatment among the writings of
roman literature  nor does anyone doubt the identity of its author and
the arbiter elegantiarum of nero whose end tacitus relates
in any case the author of this work if it be the work of one brain
must have been a profound psychologist a master of realism a
naturalborn story teller and a gentleman
bhis principal object in writing the work was to amuse but in amusing
he also intended to pillory the aristocracy and his wit is as keen as the
point of a rapier but when we bear in mind the fact that he was an
ancient we will find that his cynicism is not cruel in him there is
none of the malignity of aristophanes there is rather the attitude of
the refined patrician who is always under the necessity of facing those
things which he holds most in contempt the supreme artist who suffers
from the multitude of billboards so to speak who lashes the posters
but holds in pitying contempt those who know so little of true art that
they mistake those posters for the genuine article  niebuhrs estimate
of his character is so just and free from prejudice and proceeds from
a mind which in itself was so pure and wholesome that i will quote it
all great dramatic poets are endowed with the power of creating beings
who seem to act and speak with perfect independence so that the poet is
nothing more than the relator of what takes place  when goethe had
conceived faust and margarete mephistopheles and wagner they moved and
had their being without any exercise of his will  but in the peculiar
power which petronius exercises in its application to every scene to
every individual character in everything noble or mean which he
undertakes i know of but one who is fully equal to the roman and that
is diderot  trimalchio and agamemnon might have spoken for petronius
and the nephew rameau and the parson papin for diderot in every
condition and on every occasion inexhaustibly out of their own nature
just so the purest and noblest souls whose kind was after all not
entirely extinct in their day
diderot and a contemporary related to him in spirit count gaspar
gozzi are marked with the same cynicism which disfigures the roman
their age like his had become shameless  but as the two former were in
their heart noble upright and benevolent men and as in the writings of
diderot genuine virtue and a tenderness unknown to his contemporaries
breathe so the peculiarity of such a genius can as it seems be given
to a noble and elevated being only  the deep contempt for prevailing
immorality which naturally leads to cynicism and a heart which beats for
everything great and gloriousvirtues which then had no existence
speak from the pages of the roman in a language intelligible to every
susceptible heart
ebeck in his paper the age of petronius arbiter concluded that the
author lived and wrote between the years 6 ad  and 34 ad but he
overlooked the possibility that the author might have lived a few years
later written of conditions as they were in his own times and yet laid
the action of his novel a few years before  mommsen and haley place the
time under augustus buecheler about 367 ad and friedlaender under
nero
dla porte du theil places the scene at naples because of the fact the
city in which our heroes met agamemnon must have been of some
considerable size because neither encolpius nor asclytos could find their
way back to their inn when once they had left it because both were
tired out from tramping around in search of it and because giton had been
so impressed with this danger that he took the precaution to mark the
pillars with chalk in order that they might not be lost a second time
the gulf of naples is the only bit of coastline which fits the needs of
the novel hence the city must be naples  the fact that neither of the
characters knew the city proves that they had been recent arrivals and
this furnishes a clue vague though it is to what may have gone before
haley harvard studies in classical philology vol ii makes out a
very strong case for puteoli and his theory of the old town and the new
town is as ingenious as it is able  haley also has trimalchio in his
favor as has also la porte du theil  i saw the sibyl at cumae says
trimalchio  now if the scene of the dinner is actually at cumae this
sounds very peculiar it might even be a gloss added by some copyist
whose knowledge was not equal to his industry  on the other hand
suppose trimalchio is speaking of something so commonplace in his
locality that the second term has become a generic then the difficulty
disappears  we today even though standing upon the very spot in melos
where the venus was unearthed would still refer to her as the venus de
melos  friedlaender in bracketing cumis has not taken this
sufficiently into consideration  mommsen in an excellent paper hermes
1878 has laid the scene at cumae  his logic is almost unanswerable
and the consensus of opinion is in favor of the latter town
iii
realism  realism as we are concerned with it may be defined as the
literary effect produced by the marshaling of details in their exactitude
for the purpose of bringing out character  the fact that they may be
ugly and vulgar or the reverse makes not the slightest difference  the
modern realist contemplates the inanimate things which surround us with
peculiar complaisance and it is right that he should as these things
exert upon us a constant and secret influence  the workings of the human
mind in complex civilizations are by no means simple they are involved
and varied our thoughts our feelings our wills associate themselves
with an infinite number of sensations and images which play one upon the
other and which individualize in some measure every action we commit
and stamp it  the merit of our modern realists lies in the fact that
they have studied the things which surround us and our relations to them
and thus have they been able to make their creations conform to human
experience  the ancients gave little attention to this the man with
them was the important thing the environment the unimportant  there
are of course exceptions the interview between ulysses and nausiskaa
is probably the most striking  from the standpoint of environment
petronius in the greater portion of his work is an ancient but one
exception there is and it is as brilliant as it is important  the
entire episode in which trimalchio figures offers an incredible
abundance of details  the descriptions are exhaustive and minute but
the authors prime purpose was not description it was to bring out the
characters it was to pillory the roman aristocracy it was to amuse
cicero in his prosecution of verres had shown up this aristocracy in
all its brutality and greed it remained for the author of the cena to
hold its absurdity up to the light of day to lash an extravagance which
though utterly unbridled was yet unable to exhaust the looted
accumulations of years of political double dealing and malfeasance in
office  trimalchios introduction is a masterstroke the porter at the
door is another the effect of the wine upon the women their jealousy
lest eithers husband should seem more liberal their appraisal of each
others jewelry scintillas remark anent the finesse of habinnas
servant in the mere matter of pandering the bleareyed and blacktoothed
slave teasing a little bitch disgustingly fat offering her pieces of
bread and when from sheer inability she refuses to eat cramming it
down her throat the effect of the alcohol upon trimalchio the little
old lady girded round with a filthy apron wearing clogs which were not
mates dragging in a huge dog on a chain the incomparable humor in the
passage in which hesus desperately seasick sees that which makes him
believe that even worse misfortunes are in store for him these details
are masterpieces of realism  the description of the nightprowling
shyster lawyer whose forehead is covered with sebaceous wens is the
very acme of propriety our first meeting with the poet eumolpus is a
beautiful study in background and perspective  nineteen centuries have
gone their way since this novel was written but if we look about us we
will be able to recognize under the veneer of civilization the
originals of the satyricon and we will find that here in a little corner
of the roman world all humanity was held in miniature  petronius must
be credited with the great merit of having introduced realism into the
novel  by an inspiration of genius he saw that the framework of
frivolous and licentious novels could be enlarged until it took in
contemporary custom and environment  it is that which assures for him
an eminent place not in roman literature alone but in the literature
of the world
ainfluence of the satyricon upon literature  the vagrant heroes of
petronius are the originals from whom directly or indirectly later
authors drew that inspiration which resulted in the great mass of
picaresque fiction but great as this is it is not to this that the
satyricon owes its powerful influence upon the literature of the world
it is to the authors recognition of the importance of environment
of the vital role of inanimate surroundings as a means for bringing out
character and imbuing his episodes and the actions of his characters with
an air of reality and with those impulses and actions which are common to
human experience that his influence is due  by this the roman created
a new style of writing and inaugurated a class of literature which was
without parallel until the time of apuleius and in a lesser degree of
lucian  this class of literature though modified essentially from age
to age in keeping with the dictates of moral purity or bigotry innocent
or otherwise has come to be the very stuff of which literary success in
fiction is made  one may write a successful book without a thread of
romance one cannot write a successful romance without some knowledge of
realism the more intimate the knowledge the better the book and it is
frequently to this that the failure of a novel is due although the
critic might be at a loss to explain it  petronius lies behind tristram
shandy his influence can be detected in smollett and even fielding paid
tribute to him
iv
forgeries of petronius
from the very nature of the writings of such an author as petronius it
is evident that the gaps in the text would have a marked tendency to
stimulate the curiosity of literary forgers and to tempt their sagacity
literary or otherwise  the recovery of the trimalchionian episode and
the subsequent pamphleteering would by no means eradicate this cacoethes
emendandi
when circa 1650 the library of the unfortunate nicolas cippico yielded
up the trau fragment the news of this discovery spread far and wide and
about twelve years later statileo in response to the repeated requests
of the venetian ambassador pietro basadonna made with his own hand a
copy of the ms which he sent to basadonna  the ambassador in turn
permitted this ms to be printed by one frambotti a printer endowed with
more industry than critical acumen and the resultant textual conflation
had much to do with the pamphlet war which followed  had this paduan
printer followed the explicit directions which he received and printed
exactly what was given him much good paper might have been saved and a
very interesting chapter in the history of literary forgery would
probably never have been written  the pamphlet war did not die out until
bleau in 167071 printed his exact reproduction of the trau manuscript
and the corrections introduced by that licentiousness of emendation of
which we have spoken
in october 1690 francois nodot a french soldier of fortune a
commissary officer who combined belles lettres and philosophy with his
official duties wrote to charpentier president of the academy of
france calling his attention to a copy of a manuscript which he nodot
possessed and which came into his hands in the following manner one
du pin a french officer detailed to service with austria had been
present at the sack of belgrade in 1688  that this du pin had while
there made the acquaintance of a certain greek renegade having as a
matter of fact stayed in the house of this renegade  the greeks
father a man of some learning had by some means come into possession of
the ms and du pin in going through some of the books in the house had
come across it  he had experienced the utmost difficulty in deciphering
the letters and finally driven by curiosity had retained a copyist and
had it copied out  that this du pin had this copy in his house at
frankfort and that he had given nodot to understand that if he nodot
came to frankfort he would be permitted to see this copy  owing to the
exigencies of military service nodot had been unable to go in person to
frankfort and that he had therefore availed himself of the friendly
interest and services of a certain merchant of frankfort who had
volunteered to find an amanuensis have a copy made and send it to
nodot  this was done and nodot concludes his letter to charpentier by
requesting the latter to lay the result before the academy and ask for
their blessing and approval  these nodotian supplements were accepted as
authentic by the academics of arles and nimes as well as by charpentier
in a short time however the voices of scholarly skeptics began to be
heard in the land and accurate and unbiased criticism laid bare the
fraud  the latinity was attacked and exception taken to silver age
prose in which was found a french police regulation which required newly
arrived travellers to register their names in the book of a police
officer of an italian village of the first century  although they are
still retained in the text by some editors this is done to give some
measure of continuity to an otherwise interrupted narrative but they can
only serve to distort the author and obscure whatever view of him the
reader might otherwise have reached  they are generally printed between
brackets or in different type
in 1768 another and far abler forger saw the light of day  jose
marchena a spaniard of jewish extraction was destined for an
ecclesiastical career  he received an excellent education which served
to fortify a natural bent toward languages and historical criticism  in
his early youth he showed a marked preference for uncanonical pursuits
and heretical doctrines and before he had reached his thirtieth year
prudence counseled him to prevent the consequences of his heresy and
avoid the too pressing inquisition by a timely flight into france
he arrived there in time to throw himself into the fight for liberty
and in 1800 we find him at basle attached to the staff of general moreau
while there he is said to have amused himself and some of his cronies by
writing notes on what davenport would have called forbidden subjects
 and as a means of publishing his erotic lucubrations he constructed
this fragment which brings in those topics on which he had enlarged
he translated the fragment into french attached his notes and issued
the book  there is another story to the effect that he had been
reprimanded by moreau for having written a loose song and that he
exculpated himself by assuring the general that it was but a new fragment
of petronius which he had translated  two days later he had the fragment
ready to prove his contention
this is the account given by his spanish biographer  in his preface
dedicated to the army of the rhine he states that he found the fragment
in a manuscript of the work of st gennadius on the duties of priests
probably of the xi century  a close examination revealed the fact that
it was a palimpsest which after treatment permitted the restoration of
this fragment  it is supposed to supply the gap in chapter 26 after the
word verberabant
its obscenity outrivals that of the preceding text and the grammar
style and curiosa felicitas petroniana make it an almost perfect
imitation  there is no internal evidence of forgery  if the text is
closely scrutinized it will be seen that it is composed of words and
expressions taken from various parts of the satyricon and that in every
line it has exactly the petronian turn of phrase
not only is the original edition unprocurable to quote again from
mr gaselees invaluable bibliography but the reprint at soleure
brussels 1865 consisted of only 120 copies and is hard to find
the most accessible place for english readers is in bohns translation
in which however only the latin text is given and the notes were a
most important part of the original work
these notes humorously and perhaps sarcastically ascribed to lallemand
sanctae theologiae doctor are six in number all on various forms of
vice and show great knowledge classical and sociological of unsavory
subjects  now that the book is too rare to do us any harm we may admit
that the pastiche was not only highly amusing but showed a perverse
cleverness amounting almost to genius
marchena died at madrid in great poverty in 1821  a contemporary has
described him as being rather short and heavy set in figure of great
frontal development and vain beyond belief  he considered himself
invincible where women were concerned  he had a peculiar predilection
in the choice of animal pets and was an object of fear and curiosity
to the towns people  his forgery might have been completely successful
had he not acknowledged it himself within two or three years after the
publication of his brochure  the fragment will remain a permanent
tribute to the excellence of his scholarship but it is his ode to christ
crucified which has made him more generally known and it is one of the
ironies of fate that caused this deformed giant of sarcasm to compose a
poem of such tender and touching piety
very little is known about don joe antonio gonzalez de salas whose
connecting passages with the exception of one which is irrelevant are
here included
the learned editors of the spanish encyclopedia naively preface their
brief sketch with the following assertion no tenemos noticias de su
vida  de salas was born in 1588 and died in 1654  his edition of
petronius was first issued in 1629 and reissued in 1643 with a copper
plate of the editor  the paris edition from which he says he supplied
certain deficiencies in the text is unknown to bibliographers and is
supposed to be fictitious
to distinguish the spurious passages as a point of interest in the
present edition the forgeries of nodot are printed within round
brackets the forgery of marchena within square brackets and the
additions of de salas in italics in this pg etext in curly brackets
the work is also accompanied by a translation of the six notes the
composition of which led marchena to forge the fragment which first
appeared in the year 1800  these have never before been translated

volume 1adventures of encolpius and his companions
chapter the first
it has been so long since i promised you the story of my adventures
that i have decided to make good my word today and seeing that we have
thus fortunately met not to discuss scientific matters alone but also
to enliven our jolly conversation with witty stories  fabricius veiento
has already spoken very cleverly on the errors committed in the name of
religion and shown how priests animated by an hypocritical mania for
prophecy boldly expound mysteries which are too often such to
themselves  but are our rhetoricians tormented by another species of
furies when they cry i received these wounds while fighting for the
public liberty i lost this eye in your defense give me a guide who will
lead me to my children my limbs are hamstrung and will not hold me up
 even these heroics could be endured if they made easier the road to
eloquence but as it is their sole gain from this ferment of matter and
empty discord of words is that when they step into the forum they think
they have been carried into another world  and it is my conviction that
the schools are responsible for the gross foolishness of our young men
because in them they see or hear nothing at all of the affairs of
everyday life but only pirates standing in chains upon the shore
tyrants scribbling edicts in which sons are ordered to behead their own
fathers responses from oracles delivered in time of pestilence
ordering the immolation of three or more virgins every word a honied
drop every period sprinkled with poppyseed and sesame
chapter the second
those who are brought up on such a diet can no more attain to wisdom than
a kitchen scullion can attain to a keen sense of smell or avoid stinking
of the grease  with your indulgence i will speak out youteachers
are chiefly responsible for the decay of oratory  with your well
modulated and empty tones you have so labored for rhetorical effect that
the body of your speech has lost its vigor and died  young men did not
learn set speeches in the days when sophocles and euripides were
searching for words in which to express themselves  in the days when
pindar and the nine lyric poets feared to attempt homeric verse there was
no private tutor to stifle budding genius  i need not cite the poets for
evidence for i do not find that either plato or demosthenes was given
to this kind of exercise  a dignified and if i may say it a chaste
style is neither elaborate nor loaded with ornament it rises supreme by
its own natural purity  this windy and highsounding bombast a recent
immigrant to athens from asia touched with its breath the aspiring
minds of youth with the effect of some pestilential planet and as soon
as the tradition of the past was broken eloquence halted and was
stricken dumb  since that who has attained to the sublimity of
thucydides who rivalled the fame of hyperides  not a single poem
has glowed with a healthy color but all of them as though nourished
on the same diet lacked the strength to live to old age  painting
also suffered the same fate when the presumption of the egyptians
commercialized that incomparable art  i was holding forth along these
lines one day when agamemnon came up to us and scanned with a curious
eye a person to whom the audience was listening so closely
chapter the third
he would not permit me to declaim longer in the portico than he himself
had sweat in the school but exclaimed your sentiments do not reflect
the public taste young man and you are a lover of common sense which
is still more unusual  for that reason i will not deceive you as to the
secrets of my profession  the teachers who must gibber with lunatics
are by no means to blame for these exercises  unless they spoke in
accordance with the dictates of their young pupils they would as cicero
remarks be left alone in the schools  and as designing parasites when
they seek invitations to the tables of the rich have in mind nothing
except what will in their opinion be most acceptable to their audience
for in no other way can they secure their ends save by setting snares
for the earsso it is with the teachers of rhetoric they might be
compared with the fisherman who unless he baits his hook with what he
knows is most appetizing to the little fish may wait all day upon some
rock without the hope of a catch
chapter the fourth
what then is there to do  the parents who are unwilling to permit
their children to undergo a course of training under strict discipline
are the ones who deserve the reproof  in the first place everything
they possess including the children is devoted to ambition  then that
their wishes may the more quickly be realized they drive these unripe
scholars into the forum and the profession of eloquence than which none
is considered nobler devolves upon boys who are still in the act of
being born  if however they would permit a graded course of study to
be prescribed in order that studious boys might ripen their minds by
diligent reading balance their judgment by precepts of wisdom correct
their compositions with an unsparing pen hear at length what they ought
to imitate and be convinced that nothing can be sublime when it is
designed to catch the fancy of boys then the grand style of oratory
would immediately recover the weight and splendor of its majesty  now
the boys play in the schools the young men are laughed at in the forum
and a worse symptom than either no one in his old age will confess
the errors he was taught in his school days  but that you may not
imagine that i disapprove of a jingle in the lucilian manner i will
deliver my opinions in verse
chapter the fifth
    the man who emerges with fame from the school of stern art

chapter the sixth
i was listening so attentively to this speech that i did not notice the
flight of ascyltos and while i was pacing the gardens engulfed in this
floodtide of rhetoric a large crowd of students came out upon the
portico having it would seem just listened to an extemporaneous
declamation of i know not whom the speaker of which had taken
exceptions to the speech of agamemnon  while therefore the young men
were making fun of the sentiments of this last speaker and criticizing
the arrangement of the whole speech i seized the opportunity and went
after ascyltos on the run but as i neither held strictly to the road
nor knew where the inn was located wherever i went i kept coming back
to the same place until worn out with running and long since dripping
with sweat i approached a certain little old woman who sold country
vegetables
chapter the seventh
please mother i wheedled you dont know where i lodge do you
 delighted with such humorous affability whats the reason i dont she
replied and getting upon her feet she commenced to walk ahead of me  i
took her for a prophetess until when presently we came to a more obscure
quarter the affable old lady pushed aside a crazyquilt and remarked
heres where you ought to live and when i denied that i recognized the
house i saw some men prowling stealthily between the rows of nameboards
and naked prostitutes  too late i realized that i had been led into a
brothel  after cursing the wiles of the little old hag i covered my
head and commenced to run through the middle of the nighthouse to the
exit opposite when lo and behold whom should i meet on the very
threshold but ascyltos himself as tired as i was and almost dead you
would have thought that he had been brought by the selfsame little old
hag  i smiled at that greeted him cordially and asked him what he was
doing in such a scandalous place
chapter the eighth
wiping away the sweat with his hands he replied if you only knew what
i have gone through  what was it  i demanded  a most respectable
looking person came up to me he made reply while i was wandering all
over the town and could not find where i had left my inn and very
graciously offered to guide me  he led me through some very dark and
crooked alleys to this place pulled out his tool and commenced to beg
me to comply with his appetite  a whore had already vacated her cell for
an as and he had laid hands upon me and but for the fact that i was
the stronger i would have been compelled to take my medicine  while
ascyltos was telling me of his bad luck who should come up again but
this same very respectable looking person in company with a woman not at
all bad looking and looking at ascyltos he requested him to enter the
house assuring him that there was nothing to fear and since he was
unwilling to take the passive part he should have the active  the
woman on her part urged me very persistently to accompany her so we
followed the couple at last and were conducted between the rows of
nameboards where we saw in cells many persons of each sex amusing
themselves in such a manner that it seemed to me that every one of them
must have been drinking satyrion  on catching sight of us they
attempted to seduce us with paederastic wantonness and one wretch with
his clothes girded up assaulted ascyltos and having thrown him down
upon a couch attempted to gore him from above  i succored the sufferer
immediately however and having joined forces we defied the
troublesome wretch  ascyltos ran out of the house and took to his
heels leaving me as the object of their lewd attacks but the crowd
finding me the stronger in body and purpose let me go unharmed
chapter the ninth
after having tramped nearly all over the city i caught sight of giton
as though through a fog standing at the end of the street on the very
threshold of the inn and i hastened to the same place  when i inquired
whether my brother had prepared anything for breakfast the boy sat
down upon the bed and wiped away the trickling tears with his thumb
i was greatly disturbed by such conduct on the part of my brother and
demanded to be told what had happened  after i had mingled threats with
entreaties he answered slowly and against his will that brother or
comrade of yours rushed into the room a little while ago and commenced to
attempt my virtue by force  when i screamed he pulled out his tool and
gritted outif youre a lucretia youve found your tarquin  when i
heard this i shook my fists in ascyltos face what have you to say for
yourself i snarled you rutting pathic harlot whose very breath is
infected  ascyltos pretended to bristle up and shaking his fists more
boldly still he roared wont you keep quiet you filthy gladiator you
who escaped from the criminals cage in the amphitheatre to which you
were condemned for the murder of your host  wont you hold your
tongue you nocturnal assassin who even when you swived it bravely
never entered the lists with a decent woman in your life  was i not a
brother to you in the pleasuregarden in the same sense as that in
which this boy now is in this lodginghouse  you sneaked away from the
masters lecture i objected
chapter the tenth  what should i have done you triple fool when i was
dying of hunger  i suppose i should have listened to opinions as much to
the purpose as the tinkle of broken glass or the interpretation of
dreams  by hercules you are much more deserving of censure than i you
who will flatter a poet so as to get an invitation to dinner  then we
laughed ourselves out of a most disgraceful quarrel and approached more
peaceably whatever remained to be done  but the remembrance of that
injury recurred to my mind and ascyltos i said i know we shall not
be able to agree so let us divide our little packs of common stock and
try to defeat our poverty by our individual efforts  both you and i know
letters but that i may not stand in the way of any undertaking of yours
i will take up some other profession  otherwise a thousand trifles will
bring us into daily collision and furnish cause for gossip through the
whole town  ascyltos made no objection to this but merely remarked
as we in our capacity of scholars have accepted an invitation to
dinner for this date let us not lose our night  since it seems to be
the graceful thing to do i will look out for another lodging and another
brother tomorrow  deferred pleasures are a long time coming
 i sighed  it was lust that made this separation so hasty for i had for
a long time wished to be rid of a troublesome chaperon so that i could
resume my old relations with my giton  bearing this affront with
difficulty ascyltos rushed from the room without uttering a word
such a headlong outburst augured badly for i well knew his ungovernable
temper and his unbridled passion  on this account i followed him out
desirous of fathoming his designs and of preventing their consequences
but he hid himself skillfully from my eyes and all in vain i searched
for him for a long time
chapter the eleventh
after having had the whole town under my eyes i returned to the little
room and having claimed the kisses which were mine in good faith i
encircled the boy in the closest of embraces and enjoyed the effect of
our happy vows to a point that might be envied  nor had all the
ceremonies been completed when ascyltos stole stealthily up to the
outside of the door and violently wrenching off the bars burst in upon
me toying with my brother  he filled the little room with his
laughter and handclapping pulled away the cloak which covered us what
are you up to now most sanctimonious brother  he jeered  whats
going on here a blanketwedding  nor did he confine himself to words
but pulling the strap off his bag he began to lash me very thoroughly
interjecting sarcasms the while this is the way you would share with
your comrade is it  the unexpectedness of the thing compelled me to
endure the blows in silence and to put up with the abuse so i smiled at
my calamity and very prudently too as otherwise i should have been put
to the necessity of fighting with a rival  my pretended good humor
soothed his anger and at last ascyltos smiled as well  see here
encolpius he said are you so engrossed with your debaucheries that
you do not realize that our money is gone and that what we have left is
of no value  in the summer times are bad in the city  the country is
luckier lets go and visit our friends  necessity compelled the
approval of this plan and the repression of any sense of injury as well
so loading giton with our packs we left the city and hastened to the
countryseat of lycurgus a roman knight  inasmuch as ascyltos has
formerly served him in the capacity of brother he received us royally
and the company there assembled rendered our stay still more delightful
in the first place there was tryphaena a most beautiful woman who had
come in company with lycas the master of a vessel and owner of estates
near the seashore  although lycurgus kept a frugal table the pleasures
we enjoyed in this most enchanting spot cannot be described in words
of course you know that venus joined us all up as quickly as possible
the lovely tryphaena pleased my taste and listened willingly to my vows
but hardly had i had time to enjoy her favors when lycas in a towering
rage because his preserves had been secretly invaded demanded that i
indemnify him in her stead  she was an old flame of his so he broached
the subject of a mutual exchange of favors  burning with lust he
pressed his suit but tryphaena possessed my heart and i said lycas nay
by refusal however he was only made more ardent followed me
everywhere entered my room at night and after his entreaties had met
with contempt he had recourse to violence against me at which i yelled
so lustily that i aroused the entire household and by the help of
lycurgus i was delivered from the troublesome assault and escaped  at
last perceiving that the house of lycurgus was not suitable to the
prosecution of his design he attempted to persuade me to seek his
hospitality and when his suggestion was refused he made use of
tryphaenas influence over me  she besought me to comply with lycas
desires and she did this all the more readily as by that she hoped to
gain more liberty of action  with affairs in this posture i follow my
love but lycurgus who had renewed his old relations with ascyltos
would not permit him to leave so it was decided that he should remain
with lycurgus but that we would accompany lycas  nevertheless we had
it understood among ourselves that whenever the opportunity presented
itself we would each pilfer whatever we could lay hands upon for the
betterment of the common stock  lycas was highly delighted with my
acceptance of his invitation and hastened our departure so bidding our
friends goodbye we arrived at his place on the very same day  lycas
had so arranged matters that on the journey he sat beside me while
tryphaena was next to giton the reason for this being his knowledge
of the womans notorious inconstancy nor was he deceived for she
immediately fell in love with the boy and i easily perceived it
in addition lycas took the trouble of calling my attention to the
situation and laid stress upon the truth of what we saw  on this
account i received his advances more graciously at which he was
overjoyed  he was certain that contempt would be engendered from the
inconstancy of my sister with the result that being piqued at
tryphaena i would all the more freely receive his advances  now this
was the state of affairs at the house of lycas tryphaena was desperately
in love with giton gitons whole soul was aflame for her neither of
them was a pleasing sight to my eyes and lycas studying to please me
arranged novel entertainments each day which doris his lovely wife
seconded to the best of her ability and so gracefully that she soon
expelled tryphaena from my heart  a wink of the eye acquainted doris of
my passion a coquettish glance informed me of the state of her heart
and this silent language anticipating the office of the tongue secretly
expressed that longing of our souls which we had both experienced at the
same instant  the jealousy of lycas already well known to me was the
cause of my silence but love itself revealed to the wife the designs
which lycas had upon me  at our first opportunity of exchanging
confidences she revealed to me what she had discovered and i candidly
confessed telling her of the coldness with which i had always met his
advances  the farsighted woman remarked that it would be necessary for
us to use our wits  it turned out that her advice was sound for i soon
found out that complacency to the one meant possession of the other
giton in the meantime was recruiting his exhausted strength and
tryphaena turned her attention to me but meeting with a repulse she
flounced out in a rage  the next thing this burning harlot did was to
discover my commerce with both husband and wife  as for his wantonness
with me she flung that aside as by it she lost nothing but she fell
upon the secret gratifications of doris and made them known to lycas
who his jealousy proving stronger than his lust took steps to get
revenge  doris however forewarned by tryphaenas maid looked out
for squalls and held aloof from any secret assignations  when i became
aware of all this i heartily cursed the perfidy of tryphaena and the
ungrateful soul of lycas and made up my mind to be gone  fortune
favored me as it turned out for a vessel sacred to isis and laden with
prizemoney had only the day before run upon the rocks in the vicinity
after holding a consultation with giton at which he gladly gave consent
to my plan as tryphaena visibly neglected him after having sapped his
virility we hastened to the seashore early on the following morning
and boarded the wreck a thing easy of accomplishment as the watchmen
who were in the pay of lycas knew us well  but they were so attentive
to us that there was no opportunity of stealing a thing until having
left giton with them i craftily slipped out of sight and sneaked aft
where the statue of isis stood and despoiled it of a valuable mantle and
a silver sistrum  from the masters cabin i also pilfered other
valuable trifles and stealthily sliding down a rope went ashore  giton
was the only one who saw me and he evaded the watchmen and slipped away
after me  i showed him the plunder when he joined me and we decided
to post with all speed to ascyltos but we did not arrive at the home of
lycurgus until the following day  in a few words i told ascyltos of the
robbery when he joined us and of our unfortunate loveaffairs as well
he was for prepossessing the mind of lycurgus in our favor naming the
increasing wantonness of lycas as the cause of our secret and sudden
change of habitation  when lycurgus had heard everything he swore
that he would always be a tower of strength between us and our enemies
until tryphaena and doris were awake and out of bed our flight remained
undiscovered for we paid them the homage of a daily attendance at the
morning toilette  when our unwonted absence was noted lycas sent out
runners to comb the seashore for he suspected that we had been to the
wreck but he was still unaware of the robbery which was yet unknown
because the stern of the wreck was lying away from the beach and the
master had not as yet gone back aboard  lycas flew into a towering
rage when our flight was established for certain and railed bitterly at
doris whom he considered as the moving factor in it  of the hard words
and the beating he gave her i will say nothing for the particulars are
not known to me but i will affirm that tryphaena who was the sole cause
of the unpleasantness persuaded lycas to hunt for his fugitives in the
house of lycurgus which was our most probable sanctuary  she
volunteered to accompany him in person so that she could load us with
the abuse which we deserved at her hands  they set out on the following
day and arrived at the estate of lycurgus but we were not there for he
had taken us to a neighboring town to attend the feast of hercules which
was there being celebrated  as soon as they found out about this they
hastened to take to the road and ran right into us in the portico of the
temple  at sight of them we were greatly put out and lycas held forth
violently to lycurgus upon the subject of our flight but he was met
with raised eyebrows and such a scowling forehead that i plucked up
courage and in a loud voice passed judgment upon his lewd and base
attempts and assaults upon me not in the house of lycurgus alone but
even under his own roof and as for the meddling tryphaena she received
her just deserts for at great length i described her moral turpitude
to the crowd our altercation had caused a mob to collect and to give
weight to my argument i pointed to limberhamed giton drained dry as
it were and to myself reduced almost to skin and bones by the raging
lust of that nymphomaniac harlot  so humiliated were our enemies by the
guffaws of the mob that in gloomy illhumor they beat a retreat to plot
revenge  as they perceived that we had prepossessed the mind of lycurgus
in our favor they decided to await his return at his estate in order
that they might wean him away from his misapprehension  as the
solemnities did not draw to a close until late at night we could not
reach lycurgus country place so he conducted us to a villa of his
situated near the halfway point of the journey and leaving us to sleep
there until the next day he set off for his estate for the purpose of
transacting some business  upon his arrival he found lycas and
tryphaena awaiting him and they stated their case so diplomatically that
they prevailed upon him to deliver us into their hands  lycurgus cruel
by nature and incapable of keeping his word was by this time striving to
hit upon the best method of betraying us and to that end he persuaded
lycas to go for help while he himself returned to the villa and had us
put under guard  to the villa he came and greeted us with a scowl as
black as any lycas himself had ever achieved clenching his fists again
and again he charged us with having lied about lycas and turning
ascyltos out he gave orders that we were to be kept confined to the room
in which we had retired to rest  nor would he hear a word in our
defense from ascyltos but taking the latter with him he returned to
his estate reiterating his orders relative to our confinement which was
to last until his return  on the way back ascyltos vainly essayed to
break down lycurgus determination but neither prayers nor caresses nor
even tears could move him  thereupon my brother conceived the design
of freeing us from our chains and antagonized by the stubbornness of
lycurgus he positively refused to sleep with him and through this he
was in a better position to carry out the plan which he had thought out
when the entire household was buried in its first sleep ascyltos loaded
our little packs upon his back and slipped out through a breach in the
wall which he had previously noted arriving at the villa with the dawn
he gained entrance without opposition and found his way to our room
which the guards had taken the precaution to bar  it was easy to force
an entrance as the fastening was made of wood which same he pried off
with a piece of iron  the fall of the lock roused us for we were
snoring away in spite of our unfortunate situation  on account of the
long vigil the guard was in such a deep sleep that we alone were wakened
by the crashing fall of the lock and ascyltos coming in told us in a
few words what he had done for us but as far as that goes not many were
necessary  we were hurriedly dressing when i was seized with the notion
of killing the guard and stripping the place  this plan i confided to
ascyltos who approved of the looting but pointed out a more desirable
solution without bloodshed knowing all the crooks and turns as he did
he led us to a storeroom which he opened  we gathered up all that was
of value and sallied forth while it was yet early in the morning
shunning the public roads we could not rest until we believed ourselves
safe from pursuit  ascyltos when he had caught his breath gloatingly
exulted of the pleasure which the looting of a villa belonging to
lycurgus a superlatively avaricious man afforded him he complained
with justice of his parsimony affirming that he himself had received no
reward for his knightly services that he had been kept at a dry table
and on a skimpy ration of food  this lycurgus was so stingy that he
denied himself even the necessities of life his immense wealth to the
contrary notwithstanding
     the tortured tantalus still stands to parch in his shifting pool
     and starve when fruit sways just beyond his grasp
     the image of the miser rich when his avaricious soul
     robs him of food and drink in plentys clasp
ascyltos was for going to naples that same day but i protested the
imprudence of going to any place where they would be on the lookout for
us  lets absent ourselves for a while and travel in the country  we
are well supplied with means  this advice took his fancy and we set out
for a part of the country noted for the beauty of its estates and where
not a few of our acquaintances were enjoying the sports of the season
scarcely had we covered half the distance however before it began to
pour down rain by the bucketful compelling us to run for the nearest
village  upon entering the inn we noticed many other wayfarers who had
put up there to escape the storm  the jam prevented our being watched
and at the same time made it easier for us to pry about with curious
eyes on the alert for something to appropriate  ascyltos unseen by
anyone picked up off the ground a little pouch in which he found some
gold pieces  we were overjoyed with this auspicious beginning but
fearing that some one would miss the gold we stealthily slipped out by
the back door  a slave who was saddling a horse in the courtyard
suddenly left his work and went into the house as if he had forgotten
something and while he was gone i appropriated a superb mantle which was
tied fast to the saddle by untying the thongs then utilizing a row of
outbuildings for cover we made off into the nearest wood  when we had
reached the depths of the grove where we were in safety we thoroughly
discussed the surest method of secreting our gold so that we would
neither be accused of robbery nor robbed ourselves and we finally
decided to sew it into the hem of a ragged tunic which i threw over my
shoulders after having turned the mantle over to ascyltos for
safekeeping we then made ready to start for the city via the
unfrequented roads  we were just about to emerge from the shelter of
the wood when we heard from somewhere on our left they cant get away
they came into this wood lets spread out and beat and they will easily
be caught  on hearing this we were thrown into such a terrible fright
that ascyltos and giton dashed away cityward through the underbrush
and i retreated in such a hurry that the precious tunic slipped off my
shoulders without my knowing it  at last completely fagged out and
unable to take another step i lay down under a tree and there i first
became aware of the loss of the tunic  chagrin restored my strength and
i leaped to my feet to look for the treasure and for a long time i beat
around in vain  worn out with work and vexation i forced my way into
the thickest part of the grove and remained there for four mortal hours
but at last bored to extinction by the horrible solitude i sought a way
out  as i went ahead i caught sight of a peasant then i had need of
all my nerve and it did not fail me  marching boldly up to him i asked
my way to the city complaining that i had been lost in the wood for
several hours  seeing my condition he took pity upon me for i was
covered with mud and paler than death and asked me whether i had seen
anyone in the place  not a soul i replied whereupon he kindly
conducted me to the high road where he met two of his companions who
informed him that they had beaten along every path in the forest without
having found anything except a tunic which they showed him  as may be
readily supposed i did not have the audacity to claim it though well
aware of its value and my chagrin became almost insupportable as i
vented many a groaning curse over my lost treasure  the peasants paid
no attention to me and i was gradually left behind as my weakness
increased my pace decreased  for this reason it was late when i reached
the city and entering the inn beheld ascyltos stretched out half
dead upon a cot  too far gone to utter a single syllable i threw
myself upon another  ascyltos became greatly excited at not seeing the
tunic which he had entrusted to me demanding it insistently but i was
so weak that my voice refused its office and i permitted the apathy of my
eyes to answer his demand then by and by regaining my strength little
by little i related the whole affair to ascyltos in every detail  he
thought that i was joking and although my testimony was fortified by a
copious flood of tears it could easily be seen that he remained
unconvinced believing that i wanted to cheat him out of the gold
giton who was standing by during all this was as downcast as myself
and the suffering of the lad only served to increase my own vexation but
the thing which bothered me most of all was the painstaking search which
was being made for us i told ascyltos of this but he only laughed it
off as he had so happily extricated himself from the scrape  he was
convinced that as we were unknown and as no one had seen us we were
perfectly safe  we decided nevertheless to feign sickness and to keep
to our room as long as possible but before we knew it our money ran
out and spurred by necessity we were forced to go abroad and sell some
of our plunder
chapter the twelfth
twilight was falling as we entered the marketplace in which we noticed
a quantity of things for sale not any of much value it is true but
such as could be disposed of to the best advantage when the semidarkness
would serve to hide their doubtful origin  as we had brought our stolen
mantle we proceeded to make use of so favorable an opportunity and in
a secluded spot displayed a corner of it hoping the splendid garment
would attract some purchaser  nor was it long before a certain peasant
whose face was familiar to my eyes came up accompanied by a young
woman and began to examine the garment very closely  ascyltos in turn
cast a glance at the shoulders of our rustic customer and was instantly
struck dumb with astonishment  nor could i myself look upon this man
without some emotion for he seemed to be the identical person who had
picked up the ragged tunic in the lonely wood and as a matter of fact
he was  ascyltos afraid to believe the evidence of his own eyes for
fear of doing something rash approached the man as a prospective buyer
took the hem of the tunic from the rustics shoulders and felt it
thoroughly
chapter the thirteenth
oh wonderful stroke of fortune  the peasant had not yet laid his
meddling hands upon the seams but was scornfully offering the thing for
sale as though it had been the leavings of some beggar  when ascyltos
had assured himself that the hoard was intact and had taken note of the
social status of the seller he led me a little aside from the crowd and
said do you know brother that the treasure about which i was so
worked up has come back to us  that is the little tunic and it seems
that the gold pieces are still untouched  what ought we to do and how
shall we make good our claim  i was overjoyed not so much at seeing
our booty as i was for the reason that fortune had released me from a
very ugly suspicion  i was opposed to doing anything by devious methods
thinking that should he prove unwilling to restore to the proper owner an
article not his own it ought to come to a civil action and a judgment
secured
chapter the fourteenth
not so ascyltos who was afraid of the law and demurred who knows us
here  who will place any credence in anything we say  it seems to me
that it would be better to buy ours though it is and we know it and
recover the treasure at small cost rather than to engage in a doubtful
lawsuit
          of what avail are any laws where money rules alone
          where poverty can never win its cases
          detractors of the times who bear the cynics scrip are known
          to often sell the truth and keep their faces
          so justice is at public auction bought
          the knight gives judgement as gold says he ought
but with the exception of a twoas piece with which we had intended
purchasing peas and lupines there was nothing to hand so for fear our
loot should escape us in the interim we resolved to appraise the mantle
at less and through a small sacrifice secure a greater profit
accordingly we spread it out and the young woman of the covered head
who was standing by the peasants side narrowly inspected the markings
seized the hem with both hands and screamed thieves at the top of her
voice  we were greatly disconcerted at this and for fear that
inactivity on our part should seem to lend color to her charges we
laid hold of the dirty ragged tunic in our turn and shouted with equal
spite that this was our property which they had in their possession but
our cases were by no means on an equality and the hucksters who had
crowded around us at the uproar laughed at our spiteful claim and very
naturally too since one side laid claim to a very valuable mantle
while the other demanded a rag which was not worth a good patch
chapter the fifteenth
ascyltos when he had secured silence adroitly put a stop to their
laughter by exclaiming we can see that each puts the greater value upon
his own property  let them return our tunic to us and take back their
mantle  this exchange was satisfactory enough to the peasant and the
young woman but some nightprowling shyster lawyers who wished to get
possession of the mantle for their own profit demanded that both
articles be deposited with them and the judge could look into the case
on the morrow for it would appear that the ownership of the articles was
not so much to the point as was the suspicion of robbery that attached
to both sides  the question of sequestration arose and one of the
hucksters i do not remember which but he was bald and his forehead was
covered with sebaceous wens and he sometimes did odd jobs for the
lawyers seized the mantle and vowed that he would see to it that it was
produced at the proper time and place but it was easily apparent that he
desired nothing but that the garment should be deposited with thieves
and vanish thinking that we would be afraid to appear as claimants for
fear of being charged with crime  as far as we were concerned we were
as willing as he and fortune aided the cause of each of us for the
peasant infuriated at our demand that his rags be shown in public threw
the tunic in ascyltos face released us from responsibility and
demanded that the mantle which was the only object of litigation be
sequestered  as we thought we had recovered our treasure we returned
hurriedly to the inn and fastening the door we had a good laugh at the
shrewdness of the hucksters and not less so at that of our enemies for
by it they had returned our money to us  while we were unstitching the
tunic to get at the gold pieces we overheard some one quizzing the
innkeeper as to what kind of people those were who had just entered his
house  alarmed at this inquiry i went down when the questioner had
gone to find out what was the matter and learned that the praetors
lictor whose duty it was to see that the names of strangers were entered
in his rolls had seen two people come into the inn whose names were not
yet entered and that was the reason he had made inquiry as to their
names and means of support  mine host furnished this information in such
an offhand manner that i became suspicious as to our entire safety in his
house so in order to avoid arrest we decided to go out and not to
return home until after dark and we sallied forth leaving the
management of dinner to giton  as it suited our purpose to avoid the
public streets we strolled through the more unfrequented parts of the
city and just at dusk we met two women in stolas in a lonely spot and
they were by no means homely  walking softly we followed them to a
temple which they entered and from which we could hear a curious
humming which resembled the sound of voices issuing from the depths of a
cavern  curiosity impelled us also to enter the temple  there we caught
sight of many women who resembled bacchantes each of whom brandished in
her right hand an emblem of priapus  we were not permitted to see more
for as their eyes fell upon us they raised such a hubbub that the vault
of the temple trembled  they attempted to lay hands upon us but we ran
back to our inn as fast as we could go
chapter the sixteenth
we had just disposed of the supper prepared by giton when there came a
timid rapping at the door  we turned pale  who is there  we asked
open and you will find out came the answer  while we were speaking
the bar fell down of its own accord the doors flew open and admitted our
visitor  she was the selfsame young lady of the covered head who had but
a little while before stood by the peasants side  so you thought
 said she that you could make a fool of me did you  i am quartillas
handmaid quartilla whose rites you interrupted in the shrine  she has
come to the inn in person and begs permission to speak with you  dont
be alarmed  she neither blames your mistake nor does she demand
punishment on the contrary she wonders what god has brought such
wellbred young gentlemen into her neighborhood
chapter the seventeenth
we were still holding our tongues and refraining from any expression of
opinion when the lady herself entered the room attended by a little
girl  seating herself upon the bed she wept for a long time  not even
then did we interject a single word but waited all attention for what
was to follow these well ordered tears and this show of grief  when the
diplomatic thunderstorm had passed over she withdrew her haughty head
from her mantle and ringing her hands until the joints cracked what is
the meaning of such audacity she demanded where did you learn such
tricks  they are worthy of putting to shame the assurance of all the
robbers of the past  i pity you so help me the god of truth i do for
no one can look with impunity upon that which it is unlawful for him to
see  in our neighborhood there are so many gods that it is easier to
meet one than it is to find a man  but do not think that i was actuated
by any desire for revenge when i came here i am more moved by your age
than i am by my own injury for it is my belief that youthful imprudence
led you into committing a sacrilegious crime  that very night i tossed
so violently in the throes of a dangerous chill that i was afraid i had
contracted a tertian ague and in my dreams i prayed for a medicine  i
was ordered to seek you out and to arrest the progress of the disease by
means of an expedient to be suggested by your wonderful penetration  the
cure does not matter so much however for a deeper grief gnaws at my
vitals and drags me down almost to the very doors of death itself  i am
afraid that with the careless impulsiveness of youth you may divulge
to the common herd what you witnessed in the shrine of priapus and
reveal the rites of the gods to the rabble  on this account i stretch
out my suppliant hands to your knees and beg and pray that you do not
make a mockery and a joke of our nocturnal rites nor lay bare the
secrets of so many years into which scarcely a thousand persons are
initiated
chapter the eighteenth
the tears poured forth again after this appeal and shaken by deep
sobs she buried her whole face and breast in my bed and i moved by
pity and by apprehension begged her to be of good cheer and to make
herself perfectly easy as to both of those issues for not only would we
not betray any secrets to the rabble but we would also second divine
providence at any peril to ourselves if any god had indicated to her
any cure for her tertian ague  the woman cheered up at this promise and
smothered me with kisses from tears she passed to laughter and fell to
running her fingers through the long hair that hung down about my ears
i will declare a truce with you she said and withdraw my complaint
but had you been unwilling to administer the medicine which i seek i had
a troop in readiness for the morrow which would have exacted
satisfaction for my injury and reparation for my dignity
          to be flouted is disgraceful but to dictate terms sublime
          pleased am i to choose what course i will
          even sages will retort an insult at the proper time
          victor most is he who does not kill
then she suddenly clapped her hands and broke into such a peal of
laughter that we were alarmed  the maid who had been the first to
arrive did likewise on one side of us as also did the little girl who
had entered with the madame herself
chapter the nineteenth
the whole place was filled with mocking laughter and we who could see
no reason for such a change of front stared blankly at each other and
then at the women  then quartilla spoke up finally i gave orders
that no mortal man should be admitted into this inn this day so that i
could receive the treatment for my ague without interruption  ascyltos
was for the moment struck dumb by this admission of quartillas and i
turned colder than a gallic winter and could not utter a word but the
personnel of the company relieved me from the fear that the worst might
be yet to come for they were only three young women too weak to attempt
any violence against us who were of the male sex at least even if we
had nothing else of the man about us and this was an asset  then too
we were girded higher and i had so arranged matters that if it came to a
fight i would engage quartilla myself ascyltos the maid and giton the
girl  while i was turning over this plan in my mind quartilla came to
close quarters to receive the treatment for her ague but having her
hopes disappointed she flounced out in a rage and returning in a little
while she had us overpowered by some unknown vagabonds and gave orders
for us to be carried away to a splendid palace  then our determination
gave place to astonishment and death sure and certain began to obscure
the eyes of suffering
chapter the twentieth
pray madame i groaned if you have anything worse in store bring it
on quickly for we have not committed a crime so heinous as to merit death
by torture  the maid whose name was psyche quickly spread a blanket
upon the floor and sought to secure an erection by fondling my member
which was already a thousand times colder than death  ascyltos well
aware by now of the danger of dipping into the secrets of others covered
his head with his mantle  in the meantime the maid took two ribbons
from her bosom and bound our feet with one and our hands with the other
finding myself trussed up in this fashion i remarked you will not be
able to cure your mistress ague in this manner  granted the maid
replied but i have other and surer remedies at hand she brought me a
vessel full of satyrion as she said this and so cheerfully did she
gossip about its virtues that i drank down nearly all of the liquor and
because ascyltos had but a moment before rejected her advances she
sprinkled the dregs upon his back without his knowing it  when this
repartee had drawn to a close ascyltos exclaimed dont i deserve a
drink  given away by my laughter the maid clapped her hands and cried
i put one by you young man did you drink so much all by yourself
 whats that you say quartilla chimed in  did encolpius drink all
the satyrion there was in the house  and she laughed delightfully until
her sides shook  finally not even giton himself could resist a smile
especially when the little girl caught him around the neck and showered
innumerable kisses upon him and he not at all averse to it
chapter the twentyfirst
we would have cried aloud in our misery but there was no one to give us
any help and whenever i attempted to shout help  all honest
citizens psyche would prick my cheeks with her hairpin and the little
girl would intimidate ascyltos with a brush dipped in satyrion  then a
catamite appeared clad in a myrtlecolored frieze robe and girded round
with a belt  one minute he nearly gored us to death with his writhing
buttocks and the next he befouled us so with his stinking kisses that
quartilla with her robe tucked high held up her whalebone wand and
ordered him to give the unhappy wretches quarter  both of us then took a
most solemn oath that so dread a secret should perish with us  several
wrestling instructors appeared and refreshed us worn out as we were by
a massage with pure oil and when our fatigue had abated we again donned
our dining clothes and were escorted to the next room in which were
placed three couches and where all the essentials necessary to a
splendid banquet were laid out in all their richness  we took our
places as requested and began with a wonderful first course  we were
all but submerged in falernian wine  when several other courses had
followed and we were endeavoring to keep awake quartilla exclaimed how
dare you think of going to sleep when you know that the vigil of priapus
is to be kept
chapter the twentysecond
worn out by all his troubles ascyltos commenced to nod and the maid
whom he had slighted and of course insulted smeared lampblack all over
his face and painted his lips and shoulders with vermillion while he
drowsed  completely exhausted by so many untoward adventures i too
was enjoying the shortest of naps the whole household within and
without was doing the same some were lying here and there asleep at our
feet others leaned against the walls and some even slept head to head
upon the threshold itself the lamps failing because of a lack of oil
shed a feeble and flickering light when two syrians bent upon stealing
an amphora of wine entered the diningroom  while they were greedily
pawing among the silver they pulled the amphora in two upsetting the
table with all the silver plate and a cup which had flown pretty high
cut the head of the maid who was drowsing upon a couch  she screamed at
that thereby betraying the thieves and wakening some of the drunkards
the syrians who had come for plunder seeing that they were about to be
detected were so quick to throw themselves down besides a couch and
commence to snore as if they had been asleep for a long time that you
would have thought they belonged there  the butler had gotten up and
poured oil in the flickering lamps by this time and the boys having
rubbed their eyes open had returned to their duty when in came a female
cymbal player and the crashing brass awoke everybody
chapter the twentythird
the banquet began all over again and quartilla challenged us to a
drinkingbout the crash of the cymbals lending ardor to her revel
a catamite appeared the stalest of all mankind well worthy of that
house  heaving a sigh he wrung his hands until the joints cracked
and spouted out the following verses
    hither hither quickly gather pathic companions boon
     artfully stretch forth your limbs and on with the dance and play
     twinkling feet and supple thighs and agile buttocks in tune
     hands well skilled in raising passions delian eunuchs gay
when he had finished his poetry he slobbered a most evilsmelling kiss
upon me and then climbing upon my couch he proceeded with all his
might and main to pull all of my clothing off  i resisted to the limit
of my strength  he manipulated my member for a long time but all in
vain  gummy streams poured down his sweating forehead and there was so
much chalk in the wrinkles of his cheeks that you might have mistaken his
face for a roofless wall from which the plaster was crumbling in a rain
chapter the twentyfourth
driven to the last extremity i could no longer keep back the tears
madame i burst out is this the nightcap which you ordered served to
me  clapping her hands softly she cried out oh you witty rogue you
are a fountain of repartee but you never knew before that a catamite was
called a knightcap now did you then fearing my companion would come
off better than i madame i said i leave it to your sense of
fairness is ascyltos to be the only one in this diningroom who keeps
holiday  fair enough conceded quartilla let ascyltos have his
knightcap too  on hearing that the catamite changed mounts and
having bestridden my comrade nearly drove him to distraction with his
buttocks and his kisses  giton was standing between us and splitting his
sides with laughter when quartilla noticed him and actuated by the
liveliest curiosity she asked whose boy he was and upon my answering
that he was my brother  why has he not kissed me then  she
demanded  calling him to her she pressed a kiss upon his mouth then
putting her hand beneath his robe she took hold of his little member as
yet so undeveloped  this she remarked shall serve me very well
tomorrow as a whet to my appetite but today ill take no common fare
after choice fish
chapter the twentyfifth
she was still talking when psyche who was giggling came to her side and
whispered something in her ear  what it was i did not catch  by all
means ejaculated quartilla a brilliant idea  why shouldnt our
pretty little pannychis lose her maidenhead when the opportunity is so
favorable  a little girl pretty enough too was led in at once she
looked to be not over seven years of age and she was the same one who
had before accompanied quartilla to our room  amidst universal applause
and in response to the demands of all they made ready to perform the
nuptial rites  i was completely out of countenance and insisted that
such a modest boy as giton was entirely unfitted for such a wanton part
and moreover that the child was not of an age at which she could receive
that which a woman must take  is that so quartilla scoffed is she
any younger than i was when i submitted to my first man  juno my
patroness curse me if i can remember the time when i ever was a virgin
for i diverted myself with others of my own age as a child then as the
years passed i played with bigger boys until at last i reached my
present age  i suppose that this explains the origin of the proverb
who carried the calf may carry the bull as they say  as i feared
that giton might run greater risk if i were absent i got up to take
part in the ceremony
chapter the twentysixth
psyche had already enveloped the childs head in the bridalveil the
catamite holding a torch led the long procession of drunken women which
followed they were clapping their hands having previously decked out
the bridalbed with a suggestive drapery  quartilla spurred on by the
wantonness of the others seized hold of giton and drew him into the
bridalchamber  there was no doubt of the boys perfect willingness to
go nor was the girl at all alarmed at the name of marriage  when they
were finally in bed and the door shut we seated ourselves outside the
door of the bridalchamber and quartilla applied a curious eye to a
chink purposely made watching their childish dalliance with lascivious
attention  she then drew me gently over to her side that i might share
the spectacle with her and when we both attempted to peep our faces were
pressed against each other whenever she was not engrossed in the
performance she screwed up her lips to meet mine and pecked at me
continually with furtive kisses  a thunderous hammering was heard at
the door while all this was going on and everyone wondered what this
unexpected interruption could mean when we saw a soldier one of the
nightwatch enter with a drawn sword in his hand and surrounded by a
crowd of young rowdies  he glared about him with savage eyes and
blustering mien and catching sight of quartilla presently whats up
now you shameless woman he bawled what do you mean by making game of
me with lying promises and cheating me out of the night you promised me
but you wont get off unpunished you and that lover of yours are going to
find out that im a man  at the soldiers orders his companion bound
quartilla and myself together mouth to mouth breast to breast and
thigh to thigh and not without a great deal of laughter  then the
catamite also at the soldiers order began to beslaver me all over with
the fetid kisses of his stinking mouth a treatment i could neither fly
from nor in any other way avoid  finally he ravished me and worked
his entire pleasure upon me  in the meantime the satyrion which i had
drunk only a little while before spurred every nerve to lust and i began
to gore quartilla impetuously and she burning with the same passion
reciprocated in the game  the rowdies laughed themselves sick so moved
were they by that ludicrous scene for here was i mounted by the stalest
of catamites involuntarily and almost unconsciously responding with as
rapid a cadence to him as quartilla did in her wriggling under me  while
this was going on pannychis unaccustomed at her tender years to the
pastime of venus raised an outcry and attracted the attention of the
soldier by this unexpected howl of consternation for this slip of a
girl was being ravished and giton the victor had won a not bloodless
victory  aroused by what he saw the soldier rushed upon them seizing
pannychis then giton then both of them together in a crushing embrace
the virgin burst into tears and plead with him to remember her age but
her prayers availed her nothing the soldier only being fired the more by
her childish charms  pannychis covered her head at last resolved to
endure whatever the fates had in store for her  at this instant an old
woman the very same who had tricked me on that day when i was hunting
for our lodging came to the aid of pannychis as though she had dropped
from the clouds  with loud cries she rushed into the house swearing
that a gang of footpads was prowling about the neighborhood and the
people invoked the help of all honest men in vain for the members of
the nightwatch were either asleep or intent upon some carouse as they
were nowhere to be found  greatly terrified at this the soldier rushed
headlong from quartillas house  his companions followed after him
freeing pannychis from impending danger and relieving the rest of us from
our fear  i was so weary of quartillas lechery that i began to
meditate means of escape  i made my intentions known to ascyltos who
as he wished to rid himself of the importunities of psyche was
delighted had not giton been shut up in the bridalchamber the plan
would have presented no difficulties but we wished to take him with us
and out of the way of the viciousness of these prostitutes  we were
anxiously engaged in debating this very point when pannychis fell out of
bed and dragged giton after her by her own weight  he was not hurt
but the girl gave her head a slight bump and raised such a clamor that
quartilla in a terrible fright rushed headlong into the room giving us
the opportunity of making off  we did not tarry but flew back to our
inn where throwing ourselves upon the bed we passed the remainder of
the night without fear  sallying forth next day we came upon two of
our kidnappers one of whom ascyltos savagely attacked the moment he set
eyes upon him and after having thrashed and seriously wounded him
he ran to my aid against the other  he defended himself so stoutly
however that he wounded us both slightly and escaped unscathed  the
third day had now dawned the date set for the free dinner at
trimalchios but battered as we were flight seemed more to our taste
than quiet so we hastened to our inn and as our wounds turned out to
be trifling we dressed them with vinegar and oil and went to bed  the
ruffian whom we had done for was still lying upon the ground and we
feared detection  affairs were at this pass and we were framing
melancholy excuses with which to evade the coming revel when a slave of
agamemnons burst in upon our trembling conclave and said dont you
know with whom your engagement is today  the exquisite trimalchio who
keeps a clock and a liveried bugler in his diningroom so that he can
tell instantly how much of his life has run out  forgetting all our
troubles at that we dressed hurriedly and ordered giton who had very
willingly performed his servile office to follow us to the bath

volume 2the dinner of trimalchio
chapter the twentyseventh
having put on our clothes in the meantime we commenced to stroll around
and soon the better to amuse ourselves approached the circle of
players all of a sudden we caught sight of a baldheaded old fellow
rigged out in a russet colored tunic playing ball with some long haired
boys  it was not so much the boys who attracted our attention although
they might well have merited it as it was the spectacle afforded by this
beslippered paterfamilias playing with a green ball  if one but touched
the ground he never stooped for it to put it back in play for a slave
stood by with a bagful from which the players were supplied  we noted
other innovations as well for two eunuchs were stationed at opposite
sides of the ring one of whom held a silver chamberpot the other
counted the balls not those which bounced back and forth from hand to
hand in play but those which fell to the ground  while we were
marveling at this display of refinement menelaus rushed up he is the
one with whom you will rest upon your elbow he panted what you see
now is only a prelude to the dinner  menelaus had scarcely ceased
speaking when trimalchio snapped his fingers the eunuch hearing the
signal held the chamberpot for him while he still continued playing
after relieving his bladder he called for water to wash his hands
barely moistened his fingers and dried them upon a boys head
chapter the twentyeighth
to go into details would take too long  we entered the bath finally
and after sweating for a minute or two in the warm room we passed
through into the cold water  but short as was the time trimalchio had
already been sprinkled with perfume and was being rubbed down not with
linen towels however but with cloths made from the finest wool
meanwhile three masseurs were guzzling falernian under his eyes and
when they spilled a great deal of it in their brawling trimalchio
declared they were pouring a libation to his genius  he was then wrapped
in a coarse scarlet wraprascal and placed in a litter four runners
whose liveries were decorated with metal plates preceded him as also
did a wheelchair in which rode his favorite a withered blear eyed
slave even more repulsive looking than his master  a singing boy
approached the head of his litter as he was being carried along and
played upon small pipes the whole way just as if he were communicating
some secret to his masters ear  marveling greatly we followed and met
agamemnon at the outer door to the post of which was fastened a small
tablet bearing this inscription
                    no slave to leave the premises
                 without permission from the master
                      penalty one hundred lashes
in the vestibule stood the porter clad in green and girded with a
cherrycolored belt shelling peas into a silver dish  above the
threshold was suspended a golden cage from which a black and white
magpie greeted the visitors
chapter the twentyninth
i almost fell backwards and broke my legs while staring at all this for
to the left as we entered not far from the porters alcove an enormous
dog upon a chain was painted upon the wall and above him this
inscription in capitals
                             beware the dog
my companions laughed but i plucked up my courage and did not hesitate
but went on and examined the entire wall  there was a scene in a slave
market the tablets hanging from the slaves necks and trimalchio
himself wearing his hair long holding a caduceus in his hand entering
rome led by the hand of minerva  then again the painstaking artist had
depicted him casting up accounts and still again being appointed
steward everything being explained by inscriptions  where the walls
gave way to the portico mercury was shown lifting him up by the chin
to a tribunal placed on high  near by stood fortune with her horn of
plenty and the three fates spinning golden flax  i also took note of a
group of runners in the portico taking their exercise under the eye of
an instructor and in one corner was a large cabinet in which was a very
small shrine containing silver lares a marble venus and a golden casket
by no means small which held so they told us the first shavings of
trimalchios beard  i asked the hallporter what pictures were in the
middle hall  the iliad and the odyssey he replied and the
gladiatorial games given under laenas  there was no time in which to
examine them all
chapter the thirtieth
we had now come to the diningroom at the entrance to which sat a
factor receiving accounts and what gave me cause for astonishment
rods and axes were fixed to the doorposts superimposed as it were
upon the bronze beak of a ship whereon was inscribed
                     to gaius pompeius trimalchio
                            augustal sevir
                           from cinnamus his
                                steward
a double lamp suspended from the ceiling hung beneath the inscription
and a tablet was fixed to each doorpost one if my memory serves me
was inscribed
                       on december thirtieth and
                             thirty first
                                  our
                            gaius dines out
the other bore a painting of the moon in her phases and the seven
planets and the days which were lucky and those which were unlucky
distinguished by distinctive studs  we had had enough of these novelties
and started to enter the diningroom when a slave detailed to this duty
cried out right foot first  naturally we were afraid that some of us
might break some rule of conduct and cross the threshold the wrong way
nevertheless we started out stepping off together with the right foot
when all of a sudden a slave who had been stripped threw himself at our
feet and commenced begging us to save him from punishment as it was no
serious offense for which he was in jeopardy the stewards clothing had
been stolen from him in the baths and the whole value could scarcely
amount to ten sesterces  so we drew back our right feet and intervened
with the steward who was counting gold pieces in the hall begging him
to remit the slaves punishment  putting a haughty face on the matter
its not the loss i mind so much he said as it is the carelessness
of this worthless rascal  he lost my dinner clothes given me on my
birthday they were by a certain client tyrian purple too but it had
been washed once already  but what does it amount to  i make you a
present of the scoundrel
chapter the thirtyfirst
we felt deeply obligated by his great condescension and the same
slave for whom we had interceded rushed up to us as we entered the
diningroom and to our astonishment kissed us thick and fast voicing
his thanks for our kindness  youll know in a minute whom you did a
favor for he confided the masters wine is the thanks of a grateful
butler  at length we reclined and slave boys from alexandria poured
water cooled with snow upon our hands while others following attended
to our feet and removed the hangnails with wonderful dexterity nor were
they silent even during this disagreeable operation but they all kept
singing at their work  i was desirous of finding out whether the whole
household could sing so i ordered a drink a boy near at hand instantly
repeated my order in a singsong voice fully as shrill and whichever one
you accosted did the same  you would not imagine that this was the
diningroom of a private gentleman but rather that it was an exhibition
of pantomimes  a very inviting relish was brought on for by now all the
couches were occupied save only that of trimalchio for whom after a new
custom the chief place was reserved
on the tray stood a donkey made of corinthian bronze bearing panniers
containing olives white in one and black in the other  two platters
flanked the figure on the margins of which were engraved trimalchios
name and the weight of the silver in each  dormice sprinkled with
poppyseed and honey were served on little bridges soldered fast to the
platter and hot sausages on a silver gridiron underneath which were
damson plums and pomegranate seeds
chapter the thirtysecond
we were in the midst of these delicacies when to the sound of music
trimalchio himself was carried in and bolstered up in a nest of small
cushions which forced a snicker from the less wary  a shaven poll
protruded from a scarlet mantle and around his neck already muffled
with heavy clothing he had tucked a napkin having a broad purple stripe
and a fringe that hung down all around  on the little finger of his left
hand he wore a massive gilt ring and on the first joint of the next
finger a smaller one which seemed to me to be of pure gold but as a
matter of fact it had iron stars soldered on all around it  and then
for fear all of his finery would not be displayed he bared his right
arm adorned with a golden armband and an ivory circlet clasped with a
plate of shining metal
chapter the thirtythird
picking his teeth with a silver quill friends said he it was not
convenient for me to come into the diningroom just yet but for fear my
absence should cause you any inconvenience i gave over my own pleasure
permit me however to finish my game  a slave followed with a
terebinth table and crystal dice and i noted one piece of luxury that
was superlative for instead of black and white pieces he used gold and
silver coins  he kept up a continual flow of various coarse expressions
we were still dallying with the relishes when a tray was brought in on
which was a basket containing a wooden hen with her wings rounded and
spread out as if she were brooding  two slaves instantly approached and
to the accompaniment of music commenced to feel around in the straw
they pulled out some peahens eggs which they distributed among the
diners  turning his head trimalchio saw what was going on  friends
 he remarked  i ordered peahens eggs set under the hen but im afraid
theyre addled by hercules i am lets try them anyhow and see if
theyre still fit to suck  we picked up our spoons each of which
weighed not less than half a pound and punctured the shells which were
made of flour and dough and as a matter of fact i very nearly threw
mine away for it seemed to me that a chick had formed already but upon
hearing an old experienced guest vow there must be something good
here i broke open the shell with my hand and discovered a fine fat
figpecker imbedded in a yolk seasoned with pepper
chapter the thirtyfourth
having finished his game trimalchio was served with a helping of
everything and was announcing in a loud voice his willingness to join
anyone in a second cup of honied wine when to a flourish of music the
relishes were suddenly whisked away by a singing chorus but a small dish
happened to fall to the floor in the scurry and a slave picked it up
seeing this trimalchio ordered that the boy be punished by a box on the
ear and made him throw it down again a janitor followed with his broom
and swept the silver dish away among the litter  next followed two
longhaired ethiopians carrying small leather bottles such as are
commonly seen in the hands of those who sprinkle sand in the arena and
poured wine upon our hands for no one offered us water  when
complimented upon these elegant extras the host cried out mars loves
a fair fight and so i ordered each one a separate table that way these
stinking slaves wont make us so hot with their crowding  some glass
bottles carefully sealed with gypsum were brought in at that instant a
label bearing this inscription was fastened to the neck of each one
                           opimian falernian
                         one hundred years old
while we were studying the labels trimalchio clapped his hands and
cried ah me  to think that wine lives longer than poor little man
lets fill em up  theres life in wine and this is the real opimian
you can take my word for that  i offered no such vintage yesterday
though my guests were far more respectable  we were tippling away and
extolling all these elegant devices when a slave brought in a silver
skeleton so contrived that the joints and movable vertebra could be
turned in any direction  he threw it down upon the table a time or two
and its mobile articulation caused it to assume grotesque attitudes
whereupon trimalchio chimed in
              poor man is nothing in the scheme of things
               and orcus grips us and to hades flings
               our bones  this skeleton before us here
               is as important as we ever were
               lets live then while we may and life is dear
chapter the thirtyfifth
the applause was followed by a course which by its oddity drew every
eye but it did not come up to our expectations  there was a circular
tray around which were displayed the signs of the zodiac and upon each
sign the caterer had placed the food best in keeping with it  rams
vetches on aries a piece of beef on taurus kidneys and lambs fry on
gemini a crown on cancer the womb of an unfarrowed sow on virgo an
african fig on leo on libra a balance one pan of which held a tart and
the other a cake a small seafish on scorpio a bulls eye on
sagittarius a sea lobster on capricornus a goose on aquarius and two
mullets on pisces  in the middle lay a piece of cut sod upon which
rested a honeycomb with the grass arranged around it  an egyptian slave
passed bread around from a silver oven and in a most discordant voice
twisted out a song in the manner of the mime in the musical farce called
laserpitium  seeing that we were rather depressed at the prospect of
busying ourselves with such vile fare trimalchio urged us to fall to
let us fall to gentlemen i beg of you this is only the sauce
chapter the thirtysixth
while he was speaking four dancers ran in to the time of the music
and removed the upper part of the tray  beneath on what seemed to be
another tray we caught sight of stuffed capons and sows bellies and in
the middle a hare equipped with wings to resemble pegasus  at the
corners of the tray we also noted four figures of marsyas and from their
bladders spouted a highly spiced sauce upon fish which were swimming
about as if in a tiderace  all of us echoed the applause which was
started by the servants and fell to upon these exquisite delicacies
with a laugh  carver cried trimalchio no less delighted with the
artifice practised upon us and the carver appeared immediately  timing
his strokes to the beat of the music he cut up the meat in such a fashion
as to lead you to think that a gladiator was fighting from a chariot to
the accompaniment of a waterorgan  every now and then trimalchio would
repeat carver carver in a low voice until i finally came to the
conclusion that some joke was meant in repeating a word so frequently so
i did not scruple to question him who reclined above me  as he had often
experienced byplay of this sort he explained you see that fellow who is
carving the meat dont you  well his name is carver  whenever
trimalchio says carver carve her by the same word he both calls and
commands
chapter the thirtyseventh
i could eat no more so i turned to my whilom informant to learn as much
as i could and sought to draw him out with farfetched gossip  i
inquired who that woman could be who was scurrying about hither and yon
in such a fashion  shes called fortunata he replied  shes the
wife of trimalchio and she measures her money by the peck  and only a
little while ago what was she  may your genius pardon me but you would
not have been willing to take a crust of bread from her hand  now
without rhyme or reason shes in the seventh heaven and is trimalchios
factotum so much so that he would believe her if she told him it was
dark when it was broad daylight  as for him he dont know how rich he
is but this harlot keeps an eye on everything and where you least expect
to find her youre sure to run into her  shes temperate sober full
of good advice and has many good qualities but she has a scolding
tongue a very magpie on a sofa those she likes she likes but those
she dislikes she dislikes  trimalchio himself has estates as broad as
the flight of a kite is long and piles of money  theres more silver
plate lying in his stewards office than other men have in their whole
fortunes  and as for slaves damn me if i believe a tenth of them knows
the master by sight  the truth is that these standagapes are so much
in awe of him that any one of them would step into a fresh dunghill
without ever knowing it at a mere nod from him
chapter the thirtyeighth
and dont you get the idea that he buys anything everything is produced
at home wool pitch pepper if you asked for hens milk you would get
it  because he wanted his wool to rival other things in quality he
bought rams at tarentum and sent em into his flocks with a slap on the
arse  he had bees brought from attica so he could produce attic honey
at home and as a side issue so he could improve the native bees by
crossing with the greek  he even wrote to india for mushroom seed one
day and he hasnt a single mule that wasnt sired by a wild ass  do you
see all those cushions  not a single one but what is stuffed with either
purple or scarlet wool  he hasnt anything to worry about  look out how
you criticise those other fellowfreedmenfriends of his theyre all
well heeled  see the fellow reclining at the bottom of the end couch
hes worth his 800000 any day and he rose from nothing  only a short
while ago he had to carry faggots on his own back  i dont know how true
it is but they say that he snatched off an incubos hat and found a
treasure  for my part i dont envy any man anything that was given him
by a god  he still carries the marks of his box on the ear and he isnt
wishing himself any bad luck  he posted this notice only the other day
                     caius pomponius diogenes has
                           purchased a house
                      this garret for rent after
                          the kalends of july
what do you think of the fellow in the freedmans place  he has a good
front too hasnt he  and he has a right to  he saw his fortune
multiplied tenfold but he lost heavily through speculation at the last
i dont think he can call his very hair his own and it is no fault of
his either by hercules it isnt  theres no better fellow anywhere his
rascally freedmen cheated him out of everything  you know very well how
it is everybodys business is nobodys business and once let business
affairs start to go wrong your friends will stand from under  look at
the fix hes in and think what a fine trade he had  he used to be an
undertaker  he dined like a king boars roasted whole in their shaggy
bides bakers pastries birds cooks and bakers  more wine was spilled
under his table than another has in his wine cellar  his life was like a
pipe dream not like an ordinary mortals  when his affairs commenced to
go wrong and he was afraid his creditors would guess that he was
bankrupt he advertised an auction and this was his placard
                     julius proculus will sell at
                        auction his superfluous
                               furniture
chapter the thirtyninth
trimalchio broke in upon this entertaining gossip for the course had
been removed and the guests happy with wine had started a general
conversation lying back upon his couch you ought to make this wine go
down pleasantly he said the fish must have something to swim in  but
i say you didnt think id be satisfied with any such dinner as you saw
on the top of that tray  is ulysses no better known  well well we
shouldnt forget our culture even at dinner  may the bones of my patron
rest in peace he wanted me to become a man among men  no one can show
me anything new and that little tray has proved it  this heaven where
the gods live turns into as many different signs and sometimes into the
ram therefore whoever is born under that sign will own many flocks and
much wool a hard head a shameless brow and a sharp horn  a great many
schoolteachers and rambunctious buttersin are born under that sign
 we applauded the wonderful penetration of our astrologer and he ran on
then the whole heaven turns into a bullcalf and the kickers and
herdsmen and those who see to it that their own bellies are full come
into the world  teams of horses and oxen are born under the twins and
wellhung wenchers and those who bedung both sides of the wall  i was
born under the crab and therefore stand on many legs and own much
property on land and sea for the crab is as much at home on one as he is
in the other  for that reason i put nothing on that sign for fear of
weighing down my own destiny  bulldozers and gluttons are born under the
lion and women and fugitives and chaingangs are born under the virgin
butchers and perfumers are born under the balance and all who think that
it is their business to straighten things out  poisoners and assassins
are born under the scorpion  crosseyed people who look at the
vegetables and sneak away with the bacon are born under the archer
hornyhanded sons of toil are born under capricorn  bartenders and
pumpkinheads are born under the watercarrier  caterers and
rhetoricians are born under the fishes and so the world turns round
just like a mill and something bad always comes to the top and men are
either being born or else theyre dying  as to the sod and the honeycomb
in the middle for i never do anything without a reason mother earth is
in the centre round as an egg and all that is good is found in her
just like it is in a honeycomb
chapter the fortieth
bravo  we yelled and with hands uplifted to the ceiling we swore
that such fellows as hipparchus and aratus were not to be compared with
him  at length some slaves came in who spread upon the couches some
coverlets upon which were embroidered nets and hunters stalking their
game with boarspears and all the paraphernalia of the chase  we knew
not what to look for next until a hideous uproar commenced just outside
the diningroom door and some spartan hounds commenced to run around the
table all of a sudden  a tray followed them upon which was served a
wild boar of immense size wearing a liberty cap upon its head and from
its tusks hung two little baskets of woven palm fibre one of which
contained syrian dates the other theban  around it hung little
suckling pigs made from pastry signifying that this was a broodsow with
her pigs at suck  it turned out that these were souvenirs intended to be
taken home  when it came to carving the boar our old friend carver who
had carved the capons did not appear but in his place a great bearded
giant with bands around his legs and wearing a short hunting cape in
which a design was woven  drawing his huntingknife he plunged it
fiercely into the boars side and some thrushes flew out of the gash
fowlers ready with their rods caught them in a moment as they
fluttered around the room and trimalchio ordered one to each guest
remarking notice what fine acorns this forestbred boar fed on and as
he spoke some slaves removed the little baskets from the tusks and
divided the syrian and theban dates equally among the diners
chapter the fortyfirst
getting a moment to myself in the meantime i began to speculate as to
why the boar had come with a liberty cap upon his head  after exhausting
my invention with a thousand foolish guesses i made bold to put the
riddle which teased me to my old informant  why sure he replied
even your slave could explain that theres no riddle everythings as
plain as day  this boar made his first bow as the last course of
yesterdays dinner and was dismissed by the guests so today he comes
back as a freedman  i damned my stupidity and refrained from asking any
more questions for fear i might leave the impression that i had never
dined among decent people before  while we were speaking a handsome
boy crowned with vine leaves and ivy passed grapes around in a little
basket and impersonated bacchushappy bacchusdrunk and
bacchusdreaming reciting in the meantime his masters verses in a
shrill voice  trimalchio turned to him and said dionisus be thou
liber whereupon the boy immediately snatched the cap from the boars
head and put it upon his own  at that trimalchio added you cant
deny that my fathers middle name was liber  we applauded trimalchios
conceit heartily and kissed the boy as he went around  trimalchio
retired to the closestool after this course and we having freedom of
action with the tyrant away began to draw the other guests out  after
calling for a bowl of wine dama spoke up a days nothing at all its
night before you can turn around so you cant do better than to go
right to the diningroom from your bed  its been so cold that i can
hardly get warm in a bath but a hot drinks as good as an overcoat
ive had some long pegs and between you and me im a bit groggy the
booze has gone to my head
chapter the fortysecond
here seleucus took up the tale  i dont bathe every day he confided
a bath uses you up like a fuller waters got teeth and your strength
wastes away a little every day but when ive downed a pot of mead i
tell the cold to suck my cock  i couldnt bathe today anyway because i
was at a funeral dandy fellow he was too good old chrysanthus slipped
his wind  why only the other day he said good morning to me and i
almost think im talking to him now  gawds truth were only blownup
bladders strutting around were less than flies for they have some good
in them but were only bubbles  and supposing he had not kept to such a
low diet  why not a drop of water or a crumb of bread so much as passed
his lips for five days and yet he joined the majority  too many doctors
did away with him or rather his time had come for a doctors not good
for anything except for a consolation to your mind  he was well carried
out anyhow in the very bed he slept in during his lifetime  and he was
covered with a splendid pall the mourning was tastefully managed he had
freed some slaves even though his wife was sparing with her tears and
what if he hadnt treated her so well  but when you come to women women
all belong to the kite species no one ought to waste a good turn upon
one of them its just like throwing it down a well  an old loves like
a cancer
chapter the fortythird
he was becoming very tiresome and phileros cried out lets think about
the living  he has what was coming to him he lived respectably and
respectably he died  whats he got to kick about  he made his pile
from an as and would pick a quadrans out of a dunghill with his teeth
any old time  and he grew richer and richer of course just like a
honeycomb  i expect that he left all of a hundred thousand by hercules
i do  all in cold cash too but ive eaten dogs tongue and must speak
the truth he was foulmouthed had a ready tongue he was a trouble
maker and no man  now his brother was a good fellow a friend to his
friend freehanded and he kept a liberal table  he picked a loser at
the start but his first vintage set him upon his legs for he sold his
wine at the figure he demanded and what made him hold his head higher
still he came into a legacy from which he stole more than had been left
to him  then that fool friend of yours in a fit of anger at his
brother willed his property away to some sonofabitch or other who
he was i dont know but when a man runs away from his own kin he has
a long way to go  and whats more he had some slaves who were
earspecialists at the keyhole and they did him a lot of harm for a man
wont prosper when he believes on the spot every tale that he hears a
man in business especially  still he had a good time as long as he
lived for happys the fellow who gets the gift not the one it was meant
for  he sure was fortunes son  lead turned to gold in his hands  its
easy enough when everything squares up and runs on schedule  how old
would you think he was  seventy and over but he was as tough as horn
carried his age well and was as black as a crow  i knew the fellow for
years and years and he was a lecher to the very last  i dont believe
that even the dog in his house escaped his attentions by hercules i
dont and what a boylover he was  saw a virgin in every one he met
not that i blame him though for its all he could take with him
chapter the fortyfourth
phileros had his say and ganymedes exclaimed you gabble away about
things that dont concern heaven or earth and none of you cares how the
price of grain pinches  i couldnt even get a mouthful of bread today
by hercules i couldnt  how the drought does hang on  weve had famine
for a year  if the damned aediles would only get whats coming to them
they graft with the bakers scratchmyarseandillscratchyours
thats the way it always is the poor devils are out of luck but the
jaws of the capitalists are always keeping the saturnalia  if only we
had such lionhearted sports as we had when i first came from asia  that
was the life  if the flour was not the very best they would beat up
those bellyrobbing grafters till they looked like jupiter had been at
them  how well i remember safinius he lived near the old arch when i
was a boy  for a man he was one hot proposition  wherever he went the
ground smoked  but he was square dependable a friend to a friend you
could safely play mora with him in the dark  but how he did peel them
in the town hall he spoke no parables not he  he did everything
straight from the shoulder and his voice roared like a trumpet in the
forum  he never sweat nor spat  i dont know but i think he had a
strain of the asiatic in him  and how civil and friendlylike he was
in returning everyones greeting called us all by name just like he was
one of us  and so provisions were cheap as dirt in those days  the loaf
you got for an as you couldnt eat not even if someone helped you but
you see them no bigger than a bulls eye now and the hell of it is that
things are getting worse every day this colony grows backwards like a
calfs tall  why do we have to put up with an aedile here whos not
worth three caunian figs and who thinks more of an as than of our lives
he has a good time at home and his daily incomes more than another
mans fortune  i happen to know where he got a thousand gold pieces
if we had any nuts hed not be so damned well pleased with himself
nowadays men are lions at home and foxes abroad  what gets me is that
ive already eaten my old clothes and if this high cost of living keeps
on ill have to sell my cottages  whats going to happen to this town
if neither gods nor men take pity on it  may i never have any luck if i
dont believe all this comes from the gods  for no one believes that
heaven is heaven no one keeps a fast no one cares a hang about jupiter
they all shut their eyes and count up their own profits  in the old
days the married women in their stolas climbed the hill in their bare
feet pure in heart and with their hair unbound and prayed to jupiter
for rain  and it would pour down in bucketfuls then or never and theyd
all come home wet as drowned rats  but the gods all have the gout now
because we are not religious and so our fields are burning up
chapter the fortyfifth
dont be so down in the mouth chimed in echion the ragman if it
wasnt that itd be something else as the farmer said when he lost his
spotted pig  if a thing dont happen today it may tomorrow  thats the
way life jogs along  you couldnt name a better country by hercules
you couldnt if only the men had any brains  shes in hot water right
now but she aint the only one  we oughtnt to be so particular
heavens as far away everywhere else  if you were somewhere else youd
swear that pigs walked around here already roasted  think of whats
coming  well soon have a fine gladiator show to last for three days no
trainingschool pupils most of them will be freedmen  our titus has a
hot head and plenty of guts and it will go to a finish  im well
acquainted with him and hell not stand for any frameups  it will be
cold steel in the best style no running away the shambles will be in
the middle of the amphitheatre where all the crowd can see  and whats
more he has the coin for he came into thirty million when his father
had the bad luck to die  he could blow in four hundred thousand and his
fortune never feel it but his name would live forever  he has some
dwarfs already and a woman to fight from a chariot  then theres
glycos steward he was caught screwing glycos wife  youll see some
battle between jealous husbands and favored lovers  anyhow that cheap
screw of a glyco condemned his steward to the beasts and only published
his own shame  how could the slave go wrong when he only obeyed orders
it would have been better if that shepisspot for thats all shes fit
for had been tossed by the bull but a fellow has to beat the saddle
when he cant beat the jackass  how could glyco ever imagine that a
sprig of hermogenes planting could turn out well  why hermogenes could
trim the claws of a flying hawk and no snake ever hatched out a rope
yet  and look at glyco  hes smoked himself out in fine shape and as
long as he lives hell carry that stain  no one but the devil himself
can wipe that out but chickens always come home to roost  my nose tells
me that mammaea will set out a spread two bits apiece for me and mine
and hell nick norbanus out of his political pull if he does you all
know that its to his interest to hump himself to get the best of him
and honestly what did that fellow ever do for us  he exhibited some two
cent gladiators that were so near dead theyd have fallen flat if you
blew your breath at them  ive seen better thugs sent against wild
beasts  and the cavalry he killed looked about as much like the real
thing as the horsemen on the lamps you would have taken them for
dunghill cocks  one plug had about as much action as a jackass with a
packsaddle another was clubfooted and a third who had to take the
place of one that was killed was as good as dead and hamstrung into the
bargain  there was only one that had any pep and he was a thracian but
he only fought when we egged him on  the whole crowd was flogged
afterwards  how the mob did yell lay it on  they were nothing but
runaways  and at that he had the nerve to say ive given you a show
and ive applauded i answered count it up and youll find that i
gave more than i got  one hand washes the other
chapter the fortysixth
agamemnon your looks seem to say whats this boresome nut trying to
hand us  well im talking because you who can talk bookfoolishness
wont  you dont belong to our bunch so you laugh in your sleeve at the
way us poor people talk but we know that youre only a fool with a lot
of learning  well what of it  some day ill get you to come to my
country place and take a look at my little estate  well have fresh eggs
and spring chicken to chew on when we get there it will be all right
even if the weather has kept things back this year  well find enough to
satisfy us and my kid will soon grow up to be a pupil of yours he can
divide up to four now and youll have a little servant at your side if
he lives  when he has a minute to himself he never takes his eyes from
his tablets hes smart too and has the right kind of stuff in him even
if he is crazy about birds  ive had to kill three of his linnets
already  i told him that a weasel had gotten them but hes found
another hobby now he paints all the time  hes left the marks of his
heels on his greek already and is doing pretty well with his latin
although his masters too easy with him wont make him stick to one
thing  he comes to me to get me to give him something to write when his
master dont want to work  then theres another tutor too no scholar
but very painstaking though he can teach you more than he knows
himself  he comes to the house on holidays and is always satisfied with
whatever you pay him  some little time ago i bought the kid some law
books i want him to have a smattering of the law for home use  theres
bread in that  as for literature hes got enough of that in him
already if he begins to kick ive concluded that ill make him learn
some trade the barbers say or the auctioneers or even the lawyers
thats one thing no one but the devil can do him out of  believe  what
your  daddy  says primigenius i din into his ears every day whenever
you learn a thing its yours  look at phileros the attorney hed not
be keeping the wolf from the door now if he hadnt studied  its not
long since he had to carry his wares on his back and peddle them but he
can put up a front with norbanus himself now  learnings a fine thing
and a trade wont starve
chapter the fortyseventh
twaddle of this sort was being bandied about when trimalchio came in
mopping his forehead and washing his hands in perfume he said after a
short pause pardon me gentlemen but my stomachs been on strike for
the past few days and the doctors disagreed about the cause  but
pomegranate rind and pitch steeped in vinegar have helped me and i hope
that my belly will get on its good behavior for sometimes theres such a
rumbling in my guts that youd think a bellowing bull was in there  so
if anyone wants to do his business theres no call to be bashful about
it  none of us was born solid  i dont know of any worse torment than
having to hold it in its the one thing jupiter himself cant hold in
so youre laughing are you fortunata  why youre always keeping me
awake at night yourself  i never objected yet to anyone in my
diningroom relieving himself when he wanted to and the doctors forbid
our holding it in  everythings ready outside if the calls more
serious water closestool and anything else youll need believe me
when this rising vapor gets to the brain it puts the whole body on the
burn  many a one ive known to kick in just because he wouldnt own up
to the truth  we thanked him for his kindness and consideration and
hid our laughter by drinking more and oftener we had not realized that
as yet we were only in the middle of the entertainment with a hill
still ahead as the saying goes  the tables were cleared off to the beat
of music and three white hogs muzzled and wearing bells were brought
into the diningroom  the announcer informed us that one was a
twoyearold another three and the third just turned six  i had an
idea that some ropedancers had come in and that the hogs would perform
tricks just as they do for the crowd on the streets but trimalchio
dispelled this illusion by asking which one will you have served up
immediately for dinner  any country cook can manage a dunghill cock a
pentheus hash or little things like that but my cooks are well used to
serving up calves boiled whole in their cauldrons then he ordered a
cook to be called in at once and without awaiting our pleasure he
directed that the oldest be butchered and demanded in a loud voice
what division do you belong too  when the fellow made answer that he
was from the fortieth were you bought or born upon my estates
 trimalchio continued  neither replied the cook i was left to you by
pansas will  see to it that this is properly done trimalchio
warned or ill have you transferred to the division of messengers
 and the cook bearing his masters warning in mind departed for the
kitchen with the next course in tow
chapter the fortyeighth
trimalchios threatening face relaxed and he turned to us if the wine
dont please you he said ill change it you ought to do justice to
it by drinking it  i dont have to buy it thanks to the gods
everything here that makes your mouths water was produced on one of my
country places which ive never yet seen but they tell me its down
terracina and tarentum way  ive got a notion to add sicily to my other
little holdings so in case i want to go to africa ill be able to sail
along my own coasts  but tell me the subject of your speech today
agamemnon for though i dont plead cases myself i studied literature
for home use and for fear you should think i dont care about learning
let me inform you that i have three libraries one greek and the others
latin  give me the outline of your speech if you like me
a poor man and a rich man were enemies agamemmon began when whats
a poor man  trimalchio broke in  well put agamemnon conceded and
went into details upon some problem or other what it was i do not know
trimalchio instantly rendered the following verdict if thats the case
theres nothing to dispute about if its not the case it dont amount
to anything anyhow  these flashes of wit and others equally
scintillating we loudly applauded and he went on tell me my dearest
agamemnon do you remember the twelve labors of hercules or the story of
ulysses how the cyclops threw his thumb out of joint with a pigheaded
crowbar  when i was a boy i used to read those stories in homer  and
then theres the sibyl with my own eyes i saw her at cumae hanging up
in a jar and whenever the boys would say to her sibyl sibyl what
would you she would answer i would die
chapter the fortyninth
before he had run out of wind a tray upon which was an enormous hog was
placed upon the table almost filling it up  we began to wonder at the
dispatch with which it had been prepared and swore that no cock could
have been served up in so short a time moreover this hog seemed to us
far bigger than the boar had been trimalchio scrutinized it closely and
what the hell he suddenly bawled out this hog haint been gutted
has it  no it haint by hercules it haint  call that cook  call
that cook in here immediately  when the crestfallen cook stood at the
table and owned up that he had forgotten to bowel him so you forgot
did you  trimalchio shouted youd think hed only left out a bit of
pepper and cummin wouldnt you off with his clothes  the cook was
stripped without delay and stood with hanging head between two
torturers  we all began to make excuses for him at this saying little
things like that are bound to happen once in a while let us prevail upon
you to let him off if he ever does such a thing again not a one of us
will have a word to say in his behalf  but for my part i was
mercilessly angry and could not help leaning over towards agamemnon and
whispering in his ear it is easily seen that this fellow is criminally
careless is it not  how could anyone forget to draw a hog  if he had
served me a fish in that fashion i wouldnt overlook it by hercules i
wouldnt  but that was not trimalchios way his face relaxed into good
humor and he said since your memorys so short you can gut him right
here before our eyes the cook put on his tunic snatched up a carving
knife with a trembling hand and slashed the hogs belly in several
places  sausages and meatpuddings widening the apertures by their
own weight immediately tumbled out
chapter the fiftieth
the whole household burst into unanimous applause at this hurrah for
gaius they shouted  as for the cook he was given a drink and a silver
crown and a cup on a salver of corinthian bronze seeing that agamemnon
was eyeing the platter closely trimalchio remarked im the only one
that can show the real corinthian i thought that in his usual
purseproud manner he was going to boast that his bronzes were all
imported from corinth but he did even better by saying wouldnt you
like to know how it is that im the only one that can show the real
corinthian  well its because the bronze worker i patronize is named
corinthus and whats corinthian unless its what a corinthus makes
and so you wont think im a blockhead im going to show you that im
well acquainted with how corinthian first came into the world  when troy
was taken hannibal who was a very foxy fellow and a great rascal into
the bargain piled all the gold and silver and bronze statues in one pile
and set em afire melting these different metals into one then the
metal workers took their pick and made bowls and dessert dishes and
statuettes as well  thats how corinthian was born neither one nor the
other but an amalgam of all  but i prefer glass if you dont mind my
saying so it dont stink and if it didnt break id rather have it
than gold but its cheap and common now
chapter the fiftyfirst
but there was an artisan once upon a time who made a glass vial that
couldnt be broken  on that account he was admitted to caesar with his
gift then he dashed it upon the floor when caesar handed it back to
him  the emperor was greatly startled but the artisan picked the vial
up off the pavement and it was dented just like a brass bowl would have
been  he took a little hammer out of his tunic and beat out the dent
without any trouble  when he had done that he thought he would soon be
in jupiters heaven and more especially when caesar said to him is
there anyone else who knows how to make this malleable glass  think
now  and when he denied that anyone else knew the secret caesar
ordered his head chopped off because if this should get out we would
think no more of gold than we would of dirt
chapter the fiftysecond
and when it comes to silver im a connoisseur i have goblets as big as
winejars a hundred of em more or less with engraving that shows how
cassandra killed her sons and the dead boys are lying so naturally that
youd think em alive  i own a thousand bowls which mummius left to my
patron where daedalus is shown shutting niobe up in the trojan horse
and i also have cups engraved with the gladiatorial contests of hermeros
and petraites theyre all heavy too  i wouldnt sell my taste in these
matters for any money  a slave dropped a cup while he was running on in
this fashion  glaring at him trimalchio said go hang yourself since
youre so careless  the boys lip quivered and he immediately commenced
to beg for mercy  why do you pray to me  trimalchio demanded at
this i dont intend to be harsh with you im only warning you against
being so awkward  finally however we got him to give the boy a pardon
and no sooner had this been done than the slave started running around
the room crying out with the water and in with the wine  we all paid
tribute to this joke but agamemnon in particular for he well knew what
strings to pull in order to secure another invitation to dinner  tickled
by our flattery and mellowed by the wine trimalchio was just about
drunk  why hasnt one of you asked my fortunata to dance  he
demanded theres no one can do a better cancan believe me and he
himself raised his arms above his head and favored us with an
impersonation of syrus the actor the whole household chanting
                                oh bravo
                             oh bravissimo
in chorus and he would have danced out into the middle of the room
before us all had not fortunata whispered in his ear telling him
i suppose that such low buffoonery was not in keeping with his dignity
but nothing could be so changeable as his humor for one minute he stood
in awe of fortunata but his natural propensities would break out the
next
chapter the fiftythird
but his passion for dancing was interrupted at this stage by a
stenographer who read aloud as if he were reading the public records
on the seventh of the kalends of july on trimalchios estates near
cumae were born thirty boys and forty girls five hundred pecks of wheat
were taken from the threshing floors and stored in the granaries five
hundred oxen were put to yoke the slave mithridates was crucified on the
same date for cursing the genius of our master gaius on said date ten
million sesterces were returned to the vaults as no sound investment
could be found on said date a fire broke out in the gardens at pompeii
said fire originating in the house of nasta the bailiff  whats
that demanded trimalchio  when were the gardens at pompeii bought for
me  why last year answered the stenographer for that reason the
item has not appeared in the accounts  trimalchio flew into a rage at
this  if im not told within six months of any real estate thats
bought for me he shouted i forbid its being carried to my account at
all  next the edicts of his aediles were read aloud and the wills of
some of his foresters in which trimalchio was disinherited by a codicil
then the names of his bailiffs and that of a freedwoman who had been
repudiated by a night watchman after she had been caught in bed with a
bath attendant that of a porter banished to baioe a steward who was
standing trial and lastly the report of a decision rendered in the
matter of a lawsuit between some valets  when this was over with some
rope dancers came in and a very boresome fool stood holding a ladder
ordering his boy to dance from rung to rung and finally at the top all
this to the music of popular airs then the boy was compelled to jump
through blazing hoops while grasping a huge wine jar with his teeth
trimalchio was the only one who was much impressed by these tricks
remarking that it was a thankless calling and adding that in all the
world there were just two things which could give him acute pleasure
ropedancers and horn blowers all other entertainments were nothing
but nonsense  i bought a company of comedians he went on but i
preferred for them to put on atellane farces and i ordered my
fluteplayer to play latin airs only
chapter the fiftyfourth
while our noble gaius was still talking away the boy slipped and fell
alighting upon trimalchios arm  the whole household cried out as did
also the guests not that they bore such a coarse fellow any good will
as they would gladly have seen his neck broken but because such an
unlucky ending to the dinner might make it necessary for them to go into
mourning over a total stranger  as for trimalchio he groaned heavily
and bent over his arm as though it had been injured doctors flocked
around him and fortunata was among the very first her hair was
streaming and she held a cup in her hand and screamed out her grief and
unhappiness  as for the boy who had fallen he was crawling at our feet
imploring pardon  i was uneasy for fear his prayers would lead up to
some ridiculous theatrical climax for i had not yet been able to forget
that cook who had forgotten to bowel that hog and so for this reason i
began to scan the whole diningroom very closely to see if an automaton
would come out through the wall and all the more so as a slave was
beaten for having bound up his masters bruised arm in white wool instead
of purple  nor was my suspicion unjustified for in place of punishment
trimalchio ordered that the boy be freed so that no one could say that
so exalted a personage had been injured by a slave
chapter the fiftyfifth
we applauded his action and engaged in a discussion upon the instability
of human affairs which many took sides a good reason declared
trimalchio why such an occasion shouldnt slip by without an epigram
 he called for his tablets at once and after racking his brains for a
little while he got off the following
                    the unexpected will turn up
                    our whole lives fortune bungles up
                    falernian boy hand round the cup
this epigram led up to a discussion of the poets and for a long time
the greatest praise was bestowed upon mopsus the thracian until
trimalchio broke in with professor i wish youd tell me how youd
compare cicero and publilius  im of the opinion that the first was the
more eloquent but that the last moralizes more beautifully for what can
excel these lines
     insatiable luxury crumbles the walls of war
     to satiate gluttony peacocks in coops are brought
     arrayed in gold plumage like babylon tapestry rich
     numidian guineafowls capons all perish for thee
     and even the wandering stork welcome guest that he is
     the emblem of sacred maternity slender of leg
     and gloctoring exile from winter herald of spring
     still finds his last nest in thecauldron of gluttony base
     india surrenders her pearls and what mean they to thee
     that thy wife decked with seaspoils adorning her breast
          and her head
     on the couch of a stranger lies lifting adulterous legs
     the emerald green the glass bauble what mean they to thee
     or the fire of the ruby  except that pure chastity shine
     from the depth of the jewels in garments of woven wind clad
     our brides might as well take their stand their game
          naked to stalk
     as seek it in gossamer tissue transparent as air
chapter the fiftysixth
what should we say was the hardest calling after literature he asked
that of the doctor or that of the moneychanger i would say the
doctor because he has to know what poor devils have got in their
insides and when the fevers due but i hate them like the devil for my
part because theyre always ordering me on a diet of duck soup and the
moneychangers because hes got to be able to see the silver through
the copper plating  when we come to the dumb beasts the oxen and sheep
are the hardest worked the oxen thanks to whose labor we have bread to
chew on the sheep because their wool tricks us out so fine  its the
greatest outrage under the sun for people to eat mutton and then wear a
tunic  then theres the bee in my opinion theyre divine insects
because they puke honey though there are folks that claim that they
bring it from jupiter and thats the reason they sting too for
wherever you find a sweet youll find a bitter too he was just putting

were a thousand of these jokes more or less which have now escaped my
memory
chapter the fiftyseventh
but ascyltos threw off all restraint and ridiculed everything throwing
up his hands he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks  at last
one of trimalchios fellowfreedmen the one who had the place next to
me flew into a rage whats the joke sheepshead he bawled dont
our hosts swell entertainment suit you  youre richer than he is i
suppose and used to dining better  as i hope the guardian spirit of
this house will be on my side id have stopped his bleating long ago if

knight  well im a kings son  hows it come that youve been a slave

roman citizen than a taxpaying provincial  and now i hope that my life
will be such that no one can jeer at me  im a man among men  i take my
stroll bareheaded and owe no man a copper cent  i never had a summons in
my life and no one ever said to me in the forum pay me what you owe me
ive bought a few acres and saved up a few dollars and i feed twenty
bellies and a dog  i ransomed my bedfellow so no one could wipe his
hands on her bosom a thousand dinars it cost me too  i was chosen
priest of augustus without paying the fee and i hope that i wont need
to blush in my grave after im dead  but youre so busy that you cant
look behind you you can spot a louse on someone else all right but you
cant see the tick on yourself  youre the only one that thinks were so
funny look at your professor hes older than you are and were good
enough for him but youre only a brat with the milk still in your nose
and all you can prattle is ma or mu youre only a clay pot a piece
of leather soaked in water softer and slipperier but none the better
for that  youve got more coin than we have have you  then eat two
breakfasts and two dinners a day  id rather have my reputation than
riches for my part and before i make an end of thiswho ever dunned me
twice  in all the forty years i was in service no one could tell
whether i was free or a slave  i was only a longhaired boy when i came
to this colony and the town house was not built then  i did my best to
please my master and he was a digniferous and majestical gentleman whose
nailparings were worth more than your whole carcass  i had enemies in
his house too who would have been glad to trip me up but i swam the
flood thanks to his kindness  those are the things that try your
mettle for its as easy to be born a gentleman as to say come here
well what are you gaping at now like a billygoat in a vetchfield
chapter the fiftyeighth
giton who had been standing at my feet and who had for some time been
holding in his laughter burst into an uproarious guffaw at this last
figure of speech and when ascyltos adversary heard it he turned his
abuse upon the boy  whats so funny you curlyheaded onion he
bellowed are the saturnalia here id like to know  is it december
now
when did you pay your twentieth  whats this to you you gallowsbird
you crows meat  ill call the anger of jupiter down on you and that
master of yours who dont keep you in better order  if i didnt respect
my fellowfreedmen id give you what is coming to you right here on the
spot as i hope to get my belly full of bread i would  well get along
well enough but those that cant control you are fools like master like
mans a true saying  i can hardly hold myself in and im not hotheaded
by nature but once let me get a start and i dont care two cents for my
own mother  all right ill catch you in the street you rat you
toadstool  may i never grow an inch up or down if i dont push your
master into a dunghill and ill give you the same medicine i will by
hercules i will no matter if you call down olympian jupiter himself
ill take care of your eight inch ringlets and your two cent master into
the bargain  ill have my teeth into you either youll cut out the
laughing or i dont know myself  yes even if you had a golden beard
ill bring the wrath of minerva down on you and on the fellow that first
made a comehere out of you  no i never learned geometry or criticism
or other foolishness like that but i know my capital letters and i can
divide any figure by a hundred be it in asses pounds or sesterces
lets have a showdown you and i will make a little bet heres my coin
youll soon find out that your fathers money was wasted on your
education even if you do know a little rhetoric  hows thiswhat part
of us am i  i come far i come wide now guess me  ill give you
another  what part of us runs but never moves from its place  what part
of us grows but always grows less  but you scurry around and are as
flustered and fidgeted as a mouse in a pisspot  shut up and dont annoy
your betters who dont even know that youve been born  dont think
that im impressed by those boxwood armlets that you did your mistress
out of  occupo will back me  lets go into the forum and borrow money
then youll see whether this iron ring means credit  bah  a draggled
fox is a fine sight aint it  i hope i never get rich and die decently
so that the people will swear by my death if i dont hound you
everywhere with my toga turned inside out  and the fellow that taught
you such manners did a good job too a chattering ape all right no
schoolmaster  we were better taught  is everything in its place the
master would ask go straight home and dont stop and stare at everything
and dont be impudent to your elders  dont loiter along looking in at
the shops  no second raters came out of that school  im what you see
me and i thank the gods its all due to my own cleverness
chapter the fiftyninth
ascyltos was just starting in to answer this indictment when trimalchio
who was delighted with his fellowfreedmans tirade broke in cut out
the bickering and lets have things pleasant here  let up on the young
fellow hermeros hes hotblooded so you ought to be more reasonable
the losers always the winner in arguments of this kind  and as for you
even when you were a young punk you used to go coco coco like a hen
after a rooster but you had no pep lets get to better business and
start the fun all over again and watch the homerists  a troupe filed
in immediately and clashed spears against shields  trimalchio sat
himself up on his cushion and intoned in latin from a book while the
actors in accordance with their conceited custom recited their parts in
the greek language  there came a pause presently and you dont any of
you know the plot of the skit theyre putting on do you  he asked
diomedes and ganymede were two brothers and helen was their sister
agamemnon ran away with her and palmed off a doe on diana in her place
so homer tells how the trojans and parentines fought among themselves
of course agamemnon was victorious and gave his daughter iphigenia to
achilles for a wife this caused ajax to go mad and hell soon make the
whole thing plain to you  the homerists raised a shout as soon as
trimalchio had done speaking and as the whole familia stepped back a
boiled calf with a helmet on its head was brought in on an enormous
platter  ajax followed and rushed upon it with drawn sword as if he
were insane he made passes with the flat and again with the edge and
then collecting the slices he skewered them and much to our
astonishment presented them to us on the point of his sword
chapter the sixtieth
but we were not given long in which to admire the elegance of such
service for all of a sudden the ceiling commenced to creak and then the
whole diningroom shook  i leaped to my feet in consternation for fear
some ropewalker would fall down and the rest of the company raised
their faces wondering as much as i what new prodigy was to be announced
from on high  then lo and behold the ceiling panels parted and an
enormous hoop which appeared to have been knocked off a huge cask was
lowered from the dome above its perimeter was hung with golden chaplets
and jars of alabaster filled with perfume  we were asked to accept these
articles as souvenirs  when my glance returned to the table i noticed
that a dish containing cakes had been placed upon it and in the middle
an image of priapus made by the baker and he held apples of all
varieties and bunches of grapes against his breast in the conventional
manner  we applied ourselves wholeheartedly to this dessert and our
joviality was suddenly revived by a fresh diversion for at the
slightest pressure all the cakes and fruits would squirt a saffron sauce
upon us and even spurted unpleasantly into our faces  being convinced
that these perfumed dainties had some religious significance we arose in
a body and shouted hurrah for the emperor the father of his country
 however as we perceived that even after this act of veneration the
others continued helping themselves we filled our napkins with the
apples  i was especially keen on this for i thought i could never put
enough good things into gitons lap  three slaves entered in the
meantime dressed in white tunics well tucked up and two of them placed
lares with amulets hanging from their necks upon the table while the
third carried round a bowl of wine and cried may the gods be
propitious  one was called cerdobusiness trimalchio informed us
the other lucrioluckand the third felicioprofitand when all the
rest had kissed a true likeness of trimalchio we were ashamed to pass it
by
chapter the sixtyfirst
after they had all wished each other sound minds and good health
trimalchio turned to niceros  you used to be better company at
dinner he remarked and i dont know why you should be dumb today
with never a word to say  if you wish to make me happy tell about that
experience you had i beg of you  delighted at the affability of his
friend i hope i lose all my luck if im not tickled to death at the
humor i see you in niceros replied  all right lets go the limit for
a good time though im afraid these scholarsll laugh at me but ill
tell my tale and they can go as far as they like  what thell do i care
who laughs  its better to be laughed at than laughed down  these
words spake the hero and began the following tale we lived in a narrow
street in the house gavilla now owns when i was a slave  there by the
will of the gods i fell in love with the wife of terentius the
innkeeper you knew melissa of tarentum that pretty roundchecked little
wench  it was no carnal passion so hear me hercules it wasnt i was
not in love with her physical charms  no it was because she was such a
good sport  i never asked her for a thing and had her deny me if she
had an as i had half  i trusted her with everything i had and never was
done out of anything  her husband up and died on the place one day so
i tried every way i could to get to her for you know friends ought to
show up when anyones in a pinch
chapter the sixtysecond
it so happened that our master had gone to capua to attend to some odds
and ends of business and i seized the opportunity and persuaded a guest
of the house to accompany me as far as the fifth milestone  he was a
soldier and as brave as the very devil  we set out about cockcrow the
moon was shining as bright as midday and came to where the tombstones
are  my man stepped aside amongst them but i sat down singing and
commenced to count them up  when i looked around for my companion he
had stripped himself and piled his clothes by the side of the road  my
heart was in my mouth and i sat there while he pissed a ring around them
and was suddenly turned into a wolf  now dont think im joking i
wouldnt lie for any amount of money but as i was saying he commenced
to howl after he was turned into a wolf and ran away into the forest
i didnt know where i was for a minute or two then i went to his
clothes to pick them up and damned if they hadnt turned to stone  was
ever anyone nearer dead from fright than me  then i whipped out my sword
and cut every shadow along the road to bits till i came to the house of
my mistress  i looked like a ghost when i went in and i nearly slipped
my wind  the sweat was pouring down my crotch my eyes were staring and
i could hardly be brought around  my melissa wondered why i was out so
late  oh if youd only come sooner she said you could have helped
us a wolf broke into the folds and attacked the sheep bleeding them
like a butcher  but he didnt get the laugh on me even if he did get
away for one of the slaves ran his neck through with a spear  i
couldnt keep my eyes shut any longer when i heard that and as soon as
it grew light i rushed back to our gaius house like an innkeeper beaten
out of his bill and when i came to the place where the clothes had been
turned into stone there was nothing but a pool of blood  and moreover
when i got home my soldier was lying in bed like an ox and a doctor
was dressing his neck  i knew then that he was a werewolf and after
that i couldnt have eaten a crumb of bread with him no not if you had
killed me  others can think what they please about this but as for me
i hope your geniuses will all get after me if i lie
chapter the sixtythird
we were all dumb with astonishment when i take your story for granted
 said trimalchio and if youll believe me my hair stood on end and
all the more because i know that niceros never talks nonsense hes
always levelheaded not a bit gossipy  and now ill tell you a
hairraiser myself though im like a jackass on a slippery pavement
compared to him  when i was a longhaired boy for i lived a chian life
from my youth up my masters minion died  he was a jewel so hear me
hercules he was perfect in every facet  while his sorrowstricken
mother was bewailing his loss and the rest of us were lamenting with
her the witches suddenly commenced to screech so loud that you would
have thought a hare was being run down by the hounds  at that time we
had a cappadocian slave tall very bold and he had muscle too he
could hold a mad bull in the air  he wrapped a mantle around his left
arm boldly rushed out of doors with drawn sword and ran a woman
through the middle about here no harm to what i touch  we heard a
scream but as a matter of fact for i wont lie to you we didnt catch
sight of the witches themselves  our simpleton came back presently and
threw himself upon the bed  his whole body was black and blue as if he
had been flogged with whips and of course the reason of that was she
had touched him with her evil hand  we shut the door and returned to
our business but when the mother put her arms around the body of her
son it turned out that it was only a straw bolster no heart no guts
nothing  of course the witches had swooped down upon the lad and put
the straw changeling in his place  believe me or not suit yourselves
but i say that there are women that know too much and nighthags too
and they turn everything upside down  and as for the longhaired booby
he never got back his own natural color and he died raving mad a few
days later
chapter the sixtyfourth
though we wondered greatly we believed none the less implicitly and
kissing the table we besought the nighthags to attend to their own
affairs while we were returning home from dinner  as far as i was
concerned the lamps already seemed to burn double and the whole
diningroom was going round when see here plocamus trimalchio spoke
up havent you anything to tell us  you havent entertained us at all
have you  and you used to be fine company always ready to oblige with a
recitation or a song  the gods bless us how the green figs have
fallen  true for you the fellow answered since ive got the gout
my sporting days are over but in the good old times when i was a young
spark i nearly sang myself into a consumption  how i used to dance
and take my part in a farce or hold up my end in the barber shops  who
could hold a candle to me except of course the one and only apelles
 he then put his hand to his mouth and hissed out some foul gibberish or
other and said afterwards that it was greek  trimalchio himself then
favored us with an impersonation of a man blowing a trumpet and when he
had finished he looked around for his minion whom he called croesus a
bleareyed slave whose teeth were very disagreeably discolored  he was
playing with a little black bitch disgustingly fat wrapping her up in a
leekgreen scarf and teasing her with a halfloaf of bread which he had
put on the couch and when from sheer nausea she refused it he crammed
it down her throat  this sight put trimalchio in mind of his own dog and
he ordered scylax the guardian of his house and home to be brought
in  an enormous dog was immediately led in upon a chain and obeying a
kick from the porter it lay down beside the table thereupon trimalchio
remarked as he threw it a piece of white bread no one in all my house
loves me better than scylax  enraged at trimalchios praising scylax so
warmly the slave put the bitch down upon the floor and sicked her on to
fight  scylax as might have been expected from such a dog made the
whole room ring with his hideous barking and nearly shook the life out of
the little bitch which the slave called pearl  nor did the uproar end in
a dog fight a candelabrum was upset upon the table breaking the glasses
and spattering some of the guests with hot oil  as trimalchio did not
wish to seem concerned at the loss he kissed the boy and ordered him to
climb upon his own back  the slave did not hesitate but mounting his
rockinghorse he beat trimalchios shoulders with his open palms
yelling with laughter buck buck  how many fingers do i hold up
 when trimalchio had in a measure regained his composure which took but
a little while he ordered that a huge vessel be filled with mixed wine
and that drinks be served to all the slaves sitting around our feet
adding as an afterthought if anyone refuses to drink pour it on his
head business is business but nows the time for fun
chapter the sixtyfifth
the dainties that followed this display of affability were of such a
nature that if any reliance is to be placed in my word the very mention
of them makes me sick at the stomach  instead of thrushes fattened
chickens were served one to each of us and goose eggs with pastry caps
on them which same trimalchio earnestly entreated us to eat informing
us that the chickens had all been boned  just at that instant however
a lictor knocked at the diningroom door and a reveler clad in white
vestments entered followed by a large retinue  startled at such pomp
i thought that the praetor had arrived so i put my bare feet upon the
floor and started to get up but agamemnon laughed at my anxiety and
said keep your seat you idiot its only habinnas the sevir hes a
stone mason and if report speaks true he makes the finest tombstones
imaginable  reassured by this information i lay back upon my couch and
watched habinnas entrance with great curiosity  already drunk and
wearing several wreaths his forehead smeared with perfume which ran down
into his eyes he advanced with his hands upon his wifes shoulders and
seating himself in the praetors place he called for wine and hot water
delighted with his good humor trimalchio called for a larger goblet for
himself and asked him at the same time how he had been entertained
we had everything except yourself for my heart and soul were here but
it was fine it was by hercules  scissa was giving a novendial feast
for her slave whom she freed on his deathbed and its my opinion
shell have a large sum to split with the tax gatherers for the dead man
was rated at 50000 but everything went off well even if we did have to
pour half our wine on the bones of the late lamented
chapter the sixtysixth
but demanded trimalchio what did you have for dinner  ill tell
you if i can answered he for my memorys so good that i often forget
my own name  lets see for the first course we had a hog crowned with
a wine cup and garnished with cheese cakes and chicken livers cooked well
done beets of course and wholewheat bread which id rather have
than white because it puts strength into you and when i take a crap
afterwards i dont have to yell  following this came a course of
tarts served cold with excellent spanish wine poured over warm honey
i ate several of the tarts and got the honey all over myself  then there
were chickpeas and lupines all the smoothshelled nuts you wanted and
an apple apiece but i got away with two and here they are tied up in
my napkin for ill have a row on my hands if i dont bring some kind of
a present home to my favorite slave  oh yes my wife has just reminded
me there was a haunch of bearmeat as a side dish scintilla ate some of
it without knowing what it was and she nearly puked up her guts when she
found out  but as for me i ate more than a pound of it for it tasted
exactly like wild boar and says i if a bear eats a man shouldnt that
be all the more reason for a man to eat a bear  the last course was soft
cheese new wine boiled thick a snail apiece a helping of tripe liver
pate capped eggs turnips and mustard  but thats enough  pickled
olives were handed around in a wooden bowl and some of the party
greedily snatched three handfuls we had ham too but we sent it back
chapter the sixtyseventh
but why isnt fortunata at the table gaius  tell me  whats that
 trimalchio replied dont you know her better than that  she wouldnt
touch even a drop of water till after the silver was put away and the
leftovers divided among the slaves  im going to beat it if she dont
take her place habinnas threatened and started to get up and then
at a signal the slaves all called out together fortunata four times
or more
she appeared girded round with a sash of greenish yellow below which a
cherrycolored tunic could be seen and she had on twisted anklets and
sandals worked in gold  then wiping her hands upon a handkerchief which
she wore around her neck she seated herself upon the couch beside
scintilla habinnas wife and clapping her hands and kissing her my
dear she gushed is it really you  fortunata then removed the
bracelets from her pudgy arms and held them out to the admiring
scintilla and by and by she took off her anklets and even her yellow
hairnet which was twentyfour carats fine she would have us know
trimalchio who was on the watch ordered every trinket to be brought to
him  you see these things dont you  he demanded theyre what
women fetter us with  thats the way us poor suckers are done  these
ought to weigh six pounds and a half  i have an armband myself that
dont weigh a grain under ten pounds i bought it out of mercurys
thousandths too  finally for fear he would seem to be lying he
ordered the scales to be brought in and carried around to prove the
weights  and scintilla was no better  she took off a small golden
vanity case which she wore around her neck and which she called her
lucky box and took from it two eardrops which in her turn she handed
to fortunata to be inspected  thanks to the generosity of my husband
 she smirked no woman has better  whats that  habinnas demanded
you kept on my trail to buy that glass bean for you if i had a
daughter ill be damned if i wouldnt cut off her little ears  wed
have everything as cheap as dirt if there were no women but we have to
piss hot and drink cold the way things are now  the women angry
though they were were laughing together in the meantime and exchanging
drunken kisses the one running on about her diligence as a housekeeper
and the other about the infidelities and neglect of her husband
habinnas got up stealthily while they were clinging together in this
fashion and seizing fortunata by the feet he tipped her over backwards
upon the couch  let go  she screeched as her tunic slipped above her
knees then after pulling down her clothing she threw herself into
scintillas lap and hid with her handkerchief a face which was none
the more beautiful for its blushes
chapter the sixtyeighth
after a short interval trimalchio gave orders for the dessert to be
served whereupon the slaves took away all the tables and brought in
others and sprinkled the floor with sawdust mixed with saffron and
vermilion and also with powdered mica a thing i had never seen done
before  when all this was done trimalchio remarked i could rest
content with this course for you have your second tables but if youve
something especially nice why bring it on  meanwhile an alexandrian
slave boy who had been serving hot water commenced to imitate a
nightingale and when trimalchio presently called out change your
tune we had another surprise for a slave sitting at habinnas feet
egged on i have no doubt by his own master bawled suddenly in a
singsong voice meanwhile aeneas and all of his fleet held his course on
the billowy deep never before had my ears been assailed by a sound so
discordant for in addition to his barbarous pronunciation and the
raising and lowering of his voice he interpolated atellane verses and
for the first time in my life virgil grated on my nerves  when he had
to quit finally from sheer want of breath did he ever have any
training habinnas exclaimed no not he  i educated him by sending
him among the grafters at the fair so when it comes to taking off a
barker or a mule driver theres not his equal and the rogues clever
too hes a shoemaker or a cook or a baker a regular jack of all
trades  but he has two faults and if he didnt have them hed be
beyond all price he snores and hes been circumcised  and thats the
reason he never can keep his mouth shut and always has an eye open  i
paid three hundred dinars for him
chapter the sixtyninth
yes scintilla broke in and youve not mentioned all of his
accomplishments either hes a pimp too and im going to see that hes
branded she snapped  trimalchio laughed  theres where the
cappadocian comes out he said never cheats himself out of anything
and i admire him for it so help me hercules i do  no one can show a
dead man a good time  dont be jealous scintilla were next to you
women too believe me  as sure as you see me here safe and sound i
used to play at thrust and parry with mamma my mistress and finally
even my master got suspicious and sent me back to a stewardship but keep
quiet tongue and ill give you a cake  taking all this as praise the
wretched slave pulled a small earthen lamp from a fold in his garment
and impersonated a trumpeter for half an hour or more while habinnas
hummed with him holding his finger pressed to his lips  finally the
slave stepped out into the middle of the floor and waved his pipes in
imitation of a fluteplayer then with a whip and a smock he enacted
the part of a muledriver  at last habinnas called him over and kissed
him and said as he poured a drink for him you get better all the time
massa  im going to give you a pair of shoes  had not the dessert been
brought in we would never have gotten to the end of these stupidities
thrushes made of pastry and stuffed with nuts and raisins quinces with
spines sticking out so that they looked like seaurchins  all this would
have been endurable enough had it not been for the last dish that was
served so revolting was this that we would rather have died of
starvation than to have even touched it  we thought that a fat goose
flanked with fish and all kinds of birds had been served until
trimalchio spoke up  everything you see here my friends said he
was made from the same stuff  with my usual keen insight i jumped to
the conclusion that i knew what that stuff was and turning to agamemnon
i said i shall be greatly surprised if all those things are not made
out of excrement or out of mud at the very least i saw a like artifice
practiced at rome during the saturnalia
chapter the seventieth
i had not done speaking when trimalchio chimed in as i hope to grow
fatter in fortune but not in figure my cook has made all this out of a
hog  it would be simply impossible to meet up with a more valuable
fellow hed make you a fish out of a sows coynte if thats what you
wanted a pigeon out of her lard a turtledove out of her ham and a hen
out of a knuckle of pork thats why i named him daedalus in a happy
moment  i brought him a present of knives from rome because hes so
smart theyre made of noric steel too  he ordered them brought in
immediately and looked them over with admiration even giving us the
chance to try their edges upon our cheeks  then all of a sudden two
slaves came in carrying on as if they had been fighting at the fountain
at least each one had a waterjar hanging from a yoke around his neck
trimalchio arbitrated their difference but neither would abide by his
decision and each one smashed the others jar with a club  perturbed at
the insolence of these drunken ruffians we watched both of them
narrowly while they were fighting and then what should come pouring
out of the broken jars but oysters and scallops which a slave picked up
and passed around in a dish  the resourceful cook would not permit
himself to be outdone by such refinements but served us with snails on a
silver gridiron and sang continually in a tremulous and very discordant
voice  i am ashamed to have to relate what followed for contrary to
all convention some longhaired boys brought in unguents in a silver
basin and anointed the feet of the reclining guests but before doing
this however they bound our thighs and ankles with garlands of flowers
they then perfumed the winemixing vessel with the same unguent and
poured some of the melted liquid into the lamps  fortunata had by this
time taken a notion that she wanted to dance and scintilla was doing
more handclapping than talking when trimalchio called out
philargyrus and you too carrio you can both come to the table
even if you are green faction fans and tell your bedfellow menophila
to come too  what would you think happened then  we were nearly
crowded off the couches by the mob of slaves that crowded into the
diningroom and almost filled it full  as a matter of fact i noticed
that our friend the cook who had made a goose out of a hog was placed
next to me and he stunk from sauces and pickle  not satisfied with a
place at the table he immediately staged an impersonation of ephesus the
tragedian and then he suddenly offered to bet his master that the greens
would take first place in the next circus games
chapter the seventyfirst
trimalchio was hugely tickled at this challenge  slaves are men my
friends he observed but thats not all they sucked the same milk
that we did even if hard luck has kept them down and theyll drink the
water of freedom if i live to make a long story short im freeing all
of them in my will  to philargyrus im leaving a farm and his
bedfellow too  carrio will get a tenement house and his twentieth
and a bed and bedclothes to boot  im making fortunata my heir and i
commend her to all my friends  i announce all this in public so that my
household will love me as well now as they will when im dead  they all
commenced to pay tribute to the generosity of their master when he
putting aside his trifling ordered a copy of his will brought in which
same he read aloud from beginning to end to the groaning accompaniment
of the whole household  then looking at habinnas what say you my
dearest friend he entreated youll construct my monument in keeping
with the plans ive given you wont you  i earnestly beg that you carve
a little bitch at the feet of my statue some wreaths and some jars of
perfume and all of the fights of petraites  then ill be able to live
even after im dead thanks to your kindness  see to it that it has a
frontage of one hundred feet and a depth of two hundred  i want fruit
trees of every kind planted around my ashes and plenty of vines too
for its all wrong for a man to deck out his house when hes alive and
then have no pains taken with the one he must stay in for a longer time
and thats the reason i particularly desire that this notice be added
                       this monument does not
                         descend to an heir
in any case ill see to it through a clause in my will that im not
insulted when im dead  and for fear the rabble comes running up into my
monument to crap ill appoint one of my freedmen custodian of my tomb
i want you to carve ships under full sail on my monument and me in my
robes of office sitting on my tribunal five gold rings on my fingers
pouring out coin from a sack for the people for i gave a dinner and two
dinars for each guest as you know  show a banquethall too if you
can and the people in it having a good time  on my right you can place
a statue of fortunata holding a dove and leading a little bitch on a
leash and my favorite boy and large jars sealed with gypsum so the
wine wont run out show one broken and a boy crying over it  put a
sundial in the middle so that whoever looks to see what time it is must
read my name whether he wants to or not  as for the inscription think
this over carefully and see if you think its appropriate
                   here rests g pompeius trimalchio
                     freedman of maecenas decreed
                    augustal sevir in his absence
                    he could have been a member of
                    every decuria of rome but would
                     not conscientious brave loyal
                   he grew rich from little and left
                    thirty million sesterces behind
                     he never heard a philosopher
                          farewell trimalchio
                           farewell passerby
chapter the seventysecond
when he had repeated these words trimalchio began to weep copiously
fortunata was crying already and so was habinnas and at last the whole
household filled the diningroom with their lamentations just as if they
were taking part in a funeral  even i was beginning to sniffle when
trimalchio said lets live while we can since we know weve all got to
die  id rather see you all happy anyhow so lets take a plunge in the
bath  youll never regret it  ill bet my life on that its as hot as
a furnace  fine business seconded habinnas theres nothing suits
me better than making two days out of one and he got up in his bare
feet to follow trimalchio who was clapping his hands  i looked at
ascyltos  what do you think about this i asked  the very sight of a
bath will be the death of me  lets fall in with his suggestion he
replied and while they are hunting for the bath we will escape in the
crowd  giton led us out through the porch when we had reached this
understanding and we came to a door where a dog on a chain startled us
so with his barking that ascyltos immediately fell into the fishpond
as for myself i was tipsy and had been badly frightened by a dog that
was only a painting and when i tried to haul the swimmer out i was
dragged into the pool myself  the porter finally came to our rescue
quieted the dog by his appearance and pulled us shivering to dry land
giton had ransomed himself by a very cunning scheme for what we had
saved for him from dinner he threw to the barking brute which then
calmed its fury and became engrossed with the food  but when with
chattering teeth we besought the porter to let us out at the door if
you think you can leave by the same door you came in at he replied
youre mistaken no guest is ever allowed to go out through the same
door he came in at some are for entrance others for exit
chapter the seventythird
what were we miserable wretches to do shut up in this newfangled
labyrinth  the idea of taking a hot bath had commenced to grow in favor
so we finally asked the porter to lead us to the place and throwing off
our clothing which giton spread out in the hall to dry we went in
it was very small like a cold water cistern trimalchio was standing
upright in it and one could not escape his disgusting bragging even
here  he declared that there was nothing nicer than bathing without a
mob around and that a bakery had formerly occupied this very spot
tired out at last he sat down but when the echoes of the place tempted
him he lifted his drunken mouth to the ceiling and commenced murdering
the songs of menacrates at least that is what we were told by those who
understood his language  some of the guests joined hands and ran around
the edge of the pool making the place ring with their boisterous peals
of laughter others tried to pick rings up from the floor with their
hands tied behind them or else going down upon their knees tried to
touch the ends of their toes by bending backwards  we went down into the
pool while the rest were taking part in such amusements  it was being
heated for trimalchio  when the fumes of the wine had been dissipated
we were conducted into another diningroom where fortunata had laid out
her own treasures i noticed for instance that there were little bronze
fishermen upon the lamps the tables were of solid silver the cups were
porcelain inlaid with gold before our eyes wine was being strained
through a straining cloth  one of my slaves shaves his first beard
today trimalchio remarked at length a promising honest thrifty
lad may he have no bad luck so lets get our skins full and stick
around till morning
chapter the seventyfourth
he had not ceased speaking when a cock crowed  alarmed at this omen
trimalchio ordered wine thrown under the table and told them to sprinkle
the lamps with it and he even went so far as to change his ring from his
left hand to his right  that trumpeter did not sound off without a
reason he remarked theres either a fire in the neighborhood or else
someones going to give up the ghost  i hope its none of us  whoever
brings that jonah in shall have a present  he had no sooner made this
promise than a cock was brought in from somewhere in the neighborhood
and trimalchio ordered the cook to prepare it for the pot  that same
versatile genius who had but a short time before made birds and fish out
of a hog cut it up it was then consigned to the kettle and while
daedalus was taking a long hot drink fortunata ground pepper in a
boxwood mill  when these delicacies had been consumed trimalchio looked
the slaves over  you havent had anything to eat yet have you  he
asked  get out and let another relay come on duty  thereupon a second
relay came in  farewell gaius cried those going off duty and hail
gaius cried those coming on  our hilarity was somewhat dampened soon
after for a boy who was by no means bad looking came in among the
fresh slaves  trimalchio seized him and kissed him lingeringly
whereupon fortunata asserting her rights in the house began to rail at
trimalchio styling him an abomination who set no limits to his lechery
finally ending by calling him a dog trimalchio flew into a rage at her
abuse and threw a wine cup at her head whereupon she screeched as if
she had had an eye knocked out and covered her face with her trembling
hands  scintilla was frightened too and shielded the shuddering woman
with her garment  an officious slave presently held a cold water pitcher
to her cheek and fortunata bent over it sobbing and moaning  but as for
trimalchio what the hells next  he gritted out this syrian
dancingwhore dont remember anything  i took her off the auction block
and made her a woman among her equals didnt i  and here she puffs
herself up like a frog and pukes in her own nest shes a blockhead all
right not a woman  but thats the way it is if youre born in an attic
you cant sleep in a palace ill see that this booted cassandras tamed
so help me my genius i will  and i could have married ten million even
if i did only have two cents you know im not lying  let me give you a
tip said agatho the perfumer to the lady next door when he pulled me
aside dont let your line die out  and here ive stuck the ax into my
own leg because i was a damned fool and didnt want to seem fickle  ill
see to it that youre more careful how you claw me up sure as youre
born i will that you may realize how seriously i take what youve done
to mehabinnas i dont want you to put her statue on my tomb for fear
ill be nagged even after im dead  and furthermore that she may know i
can repay a bad turn i wont have her kissing me when im laid out
chapter the seventyfifth
when trimalchio had launched this thunderbolt habinnas commenced to
beg him to control his anger  theres not one of us but goes wrong
sometimes argued he were not gods were men  scintilla also cried
out through her tears calling him gaius and entreating him by his
guardian angel to be mollified  trimalchio could restrain the tears no
longer  habinnas he blubbered as you hope to enjoy your money spit
in my face if ive done anything wrong  i kissed him because hes very
thrifty not because hes a pretty boy  he can recite his division table
and read a book at sight he bought himself a thracian uniform from his
savings from his rations and a stool and two dippers with his own
money too  hes worth my attention aint he  but fortunata wont see
it  aint that the truth you highstepping hussy  let me beg you to
make the best of what youve got you shekite and dont make me show my
teeth my little darling or youll find out what my tempers like
believe me when once ive made up my mind im as fixed as a spike in a
beam  but lets think of the living  i hope youll all make yourselves
at home gentlemen i was in your fix myself once but rose to what i am
now by my own merit  its the brains that makes the man all the rests
bunk  i buy well i sell well someone else will tell you a different
story but as for myself im fairly busting with prosperity  what
gruntingsow still bawling  ill see to it that youve something to
bawl for but as i started to say it was my thrift that brought me to
my fortune  i was just as tall as that candlestick when i came over from
asia every day i used to measure myself by it and i would smear my lips
with oil so my beard would sprout all the sooner  i was my masters
mistress for fourteen years for theres nothing wrong in doing what
your master orders and i satisfied my mistress too during that time
you know what i mean but ill say no more for im not one of your
braggarts
chapter the seventysixth
at last it came about by the will of the gods that i was master in the
house and i had the real master under my thumb then  what is there
left to tell  i was made coheir with caesar and came into a senators
fortune  but nobodys ever satisfied with what hes got so i embarked
in business  i wont keep you long in suspense i built five ships and
loaded them with wineworth its weight in gold it was thenand sent
them to rome  youd think id ordered it so for every last one of them
foundered its a fact no fairy tale about it and neptune swallowed
thirty million sesterces in one day  you dont think i lost my pep do
you  by hercules no  that was only an appetizer for me just as if
nothing at all had happened  i built other and bigger ships better
found too so no one could say i wasnt game  a big ships a big
venture you know  i loaded them up with wine again bacon beans
capuan perfumes and slaves fortunata did the right thing in this
affair too for she sold every piece of jewelry and all her clothes into
the bargain and put a hundred gold pieces in my hand  they were the
nestegg of my fortune  a things soon done when the gods will it
i cleared ten million sesterces by that voyage all velvet and bought
in all the estates that had belonged to my patron right away  i built
myself a house and bought cattle to resell and whatever i touched grew
just like a honeycomb  i chucked the game when i got to have an income
greater than all the revenues of my own country retired from business
and commenced to back freedmen  i never liked business anyhow as far as
that goes and was just about ready to quit when an astrologer a greek
fellow he was and his name was serapa happened to light in our colony
and he slipped me some information and advised me to quit  he was hep to
all the secrets of the gods told me things about myself that id
forgotten and explained everything to me from needle and thread up knew
me inside out he did and only stopped short of telling me what id had
for dinner the day before  youd have thought hed lived with me
always
chapter the seventyseventh
habinnas you were there i think ill leave it to you didnt he say
you took your wife out of a whorehouse youre as lucky in your
friends too no one ever repays your favor with another you own broad
estates you nourish a viper under your wing andwhy shouldnt i tell
iti still have thirty years four months and two days to live  ill
also come into another bequest shortly  thats what my horoscope tells
me  if i can extend my boundaries so as to join apulia ill think ive
amounted to something in this life  i built this house with mercury on
the job anyhow it was a hovel as you know its a palace now  four
diningrooms twenty bedrooms two marble colonnades a storeroom
upstairs a bedroom where i sleep myself a sittingroom for this viper
a very good room for the porter a guestchamber for visitors  as a
matter of fact scaurus when he was here would stay nowhere else
although he has a family place on the seashore  ill show you many other
things too in a jiffy believe me if you have an as youll be rated
at what you have  so your humble servant who was a frog is now a king
stychus bring out my funereal vestments while we wait the ones ill be
carried out in some perfume too and a draught of the wine in that jar
i mean the kind i intend to have my bones washed in
chapter the seventyeighth
it was not long before stychus brought a white shroud and a
purplebordered toga into the diningroom and trimalchio requested us
to feel them and see if they were pure wool then with a smile take
care stychus that the mice dont get at these things and gnaw them or
the moths either  ill burn you alive if they do  i want to be carried
out in all my glory so all the people will wish me well  then opening
a jar of nard he had us all anointed  i hope ill enjoy this as well
when im dead he remarked as i do while im alive  he then ordered
wine to be poured into the punchbowl pretend said he that youre
invited to my funeral feast  the thing had grown positively
nauseating when trimalchio beastly drunk by now bethought himself of
a new and singular diversion and ordered some hornblowers brought into
the diningroom  then propped up by many cushions he stretched
himself out upon the couch  let on that im dead said he and say
something nice about me  the hornblowers sounded off a loud funeral
march together and one in particular a slave belonging to an
undertaker made such a fanfare that he roused the whole neighborhood
and the watch which was patrolling the vicinity thinking trimalchios
house was afire suddenly smashed in the door and rushed in with their
water and axes as is their right raising a rumpus all their own  we
availed ourselves of this happy circumstance and leaving agamemnon in
the lurch we took to our heels as though we were running away from a
real conflagration

volume 3further adventures of encolpius and his companions
chapter the seventyninth
there was no torch to light the way for us as we wandered around nor
did the silence of midnight give promise of our meeting any wayfarer with
a light in addition to this we were drunk and unfamiliar with the
district which would confuse one even in daylight so for the best part
of a mortal hour we dragged our bleeding feet over all the flints and
pieces of broken tile till we were extricated at last by gitons
cleverness  this prudent youngster had been afraid of going astray on
the day before so he had taken care to mark all the pillars and columns
with chalk  these marks stood out distinctly even through the pitchy
night and by their brilliant whiteness pointed out the way for us as we
wandered about  nevertheless we had no less cause for being in a sweat
even when we came to our lodging for the old woman herself had been
sitting and swilling so long with her guests that even if one had set her
afire she would not have known it  we would have spent the night on the
doorsill had not trimalchios courier come up in state with ten wagons
he hammered on the door for a short time and then smashed it in giving
us an entrance through the same breach  hastening to the
sleepingchamber i went to bed with my brother and burning with
passion as i was after such a magnificent dinner i surrendered myself
wholly to sexual gratification
               oh goddesses and gods that purple night
               how soft the couch  and we embracing tight
               with every wandering kiss our souls would meet
               farewell all mortal woes to die were sweet
but my selfcongratulation was premature for i was overcome with wine
and when my unsteady hands relaxed their hold ascyltos that
neverfailing wellspring of iniquity stole the boy away from me in the
night and carried him to his own bed where he wallowed around without
restraint with a brother not his own while the latter not noticing
the fraud or pretending not to notice it went to sleep in a strangers
arms in defiance of all human rights  awaking at last i felt the bed
over and found that it had been despoiled of its treasure then by all
that lovers hold dear i swear i was on the verge of transfixing them
both with my sword and uniting their sleep with death  at last
however i adopted a more rational plan i spanked giton into
wakefulness and glaring at ascyltos since you have broken faith by
this outrage i gritted out with a savage frown and severed our
friendship you had better get your things together at once and pick up
some other bottom for your abominations  he raised no objection to
this but after we had divided everything with scrupulous exactitude
come on now he demanded and well divide the boy
chapter the eightieth
i thought this was a parting joke till he whipped out his sword with a
murderous hand  youll not have this prize youre brooding over all to
yourself  since ive been rejected ill have to cut off my share with
this sword  i followed suit on my side and wrapping a mantle around
my left arm i put myself on guard for the duel  the unhappy boy
rendered desperate by our unreasoning fury hugged each of us tightly by
the knee and in tears he humbly begged that this wretched lodginghouse
should not witness a theban duel and that we would not pollutewith
mutual bloodshed the sacred rites of a friendship that was as yet
unstained  if a crime must be committed he wailed here is my naked
throat turn your swords this way and press home the points  i ought to
be the one to die i broke the sacred pledge of friendship  we lowered
our points at these entreaties  ill settle this dispute ascyltos
spoke up let the boy follow whomsoever he himself wishes to follow
in that way he at least will have perfect freedom in choosing a
brother  imagining that a relationship of such long standing had
passed into a tie of blood i was not at all uneasy so i snatched at
this proposition with precipitate eagerness and submitted the dispute to
the judge  he did not deliberate long enough to seem even to hesitate
for he got up and chose ascyltos for a brother as soon as the last
syllable had passed my lips  at this decision i was thunderstruck
and threw myself upon the bed unarmed and just as i stood  had i not
begrudged my enemy such a triumph i would have laid violent hands upon
myself  flushed with success ascyltos marched out with his prize and
abandoned in a strange town a comrade in the depths of despair one
whom but a little while before he had loved most unselfishly one whose
destiny was so like his own
     as long as is expedient the name of friendship lives
     just as in dicing fortune smiles or lowers
     when good luck beckons then your friend his gleeful service gives
     but basely flies when ruin oer you towers
     the strollers act their farces upon the stage each one his part
     the father son the rich man all are here
     but soon the page is turned upon the comic actors art
     the masque is dropped the makeups disappear
chapter the eightyfirst
nevertheless i did not indulge myself very long in tears being afraid
that menelaus the tutor might drop in upon me all alone in the
lodginghouse and catch me in the midst of my troubles so i collected my
baggage and with a heavy heart sneaked off to an obscure quarter near
the seashore  there i kept to my room for three days  my mind was
continually haunted by my loneliness and desertion and i beat my breast
already sore from blows  why could not the earth have opened and
swallowed me i wailed aloud between the many deepdrawn groans or
the sea which rages even against the guiltless  did i flee from
justice murder my ghost and cheat the arena in order that after so
many proofs of courage i might be left lying here deserted a beggar and
an exile in a lodginghouse in a greek town  and who condemned me to
this desolation  a boy stained by every form of vice who by his own
confession ought to be exiled free through vice expert in vice whose
favors came through a throw of the dice who hired himself out as a girl
to those who knew him to be a boy  and as to the other what about him
in place of the manly toga he donned the womans stola when he reached
the age of puberty he resolved even from his mothers womb never to
become a man in the slaves prison he took the womans part in the
sexual act he changed the instrument of his lechery when he
doublecrossed me abandoned the ties of a longstanding friendship
and shame upon him sold everything for a single nights dalliance
like any other streetwalker  now the lovers lie whole nights locked
in each others arms and i suppose they make a mockery of my desolation
when they are resting up from the exhaustion caused by their mutual
excesses  but not with impunity  if i dont avenge the wrong they have
done me in their guilty blood im no free man
chapter the eightysecond
i girded on my sword when i had said these words and fortifying my
strength with a heavy meal so that weakness would not cause me to lose
the battle i presently sallied forth into the public streets and rushed
through all the arcades like a maniac  but while with my face savagely
convulsed in a frown i was meditating nothing but bloodshed and
slaughter and was continually clapping my hand to the hilt of my sword
which i had consecrated to this i was observed by a soldier that is he
either was a real soldier or else he was some nightprowling thug who
challenged me  halt  who goes there  what legion are you from  whos
your centurion  since when have men in your outfit gone on pass in
white shoes  he retorted when i had lied stoutly about both centurion
and legion  both my face and my confusion proved that i had been caught
in a lie so he ordered me to surrender my arms and to take care that i
did not get into trouble  i was held up as a matter of course and my
revenge balked i returned to my lodginghouse and recovering by degrees
from my fright i began to be grateful to the boldness of the footpad
it is not wise to place much reliance upon any scheme because fortune
has a method of her own
chapter the eightythird
nevertheless i found it very difficult to stifle my longing for
revenge and after tossing half the night in anxiety i arose at dawn
and in the hope of mitigating my mental sufferings and of forgetting my
wrongs i took a walk through all the public arcades and entered a
picturegallery which contained a wonderful collection of pictures in
various styles  i beheld works from the hand of zeuxis still undimmed
by the passage of the years and contemplated not without a certain awe
the crude drawings of protogenes which equalled the reality of nature
herself but when i stood before the work of apelles the kind which the
greeks call monochromatic verily i almost worshipped for the
outlines of the figures were drawn with such subtlety of touch and were
so lifelike in their precision that you would have thought their very
souls were depicted  here an eagle was soaring into the sky bearing the
shepherd of mount ida to heaven there the comely hylas was struggling
to escape from the embrace of the lascivious naiad  here too was
apollo cursing his murderous hand and adorning his unstrung lyre with
the flower just created  standing among these lovers which were only
painted it seems that even the gods are wracked by love i cried
aloud as if i were in a wilderness  jupiter could find none to his
taste even in his own heaven so he had to sin on earth but no one was
betrayed by him  the nymph who ravished hylas would have controlled her
passion had she thought hercules was coming to forbid it  apollo
recalled the spirit of a boy in the form of a flower and all the lovers
of fable enjoyed loves embraces without a rival but i took as a comrade
a friend more cruel than lycurgus  but at that very instant as i was
telling my troubles to the winds a whitehaired old man entered the
picturegallery his face was careworn and he seemed i know not why
to give promise of something great although he bestowed so little care
upon his dress that it was easily apparent that he belonged to that class
of literati which the wealthy hold in contempt  i am a poet he
remarked when he had approached me and stood at my side and one of no
mean ability i hope that is if anything is to be inferred from the
crowns which gratitude can place even upon the heads of the unworthy
then why you demand are you dressed so shabbily  for that very reason
love or art never yet made anyone rich
          the trader trusts his fortune to the sea and takes his gains
             the warrior for his deeds is girt with gold
          the wily sycophant lies drunk on purple counterpanes
             young wives must pay debauchees or theyre cold
          but solitary shivering in tatters genius stands
             invoking a neglected art for succor at its hands
chapter the eightyfourth
it is certainly true that a man is hated when he declares himself an
enemy to all vice and begins to follow the right road in life because
in the first place his habits are different from those of other people
for who ever approved of anything to which he took exceptions  then
they whose only ambition is to pile up riches dont want to believe that
men can possess anything better than that which they have themselves
therefore they use every means in their power to so buffet the lovers
of literature that they will seem in their proper placebelow the
moneybags  i know not why it should be so i said with a sigh but
poverty is the sister of genius  you have good reason the old man
replied to deplore the status of men of letters  no i answered
that was not the reason for my sigh there is another and far weightier
cause for my grief  then in accordance with the human propensity of
pouring ones personal troubles into anothers ears i explained my
misfortune to him and dwelt particularly upon ascyltos perfidy  oh
how i wish that this enemy who is the cause of my enforced continence
could be mollified i cried with many a groan but he is an old hand
at robbery and more cunning than the pimps themselves  my frankness
pleased the old man who attempted to comfort me and to beguile my
sorrow he related the particulars of an amorous intrigue in which he
himself had played a part
chapter the eightyfifth
when i was attached to the quaestors staff in asia i was quartered
with a family at pergamus  i found things very much to my liking there
not only on account of the refined comfort of my apartments but also
because of the extreme beauty of my hosts son  for the latter reason
i had recourse to strategy in order that the father should never suspect
me of being a seducer  so hotly would i flare up whenever the abuse
of handsome boys was even mentioned at the table and with such
uncompromising sternness would i protest against having my ears insulted
by such filthy talk that i came to be looked upon especially by the
mother as one of the philosophers  i was conducting the lad to the
gymnasium before very long and superintending his conduct taking
especial care all the while that no one who could debauch him should
ever enter the house  then there came a holiday the school was closed
and our festivities had rendered us too lazy to retire properly so we
lay down in the diningroom  it was just about midnight and i knew he
was awake so i murmured this vow in a very low voice oh lady venus
could i but kiss this lad and he not know it i would give him a pair of
turtledoves tomorrow  on hearing the price offered for this favor the
boy commenced to snore  then bending over the pretending sleeper i
snatched a fleeting kiss or two  satisfied with this beginning i arose
early in the morning brought a fine pair of turtledoves to the eager
lad and absolved myself from my vow
chapter the eightysixth
next night when the same opportunity presented itself i changed my
petition if i can feel him all over with a wanton hand i vowed and
he not know it i will give him two of the gamest fightingcocks for his
silence the lad nestled closer to me of his own accord on hearing this
offer and i truly believe that he was afraid that i was asleep  i made
short work of his apprehensions on that score however by stroking and
fondling his whole body  i worked myself into a passionate fervor that
was just short of supreme gratification  then when day dawned i made
him happy with what i had promised him  when the third night gave me
my chance i bent close to the ear of the rascal who pretended to be
asleep  immortal gods i whispered if i can take full and complete
satisfaction of my love from this sleeping beauty i will tomorrow
present him with the best macedonian pacer in the market in return for
this bliss provided that he does not know it  never had the lad slept
so soundly  first i filled my hands with his snowy breasts then i
pressed a clinging kiss upon his mouth but i finally focused all my
energies upon one supreme delight  early in the morning he sat up in
bed awaiting my usual gift  it is much easier to buy doves and
gamecocks than it is to buy a pacer as you know and aside from that
i was also afraid that so valuable a present might render my motive
subject to suspicion so after strolling around for some hours i
returned to the house and gave the lad nothing at all except a kiss
he looked all around threw his arms about my neck  tell me master
he cried wheres the pacer the difficulty of getting one fine
enough has compelled me to defer the fulfillment of my promise i
replied but i will make it good in a few days the lad easily
understood the true meaning of my answer and his countenance betrayed
his secret resentment
chapter the eightyseventh
in the meantime by breaking this vow i had cut myself off from the
avenue of access which i had contrived but i returned to the attack all
the same when the opportunity came  in a few days a similar occasion
brought about the very same conditions as before and the instant i heard
his father snoring i began pleading with the lad to receive me again
into his good graces that is to say that he ought to suffer me to
satisfy myself with him and he in turn could do whatever his own
distended member desired  he was very angry however and would say
nothing at all except either you go to sleep or ill call father
but no obstacle is so difficult that depravity cannot twist around it and
even while he threatened ill call father i slipped into his bed and
took my pleasure in spite of his halfhearted resistance  nor was he
displeased with my improper conduct for although he complained for a
while that he had been cheated and made a laughingstock and that his
companions to whom he had bragged of his wealthy friend had made sport
of him  but youll see that ill not be like you he whispered do it
again if you want to  all misunderstandings were forgotten and i was
readmitted into the lads good graces  then i slipped off to sleep
after profiting by his complaisance  but the youth in the very flower
of maturity and just at the best age for passive pleasure was by no
means satisfied with only one repetition so he roused me out of a heavy
sleep  isnt there something youd like to do he whispered  the
pastime had not begun to cloy as yet and somehow or other what with
panting and sweating and wriggling he got what he wanted and worn out
with pleasure i dropped off to sleep again less than an hour had passed
when he began to punch me with his hand why are we not busy he
whispered  i flew into a violent rage at being disturbed so many times
and threatened him in his own words either you go to sleep or ill
call father
chapter the eightyeighth
heartened up by this story i began to draw upon his more comprehensive
knowledge as to the ages of the pictures and as to certain of the stories
connected with them upon which i was not clear and i likewise inquired
into the causes of the decadence of the present age in which the most
refined arts had perished and among them painting which had not left
even the faintest trace of itself behind greed of money he replied
has brought about these unaccountable changes  in the good old times
when virtue was her own reward the fine arts flourished and there was
the keenest rivalry among men for fear that anything which could be of
benefit to future generations should remain long undiscovered  then it
was that democritus expressed the juices of all plants and spent his
whole life in experiments in order that no curative property should lurk
unknown in stone or shrub  that he might understand the movements of
heaven and the stars eudoxus grew old upon the summit of a lofty
mountain three times did chrysippus purge his brain with hellebore
that his faculties might be equal to invention  turn to the sculptors if
you will lysippus perished from hunger while in profound meditation upon
the lines of a single statue and myron who almost embodied the souls of
men and beasts in bronze could not find an heir  and we sodden with
wine and women cannot even appreciate the arts already practiced we
only criticise the past we learn only vice and teach it too  what has
become of logic of astronomy  where is the exquisite road to wisdom
who even goes into a temple to make a vow that he may achieve eloquence
or bathe in the fountain of wisdom  and they do not pray for good health
and a sound mind before they even set foot upon the threshold of the
temple one promises a gift if only he may bury a rich relative another
if he can but dig up a treasure and still another if he is permitted to
amass thirty millions of sesterces in safety  the senate itself the
exponent of all that should be right and just is in the habit of
promising a thousand pounds of gold to the capitol and that no one may
question the propriety of praying for money it even decorates jupiter
himself with spoils  do not hesitate therefore at expressing your
surprise at the deterioration of painting since by all the gods and men
alike a lump of gold is held to be more beautiful than anything ever
created by those crazy little greek fellows apelles and phydias
chapter the eightyninth
but i see that your whole attention is held by that picture which
portrays the destruction of troy so i will attempt to unfold the story
in verse
and now the tenth harvest beheld the beleaguered of troia
worn out with anxiety fearing the honor of calchas
the prophet hung wavering deep in the blackest despair
apollo commanded  the forested peaks of mount ida
were felled and dragged down the hewn timbers were fitted to fashion
a warhorse  unfilled is a cavity left and this cavern
roofed over capacious enough for a camp  here lie hidden
the raging impetuous valor of ten years of warfare
malignant greek troops pack the recess lurk in their own offering
alas my poor country  we thought that their thousand grim warships
were beaten and scattered our arable lands freed from warfare
th inscription cut into the horse and the crafty behavior
of sinon his mind ever powerful for evil affirmed it
delivered from war now the crowd carefree hastens to worship
and pours from the portals  their cheeks wet with weeping the joy
of their tremulous souls brings to eyes tears which terror
had banished  laocoon priest unto neptune with hair loosed
an outcry evoked from the mob he drew back his javelin
and launched it  the belly of wood was his target  the weapon
recoiled for the fates stayed his hand and this artifice won us
his feeble hand nerved he anew and the lofty sides sounded
his twoedged ax tried them severely  the young troops in ambush
gasped  and as long as the reverberations reechoed
the wooden mass breathed out a fear that was not of its own
imprisoned the warriors advance to take troia a captive
and finish the struggle by strategem new and unheard of
behold  other portents where tenedos steep breaks the ocean
where great surging billows dash high to be broken and leap back
to form a deep hollow of calm and resemble the plashing
of oars carried far through the silence of night as when ships pass
and drive through the calm as it smashes against their fir bows
then backward we look towards the rocks the tide carries two serpents
that coil and uncoil as they come and their breasts which are swollen
aside dash the foam as the bows of tall ships and the ocean
is lashed by their tails their manes free on the water as savage
as even their eyes now a blinding beam kindles the billows
the sea with their hissing is sibilant  all stare in terror
laocoons twin sons in phrygian raiment are standing
with priests wreathed for sacrifice  them did the glistening serpents
enfold in their coils  with their little hands shielding their faces
the boys neither thinking of self but each one of his brother
fraternal loves sacrifice  death himself slew those poor children
by means of their unselfish fear for each other  the father
a helper too feeble now throws himself prone on their bodies
the serpents now glutted with death coil around him and drag him
to earth  and the priest at his altar a victim lies beating
the ground  thus the city of troy doomed to sack and destruction
first lost her own gods by profaning their shrines and their worship
the full moon now lifted her luminous beam and the small stars
led forth with her torch all ablaze when the greeks drew the bolts
and poured forth their warriors on priams sons buried in darkness
and sodden with wine  first the leaders made trial of their weapons
just as the horse when unhitched from thessalian neckyoke
first tosses his head and his mane ere to pasture he rushes
they draw their swords brandish their shields and rush into the battle
one slays the winedrunken trojans prolonging their dreams
to death which ends all  still another takes brands from the altars
and calls upon troys sacred temples to fight against trojans
chapter the nintieth
some of the public who were loafing in the portico threw stones at the
reciting eumolpus and he taking note of this tribute to his genius
covered his head and bolted out of the temple  fearing they might take
me for a poet too i followed after him in his flight and came to the
seashore where we stopped as soon as we were out of range  tell me
 i demanded what are you going to do about that disease of yours
youve loafed with me less than two hours and youve talked more often
like a poet than you have like a human being  for this reason im not
at all surprised that the rabble chases you with rocks  im going to
load my pockets with stones too and whenever you begin to go out of
your head im going to let blood out of it  his expression changed
my dear young man said he today is not the first time i have had
such compliments showered upon me the audience always applauds me in
this fashion when i go into the theatre to recite anything but ill
abstain from this sort of diet for the whole day for fear of having
trouble with you  good i replied well dine together if youll
swear off crankiness for the day  so saying i gave the housekeeper
the orders for our little supper and we went straight off to the baths
chapter the ninetyfirst
there i catch sight of giton laden with towels and scrapers leaning
downhearted and embarrassed against the wall  you could see that he did
not serve of his own free will  then that i might assure myself that i
saw aright take pity on me brother he cried turning towards me a
face lighted up with joy there are no arms here i can speak freely
take me away from that bloody robber and punish your penitent judge as
severely as you like  to have perished should you wish it will be a
consolation great enough in my misery  fearing some one might overhear
our plans i bade him hush his complaints and leaving eumolpus behind
for he was reciting a poem in the bathi pull giton down a dark and
dirty passage after me and fly with all speed to my lodgings  arriving
there i slam the door shut embrace him convulsively and press my face
against his which is all wet with tears  for a long time neither of us
could find his voice and as for the lad his shapely bosom was heaving
continuously with choking sobs  oh the disgraceful inconsistency of it
all i cried for i love you still although you abandoned me and no
scar from that gaping wound is left upon this breast  what can you say
that will justify you in yielding your love to a stranger  did i merit
such an affront  he held his head higher when he found that he was
loved
          for one to love and at the same time blame
          that were a labor hercules to tame
          conflicting passions yield in cupids name
and furthermore i went on i was not the one that laid the cause of
our love before another judge but i will complain no more i will
remember nothing if you will prove your penitence by keeping faith
 he wiped his face upon his mantle while i poured out these words with
groans and tears  encolpius said he i beseech you i appeal to your
honest recollection did i leave you or did you throw me over  for my
part i admit and openly at that that i sought refuge with the
stronger when i beheld two armed men  i kissed that bosom so full of
prudence threw my arms around his neck and pressed him tightly against
my breast that he might see unmistakably that he had gotten back into my
good graces and that our friendship lived again in perfect confidence
chapter the ninetysecond
night had fallen by this time and the woman to whom i had given my order
had prepared supper when eumolpus knocked at the door  how many of you
are there  i called out and as i spoke i peeped cautiously through a
chink in the door to see if ascyltos had come with him then as i
perceived that he was the only guest i quickly admitted him  he threw
himself upon the pallet and caught sight of giton waiting table
whereupon he nodded his head i like your ganymede he remarked
this day promises a good ending  i did not take kindly to such an
inquisitive beginning fearing that i had let another ascyltos into my
lodging  eumolpus stuck to his purpose  i like you better than the
whole bathful he remarked when the lad had served him with wine then
he thirstily drained the cup dry and swore that never before had he
tasted a wine with such a satisfying tang to it  while i was bathing
 he went on i was almost beaten up for trying to recite a poem to the
people sitting around the basin and when i had been thrown out of the
baths just like i was out of the theatre i hunted through every nook
and cranny of the building calling encolpius encolpius at the top of
my voice  a naked youth at the other end who had lost his clothes was
bawling just as loudly and no less angrily for giton  as for myself the
slaves took me for a maniac and mimicked me in the most insolent manner
but a large crowd gathered around him clapping its hands in awestruck
admiration for so heavy and massive were his private parts that you
would have thought that the man himself was but an appendage of his own
member  oh such a man  he could do his bit all right  i havent a
doubt but that he could begin on the day before and never finish till the
day after the next  and he soon found a friend of course some roman
knight or other i dont know his name but he bears a bad reputation so
they say threw his own mantle around the wanderer and took him off home
with himself hoping i suppose to have the sole enjoyment of so huge a
prize  but i couldnt get my own clothing back from the officious bath
attendant till i found some one who could identify me which only goes to
show that it is more profitable to rub up the member than it is to polish
the mind  while eumolpus was relating all this i changed countenance
continually elated naturally at the mishaps of my enemy and vexed at
his good fortune but i controlled my tongue nevertheless as if i knew
nothing about the episode and read aloud the bill of fare  hardly had
i finished when our humble meal was served  the food was plain but
succulent and nutritious and the famished scholar eumolpus fell to
ravenously
     kind providence unto our needs has tempered its decrees
        and met our wants our carping plaints to still
     green herbs and berries hanging on their rough and brambly sprays
        suffice our hungers gnawing pangs to kill
     what fool would thirst upon a rivers brink  or stand and freeze
        in icy blasts when near a cozy fire
     the law sits armed outside the door adulterers to seize
        the chaste bride guiltless gratifies desire
     all nature lavishes her wealth to meet our just demands
     but spurred by lust of pride we stop at naught to gain our ends
our philosopher began to moralize when he had gorged himself leveling
many critical shafts at those who hold everyday things in contempt
esteeming nothing except what is rare
chapter the ninetythird
to their perverted taste he went on everything one may have
lawfully is held cheap and the appetite tickled only by forbidden
indulgences delights in what is most difficult to obtain
     the pheasant from colchis the wildfowl from african shores
     because they are dainties the parvenus palate adores
     the whitefeathered goose and the duck in his brightcolored plumes
     must nourish the rabble theyre common so them fashion dooms
     the wrasse brought from dangerous syrtis is much more esteemed
     when fishingboats founder  and even the mullet is deemed
     no matter how heavy a weight on the market  the whore
     displaces the wife and in perfumes the cinnamon more
     is esteemed than the rose  so whatever we have we despise
     and whatever we have not we think a superlative prize
is this the way in which you keep your promise not to recite a single
verse today  i demanded bear in mind your promise and spare us at
least for we have thrown no rocks at you yet  if a single one of those
fellows drinking under this very roof were to smell out a poet in their
midst he would arouse the whole neighborhood and involve all of us in
the same misunderstanding  giton who was one of the gentlest of lads
took me to task for having spoken in that manner denying that i did
rightly in criticising my elders and at the same time forgetting my
duties as host by offering an affront to one whom i had invited out of
kindness  and much more full of moderation and propriety which was in
exquisite keeping with his good looks
chapter the ninetyfourth
happy the mother cried eumolpus who bore such a son as you  may
your fortune be in keeping with your merit beauty and wisdom are rarely
found mixed  and that you may not think that all your words are wasted
know that you have found a lover  i will fill my verses with your
praise  i will act as your guardian and your tutor following you even
when you bid me stay behind  nor can encolpius take offense he loves
another  the soldier who took my sword from me did eumolpus a good
turn too otherwise the rage which i had felt against ascyltos would
have been quenched in the blood of eumolpus seeing what was in the wind
giton slipped out of the room pretending he was going after water and
by this diplomatic retreat he put an end to my fury  then as my anger
cooled little by little eumolpus i said rather than have you
entertain designs of such a nature i would even prefer to have you
spouting poetry  i am hottempered and you are lecherous see how
uncongenial two such dispositions must be  take me for a maniac humor
my malady in other words get out quick  taken completely aback by
this onslaught eumolpus crossed the threshold of the room without
stopping to ask the reason for my wrath and immediately slammed the door
shut penning me in as i was not looking for any move of that kind then
having quickly removed the key he hurried away in search of giton
finding that i was locked in i decided to hang myself and had already
fastened my belt to the bedstead which stood alongside of the wall and
was engaged in fastening the noose around my neck when the doors were
unlocked and eumolpus came in with giton recalling me to light when i
was just about to turn the fatal goalpost  giton was greatly wrought up
and his grief turned to fury seizing me with both hands he threw me
upon the bed  if you think encolpius he shrieked that you can
contrive to die before i do youre wrong  i thought of suicide first
i hunted for a sword in ascyltos house i would have thrown myself from
a precipice if i had not found you  you know that death is never far
from those who seek him so take your turn and witness the spectacle you
wished to see  so saying he snatched a razor from eumolpus servant
slashed his throat once twice and fell down at our feet  i uttered a
loud cry rushed to him as he fell and sought the road to death by the
same steel giton however showed not the faintest trace of any wound
nor was i conscious of feeling any pain  the razor it turned out was
untempered and dull and was used to imbue boy apprentices with the
confidence of the experienced barber  hence it was in a sheath and for
the reason given above the servant was not alarmed when the blade was
snatched nor did eumolpus break in upon this farcical death scene
chapter the ninetyfifth
the landlord made his appearance with a part of our little supper while
this lovers comedy was being enacted and taking in the very disorderly
spectacle which we presented lying there and wallowing as we were
are you drunk he demanded or are you runaway slaves or both
who turned up that bed there  whats the meaning of all  these sneaking
preparations  you didnt want to pay the roomrent you didnt by
hercules you didnt you wanted to wait till night and run away into the
public streets but that wont go here  this is no widows joint ill
show you that not yet it aint  this place belongs  to marcus
manicius  so you threaten do you  yelled eumolpus giving the
fellow a resounding slap in the face  at this the latter threw a small
earthenware pitcher which had been emptied by the draughts of successive
guests at eumolpus head and cut open the forehead of his cursing
adversary then he skipped out of the room  infuriated at such an
insult eumolpus snatched up a wooden candlestick ran in pursuit of his
retreating foeman and avenged his broken head with a shower of blows
the entire household crowded around as did a number of drunken lodgers
but i seized this opportunity of retaliating and locked eumolpus out
retorting his own trick upon the quarrelsome fellow and found myself
without a rival as it were able to enjoy my room and my nights
pleasure as well  in the meantime eumolpus locked out as he was
was being very roughly handled by the cooks and scullions of the
establishment one aimed a spitful of hissinghot guts at his eyes
another grabbed a twotined fork in the pantry and put himself on guard
but worst of all a bleareyed old hag girded round with a filthy apron
and wearing wooden clogs which were not mates dragged in an immense dog
on a chain and sicked him upon eumolpus but he beat off all attacks
with his candlestick
chapter the ninetysixth
we took in the entire performance through a hole in the foldingdoors
this had been made but a short time before when the handle had been
broken and jerked out and i wished him joy of his beating  giton
however forgetting everything except his own compassion thought we
ought to open the door and succor eumolpus in his peril but being still
angry i could not restrain my hand clenching my fist i rapped his
pitying head with my sharp knuckles  in tears he sat upon the bed
while i applied each eye in turn to the opening filling myself up as
with a dainty dish with eumolpus misfortunes and gloating over their
prolongation when bargates agent for the building called from his
dinner was carried into the midst of the brawl by two chairmen for he
had the gout  he carried on for some time against drunkards and fugitive
slaves in a savage tone and with a barbarous accent and then looking
around and catching sight of eumolpus what he exclaimed are you
here nay prince of poets and these damned slaves dont scatter at once
and stop their brawling  then whispering in eumolpus ear my
bedfellows got an idea that shes finerhaired than i am lampoon her
in a poem if you think anything of me and make er ashamed
chapter the ninetyseventh
eumolpus was speaking privately with bargates when a crier attended by a
public slave entered the inn accompanied by a mediumsized crowd of
outsiders  waving a torch that gave out more smoke than light he
announced strayed from the baths a short time ago a boy about sixteen
years of age curly headed a minion handsome answers to the name of
giton  one thousand sesterces reward will be paid to anyone bringing him
back or giving information as to his whereabouts  ascyltos dressed in
a tunic of many colors stood not far from the crier holding out a
silver tray upon which was piled the reward as evidence of good faith
i ordered giton to get under the bed immediately telling him to stick
his hands and feet through the rope netting which supported the mattress
and just as ulysses of old had clung to the ram so he stretched out
beneath the mattress would evade the hands of the hunters  and giton
did not hesitate at obeying this order but fastened his hands in the
netting for a moment outdoing ulysses in his own cunning  for fear of
leaving room for suspicion i piled covers upon my pallet leaving the
impression of a single person of my own stature  meanwhile ascyltos in
company with the magistrates servant had ransacked all the rooms and
had come at last to mine where he entertained greater hopes of success
because he found the doors carefully barred  the public slave loosened
the bolts by inserting the edge of his ax in the chink  i threw myself
at ascyltos feet begging him by the memory of our friendship and our
companionship in suffering to show me my brother safe and sound and
furthermore that my simulated prayers might carry conviction i added
i know very well ascyltos that you have come here seeking  my  life
if not  why  the axes
well fatten your grudge then  heres my neck  pour out that blood
you seek to shed under pretext of a search  ascyltos repelled this
suspicion affirming that he sought nothing except his own fugitive and
desired the death of neither man nor suppliant and least of all did he
wish to harm one whom now that their quarrel was over he regarded as
his dearest friend
chapter the ninetyeighth
the public servant however was not derelict in the performance of his
duty for snatching a cane from the innkeeper he poked underneath the
bed ransacking every corner even to the cracks in the wall  twisting
his body out of reach and cautiously drawing a full breath giton
pressed his mouth against the very bugs themselves the pair had
scarcely left the room when eumolpus burst in in great excitement for
the doors had been broken and could keep no one out the thousand
sesterces are mine he shouted ill follow that crier out and tell him
giton is in your power and it will serve you right too  seeing that
his mind was made up i embraced his knees and besought him not to kill a
dying man  you might have some reason for being excited i said if
you could produce the missing boy but you cannot as the thing stands
now for he escaped into the crowd and i have not even a suspicion as to
where he has gone  get the lad back eumolpus for heavens sake even
if you do restore him to ascyltos i had just succeeded in persuading
him to believe all this when giton nearly suffocated from holding his
breath suddenly sneezed three times and shook the bed  eumolpus turned
at the commotion  hello giton he exclaimed glad to see you  then
he turned back the mattress and discovered an ulysses who even a ravenous
cyclops might have spared thereupon he faced me you robber said he
what does all this mean you hadnt the nerve to tell me the truth even
when you were caught  if the god that umpires human affairs hadnt
forced a sign from this boy as he hung there i would be wandering from
one pothouse to another like a fool  but giton was far more tactful
than i first of all he dressed the cut upon eumolpus forehead with
spiders web soaked in oil he then exchanged the poets torn clothing
for his own cloak this done he embraced the old gentleman who was
already somewhat mollified and poulticed him with kisses  dearest of
fathers he cried we are entirely in your hands  in yours alone  if
you love your giton do your best to save him  would that some cruel
flame might devour me alone or that the wintry sea might swallow me
for i am the cause for all these crimes  two enemies would be reconciled
if i should perish  moved by our troubles but particularly stirred by
gitons caresses you are fools exclaimed eumolpus you certainly
are here you are gifted with talents enough to make your fortunes and
you still lead a life of misery and every day you bring new torments
upon yourselves as the fruits of your own acts

          leave then thy home and seek a foreign shore
          brave youth for thee thy destiny holds more
          to no misfortune yield  the danube far
          shall know thy spirit and the polar star
          and placid nile and they who dwell in lands
          where sunrise starts or they where sunset ends
          a new ulysses treads on foreign sands
to me this advice seemed both sound and practical because it would
free me from any annoyance by ascyltos and because it gave promise of a
happier life  i was overcome by the kindly sympathy of eumolpus and was
especially sorry for the latest injury i had done him  i began to repent
my jealousy which had been the cause of so many unpleasant happenings
and with many tears i begged and pled with him to admit me into favor
as lovers cannot control their furious jealousy and vowing at the same
time that i would not by word or deed give him cause for offense in the
future  and he like a learned and cultivated gentleman ought to remove
all irritation from his mind and leave no trace of it behind  the snows
belong upon the ground in wild and uncultivated regions but where the
earth has been beautified by the conquest of the plough the light snow
melts away while you speak of it  and so it is with anger in the heart
in savage minds it lingers long it glides quickly away from the
cultured  that you may experience the truth of what you say exclaimed
eumolpus see  i end my anger with a kiss  may good luck go with us
get your baggage together and follow me or go on ahead if you prefer
 while he was speaking a knock sounded at the door and a sailor with a
bristling beard stood upon the threshold  youre hanging in the wind
eumolpus said he as if you didnt know that sonofabitch of a
skipper  without further delay we all got up  eumolpus ordered his
servant who had been asleep for some time to bring his baggage out
giton and i pack together whatever we have for the voyage and after
praying to the stars we went aboard
chapter the one hundredth
we picked out a retired spot on the poop and eumolpus dozed off as it
was not yet daylight  neither giton nor myself could get a wink of
sleep however  anxiously i reflected that i had received eumolpus as a
comrade a rival more formidable than ascyltos and that thought tortured
me  but reason soon put my uneasiness to flight  it is unfortunate
 said i to myself that the lad has so taken our friends fancy but
what of it  is not natures every masterpiece common to all  the sun
shines upon all alike  the moon with her innumerable train of stars
lights even the wild beasts to their food  what can be more beautiful
than water
yet it flows for common use  shall love alone then be stolen rather
than be regarded as a prize to be won  no indeed i desire no possession
unless the world envies me for possessing it  a solitary old man can
scarcely become a serious rival even should he wish to take advantage
he would lose it through lack of breath  when but without any
confidence i had arrived at these conclusions and beguiled my uneasy
spirit i covered my head with my tunic and began to feign sleep when
all of a sudden as though fortune were bent upon annihilating my peace
of mind a voice upon the ships deck gritted out something like this
so he fooled me after allas this voice which was a mans and was
only too familiar struck my ears my heart fluttered  and then a woman
equally furious spat out more spitefully stillif only some god would
put giton into my hands what a fine time i would give that runaway
 stunned by these unexpected words we both turned pale as death  i was
completely terrified and as though i were enveloped in some turbulent
nightmare was a long time finding my voice but at last with trembling
hands i tugged at the hem of eumolpus clothing just as he was sinking
into slumber  father i quavered on your word of honor can you tell
me whose ship this is and whom she has aboard  peeved at being
disturbed so he snapped this was the reason you wished to have us
quartered in the most inaccessible spot on deck was it  so we could get
no rest  what good will it do you when ive informed you that lycas of
tarentum is master of this ship and that he carries tryphaena as an exile
to tarentum
chapter the one hundred and first
i shivered horrorstruck at this thunderbolt and beating my throat
oh destiny i wailed youve vanquished me completely at last  as
for giton he fell in a faint upon my bosom and remained unconscious for
quite a while until a sweat finally relieved our tension whereupon
hugging eumolpus around the knees take pity upon the perishing i
besought him in the name of our common learning aid us  death himself
hangs over us and he will come as a relief unless you help us
 overwhelmed by this implication eumolpus swore by all the gods and
goddesses that he knew nothing of what had happened nor had he had any
ulterior purpose in mind but that he had brought his companions upon
this voyage which he himself had long intended taking with the most
upright intentions and in the best of good faith  but demanded he
what is this ambush  who is this hannibal who sails with us  lycas of
tarentum is a most respectable citizen and the owner not only of this
ship which he commands in person but of landed estates as well as
commercial houses under the management of slaves  he carries a cargo
consigned to market  he is the cyclops the archpirate to whom we owe
our passage  and then besides himself there is tryphaena a most
charming woman travelling about here and there in search of pleasure
 but objected giton they are the very ones we are most anxious to
avoid whereupon he explained to the astonished eumolpus the reasons for
their enmity and for the danger which threatened us  so muddled did he
become at what had been told him that he lost the power of thinking
and requested each of us to offer his own opinion  just imagine said
he that we are trapped in the cyclops cave some way out must be
found unless we bring about a shipwreck and free ourselves from all
dangers  bribe the pilot if necessary and persuade him to steer the
ship into some port volunteered giton tell him your brothers nearly
dead from seasickness your woebegone face and streaming tears will lend
color to your deception and the pilot may be moved to mercy and grant
your prayer  eumolpus denied the practicability of this  it is only
with difficulty affirmed he that large ships are warped into
landlocked harbors nor would it appear probable that my brother could
have been taken so desperately in so short a time  and then lycas will
be sure to want to visit a sick passenger as part of his duties  you
can see for yourselves what a fine stroke it would be bringing the
captain to his own runaways  but supposing that the ship could be put
off her course supposing that lycas did not hold sickcall how could we
leave the ship in such a manner as not to be stared at by all the rest
with muffled heads  with bare  if muffled who would not want to lend
the sick man a hand  if bare what would it mean if not proscribing
ourselves
chapter the one hundred and second
why would it not be better to take refuge in boldness i asked slide
down a rope into the ships boat cut the painter and leave the rest to
luck  and furthermore i would not involve eumolpus in this adventure
for what is the good of getting an innocent man into troubles with which
he has no concern  i shall be well content if chance helps us into the
boat  not a bad scheme eumolpus agreed if it could only be carried
out but who could help seeing you when you start  especially the man at
the helm who stands watch all night long and observes even the motions
of the stars  but it could be done in spite of that when he dozed off
for a second that is if you chose some other part of the ship from
which to start as it is it must be the stern you must even slip down
the rudder itself for that is where the painter that holds the boat in
tow is made fast  and there is still something else encolpius  i am
surprised that it has not occurred to you that one sailor is on watch
lying in the boat night and day  you couldnt get rid of that watchman
except by cutting his throat or throwing him overboard by force  consult
your own courage as to whether that can be done or not  and as far as my
coming with you is concerned i shirk no danger which holds out any hopes
of success but to throw away life without a reason as if it were a
thing of no moment is something which i do not believe that even you
would sanctionsee what you think of this i will wrap you up in two
hide baggage covers tie you up with thongs and stow you among my
clothing as baggage leaving the ends somewhat open of course so you
can breathe and get your food then i will raise a hue and cry because my
slaves have thrown themselves into the sea fearing worse punishment and
when the ship makes port i will carry you out as baggage without
exciting the slightest suspicion oh  so you would bundle us up like
we were solid i sneered our bellies wouldnt make trouble for us of
course and well never sneeze nor snore  and all because a similar
trick turned out successfully before  think the matter over  being tied
up could be endured for one day but suppose it might have to be for
longer  what if we should be becalmed  what if we were struck by a
storm from the wrong quarter of the heavens  what could we  do then
even clothes will cut through at the wrinkles when they are tied up too
long and paper in bundles will lose its shape  do you imagine that we
who are young and unused to hardship could endure the filthy rags and
lashings necessary to such an operation as statues do  no  thats
settled  some other road to safety must be found  i have thought up a
scheme see what you think of it  eumolpus is a man of letters  he will
have ink about him of course  with this remedy then lets change our
complexions from hair to toenails  then in the guise of ethiopian
slaves we shall be ready at hand to wait upon you lighthearted as
having escaped the torturer and with our altered complexions we can
impose upon our enemies yes indeed  sneered  giton and be sure
and circumcise us too so we will be taken for jews pierce our ears so
we will look like arabs chalk our faces so that gaul will take us for
her own sons as if color alone could change ones figure  as if many
other details did not require consideration if a passable imposture is to
result  even granting that the stained face can keep its color for some
time suppose that not a drop of water should spot the skin suppose that
the garment did not stick to the ink as it often does where no gum is
used tell me  we cant make our lips so hideously thick can we  we
cant kink our hair with a curlingiron can we  we cant harrow our
foreheads with scars can we  we cant force our legs out into the form
of a bow or walk with our anklebones on the ground can we  can we trim
our beards after the foreign style  no  artificial color dirties the
body without changing it  listen to the plan which i have thought out in
my desperation lets tie our garments around our heads and throw
ourselves into the deep
chapter the one hundred and third
gods and men forbid that you should make so base an ending of your
lives cried eumolpus  no it will be better to do as i direct  as
you may gather from his razor my servant is a barber let him shave
your heads and eyebrows too and quickly at that  i will follow after
him and i will mark my inscription so cleverly upon your foreheads that
you will be mistaken for slaves who have been branded  the same letters
will serve both to quiet the suspicions of the curious and to conceal
under semblance of punishment your real features  we did not delay the
execution of this scheme but sneaking stealthily to the ships side we
submitted our heads and eyebrows to the barber that he might shave them
clean  eumolpus covered our foreheads completely with large letters
and with a liberal hand spread the universally known mark of the
fugitive over the face of each of us  as luck would have it one of the
passengers who was terribly seasick was hanging over the ships side
easing his stomach  he saw the barber busy at his unseasonable task by
the light of the moon and cursing the omen which resembled the last
offering of a crew before shipwreck he threw himself into his bunk
pretending not to hear his puking curses we reverted to our melancholy
train of thought and settling ourselves down in silence we passed the
remaining hours of the night in fitful slumber  on the following
morning eumolpus entered lycas cabin as soon as he knew that tryphaena
was out of bed and after some conversation upon the happy voyage of
which the fine weather gave promise lycas turned to tryphaena and
remarked
chapter the one hundred and fourth
priapus appeared to me in a dream and seemed to sayknow that
encolpius whom you seek has by me been led aboard your ship
 tryphaena trembled violently you would think we had slept together
 she cried for a bust of neptune which i saw in the gallery at baiae
said to me in my dreamyou will find giton aboard lycas ship  from
which you can see that epicurus was a man inspired remarked eumolpus
he passed sentence upon mocking phantasms of that kind in a very witty
manner
          dreams that delude the mind with flitting shades
          by neither powers of air nor gods are sent
          each makes his own  and when relaxed in sleep
          the members lie the mind without restraint
          can flit and reenact by night the deeds
          that occupied the day  the warrior fierce
          who cities shakes and towns destroys by fire
          maneuvering armies sees and javelins
          and funerals of kings and bloody fields
          the cringing lawyer dreams of courts and trials
          the miser hides his hoard new treasures finds
          the hunters horn and hounds the forests wake
          the shipwrecked sailor from his hulk is swept
          or washed aboard just misses perishing
          adultresses will bribe and harlots write
          to lovers dogs in dreams their hare still course
          and old wounds ache most poignantly in dreams
still whats to prevent our searching the ship said lycas after he
had expiated tryphaenas dream so that we will not be guilty of
neglecting the revelations of providence  and who were the rascals who
were being shaved last night by the light of the moon  chimed in hesus
unexpectedly for that was the name of the fellow who had caught us at
our furtive transformation in the night  a rotten thing to do i swear
from what i hear its unlawful for any living man aboard ship to shed
hair or nails unless the wind has kicked up a heavy sea
chapter the one hundred and fifth
lycas was greatly disturbed by this information and flew into a rage
so someone aboard my ship cut off his hair did he  he bawled and at
dead of night too  bring the offenders aft on deck here and step
lively so that i can tell whom to punish from their heads that the
ship may be freed from the curse  i ordered it done eumolpus broke
in and i didnt order it as an unlucky omen either seeing that i had
to be aboard the same vessel i did it because the scoundrels had long
matted hair i ordered the filth cleared off the wretches because i did
not wish to even seem to make a prison out of your ship besides i did
not want the seared scars of the letters to be hidden in the least by
the interference of the hair as they ought to be in plain sight for
everyone to read and at full length too  in addition to their other
misdemeanors they blew in my money on a streetwalker whom they kept in
common only last night i dragged them away from her reeking with wine
and perfumes as they were and they still stink of the remnants of my
patrimony  thereupon forty stripes were ordered for each of us that
the tutelary genius of the ship might be propitiated  and they were not
long about it either  eager to propitiate the tutelary genius with our
wretched blood the savage sailors rushed upon us with their ropes ends
for my part i endured three lashes with spartan fortitude but at the
very first blow giton set up such a howling that his all too familiar
voice reached the ears of tryphaena nor was she the only one who was in
a flutter for attracted by this familiar voice all the maids rushed to
where he was being flogged  giton had already moderated the ardor of the
sailors by his wonderful beauty he appealed to his torturers without
uttering a word  its giton  its giton the maids all screamed in
unison  hold your hands you brutes help madame its giton
 tryphaena turned willing ears she had recognized that voice herself and
flew to the boy  lycas who knew me as well as if he had heard my voice
now ran up he glanced at neither face nor hands but directed his eyes
towards parts lower down courteously he shook hands with them how do
you do encolpius he said  let no one be surprised at ulysses nurse
discovering after twenty years the scar that established his identity
since this man so keenly observant had in spite of the most skillful
disguise of every feature and the obliteration of every identifying mark
upon my body so surely hit upon the sole means of identifying his
fugitive  deceived by our appearance tryphaena wept bitterly
believing that the marks upon our foreheads were in truth the brands
of prisoners she asked us gently into what slaves prison we had fallen
in our wanderings and whose cruel hands had inflicted this punishment
still fugitives whose members had gotten them into trouble certainly
deserved some punishment
chapter the one hundred and sixth
in a towering passion lycas leaped forward oh you silly woman he
shouted as if those scars were made by the letters on the
brandingiron  if only they had really blotched up their foreheads with
those inscriptions it would be some satisfaction to us at least but
as it is we are being imposed upon by an actors tricks and hoaxed by
a fake inscription  tryphaena was disposed to mercy as all was not
lost for her pleasures but lycas remembered the seduction of his wife
and the insults to which he had been subjected in the portico of the
temple of hercules tryphaena he gritted out his face convulsed with
savage passion you are aware i believe that the immortal gods have a
hand in human affairs what did they do but lead these scoundrels aboard
this ship in ignorance of the owner and then warn each of us alike by a
coincidence of dreams of what they had done  can you then see how it
would be possible to let off those whom a god has himself delivered up
to punishment  i am not a cruel man what moves me is this i am afraid
i shall have to endure myself whatever i remit to them  at this
superstitious plea tryphaena veered around  denying that she would
plead for quarter she was even anxious to help along the fulfillment of
this retribution so entirely just she had herself suffered an insult
no less poignant than had lycas for her chastity had been called in
question before a crowd
     primeval fear created gods on earth when from the sky
     the lightningflashes rent with flame the ramparts of the world
     and smitten athos blazed  then phoebus sinking to the earth
     his course complete and waning luna offerings received
     the changing seasons of the year the superstition spread
     throughout the world and ignorance and awe the toiling boor
     to ceres from his harvest the first fruits compelled to yield
     and bacchus with the fruitful vine to crown  then pales came
     into her own the shepherds gains to share  beneath the waves
     of every sea swims neptune  pallas guards the shops
     and those impelled by avarice or guilt create new gods
lycas as he perceived that tryphaena was as eager as himself for
revenge gave orders for our punishment to be renewed and made more
drastic whereupon eumolpus endeavored to appease him as follows
chapter the one hundred and seventh
lycas said he these unfortunates upon whom you intend to wreak your
vengeance implore your compassion and have chosen me for this task
i believe that i am a man by no means unknown and they desire that
somehow i will effect a reconciliation between them and their former
friends  surely you do not imagine that these young men fell into such
a snare by accident when the very first thing that concerns every
prospective passenger is the name of the captain to whom he intrusts his
safety  be reasonable then forego your revenge and permit free men to
proceed to their destination without injury  when penitence manages to
lead their fugitives back harsh and implacable masters restrain their
cruelty and we are merciful to enemies who have surrendered  what could
you ask or wish for more  these wellborn and respectable young men
be suppliant before your eyes and what ought to move you more strongly
still were once bound to you by the ties of friendship  if they had
embezzled your money or repaid your faith in them with treachery
by hercules you have ample satisfaction from the punishment already
inflicted  look  can you read slavery on their foreheads and see upon
the faces of free men the brandmarks of a punishment which was
selfinflicted  lycas broke in upon this plea for mercy dont try to
confuse the issue he said let every detail have its proper attention
and first of all why did they strip all the hair off their heads
if they came of their own free will  a man meditates deceit not
satisfaction when he changes his features  then again if they sought
reconciliation through a mediator why did you do your best to conceal
them while employed in their behalf  it is easily seen that the
scoundrels fell into the toils by chance and that you are seeking some
device by which you could sidestep the effects of our resentment  and be
careful that you do not spoil your case by overconfidence when you
attempt to sow prejudice among us by calling them wellborn and
respectable  what should the injured parties do when the guilty run into
their own punishment  and inasmuch as they were our friends by that
they deserve more drastic punishment still for whoever commits an
assault upon a stranger is termed a robber but whoever assaults a
friend is little better than a parricide  i am well aware eumolpus
replied to rebut this damning harangue that nothing can look blacker
against these poor young men than their cutting off their hair at night
on this evidence they would seem to have come aboard by accident not
voluntarily  oh how i wish that the explanation could come to your ears
just as candidly as the thing itself happened  they wanted to relieve
their heads of that annoying and useless weight before they came aboard
but the unexpected springing up of the wind prevented the carrying out of
their wishes and they did not imagine that it mattered where they began
what they had decided to do because they were unacquainted with either
the omens or the law of seafaring men  but why should they shave
themselves like suppliants  demanded lycas unless of course they
expected to arouse more sympathy as baldpates  whats the use of
seeking information through a third person anyway  you scoundrel what
have you to say for yourself  what salamander singed off your eyebrows
you poisoner what god did you vow your hair to  answer
chapter the one hundred and eighth
i was stricken dumb and trembled from fear of punishment nor could i
find anything to say out of countenance as i was and hideous for to the
disgrace of a shaven poll was added an equal baldness in the matter of
eyebrows the case against me was only too plain there was not a thing
to be said or done  finally a damp sponge was passed over my tearwet
face and thereupon the smut dissolved and spread over my whole
countenance blotting out every feature in a sooty cloud  anger turned
into loathing  swearing that he would permit no one to humiliate
wellborn young men contrary to right and law eumolpus checked the
threats of the savage persecutors by word and by deed  his hired
servant backed him up in his protest as did first one and then another
of the feeblest of the seasick passengers whose participation served
rather to inflame the disagreement than to be of help to us  for myself
i asked no quarter but i shook my fists in tryphaenas face and told
her in a loud voice that unless she stopped hurting giton i would use
every ounce of my strength against her reprobate woman that she was
the only person aboard the ship who deserved a flogging  lycas was
furiously angry at my hardihood nor was he less enraged at my
abandoning my own cause to take up that of another in so wholehearted
a manner  inflamed as she was by this affront tryphaena was as furious
as he so the whole ships company was divided into two factions  on
our side the hired barber armed himself with a razor and served out the
others to us on their side tryphaenas retainers prepared to battle
with their bare fists nor was the scolding of female warriors unheard
in the battleline  the pilot was neutral but he declared that unless
this madness stirred up by the lechery of a couple of vagabonds died
down he would let go the helm the fury of the combatants continued to
rage none the less fiercely nevertheless they fighting for revenge we
for life  many fell on each side though none were mortally wounded
and more bleeding from wounds retreated as from a real battle but
the fury of neither side abated at last the gallant giton turned the
menacing razor against his own virile parts and threatened to cut away
the cause of so many misfortunes  this was too much for tryphaena she
prevented the perpetration of so horrid a crime by the out and out
promise of quarter time and time again i lifted the barbers blade to
my throat but i had no more intention of killing myself than had giton
of doing what he threatened but he acted out the tragic part more
realistically than i as it was because he knew that he held in his
hand the same razor with which he had already cut his throat  the lines
still stood at the ready and it was plain to be seen that this would be
no everyday affair when the pilot with difficulty prevailed upon
tryphaena to undertake the office of herald and propose a truce so
when pledges of good faith had been given and received in keeping with
the ancient precedent she snatched an olivebranch from the ships
figurehead and holding it out advanced boldly to parley
     what fury she exclaims turns peace to war  what evil deed
     was by these hands committed  trojan hero there is none
     absconding in this ship with bride of atreus cuckold seed
     nor crazed medea stained by lifes blood of her fathers son
     but passion scorned becomes a power alas who courts his end
     by drawing sword amidst these waves  why die before our time
     strive not with angry seas to vie and to their fury lend
     your rage by piling waves upon its savage floods sublime 
chapter the one hundred and ninth
the woman poured out this rhapsody in a loud excited voice the
battleline wavered for an instant then all hands were recalled to
peace and terminated the war  eumolpus our commander took advantage
of the psychological moment of their repentance and after administering
a stinging rebuke to lycas signed a treaty of peace which was drawn up
as follows it is hereby solemnly agreed on your part tryphaena that
you do forego complaint of any wrong done you by giton that you do not
bring up anything that has taken place prior to this date that you do
not seek to revenge anything that has taken place prior to this date
that you do not take steps to follow it up in any other manner
whatsoever that you do not command the boy to perform anything to him
repugnant that you do neither embrace nor kiss the said giton that you
do not enfold said giton in the sexual embrace except under immediate
forfeiture of one hundred denarii  item it is hereby agreed on your
part lycas that you do refrain from annoying encolpius with abusive
word or reproachful look that you do not seek to ascertain where he
sleep at night or if you do so seek that you forfeit two hundred
denarii immediately for each and every such offense  the treaty was
signed upon these terms and we laid down our arms  it seemed well to
wipe out the past with kisses after we had taken oath for fear any
vestige of rancor should persist in our minds  factious hatreds died
out amidst universal goodfellowship and a banquet served on the field
of battle crowned our reconciliation with joviality  the whole ship
resounded with song and as a sudden calm had caused her to lose
headway one tried to harpoon the leaping fish another hauled in the
struggling catch on baited hooks  then some seabirds alighted upon the
yardarms and a skillful fowler touched them with his jointed rods they
were brought down to our hands stuck fast to the limed segments  the
breeze caught up the down but the wing and tail feathers twisted
spirally as they fell into the seafoam  lycas was already beginning to
be on good terms with me and tryphaena had just sprinkled giton with
the last drops in her cup when eumolpus who was himself almost drunk
was seized with the notion of satirizing bald pates and branded rascals
but when he had exhausted his chilly wit he returned at last to his
poetry and recited this little elegy upon hair
     gone are those locks that to thy beauty lent such lustrous charm
     and blighted are the locks of spring by bitter winters sway
     thy naked temples now in baldness mourn their vanished form
     and glistens now that poor bare crown its hair all worn away
     oh  faithless inconsistency  the gods must first resume
     the charms that first they granted youth that it might lovelier
            bloom
          poor wretch but late thy locks did brighter glister
          than those of great apollo or his sister
          now smoother is thy crown than polished grasses
          or rounded mushrooms when a shower passes
          in fear thou fliest the laughterloving lasses
          that thou mayst know that death is on his way
          know that thy head is partly dead this day
chapter the one hundred and tenth
it is my opinion that he intended favoring us with more of the same kind
of stuff sillier than the last but tryphaenas maid led giton away
below and fitted the lad out in her mistress false curls then producing
some eyebrows from a vanity box she skillfully traced out the lines of
the lost features and restored him to his proper comeliness  recognizing
the real giton tryphaena was moved to tears and then for the first time
she gave the boy a real lovekiss  i was overjoyed now that the lad was
restored to his own handsome self but i hid my own face all the more
assiduously realizing that i was disfigured by no ordinary hideousness
since not even lycas would bestow a word upon me  the maid rescued me
from this misfortune finally however and calling me aside she decked
me out with a head of hair which was none the less becoming my face
shone more radiantly still as a matter of fact for my curls were
golden  but in a little while eumolpus mouthpiece of the distressed
and author of the present good understanding fearing that the general
good humor might flag for lack of amusement began to indulge in sneers
at the fickleness of women how easily they fell in love how readily
they forgot even their own sons  no woman could be so chaste but that
she could be roused to madness by a chance passion  nor had he need to
quote from old tragedies or to have recourse to names notorious for
centuries on the contrary if we cared to hear it he would relate an
incident which had occurred within his own memory whereupon as we all
turned our faces towards him and gave him our attention he began as
follows
chapter the one hundred and eleventh
there was a certain married lady at ephesus once upon a time so noted
for her chastity that she even drew women from the neighboring states to
come to gaze upon her  when she carried out her husband she was by no
means content to comply with the conventional custom and follow the
funeral cortege with her hair down beating her naked breast in sight of
the onlookers  she followed the corpse even into the tomb and when the
body had been placed in the vault in accordance with the greek custom
she began to stand vigil over it weeping day and night  neither parents
nor relations could divert her from punishing herself in this manner and
from bringing on death by starvation  the magistrates the last resort
were rebuffed and went away and the lady mourned by all as an unusual
example dragged through the fifth day without nourishment  a most
faithful maid was in attendance upon the poor woman she either wept in
company with the afflicted one or replenished the lamp which was placed
in the vault as the occasion required  throughout the whole city there
was but one opinion men of every calling agreed that here shone the one
solitary example of chastity and of love  in the meantime the governor
of the province had ordered some robbers crucified near the little vault
in which the lady was bewailing her recent loss  on the following night
a soldier who was standing guard over the crosses for fear someone might
drag down one of the bodies for burial saw a light shining brightly
among the tombs and heard the sobs of someone grieving  a weakness
common to mankind made him curious to know who was there and what was
going on so he descended into the tomb and catching sight of a most
beautiful woman he stood still afraid at first that it was some
apparition or spirit from the infernal regions but he finally
comprehended the true state of affairs as his eye took in the corpse
lying there and as he noted the tears and the face lacerated by the
fingernails he understood that the lady was unable to endure the loss
of the dear departed  he then brought his own scanty ration into the
vault and exhorted the sobbing mourner not to persevere in useless grief
or rend her bosom with unavailing sobs the same end awaited us all the
same last resting place and other platitudes by which anguished minds
are recalled to sanity  but oblivious to sympathy she beat and
lacerated her bosom more vehemently than before and tearing out her
hair she strewed it upon the breast of the corpse  notwithstanding
this the soldier would not leave off but persisted in exhorting the
unfortunate lady to eat until the maid seduced by the smell of the
wine i suppose was herself overcome and stretched out her hand to
receive the bounty of their host  refreshed by food and drink she
then began to attack the obstinacy of her mistress  what good will it
do you to die of hunger she asked or to bury yourself alive  or to
surrender an uncondemned spirit before the fates demand it  think you
the ashes or sepultured dead can feel aught of thy woe  would you recall
the dead from the reluctant fates  why not shake off this womanish
weakness and enjoy the blessings of light while you can  the very corpse
lying there ought to convince you that your duty is to live  when
pressed to eat or to live no one listens unwillingly and the lady
thirsty after an abstinence of several days finally permitted her
obstinacy to be overcome nor did she take her fill of nourishment
with less avidity than had the maid who had surrendered first
chapter the one hundred and twelfth
but to make a long story short you know the temptations that beset a
full stomach the soldier laid siege to her virtue with the selfsame
blandishments by which he had persuaded her that she ought to live  nor
to her modest eye did the young man seem uncouth or wanting in address
the maid pled in his behalf and kept repeating
     why will you fight with a passion that to you is pleasure
     remembering not in whose lands you are taking your leisure
but why should i keep you longer in suspense  the lady observed the
same abstinence when it came to this part of her body and the victorious
soldier won both of his objectives so they lay together not only
that night in which they pledged their vows but also the next and even
the third shutting the doors of the vault of course so that anyone
acquaintance or stranger coming to the tomb would be convinced that
this most virtuous of wives had expired upon the body of her husband  as
for the soldier so delighted was he with the beauty of his mistress and
the secrecy of the intrigue that he purchased all the delicacies his pay
permitted and smuggled them into the vault as soon as darkness fell
meanwhile the parents of one of the crucified criminals observing the
laxness of the watch dragged the hanging corpse down at night and
performed the last rite  the soldier was hoodwinked while absent from
his post of duty and when on the following day he caught sight of one of
the crosses without its corpse he was in terror of punishment and
explained to the lady what had taken place he would await no sentence of
courtmartial but would punish his neglect of duty with his own sword
let her prepare a place for one about to die let that fatal vault serve
both the lover and the husband  not that cried out the lady no less
merciful than chaste the gods forbid that i should look at the same
time upon the corpses of the two men dearest to me i would rather hang
the dead than slay the living so saying she gave orders for the body
of her husband to be lifted out of the coffin and fastened upon the
vacant cross  the soldier availed himself of the expedient suggested by
this very ingenious lady and next day everyone wondered how a dead man
had found his way to the cross
chapter the one hundred and thirteenth
the sailors received this tale with roars of laughter and tryphaena
blushed not a little and laid her face amorously upon gitons neck  but
lycas did not laugh if that governor had been a just man said he
shaking his head angrily he would have ordered the husbands body taken
down and carried back into the vault and crucified the woman  no doubt
the memory of hedyle haunted his mind and the looting of his ship in
that wanton excursion but the terms of the treaty permitted the
harboring of no old grudges and the joy which filled our hearts left no
room for anger  tryphaena was lying in gitons lap by this time
covering his bosom with kisses one minute and rearranging the curls upon
his shaven head the next  uneasy and chagrined at this new league i
took neither food nor drink but looked askance at them both with grim
eyes  every kiss was a wound to me every artful blandishment which the
wanton woman employed and i could not make up my mind as to whether i
was more angered at the boy for having supplanted me with my mistress or
at my mistress for debauching the boy both were hateful to my sight and
more galling than my late servitude  and to make the matter all the more
aggravating tryphaena would not even greet me as an acquaintance whom
she had formerly received as a lover while giton did not think me worthy
of a herestoyou in ordinary civility nor even speak to me in the
course of the common conversation i suppose he was afraid of reopening a
tender scar at the moment when a return to her good graces had commenced
to draw it together  tears of vexation dropped upon my breast and the
groan i smothered in a sigh nearly wracked my soul
          the vulture tearing at the livers deep and vital parts
          that wracks our breasts and rends our very heartstrings
          is not that bird the charming poet sings with all his arts
          tis jealousy or hate that human hearts stings
in spite of my illhumor lycas saw how well my golden curls became me
and becoming enamoured anew began winking his wanton eyes at me and
sought admission to my good graces upon a footing of pleasure nor did he
put on the arrogance of a master but spoke as a friend asking a favor
long and ardently he tried to gain his ends but all in vain till at
last meeting with a decisive repulse his passion turned to fury and he
tried to carry the place by storm but tryphaena came in unexpectedly and
caught him in his wanton attempt whereupon he was greatly upset and
hastily adjusted his clothing and bolted out of the cabin  tryphaena was
fired with lust at this sight what was lycas up to  she demanded
what was he after in that ardent assault  she compelled me to explain
burned still more hotly at what she heard and recalling memories of our
past familiarities she desired me to renew our old amour but i was worn
out with so much venery and slighted her advances  she was burning up
with desire by this time and threw her arms around me in a frenzied
embrace hugging me so tightly that i uttered an involuntary cry of pain
one of her maids rushed in at this and thinking that i was attempting to
force from her mistress the very favor which i had refused her she
sprang at us and tore us apart  thoroughly enraged at the disappointment
of her lecherous passion tryphaena upbraided me violently and with many
threats she hurried out to find lycas for the purpose of exasperating him
further against me and of joining forces with him to be revenged upon me
now you must know that i had formerly held a very high place in this
waitingmaids esteem while i was prosecuting my intrigue with her
mistress and for that reason she took it very hard when she surprised me
with tryphaena and sobbed very bitterly i pressed her earnestly to tell
me the reason for her sobs and after pretending to be reluctant she
broke out you will think no more of her than of a common prostitute if
you have a drop of decent blood in your veins  you will not resort to
that female catamite if you are a man this disturbed my mind but
what exercised me most was the fear that eumolpus would find out what
was going on and being a very sarcastic individual might revenge my
supposed injury in some poetic lampoon in which event his ardent zeal
would without doubt expose me to ridicule and i greatly dreaded that
but while i was debating with myself as to the best means of preventing
him from getting at the facts who should suddenly come in but the man
himself and he was not uninformed as to what had taken place for
tryphaena had related all the particulars to giton and had tried to
indemnify herself for my repulse at the expense of my little friend
eumolpus was furiously angry because of all this and all the more so as
lascivious advances were in open violation of the treaty which had been
signed  the minute the old fellow laid eyes upon me he began bewailing
my lot and ordered me to tell him exactly what had happened  as he was
already well informed i told him frankly of lycas lecherous attempt and
of tryphaenas wanton assault  when he had heard all the facts
eumolpus swore roundly that he would certainly avenge us as the gods
were just and would not suffer so many villainies to go unpunished
chapter the one hundred and fourteenth
we were still discussing this and other matters when the sea grew rough
and clouds gathering from every quarter obscured with darkness the
light of day  the panicstricken sailors ran to their stations and took
in sail before the squall was upon them but the gale did not drive the
waves in any one direction and the helmsman lost his bearings and did not
know what course to steer at one moment the wind would set towards
sicily but the next the north wind prevailing on the italian coast
would drive the unlucky vessel hither and yon and what was more
dangerous than all the rainsqualls a pall of such black density blotted
out the light that the helmsman could not even see as far forward as the
bow  at last as the savage fury of the sea grew more malignant the
trembling lycas stretched out his hands to me imploringly  save us from
destruction encolpius he shouted restore that sacred robe and holy
rattle to the ship  be merciful for heavens sake just as you used to
be  he was still shouting when a windsquall swept him into the sea the
raging elements whirled him around and around in a terrible maelstrom and
sucked him down  tryphaena on the other hand was seized by her
faithful servants placed in a skiff along with the greater part of her
belongings and saved from certain death  embracing giton i wept aloud
did we deserve this from the gods i cried to be united only in
death  no malignant fortune grudges even that  look  in an instant
the waves will capsize the ship  think  in an instant the sea will
sever this lovers embrace  if you ever loved encolpius truly kiss him
while yet you may and snatch this last delight from impending
dissolution  even as i was speaking giton removed his garment and
creeping beneath my tunic he stuck out his head to be kissed then
fearing some more spiteful wave might separate us as we clung together
he passed his belt around us both  if nothing else he cried the sea
will at least bear us longer joined together and if in pity it casts
us up upon the same shore some passerby may pile some stones over us
out of common human kindness or the last rites will be performed by the
drifting sand in spite of the angry waves  i submit to this last bond
and as though i were laid out upon my deathbed await an end no longer
dreaded meanwhile accomplishing the decrees of the fates the storm
stripped the ship of all that was left no mast no helm not a rope nor
an oar remained on board her she was only a derelict heavy and
waterlogged drifting before the waves  some fishermen hastily put off
in their little boats to salvage their booty but seeing men alive and
ready to defend their property they changed their predatory designs into
offers of help
chapter the one hundred and fifteenth
just then amid that clamor of voices we heard a peculiar noise and from
beneath the captains cabin there came a bellowing as of some wild beast
trying to get out  we then followed up the sound and discovered
eumolpus sitting there scribbling verses upon an immense sheet of
parchment  astounded that he could find time to write poetry at deaths
very door we hauled him out in spite of his protests and ordered him
to return to his senses but he flew into a rage at being interrupted
leave me alone until i finish this sentence he bawled the poem
labors to its birth  ordering giton to come to close quarters and help
me drag the bellowing bard ashore i laid hands upon the lunatic  when
this job had at last been completed we came wet and wretched to a
fishermans hut and refreshed ourselves somewhat with stores from the
wreck spoiled though they were by salt water and passed a night that
was almost interminable  as we were holding a council next day to
determine to what part of the country we had best proceed i suddenly
caught sight of a human body turning around in a gentle eddy and
floating towards the shore  stricken with melancholy i stood still and
began to brood with wet eyes upon the treachery of the sea  and
perhaps said i a wife safe in some faraway country of the earth
awaits this man or a son who little dreams of storms or wrecks or
perhaps he left behind a father whom he kissed goodby at parting such
is the end of mortals plans such is the outcome of great ambitions
see how man rides the waves  until now i had been sorrowing for a mere
stranger but a wave turned the face which had undergone no change
towards the shore and i recognized lycas so eviltempered and so
unrelenting but a short time before now cast up almost at my feet  i
could no longer restrain the tears at this i beat my breast again and
yet again with my hands  where is your evil temper now  i cried
where is your unbridled passion  you be there a prey to fish and wild
beasts you who boasted but a little while ago of the strength of your
command  now you have not a single plank left of your great ship  go
on mortals set your hearts upon the fulfillment of great ambitions go
on schemers and in your wills control for a thousand years the disposal
of the wealth you got by fraud  only yesterday this man audited the
accounts of his family estate yea even reckoned the day he would arrive
in his native land and settled it in his mind  gods and goddesses how
far he lies from his appointed destination  but the waves of the sea are
not alone in thus keeping faith with mortal men the warriors weapons
fail him the citizen is buried beneath the ruins of his own penates
when engaged in paying his vows to the gods another falls from his
chariot and dashes out his ardent spirit the glutton chokes at dinner
the niggard starves from abstinence  give the dice a fair throw and you
will find shipwreck everywhere  ah but one overwhelmed by the waves
obtains no burial  as though it matters in what manner the body once it
is dead is consumed by fire by flood by time  do what you will
these all achieve the same end  ah but the beasts will mangle the body
as though fire would deal with it any more gently when we are angry with
our slaves that is the punishment which we consider the most severe
what folly it is then to do everything we can to prevent the grave from
leaving any part of us behind when the fates will look out for us even
against our wills after these reflections we made ready to pay the
last rites to the corpse and lycas was burned upon a funeral pyre
raised by the hands of enemies while eumolpus fixing his eyes upon the
far distance to gain inspiration composed an epitaph for the dead man
                        his fate was unavoidable
              no rockhewn tomb nor sculptured marble his
             his noble corpse five feet of earth received
              he rests in peace beneath this humble mound
chapter the one hundred and sixteenth
we set out upon our intended journey after this last office had been
wholeheartedly performed and in a little while arrived sweating at
the top of a mountain from which we made out at no great distance a
town perched upon the summit of a lofty eminence  wanderers as we were
we had no idea what town it could be until we learned from a caretaker
that it was crotona a very ancient city and once the first in italy
when we earnestly inquired upon learning this what men inhabited such
historic ground and the nature of the business in which they were
principally engaged now that their wealth had been dissipated by the oft
recurring wars my friends replied he if you are men of business
change your plans and seek out some other conservative road to a
livelihood but if you can play the part of men of great culture always
ready with a lie you are on the straight road to riches the study of
literature is held in no estimation in that city eloquence has no niche
there economy and decent standards of morality come into no reward of
honor there you must know that every man whom you will meet in that city
belongs to one of two factions they either takein or else they are
takenin  no one brings up children in that city for the reason that
no one who has heirs is invited to dinner or admitted to the games such
an one is deprived of all enjoyments and must lurk with the rabble  on
the other hand those who have never married a wife or those who have no
near relatives attain to the very highest honors in other words they
are the only ones who are considered soldierly or the bravest of the
brave or even good  you will see a town which resembles the fields in
time of pestilence he continued in which there is nothing but
carcasses to be torn at and carrion crows tearing at them
chapter the one hundred and seventeenth
eumolpus who had a deeper insight turned this state of affairs over in
his mind and declared that he was not displeased with a prospect of that
kind  i thought the old fellow was joking in the carefree way of poets
until he complained if i could only put up a better front  i mean that
i wish my clothing was in better taste that my jewelry was more
expensive all this would lend color to my deception i would not carry
this scrip by hercules i would not i would lead you all to great
riches  for my part i undertook to supply whatever my companion in
robbery had need of provided he would be satisfied with the garment and
with whatever spoils the villa of lycurgus had yielded when we robbed it
as for money against present needs the mother of the gods would see to
that out of regard to her own good name  well whats to prevent our
putting on an extravaganza demanded eumolpus  make me the master if
the business appeals to you no one ventured to condemn a scheme by
which he could lose nothing and so that the lie would be kept safe
among us all we swore a solemn oath the words of which were dictated by
eumolpus to endure fire chains flogging death by the sword and
whatever else eumolpus might demand of us just like regular gladiators
after the oath had been taken we paid our respects to our master with
pretended servility and were informed that eumolpus had lost a son a
young man of great eloquence and promise and that it was for this reason
the poor old man had left his native land that he might not see the
companions and clients of his son nor even his tomb which was the cause
of his daily tears  to this misfortune a recent shipwreck had been
added in which he had lost upwards of two millions of sesterces not
that he minded the loss but destitute of a train of servants he could
not keep up his proper dignity  furthermore he had invested in africa
thirty millions of sesterces in estates and bonds such a horde of his
slaves was scattered over the fields of numidia that he could have even
sacked carthage  we demanded that eumolpus cough frequently to further
this scheme that he have trouble with his stomach and find fault with
all the food when in company that he keep talking of gold and silver and
estates the incomes from which were not what they should be and of the
everlasting unproductiveness of the soil that he cast up his accounts
daily that he revise the terms of his will monthly and for fear any
detail should be lacking to make the farce complete he was to use the
wrong names whenever he wished to summon any of us so that it would be
plain to all that the master had in mind some who were not present  when
everything had been thus provided for we offered a prayer to the gods
that the matter might turn out well and happily and took to the road
but giton could not bear up under his unaccustomed load and the hired
servant corax a shirker of work often put down his own load and cursed
our haste swearing that he would either throw his packs away or run away
with his load  what do you take me for a beast of burden  he
grumbled or a scow for carrying stone i hired out to do the work of a
man not that of a packhorse and im as free as you are even if my
father did leave me poor  not satisfied with swearing he lifted up his
leg from time to time and filled the road with an obscene noise and a
filthy stench  giton laughed at his impudence and imitated every
explosion with his lips but eumolpus relapsed into his usual vein even
in spite of this
chapter the one hundred and eighteenth
young men said he many are they who have been seduced by poetry
for the instant a man has composed a verse in feet and has woven a more
delicate meaning into it by means of circumlocutions he straightway
concludes that he has scaled helicon take those who are worn out by the
distressing detail of the legal profession for example they often seek
sanctuary in the tranquillity of poetry as a more sheltered haven
believing themselves able more easily to compose a poem than a rebuttal
charged with scintillating epigrams but a more highly cultivated mind
loves not this conceited affectation nor can it either conceive or bring
forth unless it has been steeped in the vast flood of literature  every
word that is what i would call low ought to be avoided and phrases
far removed from plebeian usage should be chosen  let ye rabble rout
avaunt be your rule  in addition care should be exercised in
preventing the epigrams from standing out from the body of the speech
they should gleam with the brilliancy woven into the fabric  homer is an
example and the lyric poets and our roman virgil and the exquisite
propriety of horace either the others did not discover the road that
leads to poetry or having seen they feared to tread it  whoever
attempts that mighty theme the civil war for instance will sink under
the load unless he is saturated with literature  events past and
passing ought not to be merely recorded in verse the historian will
deal with them far better by means of circumlocutions and the
intervention of the immortals the free spirit wracked by the search for
epigrams having a mythological illusion should plunge headlong and
appear as the prophecy of a mind inspired rather than the attested faith
of scrupulous exactitude in speech  this hasty composition may please
you even though it has not yet received its final polishing
chapter the one hundred and nineteenth
     the conquering roman now held the whole world in his sway
     the ocean the land where the sun shone by day or the moon
     gleamed by night but unsated was he  and the seas
     were roiled by the weight of his deepladen keels if a bay
     lay hidden beyond or a land which might yield yellow gold
     twas held as a foe  while the struggle for treasure went on
     the fates were preparing the horrors and scourges of war
     amusements enjoyed by the vulgar no longer can charm
     nor pleasures worn threadbare by use of the plebeian mob
     the bronzes of corinth are praised by the soldier at sea
     and glittering gems sought in earth vie with purple of tyre
     numidia curses her here there the exquisite silks
     of china arabias people have stripped their own fields
     behold other woes and calamities outraging peace
     wild beasts in the forest are hunted for gold and remote
     african hammon is covered by beaters for fear
     some beast that slays men with his teeth shall escape for by that
     his value to men is enhanced  the vessels receive
     strange ravening monsters the tiger behind gilded bars
     and pacing his cage is transported to rome that his jaws
     may drip with the life blood of men to the plaudits of men
     oh shame  to point out our impending destruction the crime
     of persia enacted anew in his pubertys bloom
     the man child is kidnapped surrenders his powers to the knife
     is forced to the calling of venus delayed and hedged round
     the hurrying passage of lifes finest years is held back
     and nature seeks nature but finds herself not  everywhere
     these fraillimbed and mincing effeminates flowing of locks
     bedecked with an infinite number of garments of silk
     whose names ever change the wantons and lechers to snare
     are eagerly welcomed  from african soil now behold
     the citronwood tables their wellburnished surface reflects
     our tyrian purples and slaves by the horde and whose spots
     resemble the gold that is cheaper than they and ensnare

     of rome were brought low represented in him was the honor
     of sturdy republican rome  so abandoned and wretched
     the city has purchased dishonor has purchased herself
     despoiled by herself no avenger to wipe out the stigma
     twin maelstroms of debt and of usury suck down the commons
     no home with clear title no citizen free from a mortgage

     its hold on the vitals destroying the vigor of manhood
     so fear of the evils impending impels them to madness
     despair turns to violence luxurys ravages needs must
     repaired be by bloodshed for indigence safely can venture
     can art or sane reason rouse wallowing rome from the offal
     and break the voluptuous slumber in which she is sunken
     or must it be fury and war and the bloodlust of daggers
chapter the one hundred and twentieth
     three chieftains did fortune bring forth whom the fury of battles
     destroyed and interred each one under a mountain of weapons
     the parthian has crassus pompeius the great by the waters
     of egypt lies  julius ungrateful rome stained with his life blood
     and earth has divided their ashes unable to suffer
     the weight of so many tombs  these are the wages of glory
     there lies between naples and great puteoli a chasm
     deep cloven and cocytus churns there his current the vapor
     in fury escapes from the gorge with that lethal spray laden
     no green in the aututun is there no grass gladdens the meadow
     the supple twigs never resound with the twittering singing
     of birds in the springtime  but chaos volcanic black boulders
     of pumice lie happy within their drear setting of cypress
     amidst these infernal surroundings the ruler of hades
     uplifted his head by the funeral flames silhouetted
     and sprinkled with white from the ashes of corpses and challenged
     winged fortune in words such as these oh thou fickle controller
     of things upon earth and in heaven securitys foeman
     oh chance  oh thou lover eternally faithful to change and
     possessions betrayer dost own thyself crushed by the power
     of rome  canst not raise up the tottering mass to its downfall
     its strength the young manhood of rome now despises and staggers
     in bearing the booty heaped up by its efforts behold how
     they lavish their spoils  wealth run mad now brings down their
     destruction
     they build out of gold and their palaces reach to the heavens
     the sea is expelled by their moles and their pastures are oceans
     they war against nature in changing the state of creation
     they threaten my kingdom  earth yawns with their tunnels deep
     driven
     to furnish the stone for their madmens foundations already
     the mountains are hollowed and now but reechoing caverns
     while man quarries marble to serve his vainglorious purpose
     the spirits infernal confess that they hope to win heaven
     arise then o chance change thy countenance peaceful to warlike
     and harry the romans consign to my kingdom the fallen
     ah long is it now since my lips were with blood cooled and
     moistened
     nor has my tisiphone bathed her bloodlusting body

     he spake   and attempted to clasp the right hand of fortuna
     but ruptured the crust of the earth deeply cloven asunder
     then from her capricious heart fortune made answer o father
     whom cocytus deepest abysses obey if to forecast
     the future i may without fear thy petition shall prosper
     for no less consuming the anger that wars in this bosom
     the flame no less poignant that burns to my marrow all favors
     i gave to the bulwarks of rome now i hate them my
     gifts i repent the same god who built up their dominion
     shall bring down destruction upon it in burning their manhood
     my heart shall delight and its bloodlust shall slake with their
     slaughter
     now philippis field i can see strewn with dead of two battles
     and thessalys funeral pyres and iberia mourning
     already the clangor of arms thrills my ears and rings loudly
     thou lybian nile i can see now thy barriers groaning
     and actiums gulf and apollos darts quailing the warriors
     then open thy thirsty dominions and summon fresh spirits
     for scarce will the ferrymans strength be sufficient to carry
     the souls of the dead in his skiff tis a fleet that is needed
     thou pallid tisiphone slake with wide ruin thy thirsting
     and tear ghastly wounds mangled earth sinks to hell and the
     spirits

     but scarce had she finished when trembled the clouds and a
     gleaming
     bright flash of joves lightning transfixed them with flame and was

     already he gazed thou hadst thought  there silvery cynthia
     obscuring her face at the full denied light to the outrage

     and wandering rivers to rivulets shrunk writhed no longer

     trodden
     slope down and permit of approach is a spot ever sacred
     to hercules altar the winter with frozen snow seals it
     and rears to the heavens a summit eternally hoary
     as though the sky there had slipped down no warmth from the
     sunbeams
     no breath from the springtime can soften the piles wintry rigor
     nor slacken the frost chains that bind and its menacing shoulders
     the weight of the world could sustain  with victorious legions
     these crests caesar trod and selected a camp  gazing downwards
     on italys plains rolling far from the top of the mountain
     he lifted both hands to the heavens his voice rose in prayer
     omnipotent jove and thou refuge of saturn whose glory
     was brightened by feats of my armies and crowned with my triumphs
     bear witness  unwillingly summon i mars to these armies
     unwillingly draw i the sword  but injustice compels me
     while enemy blood dyes the rhine and the alps are held firmly
     repulsing a second assault of the gauls on our city
     she dubs me an outcast  and victory makes me an exile
     to triumphs three score and defeats of the germans my treason
     i trace  how can they fear my glory or see in my battles
     a menace  but hirelings and vile to whom my rome is but a
     stepmother  methinks that no craven this sword arm shall hamper
     and take not a stroke in repost  on to victory comrades
     while anger seethes hot  with the sword we will seek a decision
     the doom lowering down is a peril to all and the treason
     my gratitude owe i to you not alone have i conquered
     since punishment waits by our trophies and victory merits
     disgrace then let chance cast the lots  raise the standard of
     battle
     again take your swords  well i know  that my cause is accomplished
     amidst such armed warriors i know that i cannot be beaten
     while yet the words echoed from heaven the bird of apollo
     vouchsafed a good omen and beat with his pinions the ether
     from out of the left of a gloomy grove strange voices sounded
     and flame flashed thereafter  the sun gleamed with brighter
     refulgence
     unwonted his face in a halo of golden flame shining
chapter the one hundred and twentythird
     by omens emboldened to follow the battleflags caesar
     commanded and boldly led on down the perilous pathway
     the footing firmfettered by frost chains and ice did not hinder
     at first but lay silent the kindly cold masking its grimness
     but after the squadrons of cavalry shattered the clouds bound
     by ice and the trembling steeds crushed in the mail of the rivers
     then melted the snows  and soon torrents newborn from the
     heights of
     the mountains rush down but these also as if by commandment
     grow rigid and turn into ice in their headlong rush downwards
     now that which rushed madly a moment before must be hacked
     through
     but now it was treacherous baffling their steps and their footing
     deceiving and men horses arms fall in heaps in confusion
     and see  now the clouds by an icy gale smitten their burden
     discharge  lo the gusts of the whirlwind swirl fiercely
     about them
     the sky in convulsions with swollen hail buffets them sorely
     already the clouds themselves rupture and smother their weapons
     an avalanche icy roars down like a billow of ocean
     earth lay overwhelmed by the drifts of the snow and the planets
     of heaven are blotted from sight overwhelmed are the rivers
     that cling to their banks but unconquered is caesar  his javelin
     he leans on and scrunches with firm step a passage the bristling
     grim ice fields across  as spurred on by the lust of adventure
     amphitryons offspring came striding the caucasus slopes down
     or jupiters menacing mien as from lofty olympus
     he leaped the doomed giants to crush and to scatter their weapons
     while caesar in anger the swelling peaks treads down winged rumor
     in terror flies forth and on beating wings seeks the high summit
     of palatine tall every image she rocks with her message
     announcing this thunderbolt roman  already the ocean
     is tossing his fleets  now his cavalry reeking with german
     gore pours from the alps  slaughter bloodshed and weapons
     the red panorama of war is unrolled to their vision
     by terror their hearts are divided two counsels perplex them
     one chooses by land to seek flight to another the water
     appeals and the sea than his own land is safer  another
     will stand to his arms and advantage extort from fates mandate
     the depth of their fear marks the length of their flight  in
     confusion
     the people itselfshameful spectacledriven by terror
     is led to abandon the city  rome glories in fleeing
     the quirites from battle blench  cowed by the breath of a rumor
     relinquished their firesides to mourning  one citizen palsied
     with terror his children embraces another his penates
     conceals in his bosom then weeping takes leave of his threshold
     and slaughters the distant invaderwith curses  their spouses
     some clasp to their sorrowwracked bosoms  youths carry their
     fathers
     bowed down with old age uninured to the bearing of burdens
     they seize what they dread to lose most  inexperience drags all
     its chattels to camp and to battle as when powerful auster
     piles up the churned waters and tumbles them never a yardarm
     nor rudder to answer the hand here one fashions a liferaft
     of pine planks another steers into some bay on a lee shore
     another will crack on and run from the gale and to fortune
     trust all  but why sorrow for trifles  the consuls with pompey
     the greathe the terror of pontus of savage hydaspes
     explorer the reef that wrecked pirates caused jove to turn livid
     when thrice was a triumph decreed him whom pontus vexed water
     and pacified billows of bosphorus worshipped  disgraceful their
     flight  title and glory forsaking  now fortune capricious
     looks down on the back of great pompey retreating in terror
chapter the one hundred and twentyfourth
     so great a misfortune disrupted the concord of heaven
     and gods swelled the rout in their panic  behold through creation
     the gentle divinities flee from the ravening earth in
     their loathing they turn from humanity doomed to destruction
     and first of all peace with her snowy white arms hides her visage
     defeated her helmet beneath and abandoning earth flees
     to seek out the realm of implacable dis as a refuge
     meek faith her companion and justice with locks loosely flowing
     and concord in tears and her raiment in tatters attend her
     the minions of pluto pour forth from the portals of darkness
     that yawn the serpenthaired fury bellona the savage
     megoera with firebrands destruction and treachery livid
     deaths likeness  among them is frenzy as free with her lashings
     snapped short she now raises her gory head shielding her features
     deep scarred by innumerous wounds neath her helmet bloodclotted
     her left arm she guards with a battlescarred shield scored by
     weapons
     and numberless spearheads protrude from its surface her right hand
     a flaming torch brandishes kindling a flame that will burn up
     the world  now the gods are on earth and the skies note their
     absence
     the planets disordered their orbits attempt  into factions
     the heavens divide first dione espouses the cause of
     her caesar  minerva next steps to her side and the great son
     of ares his mighty spear brandishing  phoebus espouses
     the cause of great pompey his sister and mercury also
     and hercules like unto him in his travels and labors
     the trumpets call  discord her stygian head lifts to heaven
     her tresses disheveled her features with clotted blood covered
     tears pour from her bruised eyes her iron fangs thick coated
     with rust
     her tongue distils poison her features are haloed with serpents
     her hideous bosom is visible under her tatters
     a torch with a blood red flame waves from her tremulous right hand
     emerging from cocytus dark and from tartarus murky
     she strode to the crests of the apennines noble the prospect
     of earth to survey spread before her the world panorama
     its shores and the armies that march on its surface these words
     then
     burst out of her bosom malignant to arms now ye nations

     on earth was obeyed every detail of discords commandment
when eumolpus had with great volubility poured out this flood of words
we came at last to crotona  here we refreshed ourselves at a mean inn
but on the following day we went in search of more imposing lodgings and
fell in with a crowd of legacy hunters who were very curious as to the
class of society to which we belonged and as to whence we had come
thereupon in accord with our mutual understanding such ready answers
did we make as to who we might be or whence we had come that we gave them
no cause for doubt  they immediately fell to wrangling in their desire
to heap their own riches upon eumolpus and every fortunehunter solicited
his favor with presents

volume 5affairs at crotona
chapter the one hundred and twentyfifth
for a long time affairs at crotona ran along in this manner and eumolpus
flushed with success so far forgot the former state of his fortunes that
he even bragged to his followers that no one could hold out against any
wish of his and that any member of his suite who committed a crime
in that city would through the influence of his friends get off
unpunished  but although i daily crammed my bloated carcass to
overflowing with good things and began more and more to believe that
fortune had turned away her face from keeping watch upon me i frequently
meditated nevertheless upon my present state and upon its cause
suppose thought i some wily legacy hunter should dispatch an agent
to africa and catch us in our lie  or even suppose the hireling servant
glutted with prosperity should tip off his cronies or give the whole
scheme away out of spite  there would be nothing for it but flight and
in a fresh state of destitution a recalling of poverty which had been
driven off  gods and goddesses how ill it fares with those living
outside the law they are always on the lookout for what is coming to
them  turning these possibilities over in my mind i left the house in
a state of black melancholy hoping to revive my spirits in the fresh
air but scarcely had i set foot upon the public promenade when a girl
by no means homely met me and calling me polyaenos the name i had
assumed since my metamorphosis informed me that her mistress desired
leave to speak with me  you must be mistaken i answered in
confusion i am only a servant and a stranger and am by no means worthy
of such an honor
chapter the one hundred and twentysixth
you yourself she replied are the one to whom i was sent but
because you are well aware of your good looks you are proud and sell
your favors instead of giving them what else can those wavy wellcombed
locks mean or that face rouged and covered with cosmetics or that
languishing wanton expression in your eyes  why that gait so precise
that not a footstep deviates from its place unless you wish to show off
your figure in order to sell your favors  look at me i know nothing
about omens and i dont study the heavens like the astrologers but i can
read mens intentions in their faces and i know what a flirt is after
when i see him out for a stroll so if youll sell us what i want theres
a buyer ready but if you will do the graceful thing and lend let us be
under obligations to you for the favor  and as for your confession that
you are only a common servant by that you only fan the passion of the
lady who burns for you for some women will only kindle for canaille and
cannot work up an appetite unless they see some slave or runner with his
clothing girded up a gladiator arouses one or a muledriver all covered
with dust or some actor posturing in some exhibition on the stage  my
mistress belongs to this class she jumps the fourteen rows from the
stage to the gallery and looks for a lover among the gallery gods at the
back puffed up with this delightful chatter  come now confess wont
you i queried is this lady who loves me yourself  the waiting maid
smiled broadly at this blunt speech  dont have such a high opinion of
yourself said she ive never given in to any servant yet the gods
forbid that i should ever throw my arms around a gallowsbird  let the
married women see to that and kiss the marks of the scourge if they like
ill sit upon nothing below a knight even if i am only a servant  i
could not help marveling for my part at such discordant passions and i
thought it nothing short of a miracle that this servant should possess
the hauteur of the mistress and the mistress the low tastes of the wench
     each one will find what suits his taste one thing is not for all
     one gathers roses as his share another thorns enthrall
after a little more teasing i requested the maid to conduct her mistress
to a clump of plane trees  pleased with this plan the girl picked up
the skirt of her garment and turned into a laurel grove that bordered the
path  after a short delay she brought her mistress from her hidingplace
and conducted her to my side a woman more perfect than any statue
there are no words with which to describe her form and anything i could
say would fall far short  her hair naturally wavy flowed completely
over her shoulders her forehead was low and the roots of her hair were
brushed back from it her eyebrows running from the very springs of her
cheeks almost met at the boundary line between a pair of eyes brighter
than stars shining in a moonless night her nose was slightly aquiline
and her mouth was such an one as praxiteles dreamed diana had  her chin
her neck her hands the gleaming whiteness of her feet under a slender
band of gold she turned parian marble dull  then for the first time
doris tried lover thought lightly of doris
     oh jove whats come to pass that thou thine armor cast away
     art mute in heaven and but an idle tale
     at such a time the horns should sprout the raging bull hold sway
     or they white hair beneath swans down conceal
     heres danas self  but touch that lovely form
     thy limbs will melt beneath thy passions storm
chapter the one hundred and twentyseventh
she was delighted and so be witchingly did she smile that i seemed to see
the full moon showing her face from behind a cloud  then punctuating
her words with her fingers dear boy if you are not too critical to
enjoy a woman of wealth who has but this year known her first man i
offer you a sister said she  you have a brother already i know for
i didnt disdain to ask but what is to prevent your adopting a sister
too  i will come in on the same footing only deem my kisses worthy of
recognition and caress me at your own pleasure  rather let me implore
you by your beauty i replied  do not scorn to admit an alien among
your worshipers if you permit me to kneel before your shrine you will
find me a true votary and that you may not think i approach this temple
of love without a gift i make you a present of my brother  what she
exclaimed would you really sacrifice the only one without whom you
could not live  the one upon whose kisses your happiness depends  him
whom you love as i would have you love me  such sweetness permeated her
voice as she said this so entrancing was the sound upon the listening
air that you would have believed the sirens harmonies were floating in
the breeze  i was struck with wonder and dazzled by i know not what
light that shone upon me brighter than the whole heaven but i made
bold to inquire the name of my divinity  why didnt my maid tell you
that i am called circe  she replied  but i am not the sunchild nor
has my mother ever stayed the revolving world in its course at her
pleasure but if the fates bring us two together i will owe heaven a
favor  i dont know what it is but some gods silent purpose is beneath
this  circe loves not polyaenos without some reason a great torch is
always flaming when these names meet  take me in your arms then if you
will theres no prying stranger to fear and your brother is far away
from this spot  so saying circe clasped me in arms that were softer
than down and drew me to the ground which was covered with colored
flowers
     with flowers like these did mother earth great idas summit strew
     when jupiter his heart aflame enjoyed his lawful love
     there glowed the rose the flowering rush the violets deep blue
     from out green meadows snowwhite lilies laughed  then from above
     this setting summoned venus to the green and tender sod
     bright day smiled kindly on the secret amour of the god
side by side upon the grassy plot we lay exchanging a thousand kisses
the prelude to more poignant pleasure but alas  my sudden loss of
vigor disappointed circe
chapter the one hundred and twentyeight
infuriated at this affront whats the matter demanded she do my
kisses offend you  is my breath fetid from fasting  is there any evil
smelling perspiration in my armpits  or if its nothing of this kind
are you afraid of giton under her eyes i flushed hotly and if i had
any virility left i lost it then my whole body seemed to be inert  my
queen i cried do not mock me in my humiliation  i am bewitched
 circes anger was far from being appeased by such a trivial excuse
turning her eyes contemptuously away from me she looked at her maid
tell me chrysis and tell me truly is there anything repulsive about
me  anything sluttish  have i some natural blemish that disfigures my
beauty  dont deceive your mistress  i dont know whats the matter
with us but there must be something  then she snatched a mirror from
the silent maid and after scrutinizing all the looks and smiles which
pass between lovers she shook out her wrinkled earthstained robe and
flounced off into the temple of venus nearby and here was i like a
convicted criminal who had seen some horrible nightmare asking myself
whether the pleasure out of which i had been cheated was a reality or
only a dream
               as when in the sleepbringing night
               dreams sport with the wandering eyes
               and earth spaded up yields to light
               her gold that by day she denies
               the stealthy hand snatches the spoils
               the face with cold sweat is suffused
               and fear grips him tight in her toils
               lest robbers the secret have used
               and shake out the gold from his breast
               but when they depart from his brain
               these enchantments by which hes obsessed
               and truth comes again with her train
               restoring perspective and pain
               the phantasm lives to the last
               the mind dwells with shades of the past
the misfortune seemed to me a dream but i imagined that i must surely
be under a spell of enchantment and for a long time i was so devoid of
strength that i could not get to my feet  but finally my mental
depression began to abate little by little my strength came back to me
and i returned home arrived there i feigned illness and threw myself
upon my couch  a little late giton who had heard of my indisposition
entered the room in some concern  as i wished to relieve his mind i
informed him that i had merely sought my pallet to take a rest telling
him much other gossip but not a word about my mishap as i stood in great
fear of his jealousy and to lull any suspicion which he might entertain
i drew him to my side and endeavoured to give him some proofs of my love
but all my panting and sweating were in vain  he jumped up in a rage and
accused my lack of virility and change of heart declaring that he had
for a long time suspected that i had been expending my vigor and breath
elsewhere  no  no  darling i replied my love for you has always
been the same but reason prevails now over love and wantonness and
for the socratic continence of your love i thank you in his name he
replied sarcastically alcibiades was never more spotless when he left
his masters bed
chapter the one hundred and twentyninth
believe me brother when i tell you that i do not know whether i am a
man or not i vainly protested i do not feel like one if i am
dead and buried lies that part in which i was once an achilles  giton
seeing that i was completely enervated and fearing that it might give
cause for scandal if he were caught in this quiet place with me tore
himself away and fled into an inner part of the house  he had just gone
when chrysis entered the room and handed me her mistresss tablets in
which were written the following words
     circe to polyienosgreeting
     were i a wanton i should complain of my disappointment but as it
     is i am beholden to your impotence for by it i dallied the longer
     in the shadow of pleasure  still i would like to know how you are
     and whether you got home upon your own legs for the doctors say
     that one cannot walk without nerves  young man i advise you to
     beware of paralysis for i never in my life saw a patient in such
     great danger youre as good as dead im sure  what if the same
     numbness should attack your hands and knees  you would have to send
     for the funeral trumpeters  still even if i have been affronted
     i will not begrudge a prescription to one as sick as you  ask giton
     if you would like to recover  i am sure you will get back your
     strength if you will sleep without your brother for three nights
     so far as i am concerned i am not in the least alarmed about
     finding someone to whom i shall be as pleasing as i was to you my
     mirror and my reputation do not lie
                                        farewell if you can
such things will happen said chrysis when she saw that i had read
through the entire inditement and especially in this city where the
women can lure the moon from the sky  but well find a cure for your
trouble  just return a diplomatic answer to my mistress and restore her
selfesteem by frank courtesy for truth to tell she has never been
herself from the minute she received that affront  i gladly followed
the maids advice and wrote upon the tablets as follows
chapter the one hundred and thirtieth
     polyaenos to circegreeting
     dear lady i confess that i have often given cause for offense for
     i am only a man and a young one too but i never committed a
     deadly crime until today  you have my confession of guilt i
     deserve any punishment you may see fit to prescribe  i betrayed a
     trust i murdered a man i violated a temple demand my punishment
     for these crimes  should it be your pleasure to slay me i will come
     to you with my sword if you are content with a flogging i will run
     naked to my mistress only bear in mind that it was not myself but
     my tools that failed me  i was a soldier and ready but i had no
     arms  what threw me into such disorder i do not know perhaps my
     imagination outran my lagging body by aspiring to too much it is
     likely that i spent my pleasure in delay i cannot imagine what the
     trouble was  you bid me beware of paralysis as if a disease which
     prevented my enjoying you could grow worse  but my apology amounts
     briefly to this if you will grant me an opportunity of repairing my
     fault i will give you satisfaction
                                             farewell
after dismissing chrysis with these fair promises i paid careful
attention to my body which had so evilly served me and omitting the
bath i annointed myself in moderation with unguents and placed myself
upon a more strengthening diet such as onions and snails heads without
condiments and i also drank more sparingly of wine then taking a short
walk before settling down to sleep i went to bed without giton  so
anxious was i to please her that i feared the outcome if my brother lay
tickling my side
chapter the one hundred and thirtyfirst
finding myself vigorous in mind and body when i arose next morning i
went down to the same clump of plane trees though i dreaded the spot as
one of evil omen and commenced to wait for chrysis to lead me on my way
i took a short stroll and had just seated myself where i had sat the day
before when she came under the trees leading a little old woman by the
hand  well mr squeamish she chirped when she had greeted me have
you recovered your appetite  in the meantime the old hag
               a winesoaked crone with twitching lips
brought out a twisted hank of different colored yarns and put it about my
neck she then kneaded dust and spittle and dipping her middle finger
into the mixture she crossed my forehead with it in spite of my
protests
               as long as life remains theres hope
               thou rustic god oh hear our prayer
               great priapus i thee invoke
               temper our arms to dare
when she had made an end of this incantation she ordered me to spit three
times and three times to drop stones into my bosom each stone she
wrapped up in purple after she had muttered charms over it then
directing her hands to my privates she commenced to try out my virility
quicker than thought the nerves responded to the summons filling the
crones hand with an enormous erection  skipping for joy look
chrysis look she cried out see what a hare ive started for someone
else to course  this done the old lady handed me over to chrysis who
was greatly delighted at the recovery of her mistresss treasure she
hastily conducted me straight to the latter introducing me into a lovely
nook that nature had furnished with everything which could delight the
eye
          shorn of its top the swaying pine here casts a
          summer shade
          and quivering cypress and the stately plane
          and berryladen laurel  a brooks wimpling waters strayed
          lashed into foam but dancing on again
          and rolling pebbles in their chattering flow
          twas loves own nook
          as forest nightingale and urban procne undertook
          to bear true witness hovering the gleaming grass above
          and tender violets wooing with song their stolen love
fanning herself with a branch of flowering myrtle she lay stretched out
with her marble neck resting upon a golden cushion  when she caught
sight of me she blushed faintly she recalled yesterdays affront i
suppose  at her invitation i sat down by her side as soon as the
others had gone whereupon she put the branch of myrtle over my face and
emboldened as if a wall had been raised between us well mr
paralytic she teased have you brought all of yourself along today
 why ask me i replied why not try me instead  and throwing myself
bodily into her arms i revelled in her kisses with no witchcraft to stop
me
chapter the one hundred and thirtysecond
the loveliness of her form drew me to her and summoned me to love  our
lips were pressed together in a torrent of smacking kisses our groping
hands had discovered every trick of excitation and our bodies clasped
in a mutual embrace had fused our souls into one and then in the very
midst of these ravishing preliminaries my nerves again played me false
and i was unable to last until the instant of supreme bliss lashed to
fury by these inexcusable affronts the lady at last ran to avenge
herself and calling her house servants she gave orders for me to be
hoisted upon their shoulders and flogged then still unsatisfied with
the drastic punishment she had inflicted upon me she called all the
spinning women and scrubbing wenches in the house and ordered them to
spit upon me  i covered my face with my hands but i uttered no complaint
as i well knew what i deserved and overwhelmed with blows and spittle i
was driven from the house proselenos was kicked out too chrysis was
beaten and all the slaves grumbled among themselves and wondered what
had upset their mistresss good humor  i took heart after having given
some thought to my misfortunes and artfully concealing the marks of the
blows for fear that eumolpus would make merry over my mishaps or worse
yet that giton might be saddened by my disgrace i did the only thing i
could do to save my selfrespect i pretended that i was sick and went to
bed  there i turned the full fury of my resentment against that
recreant which had been the sole cause of all the evil accidents which
had befallen me
               three times i grasped the twoedged blade
               the recreant to cut away
               three times by fear my hand was stayed
               and palsied terror said me nay
               that which i might have done before
               twas now impossible to do
               for cold with fear the wretch withdrew
               into a thousandwrinkled mare
               and shrank in shame before my gaze
               nor would his head uncover more
               but though the scamp in terror skulked
               with words i flayed him as he sulked
raising myself upon my elbow i rebuked the shirker in some such terms as
these what have you to say for yourself you disgrace to gods and men
 i demanded for your name must never be mentioned among refined people
did i deserve to be lifted up to heaven and then dragged down to hell by
you  was it right for you to slander my flourishing and vigorous years
and land me in the shadows and lassitude of decrepit old age  give me
some sign however faint i beg of you that you have returned to life
 i vented my anger in words such as these
               his eyes were fixed and with averted look
               he stood less moved by any word of mine
               than weeping willows bending oer a brook
               or drooping poppies as at noon they pine
when i had made an end of this invective so out of keeping with good
taste i began to do penance for my soliloquy and blushed furtively
because i had so far forgotten my modesty as to invoke in words that part
of my body which men of dignity do not even recognize  then rubbing my
forehead for a long time why have i committed an indiscretion in
relieving my resentment by natural abuse i mused what does it amount
to  are we not accustomed to swear at every member of the human body
the belly throat or even the head when it aches as it often does  did
not ulysses wrangle with his own heart  do not the tragedians damn
their eyes just as if they could hear
gouty patients swear at their feet rheumatics at their hands
bleareyed
people at their eyes and do not those who often stub their toes blame
their feet for all their pain
               why will our catos with their frowning brows
               condemn a work of fresh simplicity
               a cheerful kindness my pure speech endows
               what people do i write to my capacity
               for who knows not the pleasures venus gives
               who will not in a warm bed tease his members
               great epicurus taught a truth that lives
               love and enjoy life  all the rest is embers
nothing can be more insincere than the silly prejudices of mankind and
nothing sillier than the morality of bigotry
chapter the one hundred and thirtythird
i called giton when i had finished my meditation tell me little
brother i demanded tell me on your honor did ascyltos stay awake
until he had exacted his will of you the night he stole you away from
me  or was he content to spend the night like a chaste widow  wiping
his eyes the lad in carefully chosen words took oath that ascyltos had
used no force against him  the truth of the matter is that i was so
distraught with my own misfortunes that i knew not what i was saying
why recall past memories which can only cause pain said i to myself
i then directed all my energies towards the recovery of my lost manhood
to achieve this i was ready even to devote myself to the gods
accordingly i went out to invoke the aid of priapus putting as good a
face upon the matter as i could i knelt upon the threshold of his shrine
and invoked the god in the following verses
              of bacchus and the nymphs companion boon
               whom fair dione set oer forests wide
               as god whom lesbos and green thasos own
               for deity whom lydians far and wide
               adore through all the seasons of the year
               whose temple in his own hypaepa placed
               thou dryads joy and bacchus hear my prayer
               to thee i come by no dark blood disgraced
               no shrine in wicked lust have i profaned
               when i was poor and worn with want i sinned
               not by intent a paupers sins not banned
               as of another  unto thee i pray
               lift thou the load from off my tortured mind
               forgive a light offense  when fortune smiles
               ill not thy glory shun and leave behind
               thy worship  unto thee a goat that feels
               his primest vigor father of the flocks
               shall come  and suckling pigs the tender young
               of some fine grunting sow  new wine in crocks
               shall foam  thy grateful praises shall be sung
               by youths who thrice shall dance around thy shrine
               happy in youth and full of this years wine
while i was engaged in this diplomatic effort in behalf of the affected
member a hideous crone with disheveled hair and clad in black garments
which were in great disorder entered the shrine and laying hands upon
me led me thoroughly frightened out into the portico
chapter the one hundred and thirtyfourth
what witches she cried have devoured your manhood  what filth did
you tread upon at some crossroads in the dark  not even by the boy
could you do your duty but weak and effeminate you are worn out like a
carthorse at a hill you have lost both labor and sweat  not content
with getting yourself into trouble you have stirred up the wrath of the
gods against me and i will make you smart for it  she then led me
unresisting back into the priestesss room pushed me down upon the bed
snatched a cane that hung upon the door and gave me another thrashing
i remained silent and had the cane not splintered at the first stroke
thereby diminishing the force of the blow she might easily have broken
my arms or my head  i groaned dismally and especially when she
manipulated my member and shedding a flood of tears i covered my head
with my right arm and huddled down upon the pillow  nor did she weep
less bitterly
the sailor naked from his foundered barque
some shipwrecked mariner seeks out to hear his woe
when hail beats down a farmers crop his cark
seeks consolation from another too
death levels caste and sufferers unites
and weeping parents are as one in grief
we also will beseech the starry heights
united prayers climb best is the belief
she seated herself upon the other side of the bed and in quavering tones
commenced to accuse the delays of old age  at last the priestess came
in  why she cried what has brought you into my cell as if you were
visiting a newly made grave  and on a feastday too when even mourners
ought to smile  oenothea the old hag replied this young man here
was born under an unlucky star he cant dispose of his goods to either
boy or girl  such an unfortunate fellow you never saw  he has no tool
at all only a piece of leather soaked in water  i wish you would tell
me what you think of a man who could get up from circes bed without
having tasted pleasure  on hearing these words oenothea sat down
between us and after shaking her head for a while im the only one
that knows how to cure that disease said she and for fear you think
im talking to hear myself talk ill just have the young fellow sleep
with me for a night and if i dont make it as hard as horn
     all that you see in the world must give heed to my mandates
     blossoming earth when i will it must languish a desert
     riches pour forth when i will it from crags and grim boulders
     waters will spurt that will rival the nile at its flooding
     seas calm their billows before me gales silence their howlings
     hearing my step  and the rivers sink into their channels
     dragons hyrcanian tigers stand fast at my bidding
     why should i tell you of small things  the image of luna
     drawn by my spells must descend and apollo atremble
     backs up his horses and turns from his course at my order
     such is the power of my word  by the rites of a virgin
     quenched is the raging of bulls and the suns daughter circe
     changed and transfigured the crew of the wily ulysses
     proteus changes his form when his good pleasure dictates
     i who am skilled in these arts can the shrubs of mount ida
     plant in the ocean turn rivers to flow up the mountains
chapter the one hundred and thirtyfifth
at this declaration which was so aweinspiring i shuddered in terror
and commenced to scrutinize the crone more narrowly  come now said
oenothea obey my orders and carefully wiping her hands she bent
over the cot and kissed me once twice  on the middle of the altar
oenothea placed an old table upon which she heaped live coals then with
melted pitch she repaired a goblet which had become cracked through age
next she replaced in the smokestained wall a peg which had come out
when she took down the wooden goblet  then having donned a mantle in
the shape of a piece of squarecut cloth she set a huge kettle upon the
hearth and at the same time speared with a fork a cloth hanging upon the
meathooks and lifted it down  it contained some beans which had been
laid away for future use and a very small and stale piece of pigs
cheek scored with a thousand slashes  when she had untied the string
which fastened the cloth she poured some of the beans upon the table and
ordered me to shell them quickly and carefully  i obey her mandate and
with careful fingers separate the beans from the filthy pods which
contain them but she accusing my clumsiness hastily snatched them and
skillfully tearing off the pods with her teeth spat them upon the
ground where they looked like dead flies  i wondered then at the
ingenuity of poverty and its expedients for emergency  so ardent a
follower of this virtue did the priestess seem that it was reflected in
everything around her  her dwelling in particular was a very shrine of
poverty
          no indian ivory set in gold gleamed here
          no trodden marble glistened here no earth
          mocked for its gifts but ceres festive grove
          with willow wickerwork twas set around
          new cups of clay by revolutions shaped
          of lowly wheel  for honey soft a bowl
          platters of green bark wickerwork a jar
          stained by the lifeblood of the god of wine
          the walls around with chaff and spattered clay
          were covered  flanging from protruding nails
          were slender stalks of the green rush and then
          suspended from the smoky beam the stores
          of this poor cottage  service berries soft
          entwined in fragrant wreaths hung down
          dried savory and raisins by the bunch
          an hostess here like she on attic soil
          of hecates pure worship worthy she
          whose fame kallimachos so grandly sang
          twill live forever through the speaking years
chapter the one hundred and thirtysixth
in the meantime having shelled the beans she took a mouthful of the
meat and with the fork was replacing the pigs cheek which was coeval
with herself upon the meathook when the rotten stool which she was
using to augment her height broke down under the old ladys weight and
let her fall upon the hearth  the neck of the pot was broken putting
out the fire which was just getting a good start her elbow was burned
by a flaming brand and her whole face was covered by the ashes raised by
her fall  i jumped up in dismay and not without laughing helped the
old lady to her feet  she hastily scurried out into the neighborhood to
replenish the fire for fear anything should delay the sacrifice  i was
on my way to the door of the cell when lo and behold three sacred geese
which were accustomed i suppose to demand their feed from the old woman
at midday made a rush at me and surrounding me made me nervous with
their abominable rabid cackling  one tore at my tunic another undid the
lacings of my sandals and tugged at them but one in particular the
ringleader and moving spirit of this savage attack did not hesitate to
worry at my leg with his serrated bill  unable to see the joke i
twisted off one of the legs of the little table and thus armed began to
belabor the pugnacious brute  nor did i rest content with a light blow
i avenged myself by the death of the goose
               twas thus i ween the birds of stymphalus
               to heaven fled by herakles impelled
               the harpies too whose reeking pinions held
               that poison which the feast of phineus
               contaminated  all the air above
               with their unwonted lamentations shook
               the heavens in uproar and confusion move
               the stars in dread their orbits then forsook
by this time the two remaining geese had picked up the beans which had
been scattered all over the floor and bereft i suppose of their leader
had gone back into the temple and i well content with my revenge and my
booty threw the dead goose behind the cot and bathed the trifling wound
in my leg with vinegar then fearing a scolding i made up my mind to
run away and collecting together all my belongings started to leave the
house  i had not yet stepped over the threshold of the cell however
when i caught sight of oenothea returning with an earthen vessel full of
live coals  thereupon i retraced my steps and throwing off my garments
i took my stand just inside the door as if i were awaiting her return
she banked her fire with broken reeds piled some pieces of wood on top
and began to excuse her delay on the ground that her friend would not
permit her to leave until after the customary three drinks had been
taken  but what were you up to in my absence  she demanded  where
are the beans  thinking that i had done a thing worthy of all praise i
informed her of the battle in all its details and that she might not be
downcast any longer i produced the dead goose in payment for her loss
when the old lady laid eyes upon that she raised such a clamor that you
would have thought that the geese had invaded the room again  confounded
and thunderstruck at the novelty of my crime i asked her why she was so
angry and why she pitied the goose rather than myself
chapter the one hundred and thirty seventh
but beating her palms together you villain are you so brazen that you
can speak  she shrieked  dont you know what a serious crime youve
committed  you have slaughtered the delight of priapus a goose the
very darling of married women  and for fear you think that nothing
serious has happened if the magistrates find this out youll go to the
cross  until this day my dwelling has been inviolate and you have
polluted it with blood  you have conducted yourself in such a manner
that any enemy i have can turn me out of the priesthood
     she spoke and from her trembling head she tore the snowwhite hair
          and scratched her cheeks her eyes shed floods of tears
     as when a torrent headlong rushes down the valleys drear
          its icy fetters gone when sprint appears
     and strikes the frozen shackles from rejuvenated earth
          so down her face the tears in torrents swept
          and wracking sobs convulsed her as she wept
please dont make such a fuss i said ill give you an ostrich in
place of your goose  while she sat upon the cot and to my
stupefaction bewailed the death of the goose proselenos came in with
the materials for the sacrifice  seeing the dead goose and inquiring the
cause of her grief she herself commenced to weep more violently still
and to commiserate me as if i had slain my own father instead of a
public goose  growing tired of this nonsense at last see here
 said i could i not purchase immunity for a price even though i had
assaulted you  even though i had murdered a man  look here  im
laying down two gold pieces you can buy both gods and geese with them
 forgive me young man said oenothea when she caught sight of the
gold i am anxious upon your account that is a proof of love not of
malignity  let us take such precautions that not a soul will find this
out  as for you pray to the gods to forgive your sacrilege
          the rich man can sail in a favoring gale
             and snap out his course at his pleasure
          a dance espouse no acrisius will rail
             his credence by hers he will measure
          write verse or declaim snap the finger of scorn
             at the world yet still win all his cases
          the rabble will drink in his words with concern
             when a cato austere it displaces
          at law his not proven or proved he can have
             with servius or labeo vieing
          with gold at command anything he may crave
             is his without asking or sighing
          the universe bows at his slightest behest
             for jove is a prisoner in his treasure chest
in the meantime she scurried around and put a jar of wine under my hands
and when my fingers had all been spread out evenly she purified them
with leeks and parsley  then muttering incantations she threw
hazelnuts into the wine and drew her conclusions as they sank or
floated but she did not hoodwink me for those with empty shells no
kernel and full of air would of course float while those that were
heavy and full of sound kernel would sink to the bottom  she then
turned her attention to the goose and cutting open the breast she
drew out a very fat liver from which she foretold my future  then for
fear any trace of the crime should remain she cut the whole goose up
stuck the pieces upon spits and served up a very delectable dinner for
me whom but a moment before she had herself condemned to death in
her own words  meanwhile cups of unmixed wine went merrily around and
the crones greedily devoured the goose which they had but so lately
lamented  when the last morsel had disappeared oenothea halfdrunk by
this time looked at me and said we must now go through with the
mysteries so that you may get back your virility
chapter the one hundred and thirtyeighth
as she said this oenothea brought out a leathern dildo which when she
had smeared it with oil ground pepper and pounded nettle seed she
commenced to force little by little up my anus  the merciless old
virago then anointed the insides of my thighs with the same decoction
finally mixing nasturtium juice with elixir of southern wood she gave my
genitals a bath and picking up a bunch of green nettles she commenced
to strike me gently all over my belly below the navel the nettles stung
me horribly and i suddenly took to my heels with the old hags in full
pursuit  although they were befuddled with wine and lust they followed
the right road and chased me through several wards screaming stop
thief  i made good my escape however although every toe was bleeding
as the result of my headlong flight  i got home as quickly as i could
and worn out with fatigue i sought my couch but i could not snatch a
wink of sleep for the evil adventures which had befallen me kept running
through my brain and brooding upon them i came to the conclusion that
no one could be so abjectly unfortunate  has fortune always inimical
to me stood in need of the pangs of love that she might torture me more
cruelly still i cried out unhappy wretch that i am  fortune and love
have joined forces to bring about my ruin  cruel eros himself had never
dealt leniently with me loved or lover i am put to the torture  take
the case of chrysis  she loves me desperately never leaves off teasing
me she who despised me as a servant because when she was acting as her
mistresss gobetween i was dressed in the garments of a slave she i
say that same chrysis who looked with contempt upon your former lowly
lot is now bent upon following it up even at the peril of her life she
swore that she would never leave my side on the day when she told me of
the violence of her passion but circe owns me heart and soul all
others i despise  who could be lovelier  than  she  what  loveliness
had ariadne or leda to compare with hers  what had helen to compare with
her what has venus  if paris himself had seen her with her dancing
eyes when he acted as umpire for the quarreling goddesses he would have
given up helen and the goddesses for her  if i could only steal a kiss
if only i might put my arms around that divine that heavenly bosom
perhaps the virility would come back to this body and the parts flaccid
from witchcraft would i believe come into their own  contempt cannot
tire me out what if i was flogged i will forget it  what if i was
thrown out  i will treat it as a joke  only let me be restored to her
good graces
     at rest on my pallet nights silence had scarce settled down
     to soothe me and eyes heavyladen with slumber to lull
     when torturing amor laid hold of me seizing my hair
     and dragging me wounding me ordered a vigil till dawn
     oh heart of stone how canst thou lie here alone said the god
     thou joy of a thousand sweet mistresses how oh my slave
     in disarrayed nightrobe i leap to bare feet and essay
     to follow all paths but a road can discover by none
     one moment i hasten the next it is torture to move
     it irks me again to turn back shame forbids me to halt
     and stand in the midst of the road  lo the voices of men
     the roar of the streets and the songs of the birds and the bark
     of vigilant watchdogs are hushed  alone i of all
     society dread both my slumber and couch and obey
     great lord of the passions thy mandate which on me was laid
chapter the one hundred and thirtyninth
such thoughts as these of lovely circes charms so wrought upon my mind
that i disordered my bed by embracing the image as it were of my
mistress but my efforts were all wasted  this obstinate affliction
finally wore out my patience and i cursed the hostile deity by whom i
was bewitched  i soon recovered my composure however and deriving
some consolation from thinking of the heroes of old who had been
persecuted by the anger of the gods i broke out in these lines
     hostile gods and implacable rate not me alone pursue
     herakles once suffered the weight of heavens displeasure too
     driven from the inachian coast laomedon of old
     sated two of the heavenly host in pelias behold
     junos power to avenge an affront and telephus took arms
     knowing not he must bear the brunt ulysses feared the storms
     angry neptune decreed as his due  now me to overwhelm
     outraged priapus ever pursues on land and nereus realm
tortured by these cares i spent the whole night in anxiety and at dawn
giton who had found out that i had slept at home entered the room and
bitterly accused me of leading a licentious life he said that the whole
household was greatly concerned at what i had been doing that i was so
rarely present to attend to my duties and that the intrigue in which i
was engaged would very likely bring about my ruin  i gathered from this
that he had been well informed as to my affairs and that someone had
been to the house inquiring for me  thereupon i began to ply giton
with questions as to whether anyone had made inquiry for me not today
 he replied but yesterday a woman came in at the door not bad looking
either and after talking to me for quite a while and wearing me out
with her farfetched conversation finally ended by saying that you
deserved punishment and that you would receive the scourging of a slave
if the injured party pressed his complaint  this news afflicted me so
bitterly that i levelled fresh recriminations against fortune and i had
not yet finished grumbling when chrysis came in and throwing herself
upon me embraced me passionately  i have you she cried just as i
hoped i would you are my hearts desire my joy you can never put out
this flame of mine unless you quench it in my blood  i was greatly
embarrassed by this wantonness of chrysis and had recourse to flattery
in order that i might rid myself of her as i feared that her passionate
outcries would reach the ears of eumolpus who in the arrogance of
success had put on the manner of the master  so on this account i did
everything i could think of to calm chrysis  i feigned love whispered
compliments in short so skillfully did i dissimulate that she believed
i was loves own captive  i showed her what pressing peril overhung us
should she be caught in that room with me as eumolpus was only too ready
to punish the slightest offense  on hearing this she left me hurriedly
and all the more quickly as she caught sight of giton who had only left
me a little before she had come in on his way to my room  she was
scarcely gone when one of the newly engaged servants rushed in and
informed me that the master was furiously angry with me because of my two
days absence from duty i would do well therefore to prepare some
plausible excuse as it was not likely that his angry passion would be
placated until someone had been flogged  seeing that i was so vexed and
disheartened giton said not a word about the woman contenting himself
with speaking of eumolpus and advising me that it would be better to
joke with him than to treat the matter seriously  i followed this lead
and appeared before the old fellow with so merry a countenance that
instead of showing severity he received me with good humor and rallied
me upon the success of my love affairs praising the elegance of my
figure which made me such a favorite with the ladies  i know very
well he went on that a lovely woman is dying for love of you
encolpius and this may come in handy for us so play your part and ill
play mine too
chapter the one hundred and fortieth
he was still speaking when in came a matron of the most exclusive
social set philumene by name who had often when young extorted many
a legacy by means of her charms but an old woman now the flower of her
beauty faded she threw her son and daughter in the way of childless old
men and through this substitution she contrived to continue her
established policy  she came to eumolpus both to commend her children
to his practical judgment and to entrust herself and her hopes to his
good nature he being the only one in all the world who could daily
instruct young children in healthy precepts  in short she left her
children in eumolpus house in order that they might hear the words that
dropped from his lips as this was the only legacy she could leave to
them  nor did she do otherwise than as she had promised but left in
his bed chamber a very beautiful daughter and her brother a lad and
pretended that she herself was compelled to go out to a temple to offer
up her vows  eumolpus who was so continent that even i was a boy in his
eyes lost no time in inviting the damsel to sacrifice to the aversa
venus but as he had told everyone that he was gouty and that his back
was weak and as he stood in danger of upsetting the whole farce if he
did not carefully live up to the pretence he therefore that the
imposture might be kept up prevailed upon the young lady to seat herself
upon that goodness which had been commended to her and ordered corax to
crawl under the bed upon which he himself was lying and after bracing
himself by putting his hands upon the floor to hoist his master up and
down with his own back  corax carried out the order in full and
skillfully seconded the wriggling of the girl with a corresponding
seesaw  then when the crisis was about due eumolpus in a ringing
voice called out to corax to increase the cadence  and thus the old
lecher suspended between his servant and his mistress enjoyed himself
just as if he were in a swing  time and again eumolpus repeated this
performance to the accompaniment of ringing laughter in which he himself
joined  at last fearing i might lose an opportunity through lack of
application i also made advances to the brother who was enjoying the
gymnastics of his sister through the keyhole to see if he would prove
amenable to assault  nor did this well trained lad reject my advances
but alas  i discovered that the god was still my enemy  however i was
not so blue over this failure as i had been over those before and my
virility returned a little later and suddenly finding myself in better
fettle i cried out great are the gods who have made me whole again
in his loving kindness mercury who conducts and reconducts the souls
has restored to me that which a hostile hand had cut away  look  you
will find that i am more graciously endowed than was protestilaus or any
other of the heroes of old  so saying i lifted up my tunic and showed
eumolpus that i was whole  at first he was startled then that he might
believe his own eyes he handled this pledge of the good will of the gods
with both hands  our good humor was revived by this blessing and we
laughed at the diplomacy of philumene and at the skill with which her
children plied their calling little likely to profit them much with us
however as it was only in hopes of coming into a legacy that she had
abandoned the boy and girl to us  meditating upon this unscrupulous
method of getting around childless old men i began to take thought of
the present state of our own affairs and made use of the occasion to warn
eumolpus that he might be bitten in biting the biters  everything that
we do i said should be dictated by prudence socrates whose
judgment was riper than that of the gods or of men used to boast that he
had never looked into a tavern nor believed the evidence of his own eyes
in any crowded assembly which was disorderly so nothing is more in
keeping than always conversing with wisdom
     live coals are more readily held in mens mouths than a secret
     whatever you talk of at home will fly forth in an instant
     become a swift rumor and beat at the walls of your city
     nor is it enough that your confidence thus has been broken
     as rumor but grows in the telling and strives to embellish
     the covetous servant who feared to make public his knowledge
     a hole in the ground dug and therein did whisper his secret
     that told of a kings hidden ears this the earth straightway
     echoed
     and rustling reeds added that midas was king in the story
every word of this is true i insisted and no one deserves to get into
trouble more quickly than he who covets the goods of others  how could
cheats and swindlers live unless they threw purses or little bags
clinking with money into the crowd for bait  just as dumb brutes are
enticed by food human beings are not to be caught unless they have
something in the way of hope at which to nibble  that was the reason
that the crotonians gave us such a satisfactory reception but the ship
does not arrive from africa with your money and your slaves as you
promised  the patience of the fortunehunters is worn out and they have
already cut down their liberality so that either i am mistaken or else
our usual luck is about to return to punish you

i have thought up a scheme replied eumolpus which will embarrass
our fortunehunting friends sorely and as he said this he drew his
tablets from his wallet and read his last wishes aloud as follows
all who are down for legacies under my will my freedmen only excepted
shall come into what i bequeath them subject to this condition that they
do cut my body into pieces and devour said pieces in sight of the crowd
nor need they be inordinately shocked for among some peoples the law
ordaining that the dead shall be devoured by their relatives is still in
force nay even the sick are often abused because they render their own
flesh worse  i admonish my friends by these presents lest they refuse
what i command that they devour my carcass with as great relish as they
damned my soul  eumolpus had just started reading the first clauses
when several of his most intimate friends entered the room and catching
sight of the tablets in his hand in which was contained his last will and
testament besought him earnestly to permit them to hear the contents
he consented immediately and read the entire instrument from first to
last  but when they had heard that extraordinary stipulation by which
they were under the necessity of devouring his carcass they were greatly
cast down but his reputation for enormous wealth dulled the eyes and
brains of the wretches and they were such cringing sycophants that they
dared not complain of the outrage in his hearing  one there was
nevertheless named gorgias who was willing to comply provided he did
not have too long to wait  to this eumolpus made answer i have no
fear that your stomach will turn it will obey orders if for one hour
of nausea you promise it a plethora of good things just shut your eyes
and pretend that its not human guts youve bolted but ten million
sesterces  and beside we will find some condiment which will disguise
the taste  no flesh is palatable of itself it must be seasoned by art
and reconciled to the unwilling stomach  and if you desire to fortify
the plan by precedents the saguntines ate human flesh when besieged by
hannibal and they had no legacy in prospect  in stress of famine the
inhabitants of petelia did the same and gained nothing from the diet
except that they were not hungry  when numantia was taken by scipio
mothers with the halfeaten bodies of their babes in their bosoms were
found  therefore since it is only the thought of eating human flesh
that makes you squeamish you must try to overcome your aversion with
all your heart so that you may come into the immense legacies i have put
you down for  so carelessly did eumolpus reel off these extravagances
that the fortunehunters began to lose faith in the validity of his
promises and subjected our words and actions to a closer scrutiny
immediately their suspicions grew with their experience and they came
to the conclusion that we were out and out grafters and thereupon those
who had been put to the greatest expense for our entertainment resolved
to seize us and take it out in just revenge but chrysis who was privy
to all their scheming informed me of the designs which the crotonians
had hatched and when i heard this news i was so terrified that i fled
instantly with giton and left eumolpus to his fate  i learned a few
days later that the crotonians furious because the old fox had lived
so long and so sumptuously at the public expense had put him to death
in the massilian manner  that you may comprehend what this means know
that whenever the massilians were ravaged by the plague one of the poor
would offer himself to be fed for a whole year upon choice food at public
charge after which decked out with olive branches and sacred vestments
he was led out through the entire city loaded with imprecations so that
he might take to himself the evils from which the city suffered and then
thrown headlong from the cliff

prostitution
there are two basic instincts in the character of the normal individual
the will to live and the will to propagate the species  it is from the
interplay of these instincts that prostitution took origin and it is for
this reason that this profession is the oldest in human experience the
first offspring as it were of savagery and of civilization  when fate
turns the leaves of the book of universal history she enters upon the
page devoted thereto the record of the birth of each nation in its
chronological order and under this record appears the scarlet entry to
confront the future historian and arrest his unwilling attention the
only entry which time and even oblivion can never efface
if prior to the time of augustus caesar the romans had laws designed to
control the social evil we have no knowledge of them but there is
nevertheless no lack of evidence to prove that it was only too well known
among them long before that happy age livy i 4 ii 18 and the
peculiar story of the bacchanalian cult which was brought to rome by
foreigners about the second century bc livy xxxix 917 and the
comedies of plautus and terence in which the pandar and the harlot are
familiar characters  cicero pro coelio chap xx says if there is
anyone who holds the opinion that young men should be interdicted from
intrigues with the women of the town he is indeed austere  that
ethically he is in the right i cannot deny but nevertheless he is at
loggerheads not only with the licence of the present age but even with
the habits of our ancestors and what they permitted themselves  for when
was this not done  when was it rebuked  when found fault with  the
floralia first introduced about 238 bc had a powerful influence in
giving impetus to the spread of prostitution  the account of the origin
of this festival given by lactantius while no credence is to be placed
in it is very interesting  when flora through the practice of
prostitution had come into great wealth she made the people her heir
and bequeathed a certain fund the income of which was to be used to
celebrate her birthday by the exhibition of the games they call the
floralia instit divin  xx 6  in chapter x of the same book he
describes the manner in which they were celebrated they were solemnized
with every form of licentiousness  for in addition to the freedom of
speech that pours forth every obscenity the prostitutes at the
importunities of the rabble strip off their clothing and act as mimes in
full view of the crowd and this they continue until full satiety comes
to the shameless lookerson holding their attention with their wriggling
buttocks  cato the censor objected to the latter part of this
spectacle but with all his influence he was never able to abolish it
the best he could do was to have the spectacle put off until he had left
the theatre  within 40 years after the introduction of this festival
p scipio africanus in his speech in defense of tib asellus said if
you elect to defend your profligacy well and good  but as a matter of
fact you have lavished on one harlot more money than the total value
as declared by you to the census commissioners of all the plenishing of
your sabine farm if you deny my assertion i ask who dare wager 1000
sesterces on its untruth  you have squandered more than a third of the
property you inherited from your father and dissipated it in debauchery
 aulus gellius noctes atticae vii 11  it was about this time that
the oppian law came up for repeal  the stipulations of this law were as
follows no woman should have in her dress above half an ounce of gold
nor wear a garment of different colors nor ride in a carriage in the
city or in any town or within a mile of it unless upon occasion of a
public sacrifice  this sumptuary law was passed during the public
distress consequent upon hannibals invasion of italy  it was repealed
eighteen years afterward upon petition of the roman ladies though
strenuously opposed by cato livy 34 1 tacitus annales 3 33  the
increase of wealth among the romans the spoils wrung from their victims
as a portion of the price of defeat the contact of the legions with the
softer more civilized more sensuous races of greece and asia minor
laid the foundations upon which the social evil was to rise above the
city of the seven hills and finally crush her  in the character of the
roman there was but little of tenderness  the wellbeing of the state
caused him his keenest anxiety  one of the laws of the twelve tables
the coelebes prohibito compelled the citizen of manly vigor to satisfy
the promptings of nature in the arms of a lawful wife and the tax on
bachelors is as ancient as the times of furius camillus  there was an
ancient law among the romans says dion cassius lib xliii which
forbade bachelors after the age of twentyfive to enjoy equal political
rights with married men  the old romans had passed this law in hope
that in this way the city of rome and the provinces of the roman
empire as well might be insured an abundant population  the increase
under the emperors of the number of laws dealing with sex is an accurate
mirror of conditions as they altered and grew worse  the jus trium
librorum under the empire a privilege enjoyed by those who had three
legitimate children consisting as it did of permission to fill
a public office before the twentyfifth year of ones age and in
freedom from personal burdens must have had its origin in the grave
apprehensions for the future felt by those in power  the fact that this
right was sometimes conferred upon those who were not legally entitled
to benefit by it makes no difference in this inference  scions of
patrician families imbibed their lessons from the skilled voluptuaries
of greece and the levant and in their intrigues with the wantons of those
climes they learned to lavish wealth as a fine art  upon their return
to rome they were but illpleased with the standard of entertainment
offered by the ruder and less sophisticated native talent they imported
greek and syrian mistresses  wealth increased its message sped in
every direction and the corruption of the world was drawn into italy as
by a loadstone  the roman matron had learned how to be a mother the
lesson of love was an unopened book and when the foreign hetairai
poured into the city and the struggle for supremacy began she soon
became aware of the disadvantage under which she contended  her natural
haughtiness had caused her to lose valuable time pride and finally
desperation drove her to attempt to outdo her foreign rivals her native
modesty became a thing of the past her roman initiative unadorned by
sophistication was often but too successful in outdoing the greek and
syrian wantons but without the appearance of refinement which they
always contrived to give to every caress of passion or avarice  they
wooed fortune with an abandon that soon made them the objects of contempt
in the eyes of their lords and masters  she is chaste whom no man has
solicited said ovid amor i 8 line 43  martial writing about
ninety years later says sophronius rufus long have i been searching
the city through to find if there is ever a maid to say no there is
not one  ep iv 71  in point of time a century separates ovid and
martial from a moral standpoint they are as far apart as the poles
the revenge then taken by asia gives a startling insight into the real
meaning of kiplings poem the female of the species is more deadly than
the male  in livy xxxiv 4 we read cato is speaking all these
changes as day by day the fortune of the state is higher and more
prosperous and her empire grows greater and our conquests extend over
greece and asia lands replete with every allurement of the senses and
we appropriate treasures that may well be called royalall this i dread
the more from my fear that such high fortune may rather master us than
we master it  within twelve years of the time when this speech was
delivered we read in the same author xxxix 6 for the beginnings of
foreign luxury were brought into the city by the asiatic army and
juvenal sat iii 6 quirites i cannot bear to see rome a greek city
yet how small a fraction of the whole corruption is found in these dregs
of achaea  long since has the syrian orontes flowed into the tiber and
brought along with it the syrian tongue and manners and crossstringed
harp and harper and exotic timbrels and girls bidden stand for hire at
the circus  still from the facts which have come down to us we cannot
arrive at any definite date at which houses of ill fame and women of the
town came into vogue at rome  that they had long been under police
regulation and compelled to register with the aedile is evident from a
passage in tacitus for visitilia born of a family of praetorian rank
had publicly notified before the aediles a permit for fornication
according to the usage that prevailed among our fathers who supposed
that sufficient punishment for unchaste women resided in the very nature
of their calling  no penalty attached to illicit intercourse or to
prostitution in general and the reason appears in the passage from
tacitus quoted above  in the case of married women however who
contravened the marriage vow there were several penalties  among them
one was of exceptional severity and was not repealed until the time of
theodosius again he repealed another regulation of the following
nature if any should have been detected in adultery by this plan she
was not in any way reformed but rather utterly given over to an increase
of her ill behaviour  they used to shut the woman up in a narrow room
admitting any that would commit fornication with her and at the moment
when they were accomplishing their foul deed to strike bells that the
sound might make known to all the injury she was suffering  the emperor
hearing this would suffer it no longer but ordered the very rooms to be
pulled down paulus diaconus hist miscel xiii 2  rent from a
brothel was a legitimate source of income ulpian law as to female
slaves making claim to heirship  procuration also had to be notified
before the aedile whose special business it was to see that no roman
matron became a prostitute  these aediles had authority to search every
place which had reason to fear anything but they themselves dared not
engage in any immorality there aulus gellius noct  attic iv 14
where an action at law is cited in which the aedile hostilius had
attempted to force his way into the apartments of mamilia a courtesan
who thereupon had driven him away with stones  the result of the trial
is as follows the tribunes gave as their decision that the aedile had
been lawfully driven from that place as being one that he ought not to
have visited with his officer  if we compare this passage with livy
xl 35 we find that this took place in the year 180 b c  caligula
inaugurated a tax upon prostitutes vectigal ex capturis as a state
impost he levied new and hitherto unheard of taxes a proportion of the
fees of prostitutesso much as each earned with one man  a clause was
also added to the law directing that women who had practiced harlotry and
men who had practiced procuration should be rated publicly and
furthermore that marriages should be liable to the rate suetonius
calig xi  alexander severus retained this law but directed that such
revenue be used for the upkeep of the public buildings that it might not
contaminate the state treasure lamprid alex severus chap 24  this
infamous tax was not abolished until the time of theodosius but the real
credit is due to a wealthy patrician florentius by name who strongly
censured this practice to the emperor and offered his own property to
make good the deficit which would appear upon its abrogation gibbon
vol 2 p 318 note  with the regulations and arrangements of the
brothels however we have information which is far more accurate  these
houses lupanaria fornices et cet were situated for the most part
in the second district of the city adler description of the city of
rome pp 144 et seq the coelimontana particularly in the suburra
that bordered the town walls lying in the carinaethe valley between
the coelian and esquiline hills  the great market macellum magnum was
in this district and many cookshops stalls barber shops et cet as
well the office of the public executioner the barracks for foreign
soldiers quartered at rome this district was one of the busiest and most
densely populated in the entire city  such conditions would naturally be
ideal for the owner of a house of ill fame or for a pandar  the regular
brothels are described as having been exceedingly dirty smelling of the
gas generated by the flame of the smoking lamp and of the other odors
which always haunted these ill ventilated dens  horace sat i 2 30
on the other hand another will have none at all except she be standing
in the evil smelling cell of the brothel petronius chap xxii worn

had slighted and of course insulted smeared lampblack all over his
face priapeia xiii 9 whoever likes may enter here smeared with the
black soot of the brothel seneca cont i 2 you reek still of the
soot of the brothel  the more pretentious establishments of the peace
ward however were sumptuously fitted up  hair dressers were in
attendance to repair the ravages wrought in the toilette by frequent
amorous conflicts and aquarioli or water boys attended at the door with
bidets for ablution  pimps sought custom for these houses and there was
a good understanding between the parasites and the prostitutes  from the
very nature of their calling they were the friends and companions of
courtesans  such characters could not but be mutually necessary to each
other  the harlot solicited the acquaintance of the client or parasite
that she might the more easily obtain and carry on intrigues with the
rich and dissipated  the parasite was assiduous in his attention to the
courtesan as procuring through her means more easy access to his
patrons and was probably rewarded by them both for the gratification
which he obtained for the vices of the one and the avarice of the other
the licensed houses seem to have been of two kinds those owned and
managed by a pandar and those in which the latter was merely an agent
renting rooms and doing everything in his power to supply his renters
with custom  the former were probably the more respectable  in these
pretentious houses the owner kept a secretary villicus puellarum or
superintendent of maids this official assigned a girl her name fixed
the price to be demanded for her favors received the money and provided
clothing and other necessities you stood with the harlots you stood
decked out to please the public wearing the costume the pimp had
furnished you seneca controv i 2  not until this traffic had become
profitable did procurers and procuresses for women also carried on this
trade actually keep girls whom they bought as slaves naked she stood
on the shore at the pleasure of the purchaser every part of her body
was examined and felt  would you hear the result of the sale  the
pirate sold the pandar bought that he might employ her as a
prostitute seneca controv lib i 2  it was also the duty of the
villicus or cashier to keep an account of what each girl earned give
me the brothelkeepers accounts the fee will suit ibid
when an applicant registered with the aedile she gave her correct name
her age place of birth and the pseudonym under which she intended
practicing her calling  plautus poen
if the girl was young and apparently respectable the official sought to
influence her to change her mind failing in this he issued her a
license licentia stupri ascertained the price she intended exacting
for her favors and entered her name in his roll  once entered there
the name could never be removed but must remain for all time an
insurmountable bar to repentance and respectability  failure to register
was severely punished upon conviction and this applied not only to the
girl but to the pandar as well  the penalty was scourging and
frequently fine and exile  notwithstanding this however the number
of clandestine prostitutes at rome was probably equal to that of the
registered harlots  as the relations of these unregistered women were
for the most part with politicians and prominent citizens it was very
difficult to deal with them effectively they were protected by their
customers and they set a price upon their favors which was commensurate
with the jeopardy in which they always stood  the cells opened upon a
court or portico in the pretentious establishments and this court was
used as a sort of reception room where the visitors waited with covered
head until the artist whose ministrations were particularly desired
as she would of course be familiar with their preferences in matters of
entertainment was free to receive them  the houses were easily found by
the stranger as an appropriate emblem appeared over the door  this
emblem of priapus was generally a carved figure in wood or stone and
was frequently painted to resemble nature more closely  the size ranged
from a few inches in length to about two feet  numbers of these
beginnings in advertising have been recovered from pompeii and
herculaneum and in one case an entire establishment even to the
instruments used in gratifying unnatural lusts was recovered intact
in praise of our modern standards of morality it should be said that it
required some study and thought to penetrate the secret of the proper use
of several of these instruments  the collection is still to be seen in
the secret museum at naples  the mural decoration was also in proper
keeping with the object for which the house was maintained and a few
examples of this decoration have been preserved to modern times their
luster and infamous appeal undimmed by the passage of centuries
over the door of each cell was a tablet titulus upon which was the name
of the occupant and her price the reverse bore the word occupata and
when the inmate was engaged the tablet was turned so that this word was
out  this custom is still observed in spain and italy  plautus asin
iv i 9 speaks of a less pretentious house when he says let her write
on the door that she is occupata  the cell usually contained a lamp
of bronze or in the lower dens of clay a pallet or cot of some sort
over which was spread a blanket or patchwork quilt this latter being
sometimes employed as a curtain petronius chap 7

interest to the antiquary and to the archoeologist  that bakers were
not slow in organizing the grist mills is shown by a passage from paulus
diaconus xiii 2 as time went on the owners of these turned the
public corn mills into pernicious frauds  for as the mill stones were
fixed in places under ground they set up booths on either side of these
chambers and caused harlots to stand for hire in them so that by these
means they deceived very manysome that came for bread others that
hastened thither for the base gratification of their wantonness  from a

paederastia
the origin of this vice all peoples savage and civilized have been
infected with it is lost in the mists which shroud antiquity  the old
testament contains many allusions to it and sodom was destroyed because
a longsuffering deity could not find ten men in the entire city who were
not addicted to its practice  so saturated was this city of the ancient
world with the vice that the very name of the city or the adjective
denoting citizenship in that city have transmitted the stigma to modern
times  that the fathers of israel were quick to perceive the tortuous
ramifications of this vice is proved by a passage in deuteronomy chap
22 verse 5 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to a man
neither shall a man put on a womans garment for all that do so are
abominations unto the lord thy god  here we have the first regulation
against fetishism and the perverted tendencies of gynandry and androgeny
inasmuch as our concern with this subject has to do with the roman world
alone a lengthy discussion of the early manifestations of this vice
would be out of place here nevertheless a brief sketch should be given
to serve as a foundation to such discussion and to aid sociologists who
will find themselves more and more concerned with the problem in view of
the conditions in european society induced by the late war  their
problem will however be more intimately concerned with homosexuality
as it is manifested among women
from remotest antiquity down to the present time oriental nations have
been addicted to this practice and it is probably from this source that
the plague spread among the greeks  i do not assert that they were
ignorant of this form of indulgence prior to their association with the
persians for nature teaches the sage as well as the savage  meier the
author of the article paederastia in ersch and gruebers encyclopedia
1837 is of the opinion that the vice had its origin among the
boeotians and john addington symonds in his essay on greek love concurs
in this view  as the two scholars worked upon the same material from
different angles and as the english writer was unacquainted with the
german savants monograph until after burton had written his terminal
essay it follows that the conclusions arrived at by these two scholars
must be worthy of credence  the greeks contemporary with the homeric
poems were familiar with paederasty and there is reason to believe that
it had been known for ages even then  greek literature from homer to
the anthology teems with references to the vice and so common was it
among them that from that fact it derived its generic greek love  so
malignant is tradition that the greeks of the present time still suffer
from the stigma as is well illustrated by the proverb current among
sailors englisha man he catcha da boy johnnie da greek he catcha da
blame  the romans are supposed to have received their first
introduction to paederasty and homosexuality generally from the
etruscans or from the greek colonists in italy but suidas tharnyris
charges the inhabitants of italy with the invention of this vice and it
would appear from athenaeus deiphnos lib xiii that the native peoples
of italy and the greek colonists as well were addicted to the most
revolting practices with boys  the case of laetorius valerius maximus
vi 1 11 proves that as early as 320 b c the romans were no
strangers to it and also that it was not common among them at that time
as the character of the primitive roman was essentially different from
that of the contemporary greek and as his struggle for existence was
severe in the extreme there was little moral obliquity during the first
two hundred and fifty years  the coelibes prohibeto of the twelve
tables was also a powerful influence in preserving chastity  by the time
of plautus however the practice of paederasty was much more general as
is clearly proved by the many references which are found in his comedies
cist iv sc 1 line 5 and passim  by the year 169 b c the vice
had so ravaged the populace that the lex scantinia was passed to control
it but legislation has never proved a success in repressing vice and the
effectiveness of this law was no exception to the rule  conditions grew
steadily worse with the passage of time and the extension of the roman
power served to inoculate the legionaries with the vices of their
victims  the destruction of corinth may well have avenged itself in
this manner  the accumulation of wealth and spoils gave the people more
leisure increased their means of enjoyment and educated their taste in
luxuries  the influx of slaves and voluptuaries from the levant aided in
the dissemination of the vices of the orient among the ruder romans  as
the first taste of blood arouses the tiger so did the limitless power of
the republic and empire react to the insinuating precepts of older and
more corrupt civilizations  the fragments of lucilius make mention of
the cinaedi in the sense that they were dancers and in the earlier
ages they were  cicero in the second philippic calls antonius a
catamite but in republican rome it is to catullus that we must turn to
find the most decisive evidence of their almost universal inclination to
sodomy  the first notice of this passage in its proper significance is
found in the burmann petronius ed 1709 here in a note on the correct
reading of intertitulos nudasque meretrices furtim conspatiantes the
ancient reading would seem to have been internuculos nudasque meretrices
furtim conspatiantes and i am not at all certain but that it is to be
preferred  burmann cites the passage from catullus epithalamium of
manlius and julia burmann sees the force of the passage but does not
grasp its deeper meaning  marchena seems to have been the first scholar
to read between the lines  see his third note
a few years later john colin  dunlop the author of a history of roman
literature which ought to be better known among the teaching fraternity
drew attention to the same passage  so striking is his comment that i
will transcribe it in full  it the poem has also been highly
applauded by the commentators and more than one critic has declared that
it must have been written by the hands of venus and the graces  i wish
however they had excepted from their unqualified panegyrics the coarse
imitation of the fescennine poems which leaves in our minds a stronger
impression of the prevalence and extent of roman vices than any other
passage in the latin classics  martial and catullus himself elsewhere
have branded their enemies and juvenal in bursts of satiric indignation
has reproached his countrymen with the most shocking crimes  but here
in a complimentary poem to a patron and intimate friend these are
jocularly alluded to as the venial indulgences of his earliest youth
 vol i p 453 second edition
this passage clearly points to the fact that it was the common custom
among the young roman patricians to have a bedfellow of the same sex
cicero in speaking of the acquittal of clodius letters to atticus lib
i 18 says having bought up and debauched the tribunal charges that
the judges were promised the favors of the young gentlemen and ladies of
rome in exchange for their services in the matter of clodius trial
manutius in a note on this passage says bought up because the judges
took their pay and held clodius innocent and absolved him debauched
because certain women and youths of noble birth were introduced by night
to not a few of them there were 56 judges as additional compensation
for their attention to duty variorum notes to cicero vol ii
pp 339340  in the priapeia the wayfarer is warned by priapus to
refrain from stealing fruit under penalty of being assaulted from the
rear and the god adds that should this punishment hold no terrors
there is still the possibility that his mentule may be used as a club by
the irate landowner  again in catullus 100 the roman paederasty
shows itself caelius loves aufilenus and quintus loves aufilena

emperors claudius was the only one whose taste in love was entirely

we come now to the bathing establishments  their history in every
country is the same in one respect the spreading and fostering of
prostitution and paederastia  cicero pro coelio accuses clodia of
having deliberately chosen the site of her gardens with the purpose of
having a look at the young fellows who came to the tiber to swim
catullus xxxiii speaks of the cimaedi who haunt the bathing
establishments suetonius tib 43 and 44 records the desperate
expedients to which tiberius had recourse to regain his exhausted
virility the scene in petronius chap 92  martial lib i 24

was to have emissaries everywhere charged with seeking out men with huge
members that they might bring them to him so that he could enjoy their
impressive proportions  the quotations given above furnish a sufficient
commentary upon the bathing establishments and the reasons for lighting
them  in happier times they were badly lighted as the apertures were
narrow and could admit but little light  seneca epist 86 describes
the bath of scipio in this bath of scipio there were tiny chinks
rather than windows cut through the stone wall so as to admit light
without detriment to the shelter afforded but men nowadays call them
bathsfornightmoths  under the empire however the bathing
establishments were open to the eye of the passerby lighted as they
were by immense windows  seneca epist 86 but nowadays any which
are disposed in such a way as to let the sunlight enter all day long
through immense windows men call bathsfornightmoths if they are not
sunburned as they wash if they cannot look out on the fields and sea
from the pavement  sweet clean baths have been introduced but the
populace is only the more foul  in former times youth and age were not
permitted to bathe together valer max  ii 7 women and men used the
same establishments but at different hours later however promiscuous
bathing was the order of the day and men and women came more and more to
observe that precept noscetur e naso quanta sit hasta viro which joan
of naples had always in mind  longnosed men were followed into the
baths and were the recipients of admiration wherever they were  as
luxury increased these establishments were fitted up with cells and
attendants of both sexes skilled in massage were always kept upon the
premises in the double capacity of masseurs and prostitutes martial

he would bring water to his lady in a silver ewer  several of the
emperors attempted to correct these evils by executive order and
legislation hadrian spartianus life of hadrian chap 18 he assigned
separate baths for the two sexes marcus aurelius capitolinus life of
marcus antoninus chap  23 he abolished the mixed baths and restrained
the loose habits of the roman ladies and the young nobles and alexander
severus lampridius life of alex severus chap  24 he forbade the
opening of mixed baths at rome a practice which though previously
prohibited heliogabalus had allowed to be observed but
notwithstanding their absolute authority their efforts along those lines
met with little better success than have those of more recent times  the
pages of martial and juvenal reek with the festering sores of the society
of that period but charidemus and hedylus still dishonor the cities of
the modern world  tatian writing in the second century says orat ad
graecos paederastia is practiced by the barbarians generally but is
held in preeminent esteem by the romans who endeavor to get together
troupes of boys as it were of brood mares and justin martyr apologia
1 has this to say first because we behold nearly all men seducing to
fornication not merely girls but males also  and just as our fathers
are spoken of as keeping herds of oxen or goats or sheep or brood
mares so now they keep boys solely for the purpose of shameful usage
treating them as females or androgynes and doing unspeakable acts  to
such a pitch of pollution has the multitude throughout the whole people
come  another sure indication of the prevalence of the vice of sodomy
is to be found in juvenal sat ii 1213 but your fundament is smooth
and the swollen haemorrhoids are incised the surgeon grinning the
while just as the physician of the nineties grinned when some young
fool came to him with a blennorrhoeal infection  the ancient jest which
accounts for the shaving of the priests crown is an inferential
substantiation of the fact that the evils of antiquity like the legal
codes have descended through the generations survived the middle ages
and been transmitted to the modern world  a perusal of the raggionamente
of pietro aretino will confirm this statement in its first premise and
the experiences of sir richard burton in the india of napier and harry
francks in spain in the present century and those of any intelligent
observer in the orient today will but bear out this hypothesis  the
native population of manila contains more than its proportion of
catamites who seek their sponsors in the botanical gardens and on the
luneta  the native quarters of the chinese cities have their houses
 where boys are kept just as the egyptian mignons stood for hire in the
lupanaria at rome  a scene in sylvia scarlett could be duplicated in any
large city of europe or america there is no necessity of appeal to
krafftebbing or havelock ellis  but there is still another and surer
method of gauging the extent of paederastic perversion at rome and that
is the richness of the latin vocabulary in terms and words bearing upon
this repulsive subject  there are in the latin language no less than
one hundred and fifteen words and expressions in general usage
but it is in martial that we are able to sense the abandoned and
cynical attitude of the roman public toward this vice the epigram upon
cantharus xi 46 is an excellent example  in commentating upon the
meticulous care with which cantharus avoided being spied upon by
irreverent witnesses the poet sarcastically remarks that such
precautions would never enter the head of anyone were it merely a
question of having a boy or a woman and he mentions them in the order
in which they are set forth here  no one dreads the limelight like the
utter debauchee as has been remarked by seneca  we find a parallel in
the old days in shanghai before the depredations of the american
hetairai had aroused the hostility of the american judge in 19078  men
of unquestioned respectability and austere asceticism were in the habit
of making periodic trips to this pornographic mecca for the reason that
they could there be accommodated with the simultaneous ministrations of
two or even three soiled doves of the stripe of her of whom martial ix
69 makes caustic mention
i passed the whole night with a lascivious girl whose naughtiness none
could surpass  tired of a thousand methods of indulgence i begged the
boyish favor she granted my prayers before they were finished before
even the first words were out of my mouth  smiling and blushing i
besought her for something worse still she voluptuously promised it at
once  but to me she was chaste  but aeschylus she will not be so to
you take the boon if you want it but she will attach a condition  in
all that could pertain to accomplished skill in their profession the
limit was the ceiling they were there to serve and serve they did
as long as the recipient of their ministrations was willing to pay or as
long as his chits were good  with them secrecy was the watchword
tiberius probably more sinned against than sinning he has had an able
defender in beasley is charged by suetonius with the invention of an
amplification and refinement of this vice  the performers were called
spinthriae a word which signified bracelet  these copulators could
be of both sexes though the true usage of the word allowed but one and
that the male  they formed a chain each link of which was an individual
in sexual contact with one or two other links in this diversion the
preference seems to have been in favor of odd numbers martial xii 44

chapter 9  gladiator obscene
the arena of his activities is however that of venus and not mars
petronius is fond of figurative language and in several other passages
he has made use of the slang of the arena chap  61  i used to fence
with my mistress herself until even the master grew suspicious and
again in chapter 19 he says then too we were girded higher and i
had so arranged matters that if we came to close quarters i myself would
engage quartilla ascyltos the maid and giton the girl
dufour in commentating upon this expression histoire de la
prostitution vol iii pp 92 and 93 remarks it is necessary to see in
petronius the abominable role which the obscene gladiator played but
the latin itself is clear enough to describe all the secrets of the roman
debauch  for some women says petronius in another passage will
only kindle for canaille and cannot work up an appetite unless they see
some slave or runner with his clothing girded up a gladiator arouses
one or a mule driver all covered with dust or some actor posturing in
some exhibition on the stage  my mistress belongs to this class she
jumps the fourteen rows from the stage to the gallery and looks for a
lover among the gallery gods at the back

universal depravity of rome and the smaller cities men were so worn out
by repeated vicious indulgences that it was no easy matter for a woman to
obtain satisfaction at their hands

but the crowning piece of infamy is to be found in martials three
epigrams upon his wife  they speak as distinctly as does the famous
passage in catullus epithalamium of manilius and julia or vibia as
later editors have it
wife away or conform to my habits  i am no curius numa or tatius
i like to have the hours of night prolonged in luscious cups  you drink
water and are ever for hurrying from the table with a sombre mien you
like the dark i like a lamp to witness my pleasures and to tire my
loins in the light of dawn  drawers and night gowns and long robes cover
you but for me no girl can be too naked  for me be kisses like the
cooing doves your kisses are like those you give your grandmother in

movements or your sighs or your hand you behave as if you were taking
the sacrament  the phrygian slaves masturbated themselves behind the

chapter 26  quartilla applied a curious eye to a chink purposely made
watching their childish dalliance with lascivious attention
martial xi 46 makes mention of the fact that patrons of houses of ill
fame had reason to beware of needle holes in the walls through which
their misbehaviour could be appreciatively scrutinized by outsiders and
in the passage of our author we find yet another instance of the same
kind  one is naturally led to recall the peephouses which were a
feature of city life in the nineties  there was a notorious one in
chicago and another in san francisco  a beautiful girl exquisitely
dressed would entice the unwary stranger into her room there the couple
would disrobe and the hero was compelled to have recourse to the right
of capture before executing the purpose for which he entered the house
the entertainment usually cost him nothing beyond a moderate fee and a
couple of bottles of beer or wine if he so desired  the management
 secured its profit from a different and more prurient source  the male
actor in this drama was sublimely ignorant of the fact that the walls
were plentifully supplied with peepholes through which appreciative
onlookers witnessed his corybantics at one dollar a head  there would
sometimes be as many as twenty such witnesses at a single performance
chapter 34  silver skeleton et seq
philosophic dogmas concerning the brevity and uncertainty of life were
ancient even in the time of herodotus  they have left their mark upon
our language in the form of more than one proverb but in none is this
so patent as the skeleton at the feast  in chapter lxxviii of euterpe
we have an admirable citation  in speaking of the egyptians he says
at their convivial banquets among the wealthy classes when they have
finished supper a man carries round in a coffin the image of a dead body
carved in wood made as lifelike as possible in color and workmanship
and in size generally about one or two cubits in length and showing this
to each of the company he says look upon this then drink and enjoy
yourself for when dead you will be like this  this is the practice
they have at their drinking parties  according to plutarch isis and
osiris chapter 17 the greeks adopted this egyptian custom and there
is of course little doubt that the romans took it from the greeks
the aim of this custom was according to scaliger to bring the diners
to enjoy the sweets of life while they were able to feel enjoyment and
thus to abandon themselves to pleasure before death deprived them of
everything  the verses which follow bring this out beautifully  in the
copa of virgil we find the following
wine there  wine and dice  tomorrows fears shall fools alone benumb
by the ear death pulls me  live he whispers softly live i come
the practical philosophy of the indefatigable roues sums itself up in
this sentence uttered by trimalchio  the verb vivere has taken a
meaning very much broader and less special than that which it had at
the time when it signified only the material fact of existence  the
voluptuaries of old rome were by no means convinced that life without
license was life  the women of easy virtue living within the circle
of their friendships after the fashion best suited to their desires
understood that verb only after their own interpretation and the
philologists soon reconciled themselves to the change  in this sense it
was that varro employed vivere when he said young women make haste
to live you whom adolescence permits to enjoy to eat to love and to
occupy the chariot of venus veneris tenere bigas
but a still better example of the extension in the meaning of this word
is to be found in an inscription on the tomb of a lady of pleasure  this
inscription was composed by a voluptuary of the school of petronius
              aliae  restitvtae  animae  dvlcissimae
             bellator  avg  lib  conivgi  carissimae
                    amici  dvm  vivimvs  vivamus
in this inscription it is almost impossible to translate the last three
words  while we live let us live is inadequate to say the least
so far did this doctrine go that latterly it was deemed necessary to have
a special goddess as a patron  that goddess if we may rely upon the
authority of festus took her name vitula from the word vita or from
the joyous life over which she was to preside
chapter 36  at the corners of the tray we also noted four figures of
marsyas and from their bladders spouted a highly seasoned sauce upon fish
which were swimming about as if in a tiderace
german scholars have adopted the doctrine that marsyas belonged to that
mythological group which they designate as schlauchsilen or as we
would say in english wineskinbearing silenuses  their hypothesis
seems to be based upon the discovery of two beautiful basreliefs of the
age of vespasian which were excavated near the rostra vetera in the
forum  sir theodore martin has a note on these basreliefs which i quote
in extenso
in the forum stood a statue of marsyas apollos illstarred rival  it
probably bore an expression of pain which horace humorously ascribes to
dislike of the looks of the younger novius who is conjectured to have
been of the profession and nature of shylock  a naked figure carrying a
wineskin which appears upon each of two fine basreliefs of the time of
vespasian found near the rostra vetera in the forum during the
excavations conducted within the last few years by signor pietro rosa
and which now stand in the forum is said by archaeologists to
represent marsyas  why they arrive at this conclusion except as
arguing from the spot where these basreliefs were found that they were
meant to perpetuate the remembrance of the old statue of marsyas is
certainly not very apparent from anything in the figure itself
 martins horace vol 2 pp  1456
hence german philologists render utriculis by the german equivalent for
wineskins
the romans says weitzius had two sources of watersupply through
underground channels and through channels supported by arches  as
adjuncts to these channels there were cisterns or castella as they were
called  from these reservoirs the water was distributed to the public
through routes more or less circuitous and left the cisterns through
pipes the diameter of which was reckoned in either twelfths or
sixteenths of a roman foot  at the exits of the pipes were placed stones
or stone figures the water taking exit from these figures either by the
mouth private parts or elsewhere and falling either to the ground or
into some stone receptacle such as a basket  various names were given
these statuettes marsyae satyri atlantes hermae chirones silani
tulii
no one who has been through the secret museum at naples will find much
difficulty in recalling a few of these heavily endowed examples to mind
and our author in choosing marsyae adds a touch of sarcastic realism
for statues of marysas were often set up in free cities symbolical as
it were of freedom  in such a setting as the present they would be the
very acme of propriety
the figures says gonzala de salas formerly placed at fountains and
from which water took exit either from the mouth or from some other part
took their forms from the several species of satyrs  the learned
wouweren has commented long and learnedly upon this passage and his
emendation veretriculis caused me to laugh heartily  and as a matter
of fact i affirm that such a meaning is easily possible  professor e
p crowell the first american scholar to edit petronius gravely states
in his preface that the object of this edition is to provide for
classroom use an expurgated text and i note that he has tactfully
omitted the wineskins from his edition
in this connection the last sentence in the remarks of wouweren alluded
to above is strangely to the point  after stating his emendation of
veretriculis or veretellis for utriculis he says unless someone
proves that images of marsyas were fashioned in the likeness of
bagpipers a fine instance of clarity of vision for so dark an age

in the winter of 1895 a dinner was given in a new york studio  this
dinner locally known as the girl in the pie dinner was based upon
petronius martial and the thirteenth book of athenaeus  in the summer
of 1919 i had the questionable pleasure of interviewing the chefcaterer
who got it up and he was at the time engaged in trying to work out
another masterpiece to be given in california  the studio one of the
most luxurious in the world was transformed for the occasion into a
veritable rose grotto the statuary was pompeian and here and there
artistic posters were seen which were nothing if not reminiscent of
boulevard clichy and montmartre in the palmiest days  four negro banjo
players and as many jubilee singers titillated the jaded senses of the
guests in a manner achieved by the infamous saxophone syncopating jazz of
the barbary coast of our times  the dinner was over  the four and one
half bottles of champagne allotted to each silenus had been consumed and
a welldefined atmosphere of bored satiety had begun to settle down when
suddenly the oldfashioned lullaby four and twenty blackbirds broke
forth from the banjoists and singers  four waiters came in bearing a
surprisingly monstrous object something that resembled an impossibly
large pie  they placed it carefully in the center of the table  the
negro chorus swelled louder and louderfour and twenty blackbirds baked
in a pie
the diners startled into curiosity and then into interest began to poke
their noses against this gigantic creation of the baker  in it they
detected a movement not unlike a chicks feeble pecking against the shell
of an egg  a quicker movement and the crust ruptured at the top
a flash of black gauze and delicate flesh showed within  a cloud of
frightened yellow canaries flew out and perched on the picture frames and
even on the heads and shoulders of the guests
but the lodestone which drew and held the eyes of all the revellers was
an exquisitely slender girlish figure amid the broken crust of the pie
the figure was draped with spangled black gauze through which the girls
marble white limbs gleamed like ivory seen through gauze of gossamer
transparency  she rose from her crouching posture like a wood nymph
startled by a satyr glanced from one side to the other and stepped
timidly forth to the table
chapter 56  contumeliacontus and melon malum

fact that the word is used in a very different sense in priapeia x 3

which lay behind the gift of an apple or the acceptance of one  the
truth of this may be established by many passages in the ancient writers

and proprieties which should in govern the education and conduct of the

angry with her lover and in no mood to mince matters in the slightest
aristxnetus xxv furnishes yet another excellent illustration
the prostitute philanis in writing to a friend of the same ancient
profession accuses her sister of alienating her lovers affections
i avail myself of sheridans masterly version
                     philanis to petala
               as yesterday i went to dine
               with pamphilus a swain of mine
               i took my sister little heeding
               the net i for myself was spreading
               though many circumstances led
               to prove shed mischief in her head
               for first her dress in every part
               was studied with the nicest art
               deckd out with necklaces and rings
               and twenty other foolish things
               and she had curld and bound her hair
               with more than ordinary care
               and then to show her youth the more
               a light transparent robe she wore
               from head to heel she seemed tadmire
               in raptures all her fine attire
               and often turnd aside to view
               if others gazed with rapture too
               at dinner grown more bold and free
               she parted pamphilus and me
               for veering round unheard unseen
               she slily drew her chair between
               then with alluring amrous smiles
               and nods and other wanton wiles
               the unsuspecting youth insnared
               and rivalld me in his regard
               next she affectedly would sip
               the liquor that had touched his lip
               he whose whole thoughts to love incline
               and heated with th enlivning wine
               with interest repaid her glances
               and answerd all her kind advances
               thus sip they from the goblets brink
               each others kisses while they drink
               which with the sparkling wine combind
               quick passage to the heart did find
               then pamphilus an apple broke
               and at her bosom aimd the stroke
               while she the fragment kissd and pressd
               and hid it wanton in her breast
               but i be sure was in amaze
               to see my sisters artful ways
               these are returns i said quite fit
               to me who nursed you when a chit
               for shame lay by this envious art
               is this to act a sisters part
                but vain were words entreaties vain
               the crafty witch secured my swain
               by heavens my sister does me wrong
               but oh she shall not triumph long
               well venus knows im not in fault
               twas she who gave the first assault
               and since our peace her treachry broke
               let me return her stroke for stroke
               shell quickly feel and to her cost
               not all their fire my eyes have lost
               and soon with grief shall she resign
               six of her swains for one of mine
the myth of cydippe and acontius is still another example as is the
legend of atalanta and hippomenes or meilanion to which suetonius
tiberius chap 44 has furnished such an unexpected climax  the
emperor theodosius ordered the assassination of a gallant who had given
the queen an apple  as beliefs of this type are an integral part of the
character of the lower orders i am certain that the passage in petronius
is not devoid of sarcasm and if such is the case contus cannot be
rendered pole  the etymology of the word contumely is doubtful but i
am of the opinion that the derivation suggested here is not unsound  a
recondite rendering of contus would surely give a sharper point to the
joke and furnish the riddle with the sting of an epigram
chapter 116  you will see a town that resembles the fields in time of
pestilence
in tracing this savage caricature petronius had in mind not crotona
alone he refers to conditions in the capital of the empire  the
descriptions which other authors have set down are equally remarkable for
their powerful coloring and they leave us with an idea of rome which is
positively astounding in its unbridled luxury  we will rest content
with offering to our readers the following portrayal quoted from
ammianus marcellinus lib xiv chap 6 and lib  xxviii chap  4 will
not presume to attempt any translation after having read gibbons version
of the combination of these two chapters
the greatness of rome was founded on the rare and almost incredible
alliance of virtue and of fortune  the long period of her infancy was
employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of italy the
neighbors and enemies of the rising city  in the strength and ardor of
youth she sustained the storms of war carried her victorious arms beyond
the seas and the mountains and brought home triumphal laurels from every
country of the globe  at length verging towards old age and sometimes
conquering by the terror only of her name she sought the blessings of
ease and tranquillity  the venerable city which had trampled on the
necks of the fiercest nations and established a system of laws the
perpetual guardians of justice and freedom was content like a wise and
wealthy parent to devolve on the caesars her favorite sons the care of
governing her ample patrimony  a secure and profound peace such as had
been once enjoyed in the reign of numa succeeded to the tumults of a
republic while rome was still adored as the queen of the earth and the
subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty
of the senate  but this native splendor is degraded and sullied by the
conduct of some nobles who unmindful of their own dignity and of that
of their country assume an unbounded license of vice and folly  they
contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames and
curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations
reburrus or fabunius pagonius or tarrasiuswhich may impress the ears
of the vulgar with astonishment and respect  from a vain ambition of
perpetuating their memory they affect to multiply their likeness in
statues of bronze and marble nor are they satisfied unless those statues
are covered with plates of gold an honorable distinction first granted
to achilius the consul after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the
power of king antiochus  the ostentation of displaying of magnifying
perhaps the rentroll of the estates which they possess in all the
provinces from the rising to the setting sun provokes the just
resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible
ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the
delicacy of their food or the splendor of their apparel  but the modern
nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of
their chariots and the weighty magnificence of their dress  their long
robes of silk and purple float in the wind and as they are agitated by
art or accident they occasionally discover the undergarments the rich
tunics embroidered with the figures of various animals  followed by a
train of fifty servants and tearing up the pavement they move along the
streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with
posthorses and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the
matrons and ladies whose covered carriages are continually driving
round the immense space of the city and suburbs  whenever these persons
of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths they assume
on their entrance a tone of loud and insolent command and appropriate
to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the roman
people  if in these places of mixed and general resort they meet any
of the infamous ministers of their pleasures they express their
affection by a tender embrace while they proudly decline the
salutations of their fellowcitizens who are not permitted to aspire
above the honor of kissing their hands or their knees  as soon as they
have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath they resume
their rings and the other ensigns of their dignity select from their
private wardrobe of the finest linen such as might suffice for a dozen
persons the garments the most agreeable to their fancy and maintain
till their departure the same haughty demeanor which perhaps might have
been excused in the great marcellus after the conquest of syracuse
sometimes indeed these heroes undertake more arduous achievements
they visit their estates in italy and procure themselves by the toil
of servile hands the amusements of the chase  if at any time but more
especially on a hot day they have courage to sail in their galleys from
the lucrine lake to their elegant villas on the seacoast of puteoli and
the caieta they compare their own expeditions to the marches of caesar
and alexander yet should a fly presume to settle on the silken folds of
their gilded umbrellas should a sunbeam penetrate through some
unguarded and imperceptible chink they deplore their intolerable
hardships and lament in affected language that they were not born in
the land of the cimmerians the regions of eternal darkness  in these
journeys into the country the whole body of the household marches with
their master  in the same order as the cavalry and infantry the heavy
and the light armed troops the advanced guard and the rear are
marshalled by the skill of their military leaders so the domestic
officers who bear a rod as an ensign of authority distribute and
arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants  the baggage and
wardrobe move in the front and are immediately followed by a multitude
of cooks and inferior ministers employed in the service of the kitchens
and of the table  the main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of
slaves increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent
plebeians  the rear is closed by the favorite band of eunuchs
distributed from age to youth according to the order of seniority
their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant
spectators who are ready to execrate the memory of semiramis for the
cruel art which she invented of frustrating the purposes of nature and
of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations  in the exercise
of domestic jurisdiction the nobles of rome express an exquisite
sensibility for any personal injury and a contemptuous indifference for
the rest of the human species  when they have called for warm water if
a slave has been tardy in his obedience he is instantly chastised with
three hundred lashes but should the same slave commit a wilful murder
the master will mildly observe that he is a worthless fellow but that
if he repeats the offense he shall not escape punishment  hospitality
was formerly the virtue of the romans and every stranger who could
plead either merit or misfortune was relieved or rewarded by their
generosity  at present if a foreigner perhaps of no contemptible
rank is introduced to one of the proud and wealthy senators he is
welcomed indeed in the first audience with such warm professions and
such kind inquiries that he retires enchanted with the affability of his
illustrious friend and full of regret that he had so long delayed his
journey to rome the native seat of manners as well as of empire
secure of a favorable reception he repeats his visit the ensuing day
and is mortified by the discovery that his person his name and his
country are already forgotten  if he still has resolution to persevere
he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents and obtains the
permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty
patron incapable of gratitude or friendship who scarcely deigns to
remark his presence his departure or his return  whenever the rich
prepare a solemn and popular entertainment whenever they celebrate with
profuse and pernicious luxury their private banquets the choice of the
guests is the subject of anxious deliberation  the modest the sober
and the learned are seldom preferred and the nomenclators who are
commonly swayed by interested motives have the address to insert in the
list of invitations the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind
but the frequent and familiar companions of the great are those
parasites who practice the most useful of all arts the art of flattery
who eagerly applaud each word and every action of their immortal patron
gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements and
strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider
as a part of his personal merit  at the roman tables the birds the
dormice or the fish which appear of an uncommon size are contemplated
with curious attention a pair of scales is accurately applied to
ascertain their real weight and while the more rational guests are
disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition notaries are summoned to
attest by an authentic record the truth of such a marvellous event
another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great
is derived from the profession of gaming or as it is more politely
styled of play  the confederates are united by a strict and
indissoluble bond of friendship or rather of conspiracy a superior
degree of skill in the tesserarian art is a sure road to wealth and
reputation  a master of that sublime science who in a supper or an
assembly is placed below a magistrate displays in his countenance the
surprise and indignation which cato might be supposed to feel when he
was refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people  the
acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of the nobles who
abhor the fatigue and disdain the advantages of study and the only
books which they peruse are the satires of juvenal and the verbose and
fabulous histories of marius maximus  the libraries which they have
inherited from their fathers are secluded like dreary sepulchres from
the light of day  but the costly instruments of the theatreflutes and
enormous lyres and hydraulic organsare constructed for their use and
the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in
the palaces of rome  in those palaces sound is preferred to sense and
the care of the body to that of the mind  it is allowed as a salutary
maxim that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady is
of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends
and even the servants who are dispatched to make the decent inquiries
are not suffered to return home till they have undergone the ceremony of
a previous ablution  yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally
yields to the more imperious passion of avarice  the prospect of gain
will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as spoleto every sentiment of
arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance or even
of a legacy and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the
romans  the art of obtaining the signature of a favorable testament
and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution is perfectly
understood and it has happened that in the same house though in
different apartments a husband and a wife with the laudable design of
overreaching each other have summoned their respective lawyers to
declare at the same time their mutual but contradictory intentions  the
distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury often reduces
the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients  when they
desire to borrow they employ the base and supplicating style of the
slave in the comedy but when they are called upon to pay they assume
the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of hercules  if the
demand is repeated they readily procure some trusty sycophant
instructed to maintain a charge of poison or magic against the insolent
creditor who is seldom released from prison till he has signed a
discharge for the whole debt  these vices which degrade the moral
character of the romans are mixed with a puerile superstition that
disgraces their understanding  they listen with confidence to the
predictions of haruspices who pretend to read in the entrails of
victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity and there are many
who do not presume either to bathe or to dine or to appear in public
till they have diligently consulted according to the rules of
astrology the situation of mercury and the aspect of the moon  it is
singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among
the profane sceptics who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a
celestial power
chapter 116  they either take in or else they are taken in
captare may be defined as to get the upper hand of someone and
captari means to be the dupe of someone to be the object of interested
flattery captator means a succession of successful undertakings of the
sort referred to above  martial lib vi 63 addresses the following
verses to a certain marianus whose inheritance had excited the avarice
of one of the intriguers
               you know youre being influenced
               you know the misers mind
               you know the miser and you sensed
               his purpose still youre blind
pliny the elder historia naturalis lib  xiv chap i writes in
scathing terms against the infamous practice of paying assiduous court
to old people for the purpose of obtaining a legacy under their wills
later childlessness conferred advantages in the shape of the greatest
authority and lower undue influence became very insidious in its quest
of wealth and in grasping the joyous things alone debasing the true
rewards of life and all the liberal arts operating for the greatest good
were turned to the opposite purpose and commenced to profit by
sycophantic subservience alone
and ammianus marcellinus lib xviii chap 4 remarks some there are
that grovel before rich men old men or young childless or unmarried or
even wives and children for the purpose of so influencing their wishes
and them by deft and dextrous finesse
that this profession of legacy hunting is not one of the lost arts is
apparent even in our day for the term undue influence is as common in
our courts as ambrose bierces definition of husband or refined
cruelty or injunctions restraining husbands from disposing of
property or separate maintenance or even heart balm and the
consequent breach of promise
chapter 119  the rite of the persians
castration has been practiced from remote antiquity and is a feature of
the harem life of the levant to the present day  semiramis is accused of
having been the first to order the emasculation of a troupe of her boy
slaves
whether the first false likeness of men came to the assyrians through
the ingenuity of semiramis for these wanton wretches with high timbered
voices could not have produced themselves those smooth cheeks could not
reproduce themselves she gathered their like about her or parthian
luxury forbade with its knife the shadow of down to appear and fostered
long that boyish bloom compelling artretarded youth to sink to venus
calling claudianus eutrop i 339 seq
and last of all the multitude of eunuchs ranging in age from old men
to boys pale and hideous from the twisted deformity of their features
so that go where one will seeing groups of mutilated men he will
detest the memory of semiramis that ancient queen who was the first to
emasculate young men of tender age thwarting the intent of nature and
forcing her from her course  ammianus marcellinus book xiv chap vi
the old testament proves that the hebrew authorities of the time were no
strangers to the abomination but no mention of eunuchs in judea itself
is to be found prior to the time of josiah  castration was forbidden the
jews deuteronomy xxiii 1 but as this book was probably unknown before
the time of josiah we can only conjecture as to the attitude of the
patriarchs in regard to this subject we are safe however in inferring
that it was hostile  periander son of cypselus had sent three hundred
youths of the noblest young men of the corcyraeans to alyattes at
sardis for the purpose of emasculation  herodotus iii chapter 48
hermotimus then was sprung from these pedasians and of all men we
know revenged himself in the severest manner for an injury he had
received for having been captured by an enemy and sold he was
purchased by one panionius a chian who gained a livelihood by the most
infamous practices for whenever he purchased boys remarkable for their
beauty having castrated them he used to take them to sardis and ephesus
and sell them for large sums for with the barbarians eunuchs are more
valued than others on account of their perfect fidelity  panionius
therefore had castrated many others as he made his livelihood by this
means and among them this man
hermotimus however was not in every respect unfortunate for he went
to sardis along with other presents for the king and in process of time
was the most esteemed by xerxes of all his eunuchs
when the king was preparing to march his persian army against athens
hermotimus was at sardis having gone down at that time upon some
business or other to the mysian territory which the chians possess and
is called atarneus he there met with panionius  having recognized him
he addressed many friendly words to him first recounting the many
advantages he had acquired by this means and secondly promising him how
many favors he would confer upon him in requital if he would bring his
family and settle there so that panionius joyfully accepted the proposal
and brought his wife and children  but when hermotimus got him with his
whole family into his power he addressed him as follows
o thou who of all mankind hast gained thy living by the most
infamous acts what harm had either i or any of mine done to thee
or any of thine that of a man thou hast made me nothing
thou didst imagine surely that thy machinations would pass unnoticed
by the gods who following righteous laws have enticed thee who hath
committed unholy deeds into my hands so that thou canst not complain of
the punishment i shall inflict upon thee
when he had thus upbraided him his sons being brought into his
presence panionius was compelled to castrate his own sons who were four
in number and being compelled he did it and after he had finished it
his sons being compelled castrated him  thus did vengeance and
hermotimus overtake panionius  herodotus viii ch 1056
mention of the galli the emasculated priests of cybebe should be made
emasculation was a necessary first condition of service in her worship
catullus attys  the latin literature of the silver and bronze ages
contains many references to castration  juvenal and martial have
lavished bitter scorn upon this form of degradation and suetonius and
statius inform us that domitian prohibited the practice but it is in the
amoures attributed to lucian that we find a passage so closely akin to
the one forming a basis of this note that it is inserted in extenso
some pushed their cruelty so far as to outrage nature with the
sacrilegious knife and after depriving men of their virility found in
them the height of pleasure  these miserable and unhappy creatures that
they may the longer serve the purposes of boys are stunted in their
manhood and remain a doubtful riddle of a double sex neither preserving
that boyhood in which they were born nor possessing that manhood which
should be theirs  the bloom of their youth withers away in a premature
old age while yet boys they suddenly become old without any interval
of manhood  for impure sensuality the mistress of every vice devising
one shameless pleasure after another insensibly plunges into
unmentionable debauchery experienced in every form of brutal lust  the
jealous roman husbands furious desire to prevent the consequences of his
wifes incontinence was by no means well served by the use of such
agents on the contrary the women themselves profited by the
arrangement  by means of these eunuchs they edited the morals of their
maids and hampered the sodomitical hankerings active or otherwise of
their husbands martial xii 54 but when the passions and suspicions of
both heads of the family were mutually aroused the eunuchs fanned them
into flame and gained the ascendancy in the home  they even went so far
as to marry martial xi 82 and juvenal i 22
in the third century a certain valesius formed a sect which following
the example set by origen acted literally upon the text of matthew v
28 30 and matthew xix 12  of this sect augustine de heres chap
37 said the valesians castrate themselves and those who partake of
their hospitality thinking that after this manner they ought to serve
god  that injustice was done upon the wrong member is very evident yet
in an age so dark so dominated by austere asceticism this clean cut
perception of the best interests of suffering humanity is only to be
rivalled by the french physician in the time of the black plague  he had
observed that sthenic patients when bled died the superstition and
medical usage of the age prescribed bleeding and when the fat abbots
came to be bled he bled them freely and with satisfaction  justinian
decreed that anyone guilty of performing the operation which deprived an
individual of virility should be subjected to a similar operation and
this crime was later punished with death  in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries we encounter another and even viler reason for this
practice that the voice of such a person one castrated in boyhood
after arriving at adult age combines the high range and sweetness of
the female with the power of the male voice had long been known and
italian singing masters were not slow in putting this hint to practical
use  the poor sometimes sold their children for this purpose and the
castrati and soprani are terms well known to the musical historian
these artificial voices disgraced the italian stage until literally
driven from it by public hostility and the punishment of death was the
reward of the individual bold enough to perform such an operation  the
papal authority excommunicated those guilty of the crime and those upon
whom such an operation had been performed but received artificial
voices which were the result of accident into the sistine choir
this pretext served the church well and until the year 1878 when
the disgrace was wiped out by pope leo xiii the sistine choir was an
eloquent commentary upon the attitude of an institution placed as it
were between love and duty  it should be recorded that this choir in
its recent visit to the united states had but one artificial voice and
its owner was the oldest member of the choir
young homeborn slaves were bought up by the dealers castrated because
of the increased price they brought when in this condition and sold for
huge sums seneca controv x chap 4 and kidnapping was frequently
resorted to just as it is in africa today
in russia there is a sect called the skoptzi whose tenets in this
respect are indicated by their name  this sect is first mentioned in
the person of a certain adrian a monk who came to russia about the
year 1001  in 1041 l090 to 1096 1138 to 1147 1326 they are noticed
and in 1721 to 1724 they are prominent  they call themselves white
doves and are divided into smaller congregations which in their
allegorical terminology they call ships the leader of each
congregation is called the pilot and the female leader the pilots
mate  their tenets provide for two degrees of emasculation complete
and incomplete and in the case of the former he who submitted to the
operation had the royal seal affixed to him this being their name for
complete emasculation in the case of the latter the neophyte had
reached the second degree of purity  the operation was performed with
a redhot knife or a hot iron and this was known as the baptism by
fire
in the case of female converts the breasts were amputated either with a
redhot knife or a pair of redhot shears kudrin trial moscow 1871
testimony of physicians and examination of the accused which served the
double purpose of checking haemorrhage as would a thermocautery and
avoiding infection  another method consisted in searing the orifice of
the vagina so that the scar tissue would contract it in such a manner as
to effectually prevent the entrance of the male
a peculiar attribute of this sect is the character of many of its
members bankers civil service officials navy officers army officers
and others of the finest professions  leroybeaulieu in discussing
their methods of obtaining converts says they prefer boys and youths
whom they strive to convince of the necessity of killing the flesh
they sometimes succeed so well that cases are known of boys of fifteen
or so resorting to selfmutilation to save themselves from the
temptations of early manhood  these apostles of purity do not always
scruple to have recourse to violence or deceit  they ensnare their
victims by equivocal forms of speech and having thus obtained their
consent virtually upon false pretences they reveal to the confiding
dupes the real meaning of the engagement they have entered into only at
the last moment when it is too late for them to escape the murderous
knife  one evening two men one of them young and blooming the other
old with sallow and unnaturally smooth face were conversing while
sipping their tea in a house in moscow  virgins will alone stand
before the throne of the most high said the elder man  he who looks
on a woman with desire commits adultery in his heart and adulterers
shall not enter the kingdom of heaven  what then should we sinners
doe asked the young man  knowest thou not replied the elder the
word of the lord  if thy right eye leadeth thee into temptation pluck
it out and cast it from thee if thy right hand leadeth thee into
temptation cut it off and cast it from thee  what ye must do is to kill
the flesh  ye must become like unto the disembodied angels and that may
be attained only through being made white as snow and how can we be
made thus white further inquired the young man  come and see said
the old man  he took his companion down many stairs into a cellar
resplendent with lights  some fifteen white robed men and women were
gathered there  in a corner was a stove in which blazed a fire  after
some prayers and dances very like those in use among the flagellants
the old man announced to his companion now shalt thou learn how sinners
are made white as snow and the young man before he had time to ask a
single question was seized and gagged his eyes were bandaged he was
stretched out on the ground and the apostle with a redhot knife
stamped him with the seal of purity this happened to a peasant
saltykov by name and certainly not to him alone  he fainted away under
the operation and when he came to himself he heard the voices of his
chaste sponsors give him the choice between secrecy and death
catherine ii signed the first edict against this sect in 1772 but
agitation was more or less constant until the imperial government began
vigorous prosecutions in 1871 and many were sentenced to hard labor in
siberia  when prosecutions were instituted large numbers emigrated to
roumania and there took the name of lipovans  women especially one of
the name of anna romanovna have had a great share in the invention and
diffusion of the doctrine  not infrequently it is the women who with
their own hands transform the men to angels
in 1871 their number was estimated to be about 3000 in 1874 they
numbered 5444 including 1465 women and in 1847 515 men and 240 women
were transported to siberia  the sect still holds its own in russia
they are millennarians and the messiah will not come for them until their

another exquisite and illuminating passage occurs in catullus 51 given
in marchenas fourth note
chapter 131  then she kneaded dust and spittle and dipping her middle
finger into the mixture she crossed my forehead with it
since the fairy tale era of the human race sputum has been employed to
give potency to charms and to curses  it was anciently used as anathema
and that use is still in force to this day  let the incredulous critic
spit in some ones face if he doubts my word
but sputum had also a place in the greek and roman rituals  trimalchio
spits and throws wine under the table when he hears a cock crowing
unseasonably  this in the first century  any jew in jerusalem hearing
the name of titus mentioned spits this in 1903  in the ceremony of
naming roman children spittle had its part to play it was customary for
the nurse to touch the lips and forehead of the child with spittle  the
catholic priests ritual which prescribes that the ears and nostrils of
the infant or neophyte as the case may be shall be touched with
spittle comes in all probability from mark vii 33 34 viii 23 and
john ix 6 which in turn are probably derived from a classical
original  it should be added that fishermen spit upon their bait before
casting in their hooks
chapter 131  medio sustulit digito
there is more than a suggestion in the choice of the middle finger in
this instance  among the romans the middle finger was known as the
infamous finger
               infami digito et lustralibus ante salivis
               expiat urentes oculos inhibere perita
                                        persius sat ii
see also dio chrysostom xxxiii  neither says lampridius life of
heliogabalus was he given to demand infamies in words when he could
indicate shamelessness with his fingers chapter 10  with tears in his
eyes cestos often complains to me mamurianus of being touched by your
finger  you need not use your finger merely take cestos all to
yourself if nothing else is wanting in your establishment
 martial i 93
to touch the posteriors lewdly with the finger that is the middle
finger put forth and the two adjoining fingers bent down so that the
hand might form a sort of priapus was an obscene sign to attract
catamites  that this position of the fingers was an indecent symbol is
attested by numerous passages in the classical writers  he would extend
his hand bent into an obscene posture for them to kiss suetonius
caligula 56  it may be added that one of that emperors officers
assassinated him for insulting him in that manner  when this finger was
thus applied it signified that the person was ready to sodomise him whom
he touched  the symbol is still used by the lower orders
we are informed by our younger companions that gentlemen given to
sodomitical practices are in the habit of frequenting some public place
such as the pillars of the county fire office regent st and placing
their hands behind them raising their fingers in a suggestive manner
similar to that mentioned by our epigrammatist  should any gentleman
place himself near enough to have his person touched by the playful
fingers of the pleasureseeker and evince no repugnance the latter
turns around and after a short conversation the bargain is struck  in
this epigram however martial threatens the eye and not the anus  the
romans used to point out sodomites and catamites by thus holding out the
middle finger and so it was used as well in ridicule or chaff as we
say as to denote infamy in the persons who were given to these
practices
if anyone calls you a catamite sextillus says martial ii 28
return the compliment and hold out your middle finger to him
 according to ramiresius this custom was still common in the spain of his
day 1600 and it still persists in spanish and italian countries as
well as in their colonies  this position of the fingers was supposed to
represent the buttocks with a priapus inserted up the fundament it was
called iliga by the spaniards  from this comes the ancient custom of
suspending little priapi from boys necks to avert the evil eye
aristophanes in the clouds says
socrates first they will help you to be pleasant in company and to
know what is meant by oenoplian rhythm and what by the dactylic
strepsiades of the dactyl finger  i know that quite well
socrates what is it then
strepsiades why tis this finger formerly when a child i used this
one
daktulos means of course both dactyl name of a metrical foot and
finger  strepsiades presents his middle finger with the other fingers
and thumb bent under in an indecent gesture meant to suggest the penis
and testicles  it was for this reason that the romans called this finger
the unseemly finger
socrates you are as low minded as you are stupid

chapter 138  oenothea brought out a leathern dildo
this instrument made from glass wax leather or other suitable
material such as ivory or the precious metals ezekiel xvi 17 has been
known from primitive times and the spread of the cult of priapus was a
potent factor in making the instrument more common in the western world
numerous greek authors make mention of it aristophanes lucian
herondas suidas and others  that it was only too familiar to the romans
is shown by their many references to it catullus martial the apostle
paul tertullian and others

the shadow of a lover  since the day the milesians betrayed us i have
never once caught sight of an eightinchlong dildo even to be a
leathern consolation to us poor widows  her complaint is based upon the
fact that all the men were constantly absent upon military duty and the
force of the play lies in her strategic control of a commodity in great
demand among the male members of society  quoting again from the same

the cordax
a lascivious dance of the old greek comedy  any person who performed
this dance except upon the stage was considered drunk or dissolute
that the dance underwent changes for the worse is manifest from the
representation of it found on a marble tazza in the vatican visconti
mus  pioclem  iv 29 where it is performed by ten figures five
finns and five bacchanals but their movements though extremely lively
and energetic are not marked by any particular indelicacy  many ancient
authors and scholiasts have commented upon the looseness and sex appeal
of this dance  meursius orchest article kordax has collected the
majority of passages in the classical writers bearing upon this subject
but from this disorderly collection it is impossible to arrive at any
definite description of the cordax  the article in coelius rhodiginus
var  lect  lib  iv is conventional  the cordax was probably not
unlike the french chalhut danced in the wayside inns and it has been
preserved in the spanish bolero and the neapolitan tarantella  when
the romans adopted the greek customs they did not neglect the dances
and it is very likely that the roman nuptial dance which portrayed the
most secret actions of marriage had its origin in the greek cordax  the
craze for dancing became so menacing under tiberius that the senate was
compelled to run the dancers and dancing masters out of rome but the evil
had become so deep rooted that the very precautions by which society was
to be safeguarded served to inflame the passion for the dance and
indulgence became so general and so public that great scandal resulted
domitian who was by no means straight laced found it necessary to expel
from the senate those members who danced in public  the people imitated
the nobles and as fast as the dancers were expelled others from the
highest and lowest ranks of society took their places and there soon
came to be no distinction in this matter between the noblest names of
the patricians and the vilest rabble from the suburra  there is no
comparison between the age of cicero and that of domitian  one could do
a man no graver injury than to call him a dancer says cicero pro
murena and adds a man cannot dance unless he is drunk or insane
probably the most realistic description of the cordax conventional of
course is to be found in merejkovskis death of the gods  the passage
occurs in chapter vi  i have permitted myself the liberty of supplying
the omissions and euphemisms in trenchs otherwise excellent and spirited
version of the novel  at this moment hoarse sounds like the roarings of
some subterranean monster came from the market square  they were the
notes now plaintive now lively of a hydraulic organ  at the entrance
to a showmans travelling booth a blind christian slave for four obols
a day was pumping up the water which produced this extraordinary
harmony  agamemnon dragged his companions into the booth a great tent
with blue awnings sprinkled with silver stars  a lantern lighted a
blackboard on which the order of the program was chalked up in syriac
and greek  it was stifling within redolent of garlic and lamp oil soot
in addition to the organ there struck up the wailing of two harsh
flutes and an ethopian rolling the whites of his eyes thrummed upon an
arab drum  a dancer was skipping and throwing somersaults on a
tightrope clapping his hands to the time of the music and singing a
popular song
                    hue huc convenite nunc
                    spatalocinaedi
                    pedem tendite
                    cursum addite
this starveling snubnosed dancer was old repulsive and nastily gay
drops of sweat mixed with paint were trickling from his shaven forehead
his wrinkles plastered with white lead looked like the cracks in some
wall when rain has washed away the lime  the flutes and organ ceased
when he withdrew and a fifteenyearold girl ran out upon the stage
she was to perform the celebrated cordax so passionately adored by the
mob  the fathers of the church called down anathema upon it the roman
laws prohibited it but all in vain  the cordax was danced everywhere
by rich and poor by senators wives and by street dancers just as it
had been before
what a beautiful girl whispered agamemnon enthusiastically  thanks
to the fists of his companions he had reached a place in the front rank
of spectators  the slender bronze body of the nubian was draped only
about the hips with an almost airy colorless scarf  her hair was wound
on the top of her head in close fine curls like those of nubian woven
her face was of the severest egyptian type recalling that of the sphinx
she began to dance languidly carelessly as if already weary  above
her head she swung copper bells castanets or crotalsswung them
lazily so that they tinkled very faintly  gradually her movements
became more emphatic and suddenly under their long lashes yellow eyes
shone out clear and bright as the eyes of a leopardess  she drew her
body up to her full height and the copper castanets began to tinkle with
such challenge in their piercing sound that the whole crowd trembled with
emotion  vivid slender supple as a serpent the damsel whirled
rapidly her nostrils dilated and a strange cry came crooning from her
throat  with each impetuous movement two dark little breasts held tight
by a green silk net trembled like two ripe fruits in the wind and their
sharp thickly painted nipples were like rubies as they protruded from
the net
the crowd was beside itself with passion  agamemnon nearly mad was
held back by his companions  suddenly the girl stopped as if exhausted
a slight shudder ran through her from her head down the dark limbs to
her feet  deep silence prevailed  the head of the nubian was thrown
back as if in a rigid swoon but above it the crotals still tinkled with
an extraordinary languor a dying vibration quick and soft as the wing
flutterings of a captured butterfly  her eyes grew dim but in their
inner depths glittered two sparks the face remained severe impersonal
but upon the sensuous red lips of that sphinxlike mouth a smile
trembled faint as the dying sound of the crotals

                         six notes by marchena
to the army of the rhine
the conquests of the french have resulted during this war in a boon to
knowledge and to letters  egypt has furnished us with monuments of its
aboriginal inhabitants which the ignorance and superstition of the copts
and mussulmans kept concealed from civilized countries  the libraries of
the convents of the various countries have been ransacked by savants and
precious manuscripts have been brought to light
by no means the least interesting of the acquisitions is a fragment of
petronius which we offer to the public taken from an ancient manuscript
which our soldiers in conquering st gall have sent to us for
examination  we have made an important discovery in reading a parchment
which contains the work of st gennadius on the duties of priests and
which judging from the form of the letters employed we should say was
written in the eleventh century  a most careful examination led us to
perceive that the work by this saint had been written on pages containing
written letters which had been almost effaced  we know that in the dark
ages it was customary to write ecclesiastical works on the manuscripts
containing the best authors of latinity
at a cost of much labor we have been able to decipher a morsel which we
give to the public and of the authenticity of which there can be no
doubt  we render homage to the brave french army to which we owe this
acquisition
it is easy to notice that there is a lacuna in that passage of petronius
in which encolpius is left with quartilla looking through a chink in the
door at the actions of giton and little pannychis  a few lines below
it relates in effect that he was fatigued by the voluptuous enjoyment
of quartilla and in that which remains to us there is no mention of the
preliminaries to this enjoyment  the style of the latin so closely
resembles the original of petronius that it is impossible to believe that
the fragment was forged
for the benefit of those who have not read the author it is well to
state that this quartilla was a priestess of priapus at whose house they
celebrated the mysteries of that god  pannychis is a young girl of seven
years who had been handed over to giton to be deflowered  this giton is
the good friend of encolpius who is supposed to relate the scene
encolpius who had drunk an aphrodisiacal beverage is occupied with
quartilla in peeping through the door to see in what manner giton was
acquitting himself in his role  at that moment a soldier enters the
house
finally an old woman about whom there is some question in the fragment
is the same as the one who had unexpectedly conducted encolpius to the
house of the public women and of whom mention is made in the beginning of
the work
               ipsa venus magico religatum brachia nodo
               perdocuit multis non sine verberibus
                                             tibullus viii 5
i
               vous verrez que vous avez affaire a un homme
               you will learn that you have to deal with a man
fighting men have in all times been distinguished on account of the
beauty of their women  the charming fable of the loves of venus and
mars described by the most ancient of poets expresses allegorically
this truth  all the demigods had their amorous adventures the most
valiant were always the most passionate and the happiest  hercules took
the maidenheads of fifty girls in a single night  thesus loved a
thousand beauties and slept with them  jason abandoned hypsipyle for
medea and her for creusa  achilles the swift of foot forgot the
tender deidamia in the arms of his briseis
it has been remarked that the lovers did not have very scrupulous tastes
in their methods of attaining satisfaction from the women they loved
the most common method was abduction and the women always submitted to
this without a murmur of any sort  helen was carried off by theseus
after having also been abducted by paris  the wife of atreus was
abducted by thyestus and from that arose the implacable hatred between
the two families  rape was no less common  goddesses themselves and the
favorites of the gods were at the risk of falling prey to strong mortals
pirithous aided by theseus even attempted to snatch proserpina from the
god of the underworld  juno herself was compelled to painful submission
to the pursuit of ixion and thetis succumbed despite herself to the
assaults of peleus  the gift of foretelling the future with which
apollo endowed cassandra did not insure her against the brutal caresses
of ajax son of oileus
in the infancy of society there was never known any other distinction
except between the weak and the strong the strong commanded and the weak
obeyed  for that reason women were regarded in the light of beings
destined by nature to serve the pleasures and even the caprices of men
never did her suitors express a tender thought for penelope and instead
of making love to her they squandered her property slept with her
slaves and took charge of things in her house
circe gave herself to ulysses who desired to slay her and calypso full
blown goddess as she was was obliged to make his advances for him  the
fine sentiments that virgil puts into the mouth of the shade of creusa
content with having died while serving against the greeks she was a
trojan and she wedded the son of venus the confession with which
andromache confronted by the murderer of her first husband responds to
the question of aeneas these ideas i say and these sentiments
appertained to the polished century of augustus and not to the epoch or
scene of the trojan war  virgil in his aeneid had never subscribed to
the precepts of horace and of common sense
          aut famam sequere aut sibi convenientia finge
                                             horace ars poet 119
from this manner of dealing with women arose another reason for the
possession of beauty by the valiant  one coveted a woman much as one
would covet a fine flock of sheep and in the absence of laws the one
in possession of either the one or the other of these desirable objects
would soon be dispossessed of them if he was not courageous enough to
guard them against theft  wars were as much enterprises for ravishing
women as they were for taking other property and one should remember
that agamemnon promised to retire from before troy if the trojans would
restore helen and his riches to menelaus things which paris had
despoiled him of
also there was never any of that thing we call conjugal honor among
the greeks that idea was far too refined it was a matter too complex
ever to have entered the heads of these semibarbarous people  this is
exemplified in the fact that after the taking of troy helen who had
of her own free will belonged successively to paris and to deiphobus
afterwards returned to menelaus who never offered her any reproach
that conduct of menelaus was so natural that telemachus who in his trip
to sparta found helen again with menelaus just as she was before her
abduction did not show the least astonishment
the books which bear the most remarkable resemblance to each other are
the bible and homer because the people they describe and the men about
whom they speak are forerunners of civilization in pretty much the same
degree  sarah was twice snatched from the bosom of abraham and he was
never displeased with his wife and continued to live on good terms with
her  david a newcomer on the throne hastened to have michol brought to
him although she had already married another man
the best proof that during the time of the romans the women preferred
soldiers to other men is in the claims to successful enterprises by the
bragging soldier of plautus  pyrgopolinices thought it was only
necessary to pose as a great warrior to have all the women chasing after
him therefore his parasite and his slave spoke of nothing but the
passions be inspired in women  tradition has it that among the samnites
the bravest men had the choice of the fairest women and to this custom
is attributed one of the reasons these people were so warlike
in the times of chivalry the greatest exploits were achieved for the
pleasure of ones ladylove and there were even such valiant knights as
don quixote who went about the world proving by force of arms that their
ladies had no peer  the povertystricken troubadours singing
harmoniously about their beautiful women found them flying away in the
arms of knights who had broken lances at tournaments or had performed
the greatest feats of arms  in fine all the peoples of the world have
said with dryden
               none but the brave deserves the fair
ii
          ses camarades se saisissent de moi et de quartilla
          his comrades seized hold of quartilla and me
the profession of quartilla corresponded to that which is followed by
our ladies of the palace royal  this palace royal is a sort of babylon
with this difference that the former prostitute themselves all the year
round and that they are not quite so attractive as the chaldean
beauties  for the rest one of the incontestable facts of ancient
history is this prostitution of the women of babylon in honor of venus
and i cannot understand why voltaire refused to believe it since
religions have always been responsible for the most abominable actions
and because religious wars the horrors of intolerance the impostures of
priests the despotism of kings the degradation and stupidity of the
people have been the direct fatal effects of religions and seeing that
the blind fanaticism of martyrs and the brutal cruelty of tyrants is a
hundred times more deplorable than a sacrifice equally agreeable to the
victim and to the one who officiates at the sacrifice and seeing that
the enjoyment and giving of life is no less holy than the maceration and
caging of innocent animals
the origin of courtesans is lost in the deepest antiquity  it appears
that it was one of the patriarchal customs to enjoy them for judah slept
with thamar widow of his two sons and who to seduce him disguised
herself as a courtesan  another courtesan rahab played a great role in
the first wars of the people of the lord it was this same rahab who
married solomon father of boaz fourth forefather of david and
thirtysecond forefather of jesus christ our divine savior  yet the
eternal sagacity of man has failed to take notice of this profession and
to resent the injustice done it by the scorn of men  the elected kings
of the people the man who adopts the word father according to the
flesh are descendants of a courtesan
for the rest it must be admitted that many who follow this noble
profession are unworthy of it and only too well justify the ignominy
which is levelled against the entire class  you see these miserable
creatures with livid complexions and haggard eyes with voices of
stentor breathing out at the same time the poisons which circulate in
their veins and the liquors with which they are intoxicated you see on
their blemished and emaciated bodies the marks of beings more hideous
than they twenty come to satisfy their brutal passions for every one of
them you listen to their vile language you hear their oaths and
revolting expressions to go to these megeres is often to encounter
brigands and assassins what a spectacle  it is the deformity of vice
in the rags of indigence
ah  but these are not courtesans they are the dregs of cities  a
courtesan worthy of the name is a beautiful woman gracious and amiable
at whose home gather men of letters and men of the world the first
magistrates the greatest captains and who keeps men of all professions
in a happy state of mind because she is pleasing to them she inspires in
them a desire for reciprocal pleasure such an one was aspasia who after
having charmed the cultured people of athens was for a long time the good
companion of pericles and contributed much perhaps towards making his
century what it was the age of taste in arts and letters  such an
one also was phryne lais glycera and their names will always be
celebrated such also was ninon denclos one of the ornaments of
the century of louis xiv and clairon the first who realized all the
grandeur of her art such an one art thou c french thalia who
commands attentions i do not say this by way of apology but to share the
opinion of alceste
a courtesan such as i have in mind may have all the public and private
virtues  one knows the severe probity of ninon her generosity her
taste for the arts her attachment to her friends  epicharis the soul
of the conspiracy of piso against the execrable nero was a courtesan
and the severe tacitus who cannot be taxed with a partiality for
gallantry has borne witness to the constancy with which she resisted the
most seductive promises and endured the most terrible tortures without
revealing any of the details of the conspiracy or any of the names of the
conspirators
these facts should be recognized above that ascetic moral idea which
consists of the sovereign virtue of abstinence in defiance of natures
commands and which places weakness in these matters along with the most
odious crimes  can one see without indignation suetonius reproach of
caesar for his gallantries with servilia with tertia and other roman
ladies as a thing equal to his extortions and his measureless ambitions
and praising his warlike ardor against peoples who had never furnished
room for complaint to rome  the source of these errors was the theory of
emanations  the first dreamers who were called philosophers imagined
that matter and light were coeternal they supposed that was all one
unformed and tenebrous mass and from the former they established the
principle of evil and of all imperfection while they regarded the latter
as sovereign perfection  creation or one might better say
coordination was only the emanation of light which penetrated chaos
but the mixture of light and matter was the cause of all the inevitable
imperfections of the universe  the soul of man was part and parcel of
divinity or of increased light it would never attain happiness until it
was reunited to the source of all light but for it we would be free
from all things we call gross and material and we would be taken into
the ethereal regions by contemplation and by abstinence from the
pleasures of the flesh  when these absurdities were adopted for the
regulation of conduct they necessarily resulted in a fierce morality
inimical to all the pleasures of life such in a word as that of the
gymnosophists or in a lesser measure of the trappists
but despite the gloomy nonsense of certain atrabilious dreamers the
wonderful era of the greeks was that of the reign of the courtesans
it was about the houses of these that revolved the sands of pactolus
their fame exceeded that of the first men of greece  the rich offerings
that decorated the temples of the gods were the gifts of these women
and it must be remembered that most of them were foreigners originating
for the most part in asia minor  it happened that an athenian
financier who resembled the rest of his tribe as much as two drops of
water proposed once to levy an impost upon the courtesans  as he spoke
eloquently of the incalculable advantages which would accrue to the
government by this tax a certain person asked him by whom the courtesans
were paid  by the athenians replied our orator after deliberation
then it would be the athenians who would pay the impost replied the
questioner and the people of athens who had a little more sense than
certain legislative assemblies hooted the orator down and there was
never any more question about a tax upon courtesans
corinth was famous for the number and beauty of its courtesans from
which comes the proverb it is not given to every man to go to corinth
there they ran the risk of losing their money and ruining their health
the cause of this great vogue of courtesans in greece was not the
supposed ugliness of the sex as the savant paw imagined and
contradicted by the unanimous evidence of ancient authors and of modern
travellers but rather the retired and solitary life which the women of
the country led  they lived in separate apartments and never had any
communication with the streets or with the residences of men the inner
part of the house which was called the womens apartments said
cornelius nepos preface  strangers never visited them they rarely
visited their nearest relations  this was why marriage between brothers
and sisters was authorized by law and encouraged by usage the sisters
were exposed to the attacks of their brothers because they lived
separated from them
with the romans as with us the virtuous women corrupted somewhat the
profession of the courtesans  the absolute seclusion of women was never
the fashion at rome and the stories we have on the authority of valerius
maximus on the chastity and modesty of the first roman matrons merit the
same degree of belief as the legend of romulus and remus being brought up
by a wolf the rape of lucretia or the tragic death of virginia  on the
contrary in livy a great admirer of the customs of the early days of
rome we find that in those times a great number of roman women of the
noblest families were convicted of having poisoned their husbands and
condemned to death for this hideous crime that by no means shows a very
exquisite and tender conjugal sentiment  during the period of the second
punic war with what energy they went about the city seeking the repeal of
the law which took out of their hands the custody of jewels and precious
stones  a repeal which they obtained despite the opposition of cato the
censor  it appears that the profession of the courtesan was generally
practised by the freedwomen their manner necessarily showed the results
of their education  but the young sparks of rome never paid much
attention to them they preferred to have love affairs with the wives of
their friends  for one sallust who ruined himself with freedwomen there
were five cupienniuses cupiennius that admirer of the pudenda garbed
in white hor sat i ii 36  delia lesbia ipsythillia corinna
nemesis neeria cynthia sulpitia lycimnia and almost all the women to
whom under real or assumed names catullus tibullus propertius ovid
horace and others addressed their erotic compositions were roman
married women  horace is the only one who celebrated a freedwoman in
some of his odes  this is due however to his taste for variety and
perhaps also to his birth for he himself was the son of a freedwoman
ovids art of love and the satires of juvenal reveal the extent to which
gallantry was the fashion at rome and cato would never have praised the
conduct of that young man who had recourse to a public house if that had
been an ordinary course of procedure
in europe of the middle ages the priests and abbots helped to some
extent in reviving the profession of the courtesans  long before saint
paul had stated in his epistles that it was permitted to the apostles
of the lord to take with them everywhere a sister for charity  the
deaconesses date from the first century of the church  but the celibacy
of the clergy was not universally and solidly established until about the
eleventh century under the pontificate of gregory vii  during the
preceding century the celebrated marozie and theodore had put their
lovers successively upon the chair of st peter and their sons and
grandsons as well  but after the priests had submitted to celibacy they
ostensibly took the concubines of which alas  our housekeepers of today
are but feeble vestiges  the spanish codes of the middle ages were often
concerned with the rights of the concubines of priests mancebas de los
clerigos and these chosen ones of the chosen ones of the lord invariably
appeared worthy of envy  finally the courtesans appeared in all their
magnificence in the holy city and modern rome atoned for the rebuffs and
indignities these women had been compelled to endure in ancient rome
the princes of the church showered them with gifts they threw at their
feet the price of redemption from sin paid by the faithful and the age
of leo x was for rome a wonderful epoch of fine arts belles lettres and
beautiful women  but a fanatical monk from lower germany fell upon this
calm of the church and this happy era of the harlots since then the
revenues of the sacred college have continued to decrease the beautiful
courtesans have abandoned the capital of the christian world and their
pleasures have fled with them  and can anyone longer believe in the
perfection of the human race since the best the most holy of human
institutions has so visibly degenerated

     kisses
one of the reasons which caused the learned and paradoxical hardouin to
assert that all the works which have been attributed to the ancients
with the exception of the georgics and the natural history of pliny were
the compositions of monks was doubtless the very frequent repetition of
scenes of love for boys which one notices in most of these writings
this savant was a jesuit  but this taste is not peculiar to convents it
is to be found among all peoples and in all climates its origin is lost
in the night of the centuries it is common in the most polished nations
and it is common among savage tribes  profound philosophers have argued
in favor of it poets have sung the objects of this sort of love in their
tender and passionate compositions and these compositions have always
been the delight of posterity  what stupid or unfeeling reader can read
without emotion that beautiful eclogue of virgil where corydon sighs his
hopeless love for the beautiful alexis  the most passionate ode of
horace is that one in which he complains of the harshness of ligurinus
the tender tibullus deceived by his marathus brings tears to all who
have hearts  the delicate anacreon praising his bathylle and the
valiant alceus giving himself up after his labors in war to sing of the
dark eyes and black hair of lycus       with dark eyes and black hair
beautiful  it is not to overcivilized refinements of society which
according to certain misanthropists degrade nature and corrupt it that
this taste is due it is found among the south sea islanders and the
evidence of the first spaniards attests that it was common among the
hordes of american indians before the discovery of the new world  paw
had attempted to explain this as resulting from defects in the formation
of the organs of pleasure among the natives but a peculiar cause is not
sufficient explanation for a universal effect
at the time of the patriarchs greek love was so general that in the four
cities sodom gomorrah adama and seboim it was impossible to find ten
men exempt from the contagion that number would have sufficed said the
lord to withhold the punishment which he inflicted upon those cities
it should be noted here that most of the assertions about the morals of
the israelites which are to be found in the erotica biblon of mirabeau
are either false or pure guesswork  it is a bizarre method of judging
the morals of a people that of taking their legal code and inferring
that the people were accustomed to break all the laws which are forbidden
by that code  nevertheless that is the method which the author of the
erotica biblon adopts for portraying the morals of the jewish people
again he has not even understood this code he has believed that the law
against giving ones seed to the idol moloch meant giving the human
semen and he is ignorant of the fact that this seed as spoken of in the
bible means the children and descendants  thus it is that the land of
canaan is promised to the seed of abraham and the perpetuity of the
reign on sion to that of david  moloch was a phoenician deity the same
one to which in carthage they sacrificed children the romans believed
him to be a reincarnation of their saturn but saturn was an etruscan
divinity who could never have had any connection with the gods of
phoenicia  he mirabeau has translated those who polluted the temple
 as meaning those who were guilty of some obscenity in the temple and he
does not know that the temple was polluted by a thousand acts declared
impure by law and which were not obscene  the entrance of a woman into
a sacred place less than forty days after her accouchement or the
entrance of a man who had touched an impure animal constituted a
pollution of the house of the lord  when one wishes to make a parade of
erudition he should make some attempt to understand the things which he
pretends to make clear to others  or is it that this mirabeau was merely
careless
the love of boys was so thoroughly the fashion in greece that we have
today given it the name greek love  orestes was regarded as the good
friend of pylades and patroclus as the lover of achilles  in this
taste the gods set the example for mortals and the abduction of
ganymede for the service of the master of thunder was not the least
cause for annoyance given the chaste but overprudish juno  lastly
hercules was not content with the loves of omphale and dejanira he also
loved the beautiful hylas who was brought up by the nymphs
the greeks boasted without blushing of this love which they considered
the only passion worthy of men and they did blush at loving a woman
intimacy with whom they said only rendered her adorers soft and
effeminate  in the dialogue of plato entitled the banquet which is
concerned entirely with discussions of the various forms of love they
dismiss love for women as unworthy of occupying the attention of sensible
men  one of the speakers i believe it was aristophanes explaining the
cause of this fire which we kindle in the bosoms of our loved ones
affirms that the first men were doubles which multiplied their force and
their power  this they abused and as punishment jupiter struck them
with lightning and separated them  by their love for each other they
came together again to regain their primitive state  but the effeminates
sought out only the women because they were only half men half women
while those whose tastes were masculine and courageous wanted to become
double men again
phedre has put into the mouth of aesop an explanation of that love which
would certainly not have been relished by the greeks  he says that while
prometheus was occupied with modelling his man and woman he was invited
to a feast given by jupiter to the gods he came back intoxicated and
by mistake applied the sexual parts of one to the body of the other
for the rest the greeks were all in accord in their profound contempt
for women  the theatrical writers especially who studied more
particularly the general opinions and catered to them in order to obtain
the applause of the public were distinguished by their bitterness
against the sex  euripides maintained that prometheus deserved to be
chained to mount caucasus with the vulture gnawing at his entrails
because he had fashioned a being so pernicious and hateful as woman  the
shade of agamemnon in the odyssey advised ulysses not to put any faith
in penelope and did not stop talking until he had enumerated the entire
list of the vices of the sex  the first latin authors imitated the
greeks in their invectives against women the comedies of plautus
especially teem with virulent attacks upon them
at rome however the great freedom permitted to women soon brought
about other opinions in regard to them they often played an important
role in public and private affairs and the men convinced themselves
that like men women were capable of the greatest crimes and of the most
heroic virtues  the noble stoicism of arria is not the only example of
courageous virtue displayed by the roman women at a time when crowned
monsters governed the empire  the young paulina opened her veins with
her husband the philosopher seneca mallonia preferred to die in
torments rather than give herself up to the odious hegoat of capri
who does not admire the noble independence the conjugal love and the
matronly virtues of agrippina the wife of germanicus
moreover men began to avow their love for women and we have here
occasion to observe the rapid progress of gallantry among the romans
however the love for boys was no less universally in vogue in rome and
cicero charges in his letters to atticus that the judges who had so
scandalously whitewashed clodius of the accusation of having profaned
the mysteries of the good goddess had been publicly promised the
favors of the most illustrious women and the finest young men of the
first families  caesar himself in his early youth had yielded to the
embraces of nicomedes king of bithynia moreover after his triumph over
the gauls on the solemn occasion when it was customary to twit the
victor with all his faults the soldiers sang caesar subdued the gauls
nicomedes subdued caesar  but caesar who subdued the gauls triumphed
and nicomedes who subdued caesar did not  cato said of him that he was
loved by the king in his youth and that when he was older he loved the
queen and one day in the senate while he was dwelling on i know not
what request of the daughter of nicomedes and recounting the benefits
which rome owed to that monarch cicero silenced him by replying we
know very well what he has given and what thou hast given him  at
last during the time when the first triumvirate divided all the power
a bad joker remarked to pompey i salute thee o king and addressing
caesar i salute thee o queen  his enemies maintained that he was the
husband of all the women and the wife of all the husbands  catullus who
detested him always called him the bald catamite in his epigrams he
set forth that his friendship with mamurra was not at all honorable he
called this mamurra pathicus a name which they bestowed upon those who
looked for favors among mature men or among men who had passed the stage
of adolescence
the masters of the empire never showed any hesitancy in trying and even
in overdoing the pleasures which all their subjects permitted themselves
alas  a crown is such a weighty burden  the road of domination is
strewn with so many briars that one would never be able to pass down it
if he did not take care that they were pressed down under the roses  the
roman emperors adopted that plan they longed for pleasures and they took
the pleasures which offered themselves without delay and in a spirit of
competition  caligula was so little accustomed to waiting that while
occupied in offering a sacrifice to the gods and the figure of a priest
having pleased him he did not take time to finish the sacred ceremonies
before taking his pleasure of him
a remarkable thing is that among almost all peoples the baths are the
places where the prostitution of men by their own sex is the most common
we see in catullus that the cinaedi catamites a noun which my chaste
pen refuses to translate into french haunted the baths incessantly to
carry out their practices  among the orientals of all modern peoples
who have retained this taste most generally this same fact holds good
it was at the bath that tiberius impotent through old age and
debauchery was made young again by the touch little children applied to
his breasts these children he called little fishes they sucked his
withered breasts his infected mouth his livid lips and finally his
virile parts  hideous spectacle of a tyrant disgraced by nature and
struggling against her maledictions  but in vain did he invent new
pleasures in vain did he take part in these scenes in which groups of
young men by threes and fours assumed all sorts of lascivious postures
and were at the same time active and passive the sight of these
indulgences of the sprintriae for that is the name which was given
there did not enable him to resuscitate his vigor any more than the
glamor of the throne or the servile submission of the senate served to
mitigate his remorse
but of all the emperors the ones who carried their taste for young boys
to the greatest lengths were nero domitian and hadrian  the first
publicly wedded the young eunuch sporus whom he had had operated upon so
that he might serve him like a young woman  he paid court to the boy as
he would to a woman and another of his favorites dressed himself up in a
veil and imitated the lamentations which women were accustomed to utter
on nuptial nights  the second consecrated the month of september to his
favorite and the third loved antinous passionately and caused him to be
deified after death
the most ample proof of the universality of the taste for young boys
among the romans is found in the epithalamium of manilius and julia by
catullus and it might be cause for surprise that this has escaped all
the philologists were it not a constant thing that men frequently
reading about these centuries fail to perceive the most palpable facts
in their authors just as they pass over the most striking phenomena of
nature without observing them  it appears from this epithalamium that
young men before their marriage had a favorite selected from among
their slaves and that this favorite was charged with the distribution of
nuts among his comrades on the day they in turn treated him with
contempt and hooted him  here follows an exact translation of this
curious bit  the favorite could not refuse the nuts to the slaves when
by giving them it appeared that he owned that his master had put away his
love for hire

the christian religion strongly prohibits this love the theologians put
it among the sins which directly offend against the holy ghost  i have
not the honor of knowing just why this thing arouses his anger so much
more than anything else doubtless there are reasons  but the wrath of
this honest person has not prevented the christians from having their
pathici just as they have in countries where they are authorized by
the reigning deities  we have even noticed that they are the priests of
the lord and especially the monks who practice this profession most
generally amongst us  the children of loyola have acquired wellmerited
renown in this matter when they painted pleasure they never failed to
represent him wearing trousers  those disciples of joseph calasanz who
took their places in the education of children followed their footsteps
with zeal and fervor  lastly the cardinals who have a close
acquaintance with the holy ghost are so prejudiced in favor of greek
love that they have made it the fashion in the holy city of rome this
leads me to wonder whether the holy ghost has changed his mind in regard
to this matter and is no longer shocked by it or whether the theologians
were not mistaken in assuming an aversion against sodomy which he never
had  the cardinals who are on such familiar terms with him would know
better than to give all their days over to this pleasure if he really
objected to it
i shall terminate this overlong note with an extract from a violent
diatribe against this love which lucian puts into the mouth of charicles
he is addressing callicratidas a passionate lover of young boys with
whom he had gone to visit the temple of venus at cnidus
o venus my queen  to thee i call lend me your aid while i plead your
cause  for everything over which you deign to shed be it ever so
little the persuasion of your charms reaches absolute perfection above
all erotic discourses need your presence for you are their lawful
mother  in your womanhood defend the cause of woman and grant to men
to remain men as they have been born  at the beginning of my discourse
i call as witness to the truth of my arguments the first mother of all
created things the source of all generation the holy nature of this
universe who gathering into one and uniting the elements of the
worldearth air fire and waterand mingling them together gave life
to everything that breathes  knowing that we are a compound of
perishable matter and that the span of life assigned to each of us was
short she contrived that the death of one should be the birth of
another and meted out to the dying by way of compensation the coming
into being of others that by mutual succession we might live forever
but as it was impossible for anything to be born from a single thing
alone she created two different sexes and bestowed upon the male the
power of emitting semen making the female the receptacle of generation
having inspired both with mutual desires she joined them together
ordaining as a sacred law of necessity that each sex should remain
faithful to its own naturethat the female should not play the male
unnaturally nor the male degrade himself by usurping the functions of
the female  thus intercourse of men with women has preserved the human
race by neverending succession no man can boast of having been created
by man alone two venerable names are held in equal honor and men
revere their mother equally with their father  at first when men were
filled with heroic thoughts they reverenced those virtues which bring
us nearer to the gods obeyed the laws of nature and united to women
of suitable age became the sires of noble offspring  but by degrees
human life degenerating from that nobility of sentiment sank to the
lowest depths of pleasure and began to carve out strange and corrupt
ways in the search after enjoyment  then sensuality daring all
violated the laws of nature herself  who was it who first looked upon
the male as female violating him by force or villainous persuasion
one sex entered one bed and men had the shamelessness to look at one
another without a blush for what they did or for what they submitted to
and sowing seed as it were upon barren rocks they enjoyed a
shortlived pleasure at the cost of undying shame
some pushed their cruelty so far as to outrage nature with the
sacrilegious knife and after depriving men of their virility found in
them the height of pleasure  these miserable and unhappy creatures that
they may the longer serve the purposes of boys are stunted in their
manhood and remain a doubtful riddle of a double sex neither preserving
that boyhood in which they were born nor possessing that manhood which
should be theirs  the bloom of their youth withers away in a premature
old age while yet boys they suddenly become old without any interval of
manhood  for impure sensuality the mistress of every vice devising one
shameless pleasure after another insensibly plunges into unmentionable
debauchery experienced in every form of brutal lust  whereas if each
would abide by the laws prescribed by providence we should be satisfied
with intercourse with women and our lives would be undefiled by shameful
practices  consider the animals which cannot corrupt by innate
viciousness how they observe the law of nature in all its purity
helions do not lust after helions but in due season passion excites
them towards the females of their species the bull that rules the herd
mounts cows and the ram fills the whole flock of ewes with the seed of
generation  again boars mate with sows hewolves with shewolves
neither the birds that fly through the air nor the fish that inhabit the
deep or any living creatures upon earth desire male intercourse but
amongst them the laws of nature remain unbroken  but you men who boast
idly of your wisdom but are in reality worthless brutes what strange
disease provokes you to outrage one another unnaturally  what blind
folly fills your minds that you commit the twofold error of avoiding
what you should pursue and pursuing what you should avoid  if each and
all were to pursue such evil courses the race of human beings would
become extinct on earth  and here comes in that wonderful socratic
argument whereby the minds of boys as yet unable to reason clearly are
deceived for a ripe intellect could not be misled  these followers of
socrates pretend to love the soul alone and being ashamed to profess
love for the person call themselves lovers of virtue whereat i have
often been moved to laughter  how comes it o grave philosophers that
you hold in such slight regard a man who during a long life has given
proofs of merit and of that virtue which old age and white hairs become
how is it that the affections of the philosophers are all in a flutter
after the young who cannot yet make up their minds which path of life to
take  is there a law then that all ugliness is to be condemned as
vice and that everything that is beautiful is to be extolled without
further examination  but according to homer the great interpreter of
truthone man is meaner than another in looks but god crowns his words
with beauty and his hearers gaze upon him with delight while he speaks
unfalteringly with winning modesty and is conspicuous amongst the
assembled folk who look upon him as a god when he walks through the
city  and again he says your beauteous form is destitute of
intelligence the wise ulysses is praised more highly than the handsome
nireus  how then comes it that the love of wisdom justice and the
other virtues which are the heritage of the fullgrown man possess no
attraction for you while the beauty of boys excites the most vehement
passion  what should one love phoedrus remembering lysias whom he
betrayed  could one love the beauty of alcibiades who mutilated the
statues of the gods and in the midst of a debauch betrayed the
mysteries of the rites of eleusis  who would venture to declare himself
his admirer after athens was abandoned and decelea fortified by the
enemythe admirer of one whose sole aim in life was tyranny  but as
the divine plato says as long as his chin was beardless he was beloved
by all but when he passed from boyhood to manhood when his imperfect
intelligence had reached its maturity he was hated by all  why then
giving modest names to immodest sentiments do men call personal beauty
virtue being in reality lovers of youth rather than lovers of wisdom
however it is not my intention to speak evil of distinguished men  but
to descend from graver topics to the mere question of enjoyment i will
prove that connection with women is far more enjoyable than connection
with boys  in the first place the longer enjoyment lasts the more
delight it affords too rapid pleasure passes quickly away and it is
over before it is thoroughly appreciated but if it lasts it is thereby
enhanced  would to heaven that grudging destiny had allotted us a longer
lease of life and that we could enjoy perpetual health without any
sorrow to spoil our pleasure then would our life be one continual feast
but since jealous fortune has grudged us greater blessings those
enjoyments that last the longest are the sweetest  again a woman from
puberty to middle age until the last wrinkles furrow her face is worth
embracing and fit for intercourse and even though the prime of her
beauty be past her experience can speak more eloquently than the love of
boys
i should consider anyone who attempted to have intercourse with a youth
of twenty years to be the slave of unnatural lust  the limbs of such
like those of a man are hard and coarse their chins formerly so
smooth are rough and bristly and their wellgrown thighs are disfigured
with hairs  as for their other parts i leave those of you who have
experience to decide  on the other hand a womans charms are always
enhanced by an attractive complexion flowing locks dark as hyacinths
stream down her back and adorn her shoulders or fall over her ears and
temples more luxuriant than the parsley in the fields  the rest of her
person without a hair upon it shines more brilliantly than amber or
sidonian crystal  why should we not pursue those pleasures which are
mutual which cause equal enjoyment to those who receive and to those who
afford them  for we are not like animals fond of solitary lives but
united in social relations we consider these pleasures sweeter and
those pains easier to bear which we share with others  hence a common
table was instituted the mediator of friendship  when we minister to
the wants of the belly we do not drink thasian wine or consume costly
food by ourselves alone but in company for our pleasures and enjoyments
are increased when shared with others  in like manner the intercourse
of men with women causes enjoyment to each in turn and both are alike
delighted unless we accept the judgment of tiresias who declared that
the womans pleasure was twice as great as the mans  i think that those
who are not selfish should not consider how they may best secure the
whole enjoyment for themselves but should share what they have with
others  now in the case of boys no one would be mad enough to assert
that this is the case for while he who enjoys their person reaches the
height of pleasureat least according to his way of thinkingthe
object of his passion at first feels pain even to tears but when by
repetition the pain becomes less keen while he no longer hurts him he
will feel no pleasure himself  to mention something still more curious
as is fitting within the precincts of venusyou may make the same use
of a woman as of a boy and thereby open a double avenue to enjoyment
but the male can never afford the same enjoyment as the female
therefore if you are convinced by my arguments let us men and women
keep ourselves apart as if a wall divided us but if it is becoming for
men to have intercourse with men for the future let women have
intercourse with women  come o new generation inventor of strange
pleasures  as you have devised new methods to satisfy male lust grant
the same privilege to women let them have intercourse with one another
like men girding themselves with the infamous instruments of lust an
unholy imitation of a fruitless union in a word let our wanton tribads
reign unchecked and let our womens chambers be disgraced by
hermaphrodites  far better that a woman in the madness of her lust
should usurp the nature of a man than that mans noble nature should be
so degraded as to play the woman

          the catamite soon reached the height of his passion
the theologians class this species of lascivious feeling with pollution
which is complete when it produces a result  the holy scripture tells us
of onan son of judas grandson of jacob and husband of thamar who was
slain by the lord because he spilled his semen he poured his semen upon
the ground  we may be reproached perhaps for citing the holy bible
too frequently but that book contains the knowledge of salvation and
those who wish to be saved should not fail to study it with assiduity
that this study has occupied a good part of our life we admit and we
have always found that study profitable  to vigorous minds that
admission may seem ridiculous but we are writing only for pious souls
and they will willingly applaud this courageous profession of our piety
the theologians have also classified onanism and pollution among the sins
against the holy ghost and this being the case there is no being in the
world who has been sinned against so often  a medium indulgence in this
sin furnished the pleasure of a queen the severity of one lucretia does
not repel a thousand tarquins  men with vivid imaginations create for
themselves a paradise peopled with the most beautiful houris more
seductive than those of mahomet lycoris had a beautiful body but it was
unfeeling the imagination of her lover pictured her as falling before
his caresses he led her by the hand over pressed flowers through a
thick grove and along limpid streams in that sweet reverie his life
slipped by

in the minds of the theologians pollution is synonymous with all
pleasures with persons of the opposite or the same sex which result in a
waste of the elixir of life  in this sense love between woman and woman
is pollution and sappho is a sinner against the holy ghost
notwithstanding however these caprices of the third person of the
trinity i cannot see why pleasure should be regulated or why a woman
who has surveyed all the charms of a young girl of eighteen years should
give herself up to the rude embraces of a man  what comparisons can be
made between those red lips that mouth which breathes pleasure for the
first time those snowy and purplous cheeks whose velvet smoothness is
like the venus flower half in bloom that newborn flesh which
palpitates softly with desire and voluptuousness that hand which you
press so delicately those round thighs those plastic buttocks that
voice sweet and touchingwhat comparison can be made between all this
and pronounced features rough beard hard breast hairy body and the
strong disagreeable voice of man  juvenal has wonderfully expended all
his bile in depicting as hideous scenes these mysteries of the bona
dea where the young and beautiful roman women far from the eyes of men
give themselves up to mutual caresses  juvenal has painted the eyes of
the graces with colors which are proper to the furies his tableau
moreover revolts one instead of doing good
the only work of sapphos which remains to us is an ode written to one of
her loved ones and from it we may judge whether the poetess merited her
reputation  it has been translated into all languages catullus put it
into latin and boileau into french  here follows an imitation of that of
catullus
               peer of a god meseemeth he
               nay passing gods and that can be
               who all the while sits facing thee
               sees thee and hears
               thy low sweet laughs which ah me daze
               mine every sense and as i gaze
               upon thee lesbia oer me strays
               my tongue is dulled limbs adown
               flows subtle flame with sound its own
               rings either ear and oer are strown

after that we should never again exhort the ministers and moralists to
inveigh against love of women for women never was the interest of men
found to be so fully in accord with the precepts of divine law

all people have regarded virginity as something sacred and god has so
honored it that he willed that his son be born of a virgin fecundated
however by the holy ghost  still it appears problematical whether the
virgin mary complete virgin that she was did not have the same pleasure
as those who are not virgins when she received the divine annunciation
father sanchez has discussed the question very fully whether the virgin
mary spent in copulation with the holyghost unhappily he decided in
the negative and i have too much veneration for father sanchez not to
submit to his decision but because of it i am vexed with the virgin
mary and the holy ghost
notwithstanding this the daughters of the people of the lord were not
content to remain virgins a state of being which at bottom has not much
to recommend it  the daughter of jephtha before being immolated for the
sake of the lord demanded of her father a reprieve of two months in
which to weep for her virginity upon the mountains of gelboe it seems it
should not have taken so long had she had nothing to regret  ruth had
recourse to the quickest method when she wished to cease being a virgin
she simply went and lay down upon the bed with boaz  the spirit of god
has deemed it worth while to transmit this story to us for the
instruction of virgins from century to century
the pagan gods thought highly of maidenheads they often took them and
always they set aside the virgins for themselves  the phtyian from
whose organ apollo was foreordained to come proved to be only a virgin
the spirit of god did not communicate itself to anyone who had ever been
sullied by contact with a mortal  it was to virgins that the sacred
fires of vesta were entrusted and the violation of their virginity was a
capital crime which all rome regarded as a scourge from wrathful heaven
the sybils lived and died virgins in addressing the cumaean sybil
aeneas never failed to bestow that title upon her
most of the immortals have preserved their virginity diana minerva et
cet  but what is the most astonishing is that the companions of venus
and amor the most lovable of all divinities the graces were also
virgins  juno became a virgin again every year by bathing in the waters
of a magic fountain that must have rendered jupiters duties rather
onerous
there are some reasons for this passion of mankind for maidenheads  it
is so wonderful to give the first lessons of voluptuousness to a pure and
innocent heart to feel under ones hand the first palpitations of the
virginal breasts which arouses unknown delights to dry the first tears
of tenderness to inspire that first mixture of fear and hope of vague
desires and expectant inquietude whoever has never had that satisfaction
has missed the most pleasurable of all the delights of love  but taken
in that sense virginity is rather a moral inclination as buffon says
than a physical matter and nothing can justify the barbarous precautions
against amorous theft which were taken by unnatural fathers and jealous
husbands
in those unhappy countries which are bent under oppression in those
countries where heaven shows its heat in the beauty of the sex and
where beauty is only an object of speculation for avid parents in such
countries i say they resort to the most odious methods for preserving
the virginity of the young and beautiful daughters who are destined to be
sold like common cattle  they put a lock over the organ of pleasure and
never permit it to be opened except when it is strictly necessary for
carrying out those animal functions for which nature destined them
the locks of chastity were long known in europe the italians are accused
with this terrible invention  nevertheless it is certain that they were
used upon men at least in the time of the first roman emperors
juvenal in his satire against women vi says if the singers please
them there is no need for locks of chastity for those who have sold their
voices to the praetors who keep them
               si gaudet cantu nullius fibula durat
               vocem vendentis praetoribus
                                        sat  vi 379
     if pleased by the song of the singer employed by the praetor
     no fibula long will hold out free the actor will greet her
christianity most spiritual most mystical of ancient religions
attempts to make out a great case for celibacy  its founder never
married although the pharisees reproached him for frequenting gay women
and had perhaps some reason for so doing  jesus showed a particular
affection for mary magdalen to the point of exciting the jealousy of
martha who complained that her sister passed her time in conversation
with jesus and left her with all the housework to do  mary has chosen
the better part said the savior  a good christian must not doubt that
the colloquies were always spiritual
st paul counseled virginity and most of the apostolic fathers practiced
it  among others st jerome lived his whole life among women and never
lost his purity  he answered his enemies who reproached him with his
very great intimacy with the saintly sisters that the irrefutable proof
of his chastity was that he stank  that stinking of st jerome which is
not a veritable article of faith in the church is however an object of
pious belief and my readers will very gladly assent to it
when the christian clergy wishes to form a body of doctrines to be
submitted to by all the common people it thinks that by separating its
interests and those of the common people as far as possible it must
tighten those ropes by which it binds its fellow citizens  also the pope
who was the most jealous of ecclesiastical power and the one who abused
it most hildebrand rigorously prohibited the marriage of priests and
enunciated the most terrible warnings against those who did not retain
their celibacy  however although neither priests nor monks were
permitted to marry the epithet virgins cannot be justly applied to all
priests and all monks without exception  nor shall i repeat here the
naughty pleasantries of erasmus of boccaccio and all the others
against the monks without doubt maliciousness has developed more
satyrical traits that they have brought out beyond that i have
nothing to say

                    finally an old woman   
the question here has to do with a procurers or gobetween  that
profession has gradually fallen into discredit by i know not what
fatality which befalls the most worthy things  cervantes the only
philosophic author spain has produced wanted that calling to be
venerated in cities above all others  and truly when one thinks how
much finesse is necessary to pursue that profession with success when
one considers that those who practice that truly liberal art are the
repositories of the most important as well as the most sacred secrets
one would never fail to have the greatest respect for them  the
tranquillity of homes the civil state of persons they hold at their
discretion and still though they drink in insults though they endure
abuse very rarely do these beings true stoics compromise those who
have confided in them
in their mercury the ancients realized their beau ideal or archetype
of gobetween which they called in vulgar language pimp  that god
as gobetween for jupiter was often involved in the most hazardous
enterprises such as abducting io who was guarded by argus of the
hundred eyes mercury i say was the god of concord or eloquence
and of mystery  except to inspire them with friendly feeling and kind
affections mercury never went among mortals  touched by his wand
venomous serpents closely embraced him  listening to him achilles
forgot his pride extended hospitality to priam and permitted him to take
away the body of hector  the ferocious carthaginians were softened
through the influence of this god of peace and received the trojans in
friendship  mercury it was who gathered men into society and substituted
social customs for barbarism  he invented the lyre and was the master of
amphion who opened the walls of thebes by the charm of his singing
mercury or hermes gave the first man knowledge but it was enveloped in a
mysterious veil which it was never permitted the profane to penetrate
which signifies that all that he learned from god concerning amorous
adventures should be wrapped in profound silence  how beautiful all
these allegories are  and how true  how insipid life would be without
these mysterious liaisons by which nature carries out her designs
eluding the social ties without breaking them  disciples of mercury i
salute you whatever be your sex to your discretion to your persuasive
arts are confided our dearest interests the peace of mind of husbands
the happiness of lovers the reputation of women the legitimacy of

husband would languish and grow weak like the lonely flower which the
