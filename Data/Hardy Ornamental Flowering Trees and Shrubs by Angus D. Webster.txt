preface to first edition 1893
this book has been written and is published with the distinct object
in view of bringing home to the minds of planters of hardy trees and
shrubs the fact that the monotonous repetition in at least ninetenths
of our parks and gardens of such trees as the elm the lime and the
oak and such shrubs as the cherry laurel and the privet is neither
necessary nor desirable there is quite a host of choice and beautiful
flowering species which though at present not generally known are yet
perfectly hardy of the simplest culture and equally well adapted for
the ornamentation of our public and private parks and gardens
of late years with the marked decline in the cultivation of coniferous
trees many of which are ill adapted for the climate of this country
the interest in our lovely flowering trees and shrubs has been greatly
revived this fact has been well exemplified in the numerous enquiries
after these subjects and the space devoted to their description and
modes of cultivation in the horticultural press
in the hope too of helping to establish a muchdesired standard of
nomenclature i have followed the generic names adopted by the authors
of the genera plantarum and the specific names and orthography as
far as i have been able of the index kewensis and where possible
i have given the synonyms the date of introduction and the native
country the alphabetical arrangement that has been adopted both with
regard to the genera and species it is hoped will greatly facilitate
the work of reference to its pages the descriptive notes and hints on
cultivation the selected lists of trees and shrubs for various special
purposes and the calendarial list which indicates the flowering season
of the different species may be considered all the more valuable for
being concisely written and made readily accessible by means of the
index
no work written on a similar plan and treating solely of hardy
ornamental flowering trees and shrubs has hitherto been published
and it is not supposed for a moment that the present one will entirely
supply the deficiency but should it meet with any measure of public
approval it may be the means of paving the way towards the publication
of a more elaborate workand one altogether more worthy of the
interesting and beautiful flowering trees and shrubs that have been
found suitable for planting in the climate of the british isles
of the fully thirteen hundred species and varieties of trees and shrubs
enumerated all may be depended upon as being hardy in some part of the
country several of them and particularly those introduced from china
and japan have not before been included in a book of this character
trials for the special purpose of testing the hardiness of the more
tender kinds have been instituted and carried out in several favoured
parts of england and ireland

preface to second and cheap edition 1897
the first edition of hardy ornamental flowering trees and shrubs having
been sold out it has been considered desirable to run off a second and
cheap edition on exactly similar lines to the first and previous to the
more elaborate illustrated edition which is now in hand

hardy ornamental flowering trees  shrubs
abelia
abelia chinensis syn a rupestristhe rock abelia china 1844
this is a neat twiggy shrub growing from 2 ft to 3 ft high with
slender shoots and very pleasing shining green serrated leaves the
tubular sweetscented flowers are produced in clusters at the ends of
the shoots even the smallest and are of a very delicate shade of
pinkindeed almost white it makes an excellent wall plant but by
no means refuses to grow and flower freely without either shelter or
protection provided a fairly rich and well drained soil is provided
from august to october is the flowering period of this handsome
deciduous shrub this is the only really hardy species of the genus
for though the rosypurple flowered a floribunda from mexico has stood
for several years uninjured in the south of england it is not to be
relied upon both species are readily propagated from cuttings
a triflorahimalayan regions 1847 a halfhardy and beautiful
species with small lanceolate entire leaves and pretty starshaped
flowers that are white and flushed with pink the long narrow and
hairy calyxlobes give a light and feathery appearance to the flowers
which are produced continuously from may to november it does best as a
wall plant and several beautiful examples may be seen in and around
london as also at exeter and in the south of ireland
adenocarpus
adenocarpus decorticans syn a boissierispain 1883 this little
known hardy shrub a native of the sierra nevada mountains in spain is
one of great beauty and well worthy of extended culture the flowers
are produced abundantly and are of a bright yellow colour resembling
those of our common broom to which family it is nearly allied peaty
soil suits it well and repeated trials have clearly proved that it is
hardy at least in the south of england
aesculus
aesculus californica syn pavia californicacalifornia this is
one of the handsomest species of low spreading habit and blooming
freely about midsummer
ae glabra syn ae rubicundaredflowered horse chestnut north
america 1820 if only for its neat and moderate growth and attractive
spikes of brightlycoloured flowers this species must be considered as
one of the handsomest and most valuable of small growing trees being
of moderate size for we rarely meet with specimens of greater height
than 30 feet and of very compact habit it is rendered peculiarly
suitable for planting in confined spots and where larger growing and
more straggling subjects would be out of place it withstands soot and
smoke well and is therefore much valued for suburban planting the
long spikes of pretty red flowers are usually produced in great
abundance and as they stand well above the foliage and are of firm
lasting substance they have a most pleasing and attractive appearance
as there are numerous forms of the redflowered horse chestnut
differing much in the depth of flower colouring it may be well to warn
planters for some of these have but a faint tinge of pink overlying a
dirty yellowishgreen groundwork while the finest and most desirable
tree has the flowers of a decided pinkyred there is a doubleflowered
variety ae glabra florepleno syn ae rubicunda florepleno and
one of particular merit named ae rubicunda briotii
ae hippocastanumthe common horse chestnut asia 1629 a fine
hardy freeflowering tree supposed to have been introduced from asia
and of which there are several varieties including a doubleflowered
a variegated and several lobed and cutleaved forms the tree needs
no description the spikes of pinkywhite flowers which are produced
in great abundance and ample foliage rendering it one of if not the
handsomest tree of our acquaintance it gives a pleasing shade and
forms an imposing and picturesque object in the landscape especially
where the conditions of soila rich free loamare provided ae
hippocastanum alba florepleno the double white horse chestnut has
a decidedly pyramidal habit of growth and the flowers which are
larger than those of the species are perfectly double it is a very
distinct and desirable large growing tree ae hippocastanum laciniata
and ae hippocastanum digitalis are valuable for their divided leaves
while ae hippocastanum foliis variegatis has the foliage rather
irregularly variegated
ae parviflora syn pavia macrostachyabuckeye north america
1820 this is very distinct and possesses feature which are shared by
no other hardy tree or shrub in cultivation rarely exceeding 12 feet
in height and with a spread of often as much as 20 feet this shrub
forms a perfect hemisphere of foliage and which when tipped with the
pretty fragrant flowers renders it one of the most effective and
handsome the foliage is large and resembles that of the common horse
chestnut while the pure white flowers with their long projecting
stamens and redtipped anthers are very pretty and imposing when at
their best in july it succeeds well in rich dampish loam and as a
shrub for standing alone in any conspicuous position it has indeed
few equals
ae pavia syn pavia rubrared buckeye north america 1711 a
small growing and slenderbranched tree or shrub which bears an
abundance of brownishscarlet flowers there are several good
varieties two of the best being ae pavia atrosanguinea and ae
pavia whittleyana with small brilliant red flowers
there are several other species such as ae pavia humilis syn pavia
humilis of trailing habit ae flava syn pavia flava bearing
pretty yellow flowers ae pavia macrocarpa syn pavia macrocarpa
an openheaded and graceful tree ae flava discolor syn pavia
discolor and ae chinensis but they have not been found very
amenable to cultivation except in very favoured parts of the south of
england and ireland
ailanthus
ailanthus glandulosatree of heaven china 1751 a handsome
fastgrowing tree with large pinnate leaves that are often fully
three feet long and terminal erect clusters of not very showy
greenishwhite flowers that exhale a rather disagreeable odour it is
one of the most distinct and imposing of pinnateleaved trees and
forms a neat specimen for the lawn or park light loam or a gravelly
subsoil suits it well
akebia
akebia quinatachinese akebia china 1845 this with its
peculiarlyformed and curiouslycoloured flowers though usually
treated as a cool greenhouse plant is yet sufficiently hardy to grow
and flower well in many of the southern and western english counties
where it has stood uninjured for many years it is a pretty twining
evergreen with the leaves placed on long slender petioles and
palmately divided into usually five leaflets the sweetscented
flowers particularly so in the evening are of a purplishbrown or
scarletpurple and produced in axillary racemes of from ten to a
dozen in each for covering trelliswork using as a wall plant or to
clamber over some loosegrowing specimen shrub from which a slight
protection will also be afforded the akebia is peculiarly suitable
and soon ascends to a height of 10 feet or 12 feet any ordinary
garden soil suits it and propagation by cuttings is readily affected
amelanchier
amelanchier alnifoliadwarf june berry nw america 1888 this
is a shrub of great beauty growing about 8 feet high and a native of
the mountains from british america to california this differs from a
canadensis in having much larger and more brillianttinted fruit and
in its shorter and more compact flower racemes the shape of the
leaves cannot be depended on as a point of recognition those before
me collected in the native habitat of the plant differing to a wide
extent in size and shape some being coarsely serrated while others
are almost entire
a canadensisjune berry canada 1746 unquestionably this is one
of the most beautiful and showy of early flowering trees during the
month of april the profusion of snowwhite flowers with which even
young specimens are mantled render the plant conspicuous for a long
way off while in autumn the golden yellow of the dyingoff foliage is
quite as remarkable being perfectly hardy of free growth and with
no particular desire for certain classes of soils the june berry
should be widely planted for ornamental effect in this country it
attains to a height of 40 feet and bears globose crimson fruit there
are several varieties including a canadensis rotundifolia a
canadensis oblongifolia and a canadensis oligocarpa the latter
being by some botanists ranked as a species
a vulgariscommon amelanchier south of europe 1596 this is the
only european species and grows about 16 feet in height it has been
in cultivation in this country for nearly 300 years generally this
species flowers earlier than the american ones has rounder and less
deeply serrated leaves but the flowers are much alike a vulgaris
cretica from crete and dalmatia is readily distinguished by the soft
white hairs with which the under sides of the leaves are thickly
covered to successfully cultivate the amelanchiers a good rich soil
is a necessity while shelter from cutting winds must be afforded if
the sheets of flowers are to be seen in their best form
amorpha
amorpha canescenslead plant missouri 1812 this is of much
smaller growth than a fruticosa with neat pinnate foliage whitened
with hoary down and bearing panicles of bluishpurple flowers with
conspicuous orange anthers it is a charming shrub and all the more
valuable as it flowers at the end of summer when few hardy plants are
in bloom to grow it satisfactorily a dry sandy soil is a necessity
a fruticosafalse indigo carolina 1724 this is a fast growing
shrub of fully 6 feet high of loose upright habit and with pretty
pinnate leaves the flowers are borne in densely packed spikes and
are of a purplish tint with bright yellow protruding anthers and
produced at the end of summer it prefers a dry warm soil of a sandy
or chalky nature and may readily be increased from cuttings or
suckers the latter being freely produced hard cutting back when full
size has been attained would seem to throw fresh vigour into the
amorpha and the flowering is greatly enhanced by such a mode of
treatment a native of carolina and perfectly hardy in most parts of
the country of this species there are several varieties amongst
others a fruticosa nana a dwarf twiggy plant a fruticosa
dealbata with lighter green foliage than the type and others
differing only in the size and width of the leaves
andromeda
andromeda polifoliaan indigenous shrub of low growth with
lanceolate shining leaves and pretty globose pinkywhite flowers of
it there are two varieties a polifolia major and a polifolia
angustifolia both well worthy of culture for their neat habit and
pretty flowers
see cassandra cassiope leucothoe oxydendrum pieris and zenobia
aralia
aralia mandshurica syn dimorphanthus mandschuricusmanchuria
1866 there is not much beauty about this chinese tree for it is but
a big spiny stake with no branches and a tuft of palmlike foliage
at the top the flowers however are both large and conspicuous and
impart to the tree an interesting and novel appearance they are
individually small of a creamywhite colour and produced in long
umbellate racemes and which when fully developed from their weight
and terminal position are tilted gracefully to one side usually the
stem is spiny with horse chestnutlike bark while the terminal bud
from its large size as if all the energy of the plant was
concentrated in the tip imparts a curious and somewhat ungainly
appearance to the tree from its curious tropical appearance this
species is well worthy of a place in the shrubbery it is unmindful of
soil if that is of at all fair quality and may be said to be
perfectly hardy over the greater part of the country
a spinosaangelica tree virginia 1688 amongst autumnflowering
shrubs this takes a high place for in mild seasons it blooms well
into october it grows about 12 feet high with large tripinnate
leaves composed of numerous serrulate leaflets the individual
flowers are small and whitish but being borne in large branched
panicles have a very imposing appearance it is of free growth and
produces suckers abundantly

arbutus
arbutus andrachnelevant 1724 this mediterranean species is of
stout growth with narrow laurellike leaves reddish deciduous bark
and greenishwhite flowers that are produced freely in may a hybrid
form said to have originated between this species and a unedo
partakes in part of the nature of both shrubs but the flowers are
larger than those of a unedo
a menziesii syn a proceratall strawberry tree northwest
america 1827 this is hardy in many parts of these islands
particularly maritime districts and is worthy of culture if only for
the large racemose panicles of deliciouslyscented white flowers and
peculiar metallicgreen leaves the fruit is orangered and only
about half the size of those of our commonly cultivated species
a unedostrawberry tree ireland this is a beautiful evergreen
shrub or smallgrowing tree sometimes fully 20 feet high with
ovatelanceolate leaves and clusters of pure white or yellowishtinged
flowers appearing in september and october the bright scarlet fruit
about the size of and resembling a strawberry is highly ornamental
and when borne in quantity imparts to the plant an unusual and very
attractive appearance generally speaking the arbutus is hardy
although in inland situations it is sometimes killed to the ground in
severe winters but springing freely from the root the plant soon
becomes reestablished in a young state it suffers too but after
becoming established and a few feet high the chances of injury are
greatly minimised three wellmarked varieties are a unedo coccinea
and a unedo rubra bearing scarlet and deepred flowers and a unedo
microphylla with much smaller leaves than those of the parent plant
a unedo croomei differs considerably from the former in having
larger foliage larger clusters of reddishpink flowers and the bark
of the young shoots of an enticing ruddy or rather brownishred
colour it is a very desirable and highly ornamental plant and one
that is well worthy of extended culture
there are several others to wit a photiniaefolia a rollissoni a
millerii with large leaves and pretty pink flowers and a
serratifolia having deeply serrated leaves deep light loam if on
chalk all the better and a fairly warm and sheltered situation would
seem to suit the arbutus best
arctostaphylos
arctostaphylos uvaursibearberry britain a neat shrub of trailing
habit and with flowers resembling those of the arbutus but much
smaller the leaves are entire dark green in colour and about an
inch long and obovate or oblong in shape fruit globular of a bright
red smooth and shining this is a native shrub being found in
scotland northern england and ireland
a alpinablack bearberry scotland this is confined to the
northern highlands of scotland is of smaller growth with toothed
deciduous leaves and small drooping flowers of two or three together
aristolochia
aristolochia siphodutchmans pipe north america 1763 a
largegrowing deciduous climbing shrub remarkable for its ample
foliage and curiously formed yellow and purple streaked flowers a
native of north america it is perfectly hardy in this country and
makes an excellent wall plant where plenty of space can be afforded
for the rambling branches what a pity it is that so ornamental a
climber whose big darkgreen leaves overlap each other as if
intended for keeping a house cool in warm weather is not more
generally planted it does well and grows fast in almost any soil
asimina
asimina trilobavirginian papaw pennsylvania 1736 this is a
curious and uncommon shrub that one rarely sees outside the walls of a
botanic garden the flowers are dark purple or chocolate brown fully
2 inches across and succeeded by a yellow oblong pulpy fruit that
is relished by the natives and from which the name of north american
custard apple has been derived in this country it is quite at home
growing around london to quite 12 feet in height but it wants a warm
dry soil and sunny sheltered situation as a wall plant it does well
azara
azara microphyllachili 1873 this is the only recognised hardy
species and probably the best from an ornamental point of view in
mild seaside districts it may succeed as a standard in the open
ground but generally it is cultivated as a wall plant and for which
it is peculiarly suitable the small dark green glossy leaves are
thickly arranged on the nearly horizontal branches while the flowers
if they lack in point of showiness are deliciously fragrant and
plentifully produced for wallcovering especially in an eastern
aspect it is one of the neatest of shrubs
other species in cultivation are a serrata a lanceolata and a
integrifolia but for general planting and unless under the most
favoured conditions they are not to be recommended the azaras are by
no means particular about the quality of soil in which they are
planted and succeed well even in stiffish loam bordering on clay
baccharis
baccharis halimifoliagroundsel tree or sea purslane north america
for seaside planting this is an invaluable shrub as it succeeds well
down even to high water mark and where it is almost lashed by the
salt spray the flowers are not very ornamental resembling somewhat
those of the groundsel but white with a tint of purple leaves
obovate in shape notched and thickly covered with a whitish powder
which imparts to them a pleasing glaucous hue any light soil that is
tolerably dry suits well the wants of this shrub but it is always
seen in best condition by the seaside under favourable conditions it
attains to a height of 12 feet with a branch spread nearly as much in
diameter a native of the north american coast from maryland to
florida
b patagonicamegallan this is a very distinct and quite hardy
species with small deep green leaves and white flowers it succeeds
under the same conditions as the latter
berberidopsis
berberidopsis corallinacoral barberry chili 1862 this handsome
evergreen halfclimbing shrub is certainly not so well known as its
merits entitle it to be unfortunately it is not hardy in every part
of the country though in the southern and western english counties
but especially within the influence of the sea it succeeds well as
a wall plant and charms us with its globular waxy crimson or
coralred flowers the spinytoothed leaves approach very near those
of some of the barberries and with which the plant is nearly allied
it seems to do best in a partially shady situation and in rich light
loam
berberis
berberis aquifolium syn mahonia aquifoliumhollyleaved
barberry north america 1823 this justly ranks as one of the
handsomest most useful and easilycultivated of all hardy shrubs
it will grow almost any where and in any class of soil though
preferring a fairly rich loam growing under favourable conditions to
a height of 6 feet this north american shrub forms a dense mass of
almost impenetrable foliage the leaves are large dark shining green
thickly beset with spines while the deliciouslyscented yellow
flowers which are produced at each branch tip render the plant
particularly attractive in spring it is still further valuable both
on account of the rich autumnal tint of the foliage and pretty plum
colour of the plentifully produced fruit
b aquifolium repens syn mahonia repenscreeping barberry this
is of altogether smaller growth than the preceding but otherwise they
seem nearly allied from its dense dwarf growth rising as it rarely
does more than a foot from the ground and neat foliage this barberry
is particularly suitable for edging beds or forming a low evergreen
covering for rocky ground or mounds
b aristata a native of nepaul is a vigorousgrowing species
resembling somewhat our native plant with deeply serrated leaves
brightly tinted bark and yellow flowers it is of erect habit
branchy and in winter is rendered very conspicuous by reason of the
bright reddish colour of the leafless branches
b bealei syn mahonia beallijapan this species is one of the
first to appear in bloom often by the end of january the plant being
thickly studded with flowers it is a handsome shrub of erect habit
the leaves of a yellowishgreen tint and furnished with long spiny
teeth the clusters of racemes of deliciously fragrant yellow flowers
are of particular value being produced so early in the season
b buxifolia syn b dulcis and b microphyllastraits of
magellan 1827 a neat and erectgrowing shrub of somewhat stiff and
upright habit and bearing tiny yellow flowers this is a good
rockwork plant and being of neat habit with small purplish leaves
is well worthy of cultivation
b congestiflora from chili is not yet wellknown but promises to
become a general favourite with lovers of hardy shrubs it is of
unusual appearance for a barberry with long decumbent branches
which are thickly covered with masses of orangeyellow flowers the
branchtips being almost leafless and smothered with flowers impart
to the plant a striking but distinctly ornamental appearance
b darwiniichili 1849 this is perhaps the best known and most
ornamental of the family it forms a dense bush sometimes 10 feet
high with dark glossy leaves and dense racemes of orangeyellow
flowers produced in april and may and often again in the autumn
b empetrifoliastraits of magellan 1827 this is a neathabited
and dwarf evergreen species that even under the best cultivation
rarely exceeds 2 feet in height it is one of the hardiest species
and bears though rather sparsely terminal goldenyellow flowers
which are frequently produced both in spring and autumn for its
compact growth and neat foliage it is alone worthy of culture
b fortunei syn mahonia fortuneichina 1846 this is rather a
rare species in cultivation with finely toothed leaves composed of
about seven leaflets and bearing in abundance clustered racemes of
individually small yellow flowers a native of china and requiring a
warm sunny spot to do it justice
b gracilis syn mahonia gracilismexico a pretty halfhardy
species growing about 6 feet high with slender branches and
shininggreen leaves with bright red stalks flowers small in 3inch
long racemes deep yellow with bright red pedicels fruit globular
deep purple
b ilicifolia syn b neumaniisouth america 1791 this is
another handsome evergreen species from south america and requires
protection in this country the thick glossygreen leaves beset with
spines and large orangered flowers combine to make this species one
of great interest and beauty
b japonica syn mahonia japonicajapan this is not a very
satisfactory shrub in these isles although in warm seaside districts
and when planted in rich loam on a gravelly subsoil it forms a
handsome plant with noble foliage and deliciously fragrant yellow
flowers
b nepalensis syn mahonia nepalensisnepaul barberry this is a
noble himalayan species that one rarely sees in good condition in this
country unless when protected by glass the long chalkywhite stems
often rising to 8 feet in height are surmounted by dense clusters of
lemonyellow flowers planted outdoors this handsome and partly
evergreen barberry must have the protection of a wall
b nervosa syn mahonia glumaceanorth america 1804 this with
its terminal clusters of reddishyellow flowers produced in spring is
a highly attractive northwest american species it is of neat and
compact growth perfectly hardy but as yet it is rare in cultivation
the autumnal leafagetint is very attractive
b pinnata syn mahonia facicularisa native of mexico this
species is of stout growth with long leaves that are thickly
furnished with sharp spines the yellow flowers are produced
abundantly and being in large bunches render the plant very
conspicuous it is unfortunately not very hardy and requires wall
protection to do it justice
b sinensischina 1815 this is a really handsome and distinct
species with twiggy deciduous branches from the undersides of the
arching shoots of which the flowers hang in great profusion they are
greenishyellow inside but of a dark brownishcrimson without while
the leaves are small and round and die off crimson in autumn
b stenophylla a hybrid between b darwinii and b empetrifolia is
one of the handsomest forms in cultivation the wealth of
goldenyellow flowers being remarkable as is also the dark purple
berries it is very hardy and of the freest growth
b trifoliolata syn mahonia trifoliolatamexico 1839 this is a
very distinct and beautiful mexican species that will only succeed
around london as a wall plant it grows about a yard high with leaves
fully 3 inches long having three terminal sessile leaflets and
slender leaf stalks often 2 inches long the ternate leaflets are of a
glaucous blue colour marbled with dull green and very delicately
veined flowers small bright yellow and produced in fewflowered
axillary racemes on short peduncles the berries are small globular
and light red
b trifurca syn mahonia trifurcachina 1852 this is a shrub of
neat low growth but it does not appear to be at all plentiful
b vulgariscommon barberry this is a native species with oblong
leaves and terminal drooping racemes of yellow flowers it is
chiefly valued for the great wealth of orangescarlet fruit there are
two very distinct forms one bearing silvery and the other black
fruit and named respectively b vulgaris fructoalbo and b vulgaris
fructonigro
b wallichiana syn b hookerinepaul 1820 this is exceedingly
ornamental whether as regards the foliage flowers or fruit it is
of dense bushy growth with large dark green spiny leaves and an
abundance of clusters of clear yellow flowers the berries are deep
violetpurple and fully halfaninch long being perfectly hardy and
of free growth it is well suited for extensive planting
berchemia
berchemia volubilisclimbing berchemia carolina 1714 a rarely
seen deciduous climber bearing rather inconspicuous greenishyellow
flowers succeeded by attractive violettinted berries the foliage
is neat and pretty the individual leaves being ovate in shape and
slightly undulated or wavy it is a twining shrub that in this
country even under favourable circumstances one rarely sees
ascending to a greater height than about 12 feet sandy peat and a
shady site suits it best and so placed it will soon cover a
lowgrowing tree or bush much in the way that our common honeysuckle
does it is propagated from layers or cuttings
bignonia
bignonia capreolatavirginia and other parts of america 1710 this
is not so hardy as to be depended upon throughout the country
generally though in the milder parts of england and ireland it
succeeds well as a wall plant it is a handsome climbing shrub with
long heartshaped leaves usually terminating in branched tendrils
and large orange flowers produced singly
billardiera
billardiera longiflorablue apple berry van diemens land 1810 if
only for its rich blue berries as large as those of a cherry this
otherwise elegant climbing shrub is well worthy of a far greater share
of attention than it has yet received for it must be admitted that it
is far from common the greenish bellshaped blossoms produced in may
are perhaps not very attractive but this is more than compensated
for by the highly ornamental fruit which renders the plant an object
of great beauty about midseptember leaves small and narrow on
slender twining stems that clothe well the lower half of a garden
wall in some sunny favoured spot cuttings root freely if inserted in
sharp sand and placed in slight heat while seeds germinate quickly
bryanthus
bryanthus erectussiberia this is a pretty little ericaceous plant
nearly allied to menziesia and with a plentiful supply of darkgreen
leaves the flowers which are borne in crowded clusters at the points
of the shoots are bellshaped and of a pleasing reddishlilac colour
it wants a cool moist peaty soil and is perfectly hardy when in a
flowering stage the bryanthus is one of the brightest occupants of the
peat bed and is a very suitable companion for such dwarf plants as
 the heaths menziesias and smaller growing kalmias
b empetriformis syn menziesia empetrifolianorth america 1829
this is a compact neat species and well suited for alpine gardening
the flowers are rosypurple and produced abundantly
buddleia
buddleia globosaorange ball tree chili 1774 a shrubby species
ranging in height from 12 feet to 20 feet and the only one at all
common in gardens favoured spots in southern england would seem to
suit the plant fairly well but to see it at its best one must visit
some of the maritime gardens of north wales where it grows stout and
strong and flowers with amazing luxuriance where it thrives it must
be ranked amongst the most beautiful of wall plants for few indeed
are the standard specimens that are to be met with the protection
afforded by a wall being almost a necessity in its cultivation the
leaves are linearlanceolate and covered with a dense silvery
tomentum on the under side somewhat rugose above and partially
deciduous flowers in small globular heads bright orange or yellow
and being plentifully produced are very showy in early summer it
succeeds well in rich moist loam on gravel
b lindleyanachina 1844 this has purplishred flowers and angular
twigs but it cannot be relied upon unless in very sheltered and mild
parts of the country
b paniculata syn b crispanepaul 1823 this may at once be
distinguished by its curly woolly leaves and fragrant lilac flowers
it is a desirable species but suffers from our climate
bupleurum
bupleurum fruticosumhares ear south europe 1596 a smallgrowing
branching shrub with obovatelanceolate leaves and compound umbels
of yellowish flowers it is more curious than beautiful
caesalpinia
caesalpinia sepiaria syn c japonicaindia 1857 this is as yet
a comparatively little known shrub but one that from its beauty and
hardihood is sure to become a general favourite planted out in a
light sandy peaty soil and where fully exposed this shrub has done
well and proved itself a suitable subject for the climate of england
at least the hard prickles with which both stem and branches are
provided renders the shrub of rather formidable appearance while the
leaves are of a peculiarly pleasing softgreen tint for the flowers
too it is well worthy of attention the pinky anthers contrasting so
markedly with the deep yellow of the other portions of the flower
they are arranged in long racemes and show well above the foliage
calluna
calluna vulgaris syn erica vulgariscommon ling on heather this
is the commonest native species with purplishpink flowers on small
pedicels there are many very distinct and beautifulflowering forms
the following being some of the best c vulgaris alba whiteflowered
c vulgaris hammondi c vulgaris minor and c vulgaris pilosa all
whiteflowered forms c vulgaris alportii and c vulgaris alportii
variegata the former bearing rich crimson flowers and the latter with
distinctly variegated foliage c vulgaris argentea and c vulgaris
aurea with silveryvariegated and golden foliage c vulgaris
florepleno a most beautiful and freegrowing variety with double
flowers c vulgaris foxii a dwarf plant that does not flower freely
and c vulgaris pumila and c vulgaris dumosa which are of small
cushionlike growth
calophaca
calophaca wolgaricasiberia 1786 this member of the pea family is
of dwarf branching growth thickly clothed with glandular hairs and
bears yellow flowers succeeded by reddishpurple pods it is of no
special importance as an ornamental shrub and is most frequently seen
grafted on the laburnum though its natural easy habit of growth is far
preferable hailing from siberia it may be considered as fairly hardy
at least
calycanthus
calycanthus floriduscarolina allspice carolina 1726 if only
for the purplishred pleasantlyscented flowers this north american
shrub is worthy of extensive culture the hardiness accommodating
nature and delicious perfume of its brightlycoloured flowers render
this shrub one of the choicest subjects for the shrubbery or edges
of the woodland path it is of easy though compact growth reaching
in favourable situations a height of 12 feet and with ovate leaves
that are slightly pubescent growing best in good fairly moist loam
where partial shade is afforded the sides of woodland drives and
paths will suit this allspice well but it wants plenty of room for
branchdevelopment there are several nursery forms of this shrub
such as c floridus glaucus c floridus asplenifolia and c floridus
nanus all probably distinct enough but of no superior ornamental
value to the parent plant
c occidentaliscalifornian or western allspice california 1831
this is larger in all its parts than the former and for decorative
purposes is even preferable to that species the flowers are dark
crimson and nearly twice as large as those of c floridus but rather
more sparsely produced this is a very distinct and desirable species
and one that can be recommended for lawn and park planting but like
the former it delights to grow in a rather moist and shady situation
caragana
caragana arborescenssiberian pea tree siberia 1752 on account
of its great hardihood this is a very desirable garden shrub or
smallgrowing tree the brightyellow peashaped flowers are very
attractive while the deepgreen pinnate foliage imparts to the tree a
somewhat unusual but taking appearance soil would not seem to be of
much moment in the cultivation of this as indeed the other species
of caragana for it thrives well either on dry sunny banks where the
soil is light and thin or in good stiff yellow loam
c frutescenssiberia 1852 flowers in may and is of partially
upright habit while c chamlagii from china has greenishyellow
flowers faintly tinted with pinkypurple
c microphylla syn c altagana also from siberia is smaller of
growth than the foregoing but the flowers are individually larger it
is readily distinguished by the more numerous and hairy leaflets and
thorny nature
c spinosasiberia 1775 this as the name indicates is of spiny
growth and is a beautiful and distinct member of the family they are
all hardy and readily propagated from seed
cardiandra
cardiandra alternifoliajapan 1866 with its neat habit and pretty
purpleandwhite plentifullyproduced flowers this is worthy of the
small amount of care and coddling required to insure its growth in this
country hailing from japan it cannot be reckoned as very hardy but
treated as a wall plant this pretty evergreen does well and flowers
freely it can however be said that it is equally hardy with some
of the finer kinds of hydrangea to which genus it is nearly allied
carpenteria
carpenteria californicasierra nevada california 1880 this is
undoubtedly one of the most distinct and beautiful of hardy shrubs
that it is perfectly hardy in england and ireland recentlyconducted
experiments conclusively prove as plants have stood unprotected
through the past unusually severe winters with which this country has
been visited when in full bloom the purewhite flowers resembling
those of the japanese anemone render it of great beauty while the
light gray leaves are of themselves sufficient to make the shrub one of
particular attraction the carpenteria is nearly related to the mock
orange philadelphus grows about 10 feet in height with lithe and
slender branches and light gray leaves the flowers which are pure
white with a bunch of yellow stamens and sweetscented are produced
usually in fives at the branchtips and contrast markedly with the
long and light green foliage it grows and flowers with freedom almost
anywhere but is all the better for wall protection from cuttings or
suckers it is readily increased
caryopteris
caryopteris mastacanthuschina and japan 1844 this is a neatgrowing
chinese shrub and of value for its pretty flowers that are produced
late in the autumn it must be ranked as fairly hardy having stood
through the winters of southern england unprotected but it is just as
well to give so choice a shrub the slight protection afforded by a
wall the leaves are neat thicklyarranged and hoary while the whole
plant is twiggy and of strict though by no means formal growth flowers
lavenderblue borne at the tips of the shoots and appearing in
succession for a considerable length of time light sandy peat would
seem to suit it well at least in such it grows and flowers freely
cassandra
cassandra calyculata syn andromeda calyculatanorth america
1748 this is a handsome species from the virginian swamps but one
that is rarely seen in a very satisfactory condition in this country
it grows about 18 inches high with lanceolate dullgreen leaves and
pretty pinkywhite flowers individually large and produced abundantly
for the banks of a pond or lake it is a capital shrub and very
effective particularly if massed in groups of from a dozen to twenty
plants in each there are several nursery forms of which a calyculata
minor is the best and most distinct
cassinia
cassinia fulvida syn diplopappus chrysophyllusnew zealand this
is a neatgrowing and beautiful shrub the rich yellow stems and under
sides of the leaves imparting quite a tint of gold to the whole plant
the flowers are individually small but the whole head which is
creamywhite is very effective and contrasts strangely with the
golden sheen of this beautiful shrub it is inclined to be of rather
upright growth is stout and bushy and is readily increased from
cuttings planted in sandy soil in the open border probably in the
colder parts of the country this charming shrub might not prove
perfectly hardy but all over england and ireland it seems to be quite
at home the flowers are produced for several months of the year but
are at their best about midnovember thus rendering the shrub of still
further value it grows freely in sandy peaty soil of a light nature
cassiope
cassiope fastigiata syn andromeda fastigiata and c tetragona syn
andromeda tetragona are smallgrowing species only suitable for rock
gardeningthe former of neat upright habit with large pinkywhite
bells all along the stems and the latter of bushy growth with square
stems and small white flowers
castanea
castanea sativa syn c vesca and c vulgarissweet spanish
chestnut asia minor few persons who have seen this tree as an
isolated specimen and when in full flower would feel inclined to
exclude it from our list the long cylindrical catkins of a
yellowishgreen colour are usually borne in such abundance that the
tree is during the month of june one of particular interest and
beauty so common a tree needs no description but it may be well to
mention that there are several worthy varieties and which flower
almost equally well with the parent tree
catalpa
catalpa bignonioidesindian bean north america 1798 when in
full bloom this is a remarkable and highly ornamental tree the
curiouslymarked flowers and unusually large bronzytinted foliage
being distinct from those of almost any other in cultivation that it
is not perhaps perfectly hardy in every part of the country is to be
regretted but the numerous fine old specimens that are to be met with
all over the country point out that there need be little to fear when
assigning this pretty and uncommon tree a position in our parks and
gardens the flowers produced in spikes at the branchtips are white
tinged with violet and speckled with purple and yellow in the throat
individually the flowers are of large size and very ornamental and
being produced freely give the tree a bright and pleasing appearance
when at their best usually the tree attains to a height of 30 feet in
this country with rather crooked and ungainly branches and large
heartshaped leaves that are downy beneath it flourishes well on any
free soil and is an excellent smokeresisting tree c bignonioides
aurea is a decided variety that differs mainly in the leaves being of
a desirable golden tint
c bungei and c kaempferi natives of china and japan are hardly
to be relied upon being of tender growth and unless in the most
favoured situations suffer from our severe winters they resemble our
commonly cultivated tree
c speciosaunited states 1879 the western catalpa is more erect
and taller of growth than c bignonioides the flowers too are larger
and of purer white and with the throat markings of purple and yellow
more distinct and not inclined to run into each other leaves large
heartshaped tapering to a point of a light pleasing green and soft
to the touch it flowers earlier and is more hardy than the former
ceanothus
ceanothus americanusnew jersey tea north america 1713 a shrub of
4 feet in height with deep green serrated leaves that are 2 inches
long and pubescent on the under sides flowers white in axillary
panicles and produced in great abundance this is one of the hardiest
species but succeeds best when afforded wall protection
c azureusmexico 1818 this species though not hardy enough for
every situation is yet sufficiently so to stand unharmed as a wall
plant it grows from 10 feet to 12 feet high with deepgreen leaves
that are hoary on the under sides the flowers which are borne in
large axillary panicles are bright blue and produced in june and the
following months in a light dry soil and sunny position this shrub
does well as a wall plant for which purpose it is one of the most
ornamental there are several good nursery forms of which the following
are amongst the bestc azureus albert pettitt c azureus albidus
c azureus arnddii one of the best c azureus gloire de versailles
and c azureus marie simon
c cuneatus syn c verrucosuscalifornia 1848 this is another
halfhardy species that requires wall protection which may also be
said of c veitchianus one of the most beautiful of the family with
dense clusters of rich blue flowers and a neat habit of growth
c dentatuscalifornia 1848 with deeplytoothed shininggreen
leaves and deep blue abundantlyproduced flowers this is a
wellknown wall plant that succeeds in many parts of the country
particularly within the influence of the sea it commences flowering in
may and frequently continues until frosts set in it is a very
desirable species that in favoured situations will grow to fully 10
feet high and with a spread laterally of nearly the same dimensions
c papillosuscalifornia 1848 this is a straggling bush with
small blunt leaves and panicles of pale blue flowers on long
footstalks a native of california and requiring wall protection
c rigidusanother californian species is of upright stiff growth
a subevergreen with deep purple flowers produced in april and may
there are other less hardy kinds including c floribundus c
integerrimus c velutinus and c divaricatus
cedrela
cedrela sinensis syn ailanthus flavescenschina 1875 this is a
fast growing tree closely resembling the ailanthus and evidently
quite as hardy it has a great advantage over that tree in that the
flowers have an agreeable odour those of the ailanthus being somewhat
sickly and unpleasant the flowers are individually small but arranged
in immense hanging bunches like those of koelreuteria paniculata and
being pleasantly scented are rendered still the more valuable the
whole plant has a yellow hue and the roots have a peculiar reddish
colour and very unlike those of the ailanthus which are white
celastrus
celastrus scandensclimbing waxwork or bitter sweet north america
1736 when planted in rich moist soil this soon forms an attractive
mass of twisting and twining growths with distinct glossy foliage
in summer and brilliant scarlet fruit in autumn the flowers are
inconspicuous the chief beauty of the shrub being the show of fruit
which resembles somewhat those of the spindle tree euonymus and to
which it is nearly allied a native of north america it grows from 12
feet to 15 feet high and is useful in this country for covering arches
or tree stems or for allowing to run about at will on a mound of earth
or on rockwork
celtis
celtis australissouth europe 1796 this species is much like c
occidentalis with black edible fruit it is not of so tall growth as
the american species
c occidentalisnettle tree north america 1656 in general
appearance this tree resembles the elm to which family it belongs it
has reticulated cordateovate serrated leaves with small greenish
flowers on slender stalks and succeeded by blackishpurple fruit about
the size of a pea a not very ornamental tree at least so far as
flowers are concerned but valuable for lawn planting it varies very
much in the size and shape of the leaves
cercis
cercis canadensisnorth america 1730 this species resembles c
siliquastrum but is of much smaller growth and bears paler flowers
while c chinensis which is not hardy has large rosypink flowers
c siliquastrumjudas tree south europe 1596 a smallgrowing tree
of some 15 feet in height and with usually a rather ungainly and
crooked mode of growth it is however one of our choicest subjects
for ornamental planting the handsome reniform leaves and rosypurple
flowers produced along the branches and before the leaves appear
rendering it a great favourite with planters there are three distinct
forms of this shrubthe first c siliquastrum alba having pure white
flowers c siliquastrum carnea with beautiful deep pink flowers and
c siliquastrum variegata with neatly variegated foliage though
rather inconstant of character natives of south europe and amongst
the oldest trees of our gardens
they all succeed best when planted in rather damp loam and do not
object to partial shade the common species growing well even beneath
the drip of large standard trees
chimonanthus
chimonanthus fragranswinter flower japan 1766 this japanese shrub
is certainly one of the most remarkable that could be brought under
notice the deliciously fragrant flowers being produced in abundance
during the winter months and while the plant is yet leafless being of
slender growth it is best suited for planting against a wall the
protection thus afforded being just what is wanted for the perfect
development of the pretty flowers c fragrans grandiflora has larger
and less fragrant flowers than the species and is more common in
cultivation
chionanthus
chionanthus retusachina 1852 this is not a very hardy species
and being less ornamental than the american form is not to be
recommended for general planting
c virginicafringe tree north america 1736 a very ornamental
smallgrowing tree with large deciduous leaves and pendent clusters of
pure white flowers with long fringelike petals and from which the
popular name has arisen it is a charming tree or rather shrub in
this country for one rarely sees it more than 10 feet high and one
that to do it justice must have a cool and rather damp soil and a
somewhat shady situation
choisya
choisya ternatamexican orange flower mexico 1825 a beautiful and
distinct shrub that succeeds well in the south and west of england the
evergreen leaves are always fresh and beautiful and of a dark shining
green while the sweetlyfragrant flowers are produced freely on the
apices of last years wood they have a singular resemblance to those
of the orange and on the continent are commonly grown as a substitute
for that popular flower the plant succeeds well in any light rich
soil and soon grows into a goodlysized shrub of 4 feet or 5 feet in
height as a wall plant it succeeds well but in warm maritime
situations it may be planted as a standard without fear of harm
cuttings root freely if placed in slight heat
cistus
cistus crispusportugal 1656 this is a distinct species with
curled leaves and large reddishpurple flowers it is a valuable
ornamental shrub but like the others suffers from the effects of
frost
c ladaniferusgum cistus spain 1629 a pretty but rather tender
shrub growing in favourable situations to about 4 feet in height it
has lanceolate leaves that are glutinous above and thickly covered
with a whitish tomentum on the under sides and large and showy vhite
flowers with a conspicuous purple blotch at the base of each petal
unless in southern and western england but particularly on the
seacoast this handsome portuguese shrub is not to be depended on in
so far as hardihood is concerned
c laurifoliuslaurelleaved cistus spain 1731 this is the
hardiest species in cultivation but like the latter is favourable to
the milder parts of these islands and especially maritime districts
frequently it rises to 7 feet in height and is then an object of great
beauty the large yellowishwhite flowers showing well above the deep
green laurellike leaves
c monspeliensis south of europe 1656 and its variety c
monspeliensis florentinus the former with white and the latter with
white and yellow flowers are fairly hardy in the milder parts of
britain but cannot be recommended for general planting
c purpureuspurpleflowered cistas in this species which may rank
next to the latter in point of hardihood the flowers are of a deep
reddishpurple and with a darker blotch at the base of each petal
c salvifolius is of loose and rather untidy growth with rugose leaves
and white flowers it is very variable in character and the form
generally cultivated grows about 4 feet high and has ovatelanceolate
almost glabrous leaves
other species that are occasionally to be found in collections are c
creticus with yellow and purple flowers c hirsutus white with
yellow blotches at the base of the petals and c clusii with very
large purewhite flowers all the species of gum cistus or rock rose
as they are very appropriately named will be found to succeed best
when planted in exalted positions and among light though rich strong
soil they are easy of propagation
citrus
citrus trifoliatajapan 1869 this is a singular lowgrowing shrub
with ternate leaves spiny branches and fragrant white flowers it is
hardy in many english situations but does not fruit freely although
the orangeblossomlike flowers are produced very abundantly a pretty
little glossyleaved shrub that is well worthy of attention
particularly where a cosy corner can be put aside for its cultivation
cladrastis
cladrastis amurensisamoor yellow wood amur 1880 this is a shrub
that is sure to be extensively cultivated when better known and more
readily procured it has stood uninjured for several years in various
parts of england so that its hardihood may be taken for granted the
pretty olivegreen of the bark and the greyishgreen of the leathery
leaves render the shrub one of interest even in a flowerless state in
july and august the dense spikes of white or rather yellowishwhite
flowers are produced freely and that too even before the shrub has
attained to a height of 2 feet it is well worthy of extended culture
c tinctoria syn c lutea and virgilia luteayellow wood north
america 1812 this is a handsome deciduous tree that does well in many
parts of the country and is valued for the rich profusion of white
flowers produced and which are well setoff by the finelycut pinnate
leaves it is a valuable tree for park and lawn planting requiring a
warm dry soil and sunny situationconditions under which the wood
becomes wellripened and the flowers more freely produced
clematis
clematis alpina syn atragene alpina a austriaca and a
sibericaeurope and north america this is a climbing species with
biternately divided leaves and large flowers with four blue sepals
and ten to twelve small flattened organs which are usually termed
petals
c cirrhosaevergreen virgins bower spain 1596 an interesting
earlyflowering species the flowers which are greenishwhite are
produced in bunches and very effective it is an evergreen species of
comparative hardihood and flowers well in sheltered situations
c flammulavirgins bower france 1596 this old and wellknown
plant is quite hardy in this country the leaves are pinnate and the
flowers white and fragrant c flammula rubromarginata is a worthy and
beautifulleaved variety
c floridajapan 1776 this is a beautiful species and an old
inhabitant of english gardens leaves composed of usually three
ovalshaped leaflets and unusually bright of tint the flowers are
very large and pure white it should be planted in a warm sheltered
corner against a wall
c graveolensthis is a dwarf shrub with neatly tripinnate leaves
and solitary stronglyscented yellow flowers of medium size a native
of chinese tartary and quite hardy
c lanuginosachina 1851 a handsome species with large purple
leaves that are hairy on the under sides flowers pale blue or lilac
very large and composed of six or eight spreading sepals c
lanuginosa pallida has immense flowers often fully half a foot in
diameter flowers in june
c montananepaul 1831 this is valuable on account of its flowering
in may it is a freegrowing species with trifoliolate leaves on long
footstalks and large white flowers c montana grandiflora is a
beautiful variety having large white flowers so abundantly produced as
to hide the foliage it is quite hardy and of rampant growth
c patens syns c caerulea and c azurea grandiflorajapan
1836 this has large paleviolet flowers and is the parent of many
single and double flowered forms the typical form is however very
deserving of cultivation on account of the freedom with which it
blooms during june and july from the wood of the previous year it is
perfectly hardy even in the far north
c viornaleather flower united states this is a showy
smallflowered species the flowers being campanulate greenishwhite
within and purplish without c viorna coccinea is not yet well known
but is one of the prettiest of the smallflowered section the flowers
which are leathery as in the species are of a beautiful vermilion on
the outside and yellow within
c vitalbaladys bower or old mans beard a handsome native climbing
shrub common in limestone or chalky districts and unusually abundant
in the southern english counties clambering over some neglected fence
often to nearly 20 feet in height this vigorousgrowing plant is seen
to best advantage the three or fivelobed leaves and festoons of
greenishwhite fragrant flowers succeeded by the curious and attractive
feathery carpels render the plant one of the most distinct and desirable
of our native wildlings flowering in august
c viticellaspain 1569 this is a wellknown species of not too
rampant growth and a native of spain and italy the flowers vary a
good deal in colour but in the typical plant they are reddishpurple
and produced throughout the summer crossed with c lanuginosa this
species has produced many ornamental and beautiful hybrids one of the
finest and most popular being c jackmanii
c williamsi syn c fortuneijapan 1863 the fragrant white
flowers of this species are semidouble and consist of about 100
oblonglanceolate sepals narrowed to the base the leathery leaves are
trifoliolate with heartshaped leaflets it proves quite hardy and has
several varieties
garden varietiesas well as the above there are many beautiful garden
hybrids some of which in point of floral colouring far outvie the
parent forms included in the following list are a few of the most
beautiful kinds

clerodendron
clerodendron trichotomumjapan 1800 this is at once one of the most
beautiful and distinct of hardy shrubs it is of stout nearly erect
growth 8 feet high and nearly as much through with large
darkgreen ovate leaves and deliciously fragrant white flowers with
a purplish calyx and which are at their best in september thriving
well in any light soil being of vigorous constitution and extremely
handsome of flower are qualities which combine to render this shrub
one of particular importance in our gardens
c foetidum a native of china is only hardy in southern and seaside
situations where it forms a bush 5 feet high with heartshaped leaves
and large clusters of rosypink flowers
clethra
clethra acuminatapointedleaved pepper tree carolina 1806 this is
not so hardy as c alnifolia hailing from the southern states of north
america but with a little protection is able to do battle with our
average english winter it resembles c alnifolia except in the
leaves which are sharp pointed and like that species delights to grow
in damp positions the flowers are white and drooping and the growth
more robust than is that of c alnifolia generally for planting by the
pond or lakeside the pepper trees are almost invaluable
c alnifoliaalderleaved pepper tree north america 1831 a rather
stiffgrowing shrub of about 5 feet in height with leaves resembling
those of our common alder and bearing towards the end of july spikes
of almost oppressively fragrant dullwhite flowers at the tips of the
branches it is a valuable shrub not only in an ornamental way but on
account of it thriving in damp swampy ground where few others could
exist while at the same time it will succeed and flower freely in
almost any good garden soil
cocculus
cocculus carolinusthis is a half hardy twining shrub of free
growth when planted by a tree stem in a sheltered wood but with by no
means showy flowers indeed it may be described in few words as a
shrub of no great beauty nor value
c laurifolius from the himalayas and japan is even less hardy than
the above although used as a wall plant it has survived for many
years in the south and west of england the foliage of this species is
neat and ornamental but liable to injury from cold easterly winds
colletia
colletia cruciata syn c bictonensischili 1824 with flattened
woody branches and sharppointed spines which take the place of
leaves this is at once one of the most singular of hardy flowering
shrubs it forms a stout dense bush about 4 feet high and bears
quantities of small white flowers which render the plant one of great
beauty during the summer months
c spinosaperu 1823 this species grows fairly well in some parts
of england and ireland and is a curious shrub with awlshaped leaves
and like the other members of the family an abundant producer of
flowers it thrives best as a wall plant and when favourably situated
a height of 12 feet is sometimes attained
colutea
colutea arborescensbladder senna france 1548 this is a common
plant in english gardens bearing yellow peashaped flowers that are
succeeded by curious reddish bladderlike seed pods it grows to 10

senna levant 1710 this is a freegrowing roundheaded deciduous
bush of from 6 feet to 8 feet high when fully grown the leaves are
pinnate and glaucous smooth and bright green above and downy
beneath flowers individually large of a reddishcopper colour with a
yellow spot at the base of the upper petal the fruit is an inflated
boatshaped reddish pod the bladder sennas are of very free growth
even in poor sandy soil and being highly ornamental whether in
flower or fruit are to be recommended for extensive cultivation
coriaria
coriaria myrtifoliasouth europe 1629 a deciduous shrub growing to
about 4 feet in height with myrtlelike leaves and upright terminal
racemes of not very showy flowers produced about midsummergenerally
from may to august for its pretty foliage and the frondlike
arrangement of its branches it is principally worthy of culture from
southern europe and the north of africa where it is an occupant of
waste ground and hedges but still rare in our gardens
cornus
cornus albawhitefruited dogwood siberia 1741 this is a native of
northern asia and siberia not of america as loudon stated for the
slender redbarked branches and white or creamy flowers this species
is well worthy of notice while the white fruit renders it very
distinct and effective it grows to about 10 feet in height c alba
spathi is one of the most ornamental of shrubs bearing coloured leaves
these in spring being of a beautiful bronzy tint and changing towards
summer to a mixture of gold and green or rather an irregular margin of
deep gold surrounds each leaf it was first sent out by the famous
berlin nurseryman whose name it bears c alba gouchaulti is another
variegated leaved variety but has no particular merit and originated
in one of the french nurseries
c alternifolianorth america 1760 this species is a lover of damp
ground and grows from 20 feet to nearly 30 feet high with clusters of
pale yellow flowers succeeded by bluishblack berries that render the
plant highly ornamental it is still rare in british gardens
c amomum syn c sericeafrom the eastern united states it is a
lowgrowing damploving shrub with yellowishwhite flowers borne
abundantly in small clusters it grows about 8 feet in height and has
a graceful habit owing to the long and lithe branches spreading
regularly over the ground the fruit is pale blue and the bark a
conspicuous purple
c asperifolia is another showy american species with reddishbrown
bark hairy leaves of small size and rather small flowers that are
succeeded by pearlywhite berries borne on conspicuous reddish stalks
c baileyi resembles somewhat the betterknown c stolonifera but it
is of more erect habit is not stoloniferous has rather woolly leaves
at least on the under side and bears yellowishwhite fruit it grows
in sandy soil and is a native of canada
c californica syn c pubescens grows fully 10 feet high with
smooth branches hairy branchlets and cymes of pretty white flowers
succeeded by white fruit it occurs from southern california to british
columbia
c canadensisdwarf cornel or birchberry canada 1774 this is of
herbaceous growth and remarkable for the large creamcoloured flower
bracts and showy red fruit
c candidissima syn c paniculata is a beautiful american species
with panicled clusters of almost pure white flowers that are succeeded
by pale blue fruit it is a small growing tree with narrow pointed
leaves and greyish coloured smooth bark like many of its fellows
this species likes rather moist ground
c circinata from the eastern united states is readily distinguished
by its large round leaves these sometimes measuring 6 inches long by
312 inches wide the yellowishwhite flowers are individually small
and succeeded by bright blue fruits each as large as a pea
c capitata syn benthamia fragiferanepaul 1825 an evergreen
shrub with oblong light green leaves and terminal inconspicuous
greenish flowers surrounded by an involucre of four large
pinkyyellow bracts it is this latter that renders the shrub so very
conspicuous when in full flower unfortunately the benthamia is not
hardy throughout the country the south and west of england especially
cornwall and the southern parts of ireland being the favoured spots
where this handsome shrub or small growing treefor in cornwall it has
attained to fully 45 feet in height and in cork nearly 30 feetmay be
found in a really thriving condition around london it does well enough
for a time but with severe frost it gets cut back to the ground and
though it quickly recovers and grows rapidly afterwards before it is
large enough to flower freely it usually suffers again the fruits are
as large and resemble strawberries and of a rich scarlet or reddish
hue and though ripe in october they frequently remain on the trees
throughout the winter both for its flowers and fruit this nepaul
shrubtree is well worthy of a great amount of trouble to get it
established in a cosy corner of the garden rich welldrained loam is
all it wants while propagation by seed is readily effected
c florida the florida dogwood is not always very satisfactory when
grown in this country our climate in some way or other being
unsuitable for its perfect development it is a handsome shrub or
smallgrowing tree with small flowers surrounded by a large and
conspicuous white involucre the leaves are ovateoblong and pubescent
on the undersides it is a valuable as well as ornamental little tree
and is worthy of a great amount of coddling and coaxing to get it
established
c kousa syn benthamia japonicajapan this is a very distinct
and beautiful flowering shrub flowers very small individually but
borne in large clusters and yellow the showy part being the four
large pure white bracts which subtend each cluster of blossoms much
like those in cornus florida only the bracts are more pointed than
those of the latter species being quite hardy and a plant of great
interest and beauty this little known cornus is sure to be widely
planted when better known
c macrophylla syn c brachypodahimalayas china and japan
1827 this is an exceedingly handsome species of tabulated appearance
occasioned by the branches being arranged almost horizontally the
leaves are of large size ellipticovate and are remarkable for their
autumnal tints the elderlike flowers appear in june they are pure
white and arranged in large cymes c macrophylla variegata is a
distinct and very ornamental form of the above in which the leaf
margins are bordered with white
c mascornelian cherry austria 1596 one of our earliest flowering
trees the clusters of yellow blooms being produced in mild seasons by
the middle of february it is not at all fastidious about soil
thriving well in that of very opposite description it deserves to be
extensively cultivated if only for the profusion of brightlytinted
flowers which completely cover the shoots before the leaves have
appeared c mas aureaelegantissima the tricolorleaved dogwood is a
strikingly ornamental shrub with green leaves encircled with a golden
band the whole being suffused with a faint pinky tinge it is of more
slender growth than the species and a very desirable acquisition to
any collection of hardy ornamental shrubs c mas argenteovariegata is
another pretty shrub the leaves being margined with clear white
c nuttallii grows to fully 50 feet in height and is one of the most
beautiful of the oregon and californian forest trees the flower bracts
are of large size often 6 inches across the individual bracts being
broad and white and fully 212 inches long
c officinalis is a japanese species that is however quite hardy in
this country and nearly resembles the better known c mas but from
which it may at once be known by the tufts of brownish hairs that are
present in the axils of the principal leaf veins
c stoloniferared osier dogwood north america 1741 this has
rather inconspicuous flowers that are succeeded by whitish fruit and
is of greatest value for the ruddy tint of the young shoots it grows
fully 6 feet high and increases rapidly by underground suckers the
species is quite hardy
c tartarica syn c sibericasiberia 1824 this has much
brighter coloured bark and is of neater and dwarfer habit than the
typical c alba it is a very beautiful and valuable shrub of which
there is a variegated leaved form
corokia
corokia cotoneasternew zealand 1876 a curious dwarfgrowing
shrub with small bright yellow starry flowers produced in june the
hardiness of the shrub is rather doubtful
coronilla
coronilla emerusscorpion senna france 1596 this shrub a native
of the middle and southern parts of europe forms an elegant loose bush
about 5 feet high with smooth pinnate subevergreen leaves and
peashaped flowers that are reddish in the bud state but bright
yellow when fully expanded it is an elegant plant and on account of
its bearing hard cutting back is well suited for ornamental hedge
formation but however used the effect is good the distinct foliage
and showy flowers making it a general favourite with planters it will
thrive in very poor soil but prefers a light rich loam
corylopsis
corylopsis himalayanae himalayas 1879 this is a stronger growing
species than c pauciflora and c spicata with large leaves averaging
4 inches long that are light green above and silky on the under sides
the parallel veins of the leaves are very pronounced while the
leafstalks as indeed the young twigs too are covered with a hairy
pubescence
c pauciflora is readily distinguished from the former by its more
slender growth smaller leaves and fewer flowered spikes flowers
primroseyellow
c spicatajapan 1864 this japanese shrub is of very distinct
appearance having leaves like those of our common hazel and drooping
spikes of showyyellowish fragrant flowers that are produced before
the leaves there is a variegated form in cultivation
the various species of corylopsis are very ornamental garden plants
and to be recommended on account of their early flowering for
prominent positions in the shrubbery or by the woodland walk light
rich loam seems to suit them well
corylus
corylus avellana purpureapurple hazel this has large leaves of a
rich purple colour resembling those of the purple beech and is a very
distinct plant for the shrubbery border should be cut down annually if
large leaves are desired
c colurnaconstantinople hazel turkey 1665 this is the largest
and most ornamental of the family and is mentioned here on account of
the showy catkins with which the tree is usually well supplied when
thickly produced as they usually are on established specimens these
long catkins have a most effective and pleasing appearance and tend to
render the tree one of the most distinct in cultivation under
favourable circumstances such as when growing in a sweet and rather
rich brown loam it attains to fully 60 feet in height and of a neat
shape from the branches being arranged horizontally or nearly so
even in a young state the constantinople hazel is readily distinguished
from the common english species by the softer and more angular leaves
and by the whitish bark which comes off in long strips the stipules
too form an unerring guide to its identity they being long linear
and recurved
cotoneaster
cotoneaster bacillarisnepaul 1841 a largegrowing species and one
of the few members of the family that is more ornamental in flower than
in fruit it is of bold portly upright growth and sends up shoots
from the base of the plant the pretty white flowers are borne in
clusters for some distance along the slender shoots and have a very
effective and pleasing appearance indeed the upper portion of the
plant has the appearance of a mass of white blossoms
c frigidanepaul 1824 the species forms a large shrub or low tree
with oblong elliptical subevergreen leaves the flowers are white
and borne in large corymbs which are followed by scarlet berries in
september
c microphyllasmallleaved cotoneaster nepaul 1825 this is from
a flowering point of view probably the most useful of any member of
this rather large genus its numerous pretty white flowers dark
almost yewgreen leaves and abundance of the showiest red berries in
winter will ever make this dwarf clambering plant a favourite with
those who are at all interested in beautiful shrubs all or nearly
all the species of cotoneaster are remarkable and highly valued for
their showy berries but except the above and perhaps c buxifolia
boxleaved cotoneaster few others are worthy of consideration from a
purely flowering point of view
c simonsiikhasia 1868 the stems of this species usually grow from
4 feet to 6 feet high with suberect habit the leaves are
roundlyelliptic and slightly silky beneath the small flowers are
succeeded by a profusion of scarlet berries that ripen in autumn this
is generally considered the best for garden purposes
crataegus
crataegus azarolussouth europe 1640 this is a very
vigorousgrowing species with a wide spreading head of rather
uprightgrowing branches the flowers are showy and the fruit large and
of a pleasing red colour
c azarolus aronia syn c aroniaaronia thorn south europe
1810 this tree attains to a height of 20 feet has deeply lobed leaves
that are wedgeshaped at the base and slightly pubescent on the under
sides the flowers which usually are at their best in june are white
and showy and succeeded by large yellow fruit generally the aronia
thorn forms a rather upright and branchy specimen of neat proportions
and when studded with its milkwhite flowers may be included amongst
the most distinct and ornamental of the family
c coccineascarletfruited thorn north america 1683 if only for
its lovely white flowers with bright pinky anthers it is well worthy
of a place even in a selection of ornamental flowering trees and
shrubs it is however rendered doubly valuable in that the
cordateovate leaves turn of a warm brick colour in the autumn while
the fruit and which is usually produced abundantly is of the
brightest red
c coccinea macranthanorth america 1819 this bears some resemblance
to the cockspur thorn but has very long curved spineslonger perhaps
than those of any other species
c cordata is one of the latest flowering species in which respect it
is even more hardy than the wellknown c tanacetifolia it forms a
small compact tree of neat and regular outline with dark green
shining leaves and berries about the same size as those of the common
species and deep red
c crusgallicockspur thorn north america 1691 this has large
and showy white flowers that are succeeded by deep red berries it is
readily distinguished by the long curved spines with which the whole
tree is beset of this species there are numerous worthy forms
including c crusgalli carrierii which opens at first white and
then turns a showy flesh colour c crusgalli layi c crusgalli
splendens c crusgalli prunifolia c crusgalli pyracanthifolia and
c crusgalli salicifolia all forms of great beautywhether for their
foliage or beautiful and usually plentifullyproduced flowers
c douglasiinorth america 1830 this is peculiar in having dark
purple or almost black fruit it is of stout growth often reaching to
20 feet in height and belongs to the earlyflowering section
c nigra syn c celsianaa tree 20 feet high with stout branches
and downy spineless shoots leaves large ovateacute deeply incised
glossy green above and downy beneath flowers large and fragrant pure
white and produced in close heads in june fruit large oval downy
and yellow when fully ripe a native of sicily and known under the
names of c incisa and c leeana this species must not be confused
with a variety of our common thorn bearing a similar name
c oxyacanthacommon hawthorn this is perhaps the most ornamental
species in cultivation and certainly the commonest the common wild
species needs no description the fragrant flowers varying in colour
from pure white to pink being produced in the richest profusion under
cultivation however it has produced some very distinct and desirable
forms far superior to the parent including amongst others those with
doublewhite pink and scarlet flowers
c oxyacantha punicea florepleno pauls doublescarlet thorn is one
of if not the handsomest variety with large double flowers that are
of the richest crimson other good flowering kinds include c
oxyacantha praecox glastonbury thorn c oxyacantha oliveriana c
oxyacantha punicea with deep scarlet flowers c oxyacantha rosea
rosecoloured and abundantlyproduced flowers c oxyacantha foliis
aureis with yellow fruit c oxyacantha laciniata cut leaves c
oxyacantha multiplex doublewhite flowers c oxyacantha foliis
argenteis having silveryvariegated leaves c oxyacantha pendula of
semiweeping habit c oxyacantha stricta with an upright and stiff
habit of growth c oxyacantha leeana a good form and c oxyacantha
leucocarpa
c parvifolianorth america 1704 this is a miniature thorn of slow
growth with leaves about an inch long and solitary purewhite flowers
of large size the flowers open late in the season and are succeeded
by yellowishgreen fruit
c pyracanthafiery thorn south europe 1629 this is a very
distinct species with lanceolate serrated leaves and pinkish or
nearly white flowers the berries of this species are however the
principal attraction being orangescarlet and produced in dense
clusters c pyracantha crenulata and c pyracantha lelandi are worthy
varieties of the above the latter especially being one of the most
ornamentalberried shrubs in cultivation
c tanacetifoliatansyleaved thorn greece 1789 this is a very
lateflowering species and remarkable for its tansylike foliage it
is of unusually free growth and in almost any class of soil and is
undoubtedly in so far at least as neatly divided leaves and wealth of
fruit are concerned one of the most distinct and desirable species of
thorn
other good species and varieties that may just be mentioned as being
worthy of cultivation are c apiifolia c crusgalli horrida c
orientalis and c tomentosum syn c punctata to a lesser or
greater extent the various species and varieties of thorn are of great
value for the wealth and beauty of flowers they produce but the above
are perhaps the most desirable in that particular respect they are
all of free growth and except in waterlogged soils thrive well and
flower freely
cytisus
cytisus albuswhite spanish broom portugal 1752 this is a
largegrowing shrub of often 10 feet in height with wiry somewhat
straggling branches and remarkable for the wealth of purewhite
flowers it produces in may and june if favourably situated every
branch is wreathed with small white flowers and often to such an
extent that at a short distance away the plant looks like a sheet of
white being perfectly hardy and of very free growth in any light soil
and abundantly floriferous this handsome shrub is one of particular
value in ornamental planting by placing three or five plants in
clumpfashion the beauty of this broom is greatly enhanced
c aldus incarnatus syn c incarnatus resembles c purpureus in its
leaves and general appearance but it is of larger growth the flowers
which are at their best in may are of a vinousrose colour and
produced plentifully
c biflorus syn c elongatushungary 1804 this is a dwarf
spreading twiggy bush of fully a yard high leaves trifoliolate
clothed beneath with closely adpressed hairs and bright yellow
somewhat tubular flowers usually produced in fours
c decumbensa charming alpine species of low spreading growth
brightgreen threeparted leaves and bearing axillary bunches of large
yellow brownishpurple tinted flowers a native of the french and
italian alps and quite hardy
c nigricansaustria 1730 another beautiful species with long
erect racemes of goldenyellow flowers and one whose general hardihood
is undoubted on its own roots and allowed to roam at will this
pretty smallgrowing broom is of far greater interest than when it is
grafted mophigh on a laburnum stem and pruned into artificial shapes
as is unfortunately too often the case
c purpureuspurple broom austria 1792 alow spreading shrub with
long wiry shoots clothed with neat trifoliolate leaves and bearing an
abundance of its purple peashaped flowers there is a whiteflowered
form c purpureus albus and another named c purpureus ratisbonensis
with pretty yellow flowers produced on long and slender shoots
c scopariusyellow broom this is a wellknown native shrub with
silky angular branches and bright yellow flowers in summer there are
several varieties but the most remarkable and handsome is c scoparius
andreanus in which the wings of the flowers are of a rich golden
brown it is one of the showiest shrubs in cultivation
for ornamental planting the above are about the best forms of broom
but others might include c austriacus c ardoini and c capitatus
the latter being unusually hardy and bearing dense heads of flowers
in so far as soil is concerned the brooms are readily accommodated
while either from seeds or cuttings they are easily propagated
daboecia
daboecia polifolia syn menziesia polifoliast dabeocs heath

laurel a native of portugal 1739 with glossygreen leaf substitutes
and racemes of small not very showy greenishyellow flowers
daphne
daphne alpinaitaly 1759 a deciduous species which has white or
rosywhite sweetscented flowers it is a pretty but rare shrub that
grows well in light sandy leaf soil
d altaicasiberia 1796 though rare in gardens this is a pretty
and neatfoliaged species and bears white flowers in abundance it
wants a warm corner and dry soil
d blagayanastyria 1872 this is still rare in cultivation but it
is a very desirable species bearing ivorywhite highlyfragrant
flowers for the alpine garden it is particularly suitable and though
growing rather slowly thrives well in good light soil
d championi
syn d fortunei from china is a rare and pretty species bearing
lilac flowers in winter and whilst the shrub is leafless it does best
in a warm situation such as planted against a wall facing south
d cneorumgarland flower south europe 1752 this is a charming
rock shrub of dwarf trailing habit with small glossygreen leaves
and dense clusters of deep pink deliciouslyfragrant flowers
d fioniana is of neat growth with small glossy dark leaves and
pale rosecoloured flowers its sturdy dwarf habit constant verdure
and pretty sweetscented flowers should make this species a favourite
with cultivators known also as d hyemalis
d genkwajapanese lilac japan 1866 this is a rare and beautiful
species of recent introduction with large lilactinted
sweetlyscently flowers
d laureolaspurge laurel this is not in so far at least as flowers
are concerned a showy species but the ample foliage and sturdy habit
of the plant will always render this native species of value for the
shrubbery it is of value too as growing and flowering freely in the
shade the flowers are sweetlyscented and of a greenishyellow colour
and appear about february
d mezereumthe mezereon europe england one of the commonest and
most popular of hardy garden shrubs it is of stout strict growth and
produces clusters of pinky rose or purplish flowers before winter is
past and while the branches are yet leafless few perfectly hardy
flowering shrubs are so popular as the mezereon and rightly so for a
more beautiful plant could not be mentioned wreathed as every branch
is and almost back to the main stem with the showiest of flowers it
likes good rich dampish soil and delights to grow in a quiet shady
nook or even beneath the spread of our larger forest trees there are
several very distinct varieties of which the whiteflowered d
mezereum flore albo is one of the most valuable the fruit of this
variety is bright goldenyellow d mezereum autumnale and d mezereum
atrorubrum are likewise interesting and beautiful forms
d petraea syn d rupestrisrock daphne tyrol this is quite
hardy in the more sheltered corners of the rock garden with neat
shining foliage and pretty rosy flowers produced so thickly all over
the plant as almost to hide the foliage from view at kew it thrives
well in peaty loam and limestone and although it does not increase
very quickly is yet happy and contented it is a charming rock shrub
d ponticapontic daphne asia minor 1759 this is much like d
lauriola but has shorter and more oval leaves and the flowers
instead of being borne in fives like that species are produced in
pairs they are also of a richer yellow and more sweetly scented
d sericea syn d collinaitaly and asia minor 1820 this forms
a bush fully 2 feet high with evergreen oblong shining leaves and
clusters of rosecoloured flowers that are pleasantly scented it is
quite hardy and an interesting species that is well worthy of more
extended culture there is a variety of this with broader foliage than
the species and named d sericea latifolia syn d collina
latifolia
daphniphyllum
daphniphyllum glaucescenseast indies java and corea a handsome
japanese shrub that will be valued for its neat rhododendronlike
foliage compact habit of growth and for the conspicuous bark which is
of a warm reddish hue the leaves are large and elliptic six inches
long and are rendered strangely conspicuous from the footstalks and
midrib being dull crimson this affording a striking contrast to the
delicate green of the leaves it grows freely in light sandy peat
there are two wellmarked forms one named d glaucescens viridis in
which the red markings of the leaves are absent and d glaucescens
jezoensis a pretty and uncommon variety
desfontainea
desfontainea spinosaandes from chili to new grenada 1853 this is a
desirable shrub and one that is perfectly hardy in most parts of the
country it is a charming shrub of bold bushy habit with prickly
hollylike foliage and scarlet and yellow trumpetshaped pendent
flowers borne in quantity the shelter of a wall favours the growth
and flowering of this handsome shrub but it also succeeds well in the
open if planted in rich light soil and in positions that are not
exposed to cold and cutting winds
deutzia
deutzia crenata syn d scabra and d fortuneijapan 1863 this
is of stout bushy growth often reaching a height of 8 feet and
lateral spread of nearly as much the ovatelanceolate leaves are rough
to the touch and its slender but wiry stems are wreathed for a
considerable distance along with racemes of pure white flowers it is a
very distinct shrub of noble port and when in full flower is
certainly one of the most ornamental of hardy shrubs the
doubleflowered form d crenata florepleno is one of the prettiest
flowering shrubs in cultivation the wealth of double flowers not
white as in the species but tinged with reddishpurple being highly
attractive d crenata pride of rochester is another form with
doublewhite flowers and a most distinct and beautiful shrub two
other very beautiful varieties are those known as d crenata watererii
and d crenata wellsii
d gracilis is a somewhat tender shrub of fully 18 inches high with
smooth leaves and purewhite flowers produced in the greatest freedom
it does well in warm sheltered sites but is most frequently seen as a
greenhouse plant a native of japan
diervilla
diervilla floribunda syn d multiflora and weigelia floribunda
from japan 1864 has narrow tubular purplishcoloured corollas that
are only slightly opened out at the mouth the diervillas are valuable
decorative shrubs of free growth in good rich loam and bearing a
great abundance of the showiest of flowers for shrubbery planting they
must ever rank high the beautiful flowers and rich green ample leafage
rendering them distinct and attractive
d grandiflora syn d amabilis and weigelia amabilisjapan
this is of larger growth than d rosea with strongly reticulated
leaves that are prominently veined on the under sides and much
larger almost white flowers it is a distinct and worthy species
there are some beautiful varieties of this species named isolinae van
houttei and striata
d rosea syn weigelia roseachina 1844 this is a handsome hardy
shrub of small stature with ovatelanceolate leaves and clusters of
showy pink or sometimes white flowers that are produced in april and
may there are many good varieties of this shrub of which the
following are the most populard rosea arborescens grandiflora d
rosea lavallii with an abundance of crimsonred flowers d rosea
stelzneri with an abundance of deep red flowers d rosea hortensis
nivea large foliage and large purewhite flowers d rosea candida
much like the latter but bearing purewhite flowers and d rosea
looymansii aurea has beautiful golden leaves
discaria
discaria longispinathis is at once a curious and beautiful shrub of
low creeping growth and poorly furnished with leaves which however
are amply made up for by the deep green of the shoots and stems and
which give to the plant almost the appearance of an evergreen the
flowers which are bellshaped and white are almost lavishly produced
and as they last for a very long time with only the pure white
assuming a pinky tinge when subjected to excessive sunshine the value
of the shrub is still further enhanced for planting against a mound of
rock this scrambling shrub is of value but the position should not be
exposed to cold winds for the plant is somewhat tender from south
america and allied to the better known colletias
d serratifolia syn colletia serratifolia is even a handsomer
plant than the former with minute serrated foliage and sheets of
small white flowers in june
diospyros
diospyros kaki costatathe date plum china 1789 fruit as big as a
small apple leaves leathery entire and broadly ovate flowers and
fruits in this country when afforded the protection of a wall the
fruit is superior to that of d virginiana persimmon
d lotus the common date plum is a european species with purplish
flowers and oblong leaves that are reddish on the under sides both
species want a light warm soil and sheltered situation
d virginianathe persimmon or virginian date plum north america
1629 a smallgrowing tree with coriaceous leaves and greenishyellow
flowers in southern situations and by the seaside it is perfectly
hardy and succeeds well but in other districts it is rather tender
the fruit is edible yellow in colour and about an inch in diameter
dirca
dirca palustrisleather wood north america 1750 a muchbranched
bush of quite a treelike character but rarely more than 3 feet high
to the daphnes it is nearly allied and is close in resemblance but
there is a curious yellowish hue pervading the whole plant the flowers
are produced on the naked shoots in april and are rendered conspicuous
by reason of the pendent yellow stamens they are borne in terminal
clusters of three or four together it delights to grow in a cool
moist soil indeed it is only when so situated that the leather wood
can be seen in a really thriving condition
drimys
drimys aromatica syn tasmannia aromaticatasmanian pepper plant
tasmania 1843 this is if we might say so a more refined plant than
d winteri with smaller and narrower leaves and smaller flowers the
plant too has altogether a faint reddish tinge and is of upright
growth a native of tasmania and called by the natives the pepper
plant the fruit being used as a substitute for that condiment like
the other species the present plant is only hardy in warm maritime
places and when afforded the protection of a wall
d winteri syn winter a aromaticawinters bark south america
1827 the fine evergreen character is the chief attraction of this
american shrub so far at least as garden ornamentation is concerned
with some persons even the greenishwhite flowers are held in esteem
and it cannot be denied that a well flowered plant has its own
attractions the long narrow leaves are pale green above and glaucous
beneath and make the shrub of interest both on account of their
evergreen nature and brightness of tint unfortunately it is not very
hardy requiring even in southern england a sunny wall to do it
justice
elaeagnus
elaeagnus argenteasilver berry north america 1813 a spreading
shrub 8 feet or 10 feet high with lanceolate leaves clothed with
silvery scales the flowers are axillary and clustered and are
succeeded by pretty silveryribbed berries
e glabra syn e reflexusfrom japan this is one of the
handsomest species forming bushes of delightful green leathery
leaves and with a neat and rather compact habit of growth it grows
with great freedom when planted in light sandy soil big globose
bushes being the result of a few years growth being perfectly hardy
it is to be recommended if only for the ample leathery deep green
foliage the flowers are inconspicuous there is a form having the
leaves margined with pale yellow and known under the name of e glabra
variegata
e longipes syn e edulis and e crisp ajapan 1873 this
species is also worthy of culture whether for the ornamental flowers
or fruit it is a shrub 6 feet high bearing an abundance of spotted
oval red berries on long footstalks quite hardy
e macrophyllajapan this is of robust growth with handsome dark
green leaves and purplish branch tips the leaves are thick of
texture often fully 3 inches long glossygreen above and silvery
beneath the latter is all the more remarkable as the leaves have the
habit of curling up their edges and thus revealing the light silvery
tint of the under sides it thrives well in light sandy peat and may
be relied upon as one of the hardiest of shrubs
e rotundifoliaan interesting and perfectly hardy species growing
about five feet high and remarkable for the great wealth of pretty
scarlet and ambercoloured berries the flowers are not very showy but
this is made up by the beautiful silvery leaves most pronounced on the
under sides and wealth of fruit which hangs on long stalks like
cherries
other species of less interest are e pungens of which there is a
variegated variety e simoni a neat chinese shrub and e latifolia
of good habit and with large leaves the various species and varieties
of elaeagnus may all be cultivated in light free soil and from
experiments that were recently made they have been found of great
value for planting by the seaside they are popularly known as the wild
olives and evergreen oleasters
embothrium
embothrium coccineumfire bush south america 1851 this is a
beautiful shrub of tall growth with flowers of great interest and
beauty except in warm and favoured situations it is not very hardy
and should always be grown as a wall plant the fiery scarlet
orangetinted flowers resembling somewhat those of the honeysuckle
are very beautiful by the first weeks of may it grows to about 6 feet
in height in southern england and is when in full flower a shrub of
unusual beauty
ephedra
ephedra vulgaris syn ephedra monastachya from siberia 1772 is a
halfhardy shrub of trailing habit with inconspicuous flowers
thriving in very poor soil or on rocky situations is the only reason
why it is introduced here
epigaea
epigaea repensground laurel or new england mayflower northern
united states 1736 this is perhaps in so far as stature is
concerned hardly worthy of a place in our list yet it is such a
pretty and useful shrub though rarely rising more than 6 inches from
the ground that we cannot well pass it over for planting beneath pine
or other trees where it can spread about at will this prostrate shrub
is most at home there it enlivens the spot with its pretty evergreen
foliage and sweetscented white or pinky flowers it is quite hardy
ercilla
ercilla spicata syn bridgesia spicatachili 1840 a
smallgrowing halfclimbing shrub with leathery deep green leaves
and inconspicuous flowers hailing from chili it is not very hardy
but given the protection of a wall or planted against a treestump it
soon forms a neat mass of evergreen foliage
erica
erica carneasouth europe 1763 this is one of the most beautiful
and desirable of hardy heaths on account of the richlycoloured
flowers and early season at which they are produced in the typical
species the flowers are pink or fleshcoloured and produced in january
and february it is a dwarf compact growing species with bright green
foliage there is a form with pure white flowers named e carnea alba
or e herbacea but although distinct and beautiful it is not of so
robust growth as the parent
e ciliarisa pretty native species with ciliate glandular leaves
and racemes of highlycoloured rosy flowers found in dorsetshire and
cornwall
e cinereagrayleaved heath in this species also a native of
britain the flowers are of a reddishpurple colour and borne in dense
terminal racemes there are numerous varieties including a
whiteflowered e cinerea alba e cinerea atropurpurea bearing dark
purple flowers e cinerea atrosanguinea dark red flowers e cinerea
coccinea scarlet e cinerea purpurea purple flowers and e cinerea
rosea with deep rosecoloured flowers
e mediterraneamediterranean heath portugal 1648 this is a
robustgrowing species of rather erect habit and often attaining to
fully a yard in height flowers abundantly produced and of a pretty
pinky hue of this there are several varieties the following being
best known e mediterranea hibernica found in ireland e
mediterranea alba with white flowers e mediterranea nana of very
dwarf growth and e mediterranea rubra with showy deep red flowers
e scoparia and e erecta are desirable species the former bearing
greenish flowers and the latter of decidedly upright growth
e tetralixcrossleaved heath a native species of low and bushy
growth with close umbels or terminal clusters of pretty pinky flowers
the varieties of this most worthy of notice are e tetralix alba white
flowered e tetralix mackiana crimson flowered e tetralix rubra
deep red flowers and e tetralixbicolor with particoloured flowers
e vaganscornish heath a native species bearing pinkywhite
flowers but there are forms with white and red flowers named e
vagans alba and e vagans rubra
the various kinds of heath succeed best either in peaty soil or that
composed for the greater part of light sandy loam but many will grow
and flower freely if planted in rich yellow loam they are very
desirable plants either for bed formation for rockwork ornamentation
or for planting around the shrubbery margins propagation is effected
either by cuttings or subdivisions but seedlings of several species
spring up freely under favourable conditions
escallonia
escallonia floribunda syn e montevideusisnew grenada 1827
this is one of the handsomest species bearing long arching clusters
of white flowers it is a very desirable shrub for wall or latticework
covering against which it grows rapidly and soon forms an object of
great beauty by reason of its neat foliage and graceful habit as also
wealth of pretty flowers
e illinatachili 1830 this should also be included it being a
handsome and prettyflowered plant
e macranthachiloe 1848 this is a general favourite in english
gardens where it succeeds well but especially in maritime parts of
the country it is of stout growth 6 feet or more in height of
spreading habit and with elliptical serrulated bright green leaves
and clusters of crimsonred flowers produced in summer for
wallcovering this is an almost invaluable shrub although it succeeds
well as a standard in all but the colder parts of the country any
free open soil suits it well but thorough drainage must be attended
to there are several very distinct and good varieties such as e
macrantha sanguinea with flowers deeper in colour than those of the
parent plant and e macrantha ingrami a profuseblooming and very
desirable form
e phillipianavaldivia 1873 when seen as a standard bush and
loaded with its myriads of tiny white flowers this must rank amongst
the handsomest members of the family it is very hardy and retains its
foliage throughout the winter the hybrid forms e exoniensis and e
leucantha deserve recognition the latter even as late as november
being laden with its small spikes of pretty white flowers which
contrast nicely with the neat evergreen foliage
e pterocladonpatagonia 1854 this is remarkable for the
curiouslywinged branches which give to the shrub a rather peculiar
and distinct appearance the freelyproduced flowers are white or pink
e rubrachili 1827 this has less handsome leaves and flowers than
the above but it is all the same a beautiful plant the flowers vary
a good deal in depth of colouring and may be seen of all tints between
pure white and red
the escallonias are all of very free growth in any light warm sandy
and welldrained soil and are readily propagated
eucryphia
eucryphia pinnatifoliachili 1880 this shrub is as yet rare in
cultivation and is not suited for the colder or more exposed parts of
the country it is however a singularly distinct and beautiful shrub
with deep glossygreen pinnate foliage and bearing large pure white
flowers that are rendered all the more conspicuous by the
goldenyellow anthers as an ornamental shrub it is well worthy of
cultivation in so far as its hardihood in this climate has to do it
may be mentioned that in various parts of england and ireland it has
stood in the open ground unharmed for several years back light sandy
well drained peat would seem to meet with its requirements
euonymus
euonymus americanaamerican spindle tree north america 1686 this
is a deciduous or semievergreen shrub of about 6 feet in height
found over a wide area in canada and the united states it is of
partially erect growth with long and lithe branches covered with
pleasing light green bark flowers appearing in june and succeeded by
rough warted brilliant scarlet capsules which are particularly showy
and attractive it likes a shady situation and rich rather damp soil
e europaeuswest asia europe britain c an indigenous species
rarely exceeding 6 feet in height and rendered very effective in
autumn by reason of the pale scarlet fruit which when fully ripe and
having split open reveals the orangecoloured arils of the seeds it
too delights to grow in the shade
e fimbriatus japan and india and its handsome variegated form e
fimbriatus foliis variegatus et argenteo maculatus are rather too
tender for cultivation in this country even in southern districts and
where afforded wall protection e verrucosus and e atropurpureus are
also worthy of cultivation
e latifoliusbroadleaved spindle tree a european species 1730
deciduous and growing from 10 feet to sometimes fully 20 feet in
height the leaves are bright shining green and much larger than
those of our native species flowers purplishwhite appearing in
june the capsules large deep red and when open contrasting very
effectively with the bright orange arils in which the seeds are
enveloped it is a very distinct and beautiful smallgrowing lawn
tree and succeeding as it does best in shade is an extra
qualification
fabiana
fabiana imbricatachili 1838 this is unfortunately not hardy in
any but the milder maritime parts of england and ireland it is a
charming shrub of heatherlike appearance with small crowded leaves
and pure white flowers produced in may planted at the base of a
southern wall it does best and where it thrives it is certainly one of
our handsomest halfhardy shrubs
fatsia
fatsia japonica syns aralia japonica and a sieboldiijapan
1858 this is of no particular value as a flowering shrub but being
hardy in most districts and having large handsome leaves that impart
to it a tropical appearance it is well worthy of culture the flowers
are ivorywhite and produced in large umbels towards the end of
autumn but our early frosts too often mar their beauty in this
country it grows about 10 feet high and is usually what is termed
leggy in appearance and thrives well in any good loamy soil if
fairly dry
fendlera
fendlera rupicolamexico 1888 a lowgrowing shrub peculiar to the
dry rocky parts of the united states particularly the southwestern
district it grows about a yard high and bears a great profusion of
bluishwhite flowers that are rendered very conspicuous by reason of
the bright yellow stamens it is the only known species and is nearly
allied to the saxifrages any fairly good garden soil will suit it
well but it wants to be planted where superfluous moisture is quickly
carried off
forsythia
forsythia suspensa syn f fortunei and f sieboldiijapan and
china 1864 a slendergrowing shrub with variable leaves and long
trailing shoots the flowers are abundantly produced are of a
beautiful golden tint and bellshaped and being of good substance
last for a long time either as a wall plant or for using in some
sheltered corner and where the branches can spread about at will it
forms a very distinct and handsome shrub and one that is perfectly
hardy and quite indifferent as regards the quality of soil in which it
is planted there are several forms of this pretty shrub but as they
do not differ to any great extent from the species are hardly worthy
of consideration
f suspensa intermedia is a garden hybrid 1891
f viridissimajapan 1845 this is another desirable species but it
is not comparable in point of beauty with the former it is usually of
strong erect growth with stout shoots wreathed with bright yellow
flowers towards the end of winter it is a very beautiful shrub and a
valuable addition to the winter or early spring flowering section
fothergilla
fothergilla alnifolianorth eastern america 1765 this is an
ungainly habited shrub of dwarf growth the branches being somewhat
slender and crooked the flowers are white sweetly scented and
produced in dense terminal spikes it is perfectly hardy
fraxinus
fraxinus ornus syn f argentea f rotundifolia and ornus
europeamanna ash south europe 1730 this is a handsome tree
especially when young and vigorous and by far the most ornamental
species in cultivation for planting in situations where largegrowing
subjects would be out of place this is a valuable tree while the
wealth of flowers renders it particularly interesting and effective it
rarely exceeds 30 feet in height with leaves not unlike those of the
common ash and conspicuous panicles of light feathery white
petaliferous flowers produced usually in great abundance all over the
tree perfectly hardy
f ornus serotina alba and f ornus serotina violacea are beautiful
seedling forms that were raised in france and on account of their
dwarf habit and profusion of flowers are well worthy of attention the
flowers of the firstnamed variety are pure white the stamens having
at first yellow anthers which speedily turn to a rich blackishbrown
the other differs but little only in the flowers which are of a
distinct greyishviolet hue while the leaves are of a darker shade of
green and the leaflets longer and narrower
f mariesiinorthern china 1880 this is hardy in most parts of the
country the whole tree is quite glabrous except the petioles which
are clothed with a dense pubescence flowers pure white and arranged
in large dense panicles
fremontia
fremontia californicacalifornia 1851 a handsome and deciduous
californian shrub but scarcely hardy enough for the open air without
protection in southern england and ireland however it does well and
all the better if planted within the influence of the sea the large
yellow flowers are often about 2 inches across and produced singly
along the branches while the leaves are large lobed and of an
enticing shade of green planted against a wall in good dampish loam
it succeeds well
fuchsia
fuchsia macrostema globosa syn f globosachili this is readily
recognised by the globose form assumed by the incurved sepals while
the flowers are smaller and less showy than those of f riccartoni
hardihood about similar to the following
f riccartonithis seedling from f m globosa is one of the two
hardiest varieties but even this plant except in warm maritime
districts is by no means satisfactory where it does well it is a
shrub of great beauty and blooms profusely this species has red
straight sepals and a purple corolla in favoured districts it may
frequently be seen as much as 12 feet high and is then during the
flowering period an object of great beauty it originated at riccarton
near edinburgh about 1830
garrya
garrya ellipticacalifornia 1818 this is a handsome shrub with dark
green coreaceous leaves resembling very nearly those of the evergreen
oak the long tassellated catkins of a peculiar yellowishgreen
colour render the plant one of much interest and beauty as a wall
plant it thrives well the slight protection thus afforded favouring the
growth and expansion of the catkins for planting in the shrubbery it is
also well suited and where it ofttimes attains to a height of 6 feet
and is bushy in proportion it is well to bear in mind that there are
male and female plants of the garrya and that the former is the more
ornamental good rich welldrained loam will suit this shrub well
gaultheria
gaultheria nummularioides syn g nummulariae and g repens
himalayas this is a neat alpine species with small and very dark
green leaves it likes a shady situation and vegetable soil for
planting on the rockwork amongst tree roots or beneath the shade of

to a greater height than about half a foot with lanceolate serrated
leaves and pendulous axillary clusters of white flowers
g shallonnorthwest america 1826 growing in favourable situations
to fully a yard in height this distinct evergreen shrub which is
fairly common in cultivation is particularly valuable as it thrives
well under the shade and drip of trees it is a rambling plant with
ovatecordate almost sessile leaves and bears tiny white flowers that
are succeeded by purplish fruit g shallon acutifolia has more sharply
pointed leaves than those of the species
genista
genista aetnensis syn spartium aetnensisetna broom sicily and
sardinia 1816 this is a largegrowing species of elegant growth and
remarkable for the abundance of yellow flowers with which it is
literally covered in august than this southeuropean peaflower
perhaps not another member of the family is more worthy of culture the
neat elegant habit of growth and profusion of flowers rendering it a
plant of particular interest and beauty it is quite hardy thrives in
any light soil if well drained and is readily propagated from seed
which it ripens in abundance
g anxanticanaples 1818 this is a nearly allied species to our
native g tinctoria and is of dwarf growth with a rich abundance of
golden yellow flowers that are produced towards the end of summer

slendergrowing shrub about 18 inches high with narrow leaflets and
terminal heads of yellow flowers produced in summer
g sagittalissouth europe 1750 with its peculiarly winged and
jointed stems which are of a deep green colour this is one of the most
distinct forms the flowers are few but pretty and with the dwarf habit
render the plant an excellent subject for rockwork
g tinctoriadyers greenweed europe britain north and west asia
this is a spineless species and bears a profusion of yellow flowers
from july onwards the doubleflowering variety g tinctoria
florepleno is in so far as ornamental qualities are concerned
superior to the parent form
g tinctoria elatior syn g elatior grows to 12 feet in height is
of free spreading growth and a very handsome plant the flowers which
are individually small and yellow are so thickly produced that the
shrub in late summer has the appearance of a sheet of gold

decidedly good garden plant and of neat trailing habit the stems are
three sided and the flowers golden yellow and plentifully produced a
native of south europe and perfectly hardy in almost any position

daurica both very ornamental kinds might be added to the list they
are all very hardy freeflowering shrubs of simple culture and
succeeding well in any light and rather dry soil
gleditschia
gleditschia triacanthoshoney locust united states 1700 as an
ornamental hardy tree this is well worthy the attention of planters the
pinnate and bipinnate foliage being particularly elegant while the
flowers though individually small are borne in such quantities of
fascicled racemes as to attract notice the stem and branches are armed
with formidable prickles but there is a form in which the prickles are
absent a native of north america and readily cultivated in any soil of
even fair quality for town planting it is a valuable tree there is a
good weeping variety named g triacanthos pendula
g sinensis syn g horridachina 1774 this nearly resembles the
latter and is occasionally to be met with in cultivation in this
country
gordonia
gordonia lasianthusloblolly bay north america 1739 a shrub of
great beauty but one that unfortunately is rarely to be seen outside
the walls of a botanic garden it is of camellialike growth with
large sweetly fragrant flowers and a good habit of growth
g pubescensnorth america 1774 this is of smaller growth than the
latter rarely exceeding about 6 feet high with large white flowers
that are rendered all the more conspicuous by the tuft of golden
stamens both species are somewhat tender although hailing from the
coast swampy grounds of the southern states of north america planted
in favoured sites they usually grow freely in light peaty soil or
that containing a large admixture of decayed leaf soil
grabowskia
grabowskia boerhaaviaefoliaperu 1780 this is occasionally to be
seen in sheltered and favoured gardens but it is not to be relied upon
in other than southern and seaside districts the plant is of no
particular interest to the cultivator the outline being ungainly while
the pale blue flowers are both dull and uninteresting it belongs to the
solanum family and is only worth cultivating as a curiosity light
warm soil and a sunny position are necessities in the cultivation of
this shrub
griselinia
griselinia littoralisnew zealand 1872 this forms a compact bush of
moderate size and is fairly hardy the leaves are of a light pleasing
green shade coriaceous and glossy and remain on the plant during
winter it is an excellent shrub for the seaside and moreover will
succeed well in stiff soils where many other plants would refuse to
grow
gymnocladus
gymnocladus canadensiskentucky coffee tree canada 1748 when in
full leafage this is a distinct and beautiful tree the foliage hanging
in wellrounded masses and presenting a pretty effect by reason of the
loose and tufted appearance of the masses of finelydivided leaves
leaves often 3 feet long bipinnate and composed of numerous
bluishgreen leaflets flowers white borne in loose spikes in the
beginning of summer and succeeded by flat somewhat curved brown pods
it prefers a rich strong soil or alluvial deposit
g chinensissoap tree china 1889 readily distinguished from the
american species by its much smaller and more numerous leaflets and
thicker fruit pod it is not very hardy in this country unless in the
milder seaside districts the leaves are used by the chinese women to
wash their hair hence the popular name of soap tree
halesia
halesia diptera syn h reticulatanorth america 1758 this is not
so suitable for our climate as h tetraptera though in southern parts
of the country it forms a neat healthy bush and flowers freely it is
distinguished as the name indicates by having two wings to the seed
vessel h tetraptera having four
h hispida syn pterostyrax hispidumjapan 1875 this is a shrub
of perfect hardihood free growth and very floriferous the flowers
which are pure white and in long racemes resemble much those of the

shrub of free growth in light sandy loam and quite hardy even when
fully exposed
h parviflora has smaller flowers than those of our commonlycultivated
plant
h tetrapterasnowdrop tree north america 1756 this is a very
ornamental tallgrowing shrub of somewhat loose growth and bearing
flowers which resemble both in size and appearance those of our common
snowdrop it is one of the most ornamental of all the smallgrowing
american trees and richly deserves a place in every collection on
account of the profusion with which the flowers are produced in april
and may they are snowwhite drooping and produced in lateral
fascicles of eight or ten together it is a native of river banks in
north carolina and is well suited for cultivation in this country
light peaty soil will grow it to perfection

small species with lemonyellow flowers h japonica arborea is a taller
growing variety with primroseyellow petals and a deep claret calyx
the flowers are borne in clusters in early spring rarely in this
country do we find this species of greater height than about 8 feet but
it is of bushy growth though somewhat straggling in appearance as
early as the beginning of january this witch hazel may be found in
bloom the bare branches being studded here and there with the
curiousshaped flowers these having bright yellow twisted petals and
reddish calyces hj zuccarinianais a very desirable freeflowering
variety with pale yellow petals and a greenishbrown calyx
h virginicavirginian witch hazel north america 1736 this has
smaller flowers than hj arborea and they are plentifully produced in
autumn or early winter in this country it assumes the shape of an open
bush of about 6 feet in height but is usually of untidy appearance from
the branches being irregularly disposed
they all delight in cool rather moist soil and are of value for their
earlyflowering nature
hedysarum
hedysarum multijugumsouth mongolia hardly ten years have elapsed
since this pretty shrub was introduced into england so that at present
it is rather rare in our gardens it is a decided acquisition if only
for the production of flowers at a time when these are scarce usually
the flowering time is in august but frequently in the first weeks of
october the pretty flowers are still full of beauty it is of bushy
habit from 4 feet to 5 feet high with oblong leaflets in number from
twenty to thirtyfive which are peagreen above and downy on the under
sides flowers bright red and produced in axillary racemes it is

yellow flowers h vulgare barbaturn is of erect habit with silky
hairy oval leaves h vulgare mutabile bears pale rose flowers marked
with yellow at the base h vulgare grandiflorum is remarkable for the
large bright yellow flowers and is one of the most beautiful and
worthy varieties h vulgare ovalifolium syn h serpyllifolium bears
yellow flowers and ovate leaves with the margins revolute h vulgare
hyssopifolium bears reddish flowers but the colouring varies
considerably and saffron is not uncommon
the rockroses are very valuable plants in that they will succeed on
poor gravelly banks where few other plants could eke out an existence
they cannot withstand stiff soil nor that at all inclined to be damp
their favourite resorts being exposed rocky ground and dry gravelly
banks being readily increased from cuttings which take root well under
a hand glass or in a cool house it is advisable at least with the more
tender forms to have at hand a stock so that blanks in the shrubbery
may be filled up
hibiscus
hibiscus syriacus syn althaea frutexsyrian mallow syria 1596

hippophae
hippophae rhamnoidessea buckthorn or sallow thorn though generally
considered as a seaside shrub the sea buckthorn is by no means
exclusively so thriving well and attaining to large dimensions in
many inland situations the flowers are not at all conspicuous but this
is amply compensated for by the beautiful silverylike leaves and wealth
of fruit borne by the shrub in not a few instances for fully a foot in
length the branches are smothered with crowded clusters of bright
orange berries and which render the shrub during november and december
both distinct and effective it does best in sandy soil and is readily
increased from suckers which are usually plentifully produced by old
plants for seaside planting it is one of our most valuable shrubs
succeeding as it does well down even to high water mark and where the
foliage is lashed with the salt spray
holboellia
holboellia latifolia syn stauntonia latifoliahimalayas 1840 an
evergreen climbing shrub that is more often found under glass than out

white others pink and others of varying shades of blue there are some
very beautiful and distinct varieties such as h hortensis japonica h
hortensis otaksa with large panicles of sterile blue flowers h
hortensis roseaalba with large rosy flowers h hortensis thomas hogg
a very freeflowering and welcome form h hortensis mandschurica and
h hortensis stellata florepleno with partially double flowers are
worthy of attention
h paniculatajapan 1874 this is one of the most distinct species
in which the flowerheads are elongated not flat as in most other
species and from which the finest form in cultivation has been
obtained this is h paniculata grandiflora in which the flowers are
sterile and pure white forming large panicles often a foot in length
it is a magnificent variety and being perfectly hardy should be
extensively planted for ornament the flowers are produced in late
summer but remain in good form for fully two months dying off a rich
reddish hue

across and of a glaucous tint on the under sides the deliciously
fragrant flowers are greenishwhite or yellowishgreen and produced in
graceful drooping racemes in southern england it does well and being
a tree of unusual beauty of both leaves and flowers is well worthy of
attention rich loam not too stiff will grow the idesia well
ilex
ilex aquifoliumcommon holly europe britain and west asia though
the hollies are not usually reckoned ornamental for the sake of their
flowers their berries are highly so some of them are nevertheless
deliciously fragrant when in bloom the leaves of this our native
species in their typical form are oblongovate wavy and deeply
spinytoothed the tree flowers in may and june while the clusters of
bright red berries ripen in autumn persist all the winter and
sometimes even hang on tree till a second crop is matured provided they
are not devoured by birds during severe weather the varieties are very
numerous and differ chiefly in the form and toothing of the leaves
which are variegated in many cases their size and form and in the
colour of the berries in a few instances

flat almost spineless leaves heavily and irregularly blotched with
yellow in the centre the berries are of a brilliant red the variety
differs from milkmaid in having flat nearly entire leaves i
aquifolium pendula has a wide rounded drooping head but otherwise
does not differ from the type many others bear berries but the above
are all very distinct forms
i opacaamerican holly united states 1744 the leaves of this
species are oblong or oval small spinyserrate and of a dark opaque
green the berries which ripen in autumn are small bright red and
very liable to be eaten by birds in america this holly is put to
precisely the same purposes as the common holly is in europe it is
perfectly hardy here
illicium
illicium floridanum from florida 1771 is a beautiful but uncommon
shrub probably on account of its being tender and susceptible to injury
by frost unless in the warmer and more favoured parts of the country
the fragrant flowers are of a purplishrose while the foliage is neat
and of a pleasing green
i anisatum syn i religiosum from china and japan 1842 is too

jamesia
jamesia americanarocky mountains and colorado 1865 amongst early
springflowering shrubs this pretty but neglected plant is one of the
best of perfect hardihood for it stands the vigour of our winters with
impunity and of dense thick growth it is suitable for using in a
variety of ways as well as for purely ornamental purposes the leaves
are oval and neatly dentated and the flowers individually of large
size pure white and produced in terminal bunches cool soil and a
shady situation would seem to suit the plant admirably but for screen
purposes in the rock garden or border it is invaluable on account of the
strong and dense twigs

suffers from severe frost but as only the branch tips are injured it
shoots freely from the stock it produces its flowers in the autumn
there is a variety with variegated leaves
kalmia
kalmia angustifoliasheep laurel canada 1736 this is at once
distinguished from k latifolia by its much smaller and narrower leaves
and smaller flowers which latter are however of brighter tint and
more plentifully produced it rarely exceeds 2 feet in height of this
there are two very distinct forms that named k angustifolia pumila
being of neat and dense small growth and k angustifolia rubra in
which the flowers are of an unusually deep red
k glaucacanada and sitcha 1767 this which has lilacpurple
flowers produced in early spring is not a very desirable species
being rather straggling of growth and with few flowers
k hirsutahairyleaved kalmia southeast virginia to florida 1786
this is at once distinguished by the rather rough and hairy foliage and
few rosytinted flowers it is of dwarf neat growth
k latifoliacalico bush or mountain laurel alleghanies canada and
western florida 1734 a favourite shrub in every garden where the
conditions of soil will allow of its being successfully cultivated in
peaty soil or light friable loam and leaf soil it forms a dense
roundheaded bush often 8 feet in height and nearly as much through
with pleasing green leaves and dense clusters of beautiful pink
waxlike flowers the flowering period commences in may and usually
extends to the end of july this is a choice shrub of great hardihood
and one of the handsomest flowering in cultivation there is a still
more beautiful form named k latifolia major splendens and one with
small myrtlelike foliage named k latifolia myrtifolia
the members of this handsome family are as a rule partial to cool
damp soil peat of a light sandy nature being preferred they thrive
well where azaleas and rhododendrons will succeed in bold masses they
have a fine effect but a well developed standard specimen of the
commonly cultivated species is highly ornamental
kerria
kerria japonica syn corchorus japonicusjapan 1700 a japanese
shrub the doubleflowered variety of which k japonica florepleno is
one of our commonest wall plants the orangeyellow flowers produced in
great rosettes are highly ornamental and have earned for the shrub a
wellknown name it succeeds well almost anywhere and though usually
seen as a wall plant is perfectly hardy and forms a neat shrub for the
open border there is a form in which the leaves are variegated and
known under the name of k japonica variegata
koelreuteria
koelreuteria paniculatanorthern china 1763 whether for its foliage
or flowers this smallgrowing tree is worthy of a place though of
rather irregular growth the beautiful foliage and large panicles of
yellowish flowers which stand well above the leaves make the shrub
for it does not in this country attain to tree height one of
particular interest and a valuable aid in ornamental planting in a
sheltered corner and planted in rich soil it grows and flowers freely
laburnum
laburnum adami syn cytisus adamia graft hybrid form between the
common laburnum and cytisus purpureus the result being flowers of the
laburnum the true cytisus purpureus and the graft hybrid between the
two it was raised by jean louis adam in 1825 it is a curious and
distinct tree worthy of culture if only for the production of three
distinct kinds of flowers on the same plant
l alpinum syn cytisus alpinusscotch laburnum europe 1596 this
very closely resembles the common laburnum but it is of larger growth
and flowers later in the season the flowers too though in longer

flowers named l alpinum fragrans as also a third with very long
racemes of flowers named l alpinum alschingeri
l caramanicumasia minor 1879 a bushy shrub of vigorous habit with

but uncommon shrub and succeeds very well in chalky or calcareous soil
flowers in july
l vulgare syn cytisus laburnumcommon laburnum southern france
to hungary 1596 this is one of our commonest garden and park trees
and at the same time one of the most beautiful and floriferous the
large pendulous racemes of bright yellow flowers are when at their
best in may surpassed neither in quantity nor beauty by those of any
other hardy tree there are several varieties of this laburnuma few
good but many worthless at least from a garden point of view l
vulgare parkesii is a seedling form bearing large racemes of
deepcoloured flowers often 14 inches long l vulgare watereri was
raised in the knap hill nursery surrey and is one of the most distinct
and beautiful of the many forms into which the laburnum has been
subdivided the flower racemes are very long and richly coloured l
vulgare quercifolium and l vulgare sessilifolium are fairly well
described by their names l vulgare fragans differs only in having
sweetlyscented flowers l vulgare involutum has curiouslycurled
leaves while l vulgare aureum where it does well is a beautiful and
distinct form

being few situations in which it will succeed when planted in the open
it is a tall climbing shrub with dark green persistent leaves and
bearing purplish flowers in drooping racemes in midwinter planted in
rather dry soil at the base of a sunny wall this shrub forms a by no
means unattractive covering the twice ternate glossy leaves being
fresh and beautiful the winter through

in favoured maritime districts but in such situations it has stood
unharmed for many years and attained to goodly proportions it is a
beautiful climber with deepgreen leaves and large fleshy

indigenous to swampy ground in canada greenland and over a large area
of the colder parts of america leaves oval or oblong and plentifully
produced all over the plant flowers pure white or slightly tinted with
pink produced in terminal corymbs and usually at their best in april
a perfectly hardy neatgrowing and abundantlyflowered shrub but one
that somehow has gone greatly out of favour in this country this
plant has been subdivided into several varieties that are perhaps
distinct enough to render them worthy of attention they are l
latifolium globosum with white flowers borne in globose heads on the
short twiggy and darkfoliaged branches l latifolium angustifolia
has narrower leaves than those of the species while l latifolium
intermedium is of neat growth and bears pretty showy flowers
l palustremarsh ledum this is a common european species growing

elegant growth and reaching under favourable culture a height of
about 6 feet the leaves are trifoliolate small and neat and the
abundant racemes of individually small peashaped flowers are of the
richest and showiest reddishpurple being only semihardy will account
for the scarcity of this beautiful japanese shrub but having stood
uninjured in all but the coldest parts of these islands should induce
lovers of flowering shrubs to give it a fair chance
leucothoe
leucothoe axillaris syn andromeda axillarisnorth america 1765
this is of small growth from 2 feet to 3 feet high with ovalpointed
leaves and white flowers in short racemes produced in may and june it
is not a very satisfactory species for cultivation in this country

chestnut blossoms but is worthy of cultivation and succeeds best in
cool sandy peat or friable yellow loam
l davisiae from california 1853 is a very handsome evergreen shrub
of small and neat growth and will be found an acquisition where compact
shrubs are in demand the leaves are small of a deep green colour and
remain throughout the year flowers produced in great abundance at the
branch tips usually in dense clusters and individually small and pure
white
l recurva syn andromeda recurvanorth america a very distinct
plant on account of the branch tips being almost of a scarlet tint and
thus affording a striking contrast to the grayishgreen of the older
bark the flowers are pinkywhite and produced in curving racemes and
abundantly over the shrub like other members of the family it delights
to grow in cool sandy peat
leycesteria
leycesteria formosa from nepaul 1824 is an erectgrowing deciduous
shrub with green hollow stems and large ovate pointed leaves of a
very deep green colour the flowers are small and white or purplish
and produced in long pendulous bracteate racemes from the axils of

and spikes of yellowishwhite flowers it is a good hedge plant and
succeeds well as a town shrub there are several variegated forms of
which l ovalifolium variegatum japan 1865 and l ovalifolium aureum
are the best
l quihoichina 1868 this is a much valued species as it does not
flower until most of its relations have finished most of the privets
flower at midsummer but this species is often only at its best by the
last week of october and beginning of november it forms a straggling
freelybranched shrub of fully 6 feet in height and nearly as much
through with dark shininggreen oblong leaves and loose terminal
panicles of pure white powerfullyscented flowers it flourishes like
most of the privets on poor soil and is a littleknown species that
note should be made of during the planting season
l sinense syns l villosum and l ibota villosumchinese
privet china 1858 this is a tall deciduous shrub with oblong and
tomentose leaves and flowers in loose terminal panicles and produced
freely in august l sinense nanum is one of the prettiest forms in
cultivation it is almost evergreen with a horizontal mode of growth
and dense spikes of crearnywhite flowers so thickly produced as almost
to hide the foliage from view it is a most distinct and desirable
variety
l vulgarecommon privet although one of our commonest shrubs this
privet can hardly be passed unnoticed for the spikes of creamywhite
flowers that are deliciously scented are both handsome and effective
of the common privet there are several distinct and highly ornamental
forms such as l vulgare variegatum l vulgare pendulum having
curiouslycreeping branches and the betterknown and valuable l

through the most severe weather with little or no injury save in some
instances the branch tips being killed back propagated readily from
cuttings placed in a cool frame or under a handlight
liriodendron
liriodendron tulipiferatulip tree north america 1688 one of the
noblest hardy exotic trees in cultivation the large fourlobed
truncate leaves of a soft and pleasing green are highly ornamental
and are alone sufficient to establish the identity of the tree flowers
large yellow and sweetscented and usually freely produced when the
tree has attained to a height of between 20 feet and 30 feet when we
consider the undoubted hardihood of the tree and indifference to soil
its noble aspect handsome foliage that is so distinct from that of any
other tree and showy flowers we feel justified in placing it in the
very first rank of ornamental trees l tulipifera integrifolia has
entire leaves which render it distinct from the type l tulipifera
fastigiata or pyramidalis is of erect growth l tulipifera aurea
with golden foliage and l tulipifera crispa with the leaves curiously
undulateda peculiarity which seems constant but is more curious than
beautiful few soils come amiss to the tulip tree it thriving well in
that of very opposite descriptionsloam almost pure gravel and
alluvial deposit
lonicera
lonicera caprifoliumeurope this species resembles l periclymenum
but is readily distinguished by the sessile flowerheads and
fawnyorange flowers
l flexuosa syn l brachypodajapan 1806 this is a pretty
species and one of the most useful of the climbing section by its
slender twining purplish stems it may at once be distinguished as
also by the deep green purplishtinted leaves and sweetlyscented
flowers of various shades of yellow and purple a native of china and
perfectly hardy as a wall plant l flexuosa aureoreticulata is a
worthy variety in which the leaves are beautifully netted or variegated
with yellow
l fragrantissimachina 1845 this species is often confounded with
l standishii but differs in at least one respect that the former is
strictly a climber while the latter is of bushy growth the leaves
too of l standishii are hairy which is not the case with the other
species it is a very desirable species with white fragrant flowers
produced during the winter season
l periclymenumhoneysuckle or woodbine an indigenous climbing
shrub with long lithe and twisted cablelike branches and bearing
heads of sweetlyscented reddishyellow flowers this is a favourite
wild plant and in the profusion and fragrance of its flowers it is

nursery forms of this plant including those known as l periclymenum
late dutch l periclymenum early cream and l periclymenum
odoratissimum as also one with variegated foliage
l sempervirensscarlet trumpet honeysuckle a north american

flowers with a slight purplish tint and is well worthy of attention
it soon forming a wall covering of great beauty
l tataricatartarian honeysuckle tartary 1752 this is a very
variable species in so far at least as the colour of flowers is
concerned and has given rise to several handsome varieties the typical
plant has rosy flowers but the variety l tatarica albiflora has pure
white flowers and another l tatarica rubriflora has freely produced
purplishred flowers
l xylosteum syn xylosteum dumetorumfly honeysuckle europe
england to the caucasus the small creamywhite flowers of this plant
are not particularly showy but the scarlet berries are more conspicuous
in september and october the gray bark of the branches has also a
distinct effect in winter when grown in contrast to the redbarked
species of cornus viburnum and yellowbarked osier it is one of the
oldest occupants of british shrubberies l xylosteum leucocarpum has
white berries those of l xylosteum melanocarpum are black and in l
xylosteum xanthocarpum they are yellow
the honeysuckles are all of the readiest culture and succeed well in
very poor soils and in that of opposite qualities propagated from
cuttings or by layering

lax trailing shrub with long slender flexible twigs small
linearlanceolate leaves and rather sparselyproduced lilac or violet
flowers planted against a wall or beside a stoutgrowing openhabited
shrub where the peculiarly lithe branches can find support this plant
does best probably nowhere is the box thorn so much at home as in
seaside places it then attaining to sometimes 12 feet in height and
bearing freely its showy flowers during summer and the bright scarlet
or orange berries in winter
l europaeumeuropean box thorn south europe 1730 this is a spiny
rambling shrub that may often be seen clambering over some cottage

pink or reddish flowers for quickly covering steep dry banks and
mounds where few other plants could exist this european box thorn is
invaluable either species will grow in very poor dry soil and is
readily propagated by means of cuttings

shrub with peagreen deciduous foliage and large pure white flowers
that oft get damaged by the spring frosts m conspicua soulangeana is a
supposed hybrid between m conspicua and m obovata whatever may be the
origin of this magnolia it is certainly a handsome and showy plant of
very vigorous growth producing freely its white purpletinted flowers
and which last for a long time in perfection there are several other
varieties including m conspicua soulangeana nigra with dark purplish
flowers m conspicua alexandrina m conspicua soulangeana speciosa
and m conspicua norbertii

june
m grandifloranorth america 1737 one of the handsomest species
with very large glossy evergreen leaves and deliciously odoriferous
creamywhite flowers that are often fully 6 inches across it is
usually seen as a wall plant and the slight protection thus afforded is
almost a necessity in so far as the development of the foliage and
flowers is concerned m grandiflora exoniensis exmouth magnolia is a
very handsome form
m lenneithis is a garden hybrid between m conspicua and m obovata
discolor and has flowers as large as a gooses egg of a rosypurple

generally be relied upon as hardy
m stellata syn m halleanajapan 1878 a neat smallgrowing
japanese species of bushy habit and quite hardy in this country the
small white fragrant flowers are produced abundantly even on young
plants and as early as april one of the most desirable and handsome of
the smallgrowing species m stellata pink variety received an award
of merit at the meeting of the royal horticultural society on march 28
1893 this bids fair to be really a good thing and may best be
described as a pinkflowered form of the now wellknown and popular
species
m umbrella syn m tripetalaumbrella tree north america 1752 a
noble species with large deep green leaves that are often 16 inches
long it is quite hardy around london and produces its large white

of southern england and ireland although it stood unharmed for many
years at kew it succeeds best and is less apt to receive injury when
planted in rather dry and warm soil

principally remarkable for the large reniform peltate leaves which
are of value for covering pergolas bowers and walls the flowers are of
no great account being rather inconspicuous and paniculate it is hardy

myrica
myrica asplenifolia syn comptonia asplenifoliasweet fern north
america 1714 a north american plant of somewhat straggling growth
growing to about 4 feet high and with linear pinnatified
sweetsmelling leaves the flowers are of no decorative value being
small and inconspicuous but for the fragrant leaves alone the shrub
will always be prized it grows well in peaty soil is very hardy and
may be increased by means of offsets this shrub is nearly allied to our
native myrica or sweet gale
m californicacalifornian wax myrtle california 1848 in this we
have a valuable evergreen shrub that is hardy beyond a doubt and that
will thrive in the very poorest classes of soils in appearance it
somewhat resembles our native plant but is preferable to it on account
of the deep green persistent leaves the leaves are about 3 inches
long narrow and produced in tufts along the branches unlike our
native species the californian wax myrtle has no pleasant aroma to the
leaves
m ceriferacommon candleberry myrtle canada 1699 this is a neat
little shrub usually about 4 feet high with oblonglanceolate leaves
and inconspicuous catkins
m galesweet gale or bog myrtle this has inconspicuous flowers and
is included here on account of the deliciously fragrant foliage and
which makes it a favourite with cultivators generally it is a native
shrub growing from 3 feet to 4 feet high with deciduous
linearlanceolate leaves and clustered catkins appearing before the
leaves a moor or bog plant and of great value for planting by the pond
or lake side or along with the socalled american plants for the aroma
given off by the foliage
the myricas are all worthy of cultivation although the flowers are
inconspicuoustheir neat and in most cases fragrant foliage and
adaptability to poor soil or swampy hollows being extra
recommendations
myrtus
myrtus communiscommon myrtle south europe 1597 a wellknown shrub
which unless in very favoured spots and by the seaside cannot survive
our winters where it does well and then only as a wall plant this and
its varieties are charming shrubs with neat foliage and an abundance of
showy flowers the doubleflowered varieties are very handsome but they

america 1690 a hardy shrub nearly allied to spiraea it produces a
profusion of umbellike corymbs of pretty white flowers that are
succeeded by curious swollen membraneous purplish fruit n opulifolia

stamens of a tufted brushlike character it is usually treated as a
greenhouse plant but may be seen growing and flowering freely in the
open ground at kew
nuttallia
nuttallia cerasiformisosoberry california 1848 this shrub is of
great value on account of the flowers being produced in the early weeks
of the year and when flowers are few and far between it grows from 6
feet to 10 feet high with a thick twiggy head and drooping racemes of
white flowers borne thickly all over the plant few soils come amiss to
this neglected shrub it growing and flowering freely even on poor
gravelly clay and where only a limited number of shrubs could succeed
olearia
olearia haastiinew zealand 1872 this composite shrub is only hardy
in the milder parts of england and ireland it is of stiff dwarf
growth rarely growing more than 4 feet high but of neat and compact
habit flowering as it does in late summer it is rendered of special
value the daisylike white blossoms being produced in large and flat
clusters at the branch tips the leaves are neat and of leathery
texture and being evergreen lend an additional charm to the shrub
o macrodonta syn o dentata from new zealand 1886 is tolerably
hardy and may be seen in good form both at kew and in the south of
ireland the large hollylike leaves are of a peculiar silverygreen
tint above and almost white on the under sides flowers white and

species the latter from new zealand bearing a profusion of white
daisylike flowers on dense twiggy branches
ononis
ononis arvensisrestharrow a native undershrub of very variable size
according to the position in which it is found growing it creeps along
the ground the shoots sending out roots as they proceed and is usually
found on dry sandy banks the flowers when at their best are very
ornamental being bright pink and with the standard streaked with a
deeper shade they are abundantly produced and render the plant very
conspicuous during the summer and autumn months when planted on an old
wall and allowed to roam at will the restharrow is perhaps seen to
best advantage
osmanthus
osmanthus aquifolium illicifoliushollyleaved osmanthus japan this
is a handsome evergreen shrub with hollylike leaves and not very
conspicuous greenishwhite flowers it is a very desirable shrub of
which there are varieties named oa ilicifolius argenteovariegatus

names of which will be sufficient to define their characters
oa ilicifolius myrtifoliusmyrtleleaved osmanthus a very distinct
and beautiful shrub with unarmed leaves it is of dwarf compact
growth with small sharplypointed leaves and inconspicuous flowers
for the front line of a shrubbery this is an invaluable shrub its
pretty leaves and neat twiggy habit making it a favourite with planters
the variety rotundifolius is seldom seen in cultivation but being
distinct in foliage from any of the others is to be recommended they
grow freely in any good garden soil but all the better if a little peat
is added at the time of planting
ostrya
ostrya carpinifolia syn o vulgariscommon hop hornbeam south
europe 1724 a muchbranched roundheaded tree with cordateovate
acuminate leaves both this and the following species by reason of the
resemblance between their female catkins and those of the hop and
between their leaves and those of the hornbeam have acquired the very
descriptive name of hop hornbeam this is a largegrowing tree
specimens in various parts of the country ranging in height from 50 feet
to 60 feet
o virginicavirginian hop hornbeam eastern united states 1692
resembles the latter but is of smaller growth rarely exceeding 40 feet
in height they grow fairly well in almost any class of soil and on
account of the long and showy catkins are well worthy of cultivation
oxydendrum
oxydendrum arboreum syn andromeda arboreasorreltree eastern
united states 1752 unfortunately this species is not often found under
cultivation being unsuitable generally for our climate in some
instances however it has done well a specimen in the knap hill

composite forming a dense twiggy shrub with narrow rosemarylike
leaves and small whitish asterlike flowers which resemble those of
its near relative the olearia and are produced so thickly that the

tips of the branches being usually killed back should the winter be at
all severe
parrotia
parrotia persicapersia 1848 well known for the lovely autumnal
tints displayed by the foliage when dying off but for the flowers too
it is well worthy of culture the crimsontipped stamens of the male
flowers being singularly beautiful and uncommon in february it is no
unusual sight to see on wellestablished plants whole branches that are
profusely furnished with these showy flowers for planting in a warm
corner of a rather dry border it seems to be well suited but it is
perfectly hardy and free of growth when suited with soil and site it is
as yet rare in cultivation but is sure when better known and more
widely disseminated to become a general favourite with lovers of hardy
shrubs
passiflora
passiflora caeruleapassion flower brazil and peru 1699 though not
perfectly hardy yet this handsome climbing plant if cut down to the
ground usually shoots up freely again in the spring the flowers which
are produced very freely but particularly in maritime districts vary
from white to blue and the prettilyfringed corona and centre of the
flower render the whole peculiarly interesting and beautiful p

colvillei has white sepals and a blue fringe the latter is of more
robust growth and more floriferous than the species
paulownia
paulownia imperialisjapan 1840 this is a handsome fastgrowing
tree and one that is particularly valuable for its ample foliage and
distinct and showy flowers though perfectly hardy in other respects it
is unfortunate that the season at which the paulownia flowers is so
early that unless the conditions are unusually favourable the flower
buds get destroyed by the frost the tree grows to fully 40 feet high in
this country and is a grandly decorative object in its foliage alone
and for which should the flowers never be produced it is well worthy
of cultivation they are ovatecordate thickly covered with a grayish
woolly tomentum and often measure but particularly in young and
healthy trees as much as 10 inches in length the foxglovelike flowers
are purplishviolet and spotted and borne in terminal panicles they
are sweetlyscented when favourably situated and in cool sandy loam
or peaty earth the growth of the tree is very rapid and when a tree
has been cut over the shoots sent out often exceed 6 feet in length in
one season and nearly 2 inches in diameter there are many fine old
trees throughout the country and which testify to the general hardihood
of the paulownia
periploca

a tall climbing shrub with small ovatelanceolate leaves and
clusters of curious purplishbrown greentipped flowers produced in
summer the long incurved appendages in the shape of a crown and
placed so as to protect the style and anthers render the flowers of

and bears an abundance of white bellshaped flowers it is a capital
wind screen and may be used to advantage on the exposed side of
rockwork or flower beds or as an ornamental shrub by the pond or lake
side the small darkgreen leaves the tiny white flowers and great
abundance of deep purple berries in winter are all points that are in
favour of the shrub for extended cultivation the pretty pinky shoots
too help to make the plant attractive even in midwinter propagation
by layers or seed is readily brought about to grow this shrub to
perfection peaty soil or decayed vegetable matter will be found most
suitable there is a narrowleaved form named p mucronata angustifolia
and another on which the name of p mucronata speciosa has been
bestowed
there are many beautifulberried forms of the pernettya but as their
flowers are small can hardly be included in our list

wellknown and valuable garden shrub of from 6 feet to 10 feet high
with ovate and serrulated leaves and pretty racemes of white or
yellowishwhite fragrant flowers p coronarius aureovariegatus is one
of the numerous forms of this shrub having brightlytinted golden
foliage but the flowers are in no way superior to those of the parent
it is if only for the foliage an extremely pretty and distinct
variety p coronarius argenteovariegatus has silverytinted leaves p
coronarius florepleno full double flowers and p coronarius keteleeri
florepleno is the best doubleflowered form in cultivation
p gordonianus an american species 1839 is a wellknown and
beautiful shrub in which the flowers are usually double the size of
those of the common species and which are not produced till july while
those of p coronarius appear in early may
p grandiflorus syns p floribundus p latifolius and p

irregularlytoothed leaves and large white sweetlyscented flowers
produced in clusters this forms a stout bush 10 feet high and as much
through there are two varieties p grandiflorus laxus and p
grandiflorus speciosissimus both distinct and pretty kinds
p hirsutusnorth america 1820 another handsome smallflowered
species of dwarf growth and having hairy leaves
p inodorous also from north america 1738 differs little in size
and shape of flowers from p grandiflorus but the flowers are without
scent the leaves too are quite glabrous and obscurely toothed
p lemoinei boule dargent is a cross raised in 1888 from p lemoinei
and the doubleflowered form of p coronarius the flowers are double
white and with the pleasant but not heavy scent of p microphyllus p
lemoinei gerbe de neige bears pleasantlyscented flowers that are as
large as those of the wellknown p speciosissimus there is an erect
form of p lemoinei named erectus that is also worthy of note
p lewisi from north america is hardly sufficiently distinct from some
of the others to warrant special notice
p microphyllus from new mexico 1883 is of low growth and
remarkable for its slender branches small myrtlelike leaves and
abundance of small white flowers it is a decidedly pretty shrub but
is not so hardy as the others
p satzumi syn p chinensisjapan 1851 a slendergrowing
species with long and narrow leaves and large white flowers
p triflorus and p mexicanus are other species that might be worthy of
including in a representative collection of these plants
this is a valuable genus of shrubs all being remarkable for the
abundance of white and usually sweetscented flowers which they
produce they require no special treatment few soils if at all free
and rich coming amiss to them while even as shrubs for shady
situations they are not to be despised propagation is effected by means
of cuttings which root freely if placed in sandy soil

growth with large laurellike leaves which are of a pleasing shade of
green and fully 4 inches long they are of stout leathery texture and
plentifully produced that this shrub is perfectly hardy is now a
wellestablished fact
the phillyreas succeed well in light warm but not too dry soil and
they do all the better if a warm and sheltered position is assigned to
them being unusually bright of foliage they are of great service in
planting for shrubbery embellishment and which they light up in a very
conspicuous manner during the dull winter months they get shabby and
meagre foliaged if exposed to cold winds

the flowers being large often 3 inches in diameter and white tinged
with pink particularly at the base of the petals the flowers too are
produced earlier than those of any other almond while the tree is of
stout growth and readily suited with both soil and site

years ago but it is still far from common it is the earliest of the
almonds to unfold its white flowers for in mild winters some of them
expand before the end of january but march about the first week it is
at its best it is of more slender growth than the common almond and
the flowers which are individually smaller are borne in great
profusion along the shoots of the preceding year so that a specimen
when in full flower is quite one mass of bloom there is a rosytinted
form known as amygdalus davidiana rubra

that are individually not very large and rarely exceeding an inch in
diameter when fully expanded generally in the bud state the flowers are
of a deep crimson but this disappears as they become perfectly
developed and when a less striking tint of pinkywhite is assumed from
the st petersburgh gardens many very ornamental crabs have been sent
out these differing considerably in colour of bark habit and tint of
flowers they have all been referred to the above species p floribunda
is a worthy form and one of the most brilliant of springflowering
trees the long slender shoots are thickly covered for almost their
entire length with flowers that are rich crimson in the bud state but
paler when fully opened there are numerous very distinct varieties
such as p floribunda atrosanguinea with deep red flowers p
floribunda elise rathe of pendulous habit p floribunda john downie
very beautiful in fruit p floribunda pendula a semiweeping variety
p floribunda praecox earlyflowering p floribunda mitis of small
size p floribunda halleana or parkmanii probably the most beautiful
of all the forms and p floribunda fairy apple and p floribunda
transcendant crab of interest on account of their showy fruit p
floribunda toringo toringo crab is a japanese tree of small growth
with sharply cut usually threelobed pubescent leaves and small
flowers fruit small with deciduous calyx lobes
p germanica syn mespilus germanicacommon medlar europe
britain asia minor persia early records show that the medlar was
cultivated for its fruit as early as 1596 some varieties are still
grown for that purpose and in that state the tree is not devoid of
ornament the large white flowers are produced singly but have a fine
effect in their setting of long lanceolate finelyserrate leaves
during may
p japonica syn cydonia japonicajapanese quince japan 1815
this is one of the commonest of our garden shrubs and one that is
peculiarly well suited for our climate whether planted as a standard or
as a wall plant the flowers are brilliant crimson and plentifully
produced towards the end of winter and before the leaves besides the
species there are several very fine varieties including p japonica
albo cincta p japonica atropurpurea p japonica coccinea p japonica
florepleno p japonica nivalis a charming species with snowywhite
flowers p japonica rosea of a delicate rosepink and p japonica
princeps p japonica cardinalis is one of the best of the numerous
forms of this beautiful shrub the flowers are of large size of full
rounded form and of a deep cardinalrose colour they are produced in
great quantity along the branches a wellgrown specimen is in april a
brilliant picture of vivid colour and the shrub is sooner or later
destined to a chief place amongst our ornamental flowering shrubs p
japonica maulei syn cydonia maulei from japan 1874 is a rare
shrub as yet small of growth and with every twig festooned with the
brightest of orangescarlet flowers it is quite hardy and succeeds
well under treatment that will suit the common species
p prunifoliasiberia 1758 whether in flower or fruit this beautiful
species is sure to attract attention it is a tree of 25 feet in height
with nearly rotundate glabrous leaves on long footstalks and pretty
pinkywhite flowers the fruit is very ornamental being when fully
ripe of a deep and glowing scarlet but there are forms with yellow
and green as also striped fruit
p rivularisriverside wild service tree northwest america 1836 a
native of north america with terminal clusters of white flowers
succeeded by subglobose red or yellow fruit is an attractive and
handsome species the fruit is eaten by the indians of the northwest
and the wood which is very hard and susceptible of a fine polish is
largely used in the making of wedges it is a rare species in this
country
p sinica syn p sinensis of lindleychinese pear tree china and
cochin china 1820 another very ornamental crab bearing a great
abundance of rosypink or nearly white flowers it is a shrublike tree
reaching a height of 20 feet and with an upright habit of growth bark
of a rich reddishbrown colour it is one of the most profuse and
persistent bloomers of the whole family
p sinensis syn cydonia chinensischinese quince china 1818
this is rarely seen in cultivation it having comparatively speaking
few special merits of recommendation
p smithii syns mespilis smithii and m grandiflorasmiths
medlar caucasus 1800 the habit of this tree closely resembles that of
a hawthorn and although the flowers are only half the size of those of
the common medlar they are produced in greater profusion so that the
roundheaded tree becomes a sheet of white blossom during may and june
the reddishbrown fruits are small for a medlar and ripen in october
p torminaliswild service tree a native species of small growth
with ovatecordate leaves and small white flowers p torminalis
pinnatifida with acutelylobed leaves and ovaloblong fruit may just
be mentioned
p vestitanepaul white beam nepaul 1820 in this species the leaves
are very large ovateacute or elliptic and when young thickly coated
with a white woollylike substance but which with warm weather
gradually gives way until they are of a smooth and shining green the
flowers are borne in woolly racemose corymbs and are white succeeded by
greenishbrown berries as large as marbles
other species of less interest are p varidosa p salicifolia p
salvaefolia p bollwylleriana and p amygdaliformis they are all of
free growth and the readiest culture and being perfectly hardy are
well worthy of a much larger share of attention than they have
heretofore received
rhamnus
rhamnus alaternusmediterranean region 1629 this is an evergreen
shrub with lanceolate shining leaves of a dark glossygreen colour and
pretty flowers produced from march till june there are several
wellmarked varieties one with golden and another with silvery leaves
and named respectively r alaternus foliis aureis and r alaternus
foliis argenteus
r alpinuseurope 1752 this is a neatgrowing species with greenish
flowers and black fruit
r catharticus common buckthorn is a native thorny species with
ovate and stalked leaves and small thickly clustered greenish flowers
succeeded by black berries about the size of peas
r frangulathe berrybearing alder europe and britain a more erect
shrub than the former and destitute of spines the leaves too are
larger and the fruit of a dark purple colour when ripe more common in
britain than the former
rhaphiolepis
rhaphiolepis japonica integerrima syn r ovataa japanese shrub
1865 with deep green ovate leathery leaves that are not over
abundant and produced generally at the branchtips the pure white
fragrant flowers are plentifully produced when the plant is grown in a
cosy corner or on a sunny wall though seldom killed outright the
raphiolepis becomes badly crippled in severe winters it is however a
bold and handsome shrub and one that may be seen doing well in many
gardens around london
rhaphithamnus
rhaphithamnus cyanocarpus syn citharexylum cyanocarpum chili this
bears a great resemblance to some of the thorny berberis and is at once
a distinct and beautiful shrub the flowers are large and conspicuous
and of a taking bluishlilac colour having stood unharmed in ireland
through the unusually severe winters of 187980 when many more common
shrubs were killed outright it may be relied upon as at least fairly
hardy the soil in which this rare and pretty shrub does best is a
brown fibrous peat intermingled with sharp sand
rhododendron
rhododendron arborescens syn azalea arborescens from the carolina
mountains 1818 is a very showy lateblooming species the white
fragrant flowers and noble port together with its undoubted hardihood
should make this shrub a general favourite with cultivators
r calendulaceum syn azalea calendulacea from north america 1806
is another of the deciduous species having oblong hairy leaves and
large orangecoloured flowers it is of robust growth and in favoured
situations reaches a height of 6 feet when in full flower the slopes of
the southern alleghany mountains are rendered highly attractive by
reason of the great flamecoloured masses of this splendid plant and
are one of the great sights of the american continent during the month
of june
r californicumcalifornia a good hardy species with broadly
campanulate rosypurple flowers spotted with yellow
r campanulatum syn r aeruginosumsikkim 1825 a smallgrowing
species rarely over 6 feet high with elliptic leaves that are
fawncoloured on the under sides the campanulate flowers are large and
showy rose or white and purple spotted at the base of the three upper
lobes in this country it is fairly hardy but suffers in very severe
weather unless planted in a sheltered site
r campylocarpumsikkim 1851 this has stood the winter uninjured in
so many districts that it may at least be recommended for planting in
favoured situations and by the seaside it is a sikkim species that was
introduced about forty years ago and is still rather rare the leaves
are about 4 inches long 2 inches wide and distinctly undulated on the
margins flowers bellshaped about 2 inches in diameter and arranged
in rather straggling terminal heads they are sulphuryellow without
markings a tint distinct from any other known indian species
r catawbiensemountains from virginia to georgia 1809 a bushy free
growing species with broadly oval leaves and large campanulate
flowers produced in compact rounded clusters they vary a good deal in
colour but lilacpurple is the typical shade this is a very valuable
species and one that has given rise to a large number of beautiful
varieties
r chrysanthum is a siberian species 1796 of very dwarf compact
growth with linearlanceolate leaves that are ferruginous on the under
side and beautiful goldenyellow flowers an inch in diameter it is a
desirable but scarce species
r collettianum is an afghanistan species and one that may be reckoned
upon as being perfectly hardy it is of very dwarf habit and bears an
abundance of small white and faintly fragrant flowers for planting on
rockwork it is a valuable species
r dahuricumdahuria 1780 a smallgrowing scraggylooking species
of about a yard high with ovaloblong leaves that are rustytomentose
on the under sides the flowers which are produced in february are
purple or violet in twos or threes and usually appear before the
leaves it is a sparselyleaved species and of greatest value on
account of the flowers being produced so early in the season one of the
hardiest species in cultivation r dahuricum atrovirens is a beautiful
and worthy variety because nearly evergreen
r ferrugineumalpine rose europe 1752 this dwarf species rarely
exceeding a yard in height occurs in abundance on the swiss alps and
generally where few other plants are to be found it is a neat little
compact shrub with oblonglanceolate leaves that are rustyscaly on the
under sides and has terminal clusters of rosyred flowers
r flavum syn azalea ponticapontic azalea a native of asia minor
1793 is probably the commonest of the recognised species and may
frequently in this country be seen forming good round bushes of 6 feet
in height with hairy lanceolate leaves and large yellow flowers
though in this latter it varies considerably orange and orange tinged
with red being colours often present it is of free growth in any good
light peaty or sandy soil
r hirsutumalpine rose south europe 1656 very near r ferrugincum
but having ciliated leaves with glands on both sides r hallense and
r hirsutiforme are intermediate forms of a natural cross between r
hirsutum and r ferrugincum they are handsome smallgrowing brightly
flowered plants and worthy of culture
r indicumindian azalea a native of china 1808 and perfectly
hardy in the more favoured portions of southern england where it looks
healthy and happy out of doors and blooms freely from year to year
this is the evergreen socalled azalea that is so commonly cultivated in
greenhouses with long hirsute leaves and large showy flowers r
indicum amoenum syn azalea amoena as a greenhouse plant is common
enough but except in the south of england and ireland it is not
sufficiently hardy to withstand severe frost the flowers are moreover
not very showy at least when compared with some of the newer forms
being dull magenta and rather lax of habit
r ledifolium syns azalea ledifolia and a liliifloraledumleaved
azalea china 1819 a perfectly hardy species the flowers are large
and white but somewhat flaunting it is however a desirable species
for massing in quantity beside clumps of the pink and yellow flowered
kinds though introduced nearly threequarters of a century ago this
is by no means a common plant in our gardens
r maximumamerican great laurel north america 1756 this is a very
hardy american species growing in favoured localities from 10 feet to
15 feet high leaves oblonglanceolate slightly ferruginous beneath
flowers rose and white in dense clusters there are several handsome
varieties that vary to a wide extent in the size and colour of flowers
r maximum album bears white flowers
r molle syn azalea mollis from japan 1867 is a dwarf deciduous
species of neat growth with flamecoloured flowers it is very hardy
and a desirable acquisition to any collection of smallgrowing shrubs
r occidentale syn azalea occidentalis western azalea is valuable
in that the flowers are produced later than those of almost any other
species these are white blotched with yellow at the base of the upper
petals and being produced when the leaves are almost fully developed
have a very pleasing effect particularly as they are borne in great
quantity and show well above the foliage this is a californian species
that has been found further west of the rocky mountains than any other
member of ihe family
r parvifoliumbaiacul 1877 this is a pleasing and interesting
species with small deepgreen ovate leaves and clusters of white
flowers margined with rose it is of dwarf and neat growth and well
suited for planting on the rock garden
r ponticumpontic rhododendron or rose bay asia minor 1763 this
is the commonest species in cultivation and although originally a
native of the district by the black or pontic sea is now naturalised
in many parts of europe it is the hardiest and least exacting of the
large flowered species and is generally employed as a stock on which
to graft the less hardy kinds flowers in the typical species pale
purplishviolet and spotted there is a great number of varieties
including white pink scarlet and doubleflowering
r ponticum azaleoides syn r ponticum deciduum a hybrid between r
ponticum and a hardy azalea is a subevergreen form with a compact
habit of growth and bearing loose heads of fragrant lavenderandwhite
flowers it is quite hardy at kew
r racemosumcentral china 1880 a neat little species of dwarf
compact growth from the yunnan district of china the flowers are pale
pink edged with a deeper tint about an inch across and borne in
terminal and axillary clusters it has stood unharmed for several years
in southern england so may be regarded as at least fairly hardy its
neat dwarf growth and flowering as it does when hardly a foot high
renders it a choice subject for the alpine garden
r rhodora syn rhodora canadensisnorth america 1767 in general
aspect this shrub resembles an azalea but it comes into flower long
even before r molle being deciduous and producing its pretty purplish
sweetscented flowers in early spring gives to the plant a particular
value for gardening purposes clumps of the shrub being most effective
at the very time when flowers are at their scarcest it thrives well in
any peaty soil and is quite hardy
r viscosum syn azalea viscosaclammy azalea or swamp
honeysuckle north america 1734 this is one of the hardiest most
floriferous and easily managed of the family the white or rose and
deliciously fragrant flowers are produced in great abundance and impart
when at their best quite a charm to the shrub it delights in rather
moist peaty soil and grows all the stronger and flowers all the more
freely when surrounded by rising ground or tall trees at considerable
distance away the variety r viscosum glaucum has leaves paler than
those of the species and r viscosum nitidum of dwarf compact growth
has leaves deep green on both sides
r wilsoni a cross between r ciliatum and r glaucum is of remarkably
neat growth and worthy of cultivation where smallsized kinds are a
desideratum
the following himalayan species have been found to thrive well in the
warmer parts of england and in close proximity to the sear
argenteum r arboreum r aucklandii r barbatum r ciliatum r
campanulatum r cinnabarinum r campbelli r compylocarpum r
eximium r fortunei r falconeri r glaucum r hodgsoni r lanatum
r niveum r roylei r thompsoni and r wallichii
r ungernii and r smirnowii from the armenian frontier are also
worthy of culture but they are at present rare in cultivation in this
country
few hardy shrubs it must be admitted are more beautiful than these
rhododendrons none flowering more freely or lasting longer in bloom
their requirements are by no means hard to meet light peaty soil or
even good sandy loam with a small admixture of decayed vegetable
matter suiting them well lime in any form must however be kept away
both from azaleas and rhododendrons they like a quiet still place
where a fair amount of moisture is present in the air and soil
hardy hybrid rhododendrons
ghent azaleas as generally known from having been raised in belgium
are a race of hybrids that have been produced by crossing the asiatic r
pontica with the various american species noted above but particularly
r calendulaceum r nudiflorum and r viscosum and these latter with
one another these have produced hybrids of almost indescribable beauty
the flowers of which range in colour from crimson and pink through
orange and yellow to almost white
within the last few years quite an interesting race of rhododendrons has
been brought out with double or hoseinhose flowers and very
appropriately termed the narcissiflora group they include fully a dozen
highly ornamental kinds with flowers of varying shades of colour

rhodothamnus chamaecistus syn rhododendron chamaecistusground
cistus alps of austria and bavaria 1786 a very handsome shrub of
small growth and widely distributed in bavaria switzerland and
elsewhere planted in peaty soil and in a rather damp shady situation
it thrives best the ovalserrate leaves covered with white villous
hairs and pretty rosy flowers giving it an almost unique appearance
it is a charming rock shrub and perfectly hardy
rhodotypos
rhodotypos kerrioideswhite kerria japan 1866 a handsome deciduous
shrub and one that is readily propagated and comparatively cheap it
is distinct and pretty when in flower and one of the hardiest and most
accommodating of shrubs the leaves are handsome being deeply serrated
and silky on the under sides while the pure white flowers are often
about 2 inches across it grows about 4 feet in height and is a very
distinct and desirable shrub
rhus
rhus cotinussmoke plant wig tree or venetian sumach spain to
caucasus 1656 on account of its singular appearance this shrub always
attracts the attention of even the most unobservant in such matters it
is a spreading shrub about 6 feet high with rotundate glaucous
leaves on long petioles the flowers are small and inconspicuous but
the feathery nature of the flower clusters occasioned by the
transformation of the pedicels and hairs into fluffy awns renders this
sumach one of the most curious and attractive of hardy shrubs spreading
about freely this south european shrub should be allowed plenty of room
so that it may become perfectly developed
r glabra syns r caroliniana r coccinea r elegans and r
sanguineasmooth or scarlet sumach north america 1726 a smaller
tree than the last with leaves that are deep glossygreen above and
whitish beneath the male tree bears greenishyellow flowers and the
female those of a reddishscarlet but otherwise no difference between
the trees can be detected r glabra laciniata fern sumach is a
distinct and handsome variety with finely cut elegant leaves and a
dwarf and compact habit of growth the leaves are very beautiful and
resemble those of the grevillea robusta it is a worthy variety
r succedaneared lac sumach japan 1768 this is not often seen
planted out though in not a few places it succeeds perfectly well it
has elegant foliage each leaf being 15 inches long and divided into
several pairs of leaflets
r toxicodendronpoison oak or poison ivy north america 1640 this
species is of halfscandent habit with large trifoliolate leaves
which turn of various tints of red and crimson in the autumn it is
quite hardy and seen to best advantage when allowed to run over large
rockwork and tree stumps in partial shade the variety r toxicodendron
radicans has ample foliage and is suited for similar places to the
last the leaves turn bright yellow in the autumn
r typhinastags horn sumach or vinegar tree a native of north
america 1629 and a very common shrub in our gardens probably on
account of its spreading rapidly by suckers it is when well grown a
handsome and distinct shrub or small tree with large pinnate hairy
leaves and shoots that are rendered very peculiar by reason of the
dense hairs with which they are covered for some distance back the
dense clusters of greenishyellow flowers are sure to attract attention
although they are by no means pretty r typhina viridiflora is the
maleflowered form of this species with green flowers
r venenata syn r vernixpoison elder sumach or dogwood north
america 1713 this is remarkable for its handsome foliage and is the
most poisonous species of the genus
all the sumachs grow and flower freely in any good garden soil indeed
in that respect they are not at all particular they throw up shoots
freely so that increasing the stock is by no means difficult
ribes
ribes alpinum pumilum aureumgolden mountain currant the ordinary
green form is a native of britain of which the plant named above is a
dwarf goldenleaved variety
r aureumbuffalo currant northwest america 1812 in this species
the leaves are lobed and irregularly toothed while the flowers are
yellow or slightly reddishtinted it is of rather slender and
straggling growth r aureum praecox is an earlyflowering variety and
r aureum serotinum is valued on account of the flowers being produced
much later than are those of the parent plant
r cereum syn r inebriansnorth america 1827 one of the
dwarfergrowing species of flowering currant forming a low dense bush
of gooseberrylike appearance but destitute of spines by may it is in
full flower and the blooms borne in large clusters have a pretty
pinkish tinge the foliage is small neat and of a tender green that
helps to set off the pretty flowers to perfection it is a native of
northwest america and perfectly hardy in every part of the country
though not equal in point of floral beauty with our common flowering
currant still the miniature habit pretty and freelyproduced
pinktinted flowers and fresh green foliage will all help to make it an
acquisition wherever planted like the other species of ribes the
present plant grows and flowers very freely in any soil and almost
however poor
r floridum syns r missouriense and r pennsylvanicumamerican
wild black currant north america 1729 this should be included in all
collections for its pretty autumnal foliage which is of a bright
purplish bronze
r gordonianum syns r beatonii and r loudonii is a hybrid
between r aureum and r sanguineum and has reddish yellow tinged
flowers and partakes generally of the characters of both species
r multiflorum eastern europe 1822 is another desirable species
with long drooping racemes of greenishyellow flowers and small red
berries
r sanguineumflowering currant northwest america 1826 an old
inhabitant of our gardens and well deserving of all that can be said in
its favour as a beautiful springflowering shrub it is of north
american origin with deep red and abundantlyproduced flowers there
are several distinct varieties as followsr sanguineum florepleno
burning bush with perfectly double flowers which are produced later
and last longer than those of the species r sanguineum album with
pale pink or almost white flowers r sanguineum atrorubens with
deeplycoloured flowers r sanguineum glutinosum and r sanguineum
grandiflorum bearing compact clusters of flowers that are rosyflesh
coloured on the outside and white or pinkywhite within
r speciosumfuchsiaflowered gooseberry california 1829 a
californian species remarkable for being more or less spiny and with
flowers resembling some of the fuchsias they are crimson and with
long protruding stamens as a wall plant where it often rises to 6
feet in height this pretty and taking species is most often seen
the flowering currants are of unusually free growth and are not at all
particular about soil often thriving well in that of a very poor
description they are increased readily from cuttings and by layers
robinia
robinia dubia syns r echiuata and r ambiguaa very pretty
garden hybrid form said to have for its parentage r pseudacacia and
r viscosa it is of quite treelike growth and habit with unusually
short spines and peagreen foliage the flowers are produced pretty
freely and are of a pale rose colour and well set off by the
lightgreen leaves over which they hang in neat and compact spikes
r hispidarose acacia north america 1743 amongst largegrowing
shrubs this is certainly one of the most distinct and handsome and at
the same time one of the hardiest and readiest of culture under
favourable conditions it grows about 16 feet high with large oval or
oblong leaflets and having the young branches densely clothed with
bristles the flowers which are individually larger than those of the
false acacia are of a beautiful rosypink and produced in june and
july it is a very ornamental small growing species and one that is
peculiarly suitable for planting where space is limited r hispida
macrophylla largeleaved rose acacia is rendered distinct by its
generally more robust growth and by its larger foliage and flowers the
species however varies a good deal in respect of the size of leaves
and flowers
r pseudacaciacommon locust bastard acacia or false acacia north
america 1640 a noblegrowing and handsome tree with smooth shoots
and stipules that become transformed into sharp stiff spines the
flowers are in long racemes purewhite or slightly tinged with pink
and with a faint pleasing odour this species has been subdivided into
a great number of varieties some of which are very distinct but the
majority are not sufficiently so to warrant special attention the
following include the best and most popular kindsr pseudacacia
decaisneana a distinct form bearing light pinky flowers r
pseudacacia bessoniana with thornless branches and a dense head of
refreshing peagreen foliage r pseudacacia angustifolia with narrow
leaves r pseudacacia aurea a conspicuous but not very constant
golden leaved form r pseudacacia inermis of which there are weeping
upright and broadleaved forms has narrow leaves that are glaucous
beneath and the characteristic spines of the species are wanting or
rarely well developed r pseudacacia monophylla is very distinct the
leaves being entire instead of pinnate while r pseudacacia crispa has
curiouslycurled foliage then there is the peculiar r pseudacacia
tortuosa of ungainly habit r pseudacacia umbraculifera with a
spreading head r pseudacacia sophoraefolia the leaves of which
resemble those of sophora japonica and r pseudacacia amorphaefolia
with very large foliage when compared with the parent tree the above
may be taken as the most distinct and desirable forms of the false
acacia but there are many others such as r pseudacacia colutoides
r pseudacacia semperflorens and r pseudacacia rhederi all more or
less distinct from the typical tree
r viscosa syn r glutinosaclammy locust north america 1797
this is a smallgrowing tree and readily distinguished by the clammy
bark of the younger shoots flowers in short racemes and of a beautiful
rosepink but varying a good deal in depth of tint it is a valuable
species for ornamental planting and flowers well even in a young state
few soils would seem to come amiss to the acacias but observations
made in many parts of the country conclusively prove that the finest
specimens are growing on light rich loam overlying a bed of gravel
they are propagated from seed by layers or by grafting
rosa
rosa albathis is a supposed garden hybrid between r canina and r
gallica 1597 it has very glaucous foliage and large flowers which
vary according to the variety from pure white to rose
r repens syn r arvensisfield rose europe britain this
species bears white flowers that are produced in threes or fours rarely
solitary the whole plant is usually of weak and straggling growth with
shining leaves
r bracteata macartney rose r palustris marsh rose and r

floral leaves or bracts and shaggy fruit they are of compact growth
with neat shining leaves the flowers of the firstmentioned being rose
or carmine and those of the other two pure white
r caninadog rose our native roses have now been reduced to five
species of which the present is one of the number it is a straggling
shrub 6 feet or 8 feet high and armed with curved spines flowers
sweetscented pink or white and solitary or in twos or threes at the
branch tips
r centifoliahundredleaved or cabbage rose orient 1596 a
beautiful sweetlyscented species growing to 6 feet in height and
having leaves that are composed of from three to five broadly ovate
toothed leaflets the flowers are solitary or two or three together
drooping and of a rosy hue but differing in tint to a considerable
extent this species has varied very much principally through the
influences of culture and crossing the three principal and marked
variations being size colour and clothing of the calyx tube there are
the common provence roses the miniature provence or pompon roses and
the moss roseall of which are merely races of r centifolia
r damascenadamask rose orient 1573 a bushy shrub varying from 2
feet to 8 feet in height according to cultural treatment and age the
flowers are white or red large borne in corymbose clusters and
produced in great profusion during june and july the varieties that
have arisen under cultivation by seminal variation hybridisation or
otherwise are exceedingly numerous those now grown are mostly double
and a large proportion of them are light in colour they include the
quatre saisons and the true york and lancaster the flowers are highly
fragrant and like those of r centifolia and other species are used
indiscriminately for the purpose of making rose water the species is
distinguished from r centifolia by its larger prickles elongated
fruit and long reflexed sepals
r feroxnorth asia this species bears flowers in clusters of two and
three together terminating the branches the petals are white with a
yellow base the branches are erect and thickly crowded with prickles
of unequal size
r gallicathe french or gallic rose europe and western asia this
rose forms a bushy shrub 2 feet to 3 feet high and has been so long
grown in british gardens that the date of its introduction has been lost
in obscurity it is doubtless the red rose of ancient writers but at
present the flowers may be red crimson or white and there are
varieties of all intermediate shades several variegated or striped
roses belong here including gloria mundi a popular favourite often but
erroneously grown under the name of york and lancaster they all flower
in june and july and together with other kinds that flower about the
same time are generally known as summer or oldfashioned garden roses
r hemisphaerica syn r sulphureaorient 1629 a bushy plant
growing from 4 feet to 6 feet high and bearing large double yellow
flowers
r indicacommon china or monthly rose introduced from china near
canton in 1789 but the native country is not known with certainty the
flowers of the plant when first introduced were red and generally
semidouble but the varieties now vary through all shades of blush
rose and crimson and the plant varies exceedingly in height in its
different forms 1 foot to 20 feet in height the monthly roses form
bushes generally about 2 feet high or a little over the noisette and
tea roses with several other more or less distinct types belong here
but as most of them are well known and otherwise well cared for it is
unnecessary to dwell upon them in detail beyond the two varieties here
given and which should not be overlooked
r indica minima syn r semperflorens minima r lawrenceana and r
minimafairy or miniature rose china 1810 a beautiful little
rose that rarely exceeds a height of 4 inches or 5 inches the flowers
are about the size of a halfcrown and somewhat after the york and
lancaster as regards colouring though not perhaps so distinctly
marked and are produced in abundance for the rock garden it is one of
the most desirable and being perfectly hardy still further adds to its
value
r indica semperflorens syns r bengalensis and r

scarlet and the under surface yellow
r rubiginosa syn r eglanteriaeglantine or sweet brier this
species has pink flowers and clammy leaves which are glandular on the
under surface and give out a fragrant smell by which it may be
recognised
r rugosa syn r ferox of bot reg a japanese species and its
variety r rugosa alba are beautiful shrubs that have proved themselves
perfectly hardy and well suited for extensive culture in this country
they are of stiff shrubby habit about 4 feet high and with branches
thickly clothed with spines becoming brown with age leaflets oval in
shape deep green with the upper surface rough to the touch the under
sides densely tomentose flowers single fully 3 inches in diameter the
petals of good substance and white or rosecoloured the fruit is
large larger than that of perhaps any other rose and of a bright red
when fully ripe in so far as beauty of fruit is concerned this rose
has certainly no rival and whether for the rockwork or open border it
must be classed amongst the most useful and beautiful of hardy shrubs
r rugosa is a capital hedge plant and being a true species it is
readily propagated from seed r rugosa kamtschatika is a deepred
flowered form with deciduous spines
r sempervirensevergreen rose south europe and india 1529 a
climbing species with long slender branches armed with hooked
prickles leaves evergreen shining and composed of from five to seven

bushy growth with the leaflets softly downy on both sides flowers
white or pale pink succeeded by globular fruits that are more or less
covered with fine hair or prickles
rosmarinus
rosmarinus officinaliscommon rosemary mediterranean region 1848 a
familiar garden shrub of dense growth with duskygray green linear
leaves and pale blue or white flowers there is a golden and a silver
leaved variety named respectively r officinalis foliisaureis and r
officinalis foliisargenteis as also one distinguished by having
broader foliage than the species and named r officinalis latifolius
rubus
rubus arcticusarctic regions of both hemispheres an interesting
species about 6 inches high with trifoliolate leaves and deepred
flowers for alpine gardening it is a valuable species of dwarf growth
r australis from new zealand is a very prickly species with the
leaves reduced to their stalks and the midribs of three leaflets not
being very hardy it is usually seen as a wall plant
r biflorushimalayas 1818 a tallgrowing species with whitish
spiny stems and simple threelobed leaves that are tomentose on the
under sides the flowers are thickly produced pure white and render
the plant highly attractive and of great beauty
r deliciosusthis rocky mountain bramble 1870 is a very worthy
species with three or fivelobed not pinnate leaves and large pure
white flowers that are each about 2 inches in diameter and produced in
profusion from the leafaxils for ornamental planting this may be
placed in the first rank of the family to which it belongs
r fruticosuscommon bramble or blackberry of this wellknown native
species there are several worthy varieties of which the doubleflowered
are especially worth notice blooming as they do in the latter part of
summer r fruticosus flore albopleno double whiteflowered bramble
and r fruticosus flore roseopleno double redflowered bramble are
very pretty and showy varieties and well worth including in any
collection there is a pretty variegatedleaved form of the common
bramble known as r fruticosus variegatus
r laciniatus cutleaved bramble might also be included on account of
its profusion of white flowers and neatly divided foliage
r nutkanusnorth america 1826 this has white flowers but otherwise
it resembles r odoratus
r odoratuspurple flowering raspberry north america 1700 the
sweetscented virginian raspberry forms a rather dense upright growing
bush fully 4 feet high with large broadly fivelobed and toothed
leaves that are more or less viscid sweetscented and deciduous the
leaves are placed on long hairy viscid footstalks flowers in
terminal corymbs large and nearly circular purplishred in colour and
composed of five broad round petals the fruit which is rarely
produced in this country is velvety and ambercoloured it is a very
ornamental species the ample maplelike leaves and large flowers
rendering it particularly attractive in summer the leaves and not the
flowers as is generally supposed are sweetly scented
r rosaefoliusroseleaved raspberry himalayas 1811 another
halfhardy species and only suited for planting against sunny walls
leaves pinnate finer than those of the raspberry r r coronarius
with semidouble white flowers is better than the type
r spectabilisthe salmon berry north america 1827 grows about 6
feet high with ternate or trilobate leaves that are very thickly
produced flowers usually bright red or purplishcoloured and placed on
long pendulous footstalks it is of very dense growth occasioned by the
number of suckers sent up from the roots
there are also some of the socalled american brambles well worthy of
attention two of the best being kittatiny and lawtons
the brambles are particularly valuable shrubs as owing to their dense
growth they may be used for a variety of purposes but especially for
covering unsightly objects or banks they are all wonderfully
floriferous and succeed admirably even in very poor and stony soils
increase is readily obtained either from root suckers or by layering
ruscus
ruscus aculeatusbutchers broom pettigree and pettigrue europe
britain and north africa this is a native evergreen shrub with
rigid cladodes which take the place of leaves and not very showy
greenish flowers appearing about may for the bright red berries which
are as large as small marbles it is alone worth cultivating while it
is one of the few shrubs that grow at all satisfactorily beneath the
shade of our larger trees
r hypophyllumdouble tongue mediterranean region 1640 this species
has the flowers on the undersides of the leaflike branches and its
variety rh hypoglossum has them on the upper side both are of value
for planting in the shade
sambucus
sambucus californicacalifornian elder a rare species as yet but one
that from its elegant growth and duration of flowers is sure when
better known to become widely distributed
s glauca has its herbaceous parts covered with a thick pubescence
leaves pubescent on both sides and with yellow flowers produced in
umbels
s nigracommon elder bourtry or bour tree although one of our
commonest native trees the elder must rank amongst the most ornamental
if only for its large compound cymes of white or yellowishwhite
flowers and ample bunches of shining black berries there are however
several varieties that should be largely cultivated such as s nigra
foliis aureis golden elder s nigra fructu albo white fruited s
nigra laciniata cutleaved elder s nigra argentea silverleaved
elder s nigra rotundifolia roundleaved elder the names of which
will be sufficient for the purposes of recognition
s racemosascarletberried elder south europe and siberia 1596
this is almost a counterpart of our native species but instead of black
the berries are brilliant scarlet it is a highly ornamental species
but it is rather exacting requiring for its perfect growth a cool and
moist situation of this there is a cutleaved form named s racemosa
serratifolia
s rosaeflora is said to be a seedling from s glauca but differs in
many important points from the parent it has smooth shoots and
branches ovateacuminate leaves that are downy beneath and flowers
rosecoloured without and white within they are produced in short
spikelike clusters and are almost destitute of smell the reddish
rings at the insertion of the leaves is another distinguishing feature
for freedom of growth in almost every class of soil and readiness with
which they may be increased the more showy kinds of elder are well
worthy of attention
schizandra
schizandra chinensisnorthern china 1860 this is a climbing shrub
with oval bright green leaves and showy carmine flowers for clothing
arbors and walls it may prove of use but it is as yet rare in
cultivation
s coccinea from north america 1806 is another uncommon species in
which the leaves are oblong and petiolate and the flowers red or
scarlet for purposes similar to the last this species may be employed
schizophragma
schizophragma hydrangeoidesclimbing hydrangea japan 1879 as yet
this is an uncommon shrub and allied to the hydrangea it is of slender
growth the stems rooting into the support and with pinkywhite
flowers as an ornamental climber it is of no great value and requires
a favoured spot to grow it at all satisfactorily
shepherdia
shepherdia argenteabeef suet tree or rabbit berry north america
1820 this shrub is rendered of particular interest on account of the
intense silvery hue of the foliage the leaves are narrow and
lanceolate silvery on both sides and dotted over with rustybrown
scales beneath the flowers which are produced in april are small and
yellow unisexual or each sex on a distinct plant berries scarlet
about the size of red currants and ripe about september

glossy laurellike leaves white or greenishwhite flowers and an
abundance of scarlet berries in autumn it succeeds best in a somewhat
shady situation and when planted in not too heavy peaty soil but where
abundance of not stagnant moisture is present
s japonica of thunberg syn s oblatajapan 1864 a
neatgrowing evergreen shrub with rather larger and more showy leaves
than the former and spikes of pretty whitish sweetly scented flowers
the female form of this is usually known as s fragrans what is usually
known as s oblata ovata and s oblata veitchii are only forms of the
true s japonica while s fragrantissima is the male of the same
species the beautiful berried plant that has been exhibited under the
name of s foremanii and which is of very vigorous growth and produces
pyramidal spikes of sweetly scented flowers is probably s japonica or
a seminal variety another variety sent out under the name of s
macrophylla has unusually large leaves and another named s rogersi
produces fruit very abundantly
s laureola syn limonia laureola from the himalayas is an uncommon
species with very fragrant and pale yellow flowers
s rubella china 1874 is another member of the family that has
greenishwhite sweetscented flowers and which when better known will
be largely planted
smilax

shrub with prickly stems ovate spinytoothed evergreen leaves and
rather unattractive flowers there are other hardy species from north
america including s bonanox better known as s tamnoides s
rotundifolia and s herbacea the first being the most desirable s
aspera mauritanica is a hardy variety but one that is rare in
cultivation with long wiry shoots and well adapted for wall or
trellis covering they all require favoured situations else the growth
is short and the plants stunted and meagre in appearance
solanum
solanum crispumpotatotree a native of chili 1824 and not very
hardy except in the coast regions of england and ireland it grows
stout and bushy often in favoured places rising to the height of 12
feet and has large clusters of purpleblue flowers that are succeeded
by small white berries this is a decidedly ornamental shrub that
should be cultivated wherever a suitable place can be spared it bears
hard pruning back with impunity and succeeds in any light rich loamy
soil
s dulcamarabitter sweet and woody nightshade this is a native
plant and one of great beauty when seen clambering over a fence or
bank it has long flexuous stems and large clusters of purple flowers
which are made all the more conspicuous by the showy yellow anthers the

mediterranean region and canary isles 1548 this resembles our common
broom but the slender rushlike branches are not angular and usually
destitute of leaves the fragrant yellow flowers are produced abundantly
in racemes and when at their best impart to the shrub a very striking
and beautiful appearance for planting in poor sandy or gravelly soils
or amongst stones and shingle and where only a very limited number of
shrubs could be got to grow the spanish broom will be found an
excellent and valuable plant it is a native of southern europe and is
quite hardy all over the country propagated from seed

this is readily distinguished by its showy and freelyproduced coral
berries there is a very neat and much sought after variety having
conspicuous green and yellow leaves and named s vulgaris foliis

the snowberries are of no great value as ornamental shrubs but owing to
their succeeding well in the very poorest and stoniest of soils and
beneath the shade and drip of trees it is to be recommended that they
are not lost sight of they grow and spread freely and are therefore
useful where unchecked and rampant shrub growth is desirable

large double and produced in very massive clusters and of a light
bluishlilac tint when forced almost white the first of this group s
vulgaris lemoinei was sent out about 1884 and was then awarded a
certificate by the rhs the range in colouring of these lilacs is
rather confined so that the various forms resemble one another in no
small degree particularly when the flowers are opened under glass from
the large size of the flower bunches and the individual flowers being
double they are all of great beauty and being quite hardy still
further enhances their value for outdoor gardening purposes
the lilacs grow freely in any soil of fair quality but a free rich
and not too dry loam would seem to suit the majority of these plants

the various species and varieties of lime succeed well in almost any
class of soil but rich loam on sand is considered the most suitable for
their perfect development
ulex
ulex europaeusfurze gorse or whin this pretty native shrub needs
no description suffice it to say that it is one of the
handsomestflowering shrubs in cultivation u europaeus florepleno
doubleflowered gorse is even more beautiful than the species the
wealth of golden flowers almost hiding the plant from view u europaeus
strictus irish furze is of more erect and slender growth and less
rigid than the common species
u nanusdwarf gorse cat whin and tam furze this differs
considerably from the common plant not only in stature but in the time
of flowering in this species the bracts at the calyx base are small
compared with those of u europaeus while the smaller flowers are
produced during summer and when not a bloom is to be found on its
supposed parent it is of dense growth the tallest stems rarely rising
from the ground to a greater height than about 15 inches
all the furze family succeed admirably in the poorest of soil indeed a
dry gravelly bank would seem to be their favourite haunt
vaccinium
vaccinium corymbosumcanada to carolina and georgia 1765 this is one
of the most beautiful and showy species with dense clusters of small
pinky flowers
v myrtilluswhortleberry bilberry blackberry and blueberry a
native plant with angular stems ovatetoothed leaves and pinkywhite
flowers succeeded by bright bluishblack berries
v pennsylvanicumnew england to virginia 1772 this has rather
inconspicuous flowers and is of greatest value for the autumnal foliage
tints
v vitisidea cowberry flowering box or brawlins a native species
has racemose flowers and red berries
other species that might be included are v canadense v stamineum v
frondosum and v ligustrifolium
the various species of vaccinium are of dwarf or procumbent growth and
only suitable for planting in beds or on rockwork where they will not
be lost sight of they thrive best in soil of a peaty nature
veronica
veronica pinquifolianew zealand 1870 this is one of the hardiest
species but it is of low growth and only suitable for alpine
gardening it is a dwarf spreading shrub with intensely glaucous leaves
and white flowers
v traversiinew zealand 1873 this may be considered as one of the
few species of hardy veronicas it grows about 4 feet high with deep
green leaves arranged in rows and white flowers produced late in
summer it is a very freegrowing shrub of perfect hardihood and one
of if not the best for general planting
the above two species are so far as is at present known the hardiest
in cultivation although there are many kinds that will succeed well
under very favourable conditions and particularly when planted by the
seaside other halfhardy species might include v salicifolia
willowleaved veronica with long narrow leaves and white or
purplish flowers v ligustrifolia privetleaved veronica with spikes
of featherywhite flowers v speciosa with erect spikes of
purplishblue flowers and v andersoni a hybrid form with spikes of
bluishviolet flowers
the dwarf or alpine species might include v cupressoides with
cypresslike foliage v lyallii v carnosula and others but such
hardly come within our scope
viburnum
viburnum acerifoliumdockmackie new england to carolina 1736 this
is one of the handsomest members of the family being of slender growth
and compact and neat in habit it grows to fully 4 feet in height and
is well supplied with neatly threelobed leaves these in the autumn
turning to a deep crimson the flowers too are highly ornamental
being borne in fair sized clusters and white or yellowishwhite it is
a very desirable and beautiful plant quite hardy and of free growth in
any fairly rich soil
v awafukiijapan 1842 this is another rare and beautiful plant of
neat habit and producing an abundance of showy white flowers that are
however seldom produced in this country
v dahuricumdahuria 1785 this is a charming hardy species which in
may and june is covered with numerous umbels of showy white flowers it
forms a rather spreading bush of 6 feet or 8 feet high with gray downy
branches and neat foliage the berries are ovaloblong red at first
but becoming black and faintly scented when fully ripe
v dentatumarrowwood a native of the united states 1763 this can
be recommended as a distinct and beautiful shrub with cymes of white
flowers that are produced in plenty the leaves are dark green smooth
and shining and strongly veined while the bark is ashcoloured and
the berries bright blue
v lantanawayfaring tree europe britain this is a native species
of large bush or almost tree growth with rugose oblong serrulated
leaves and large flat cymes of white flowers appearing in may and
june the whole tree is usually covered with a scaly tomentum while the
fruit is a black flattened drupe
v lentagosheepberry and sweet viburnum north america 1761 this
resembles our native v lantana with dense clusters of white blossoms
succeeded by black berries
v macrocephalum syn v fortuneichina 1844 this is a chinese
species but one that cannot be depended on as hardy enough to withstand
our most severe winters it has very large heads or panicles of white
neutral flowers against a sunny wall and in a cosy nook it may
occasionally be found doing fairly well but it is not to be generally
recommended
v nudumamerican withe rod canada to georgia 1752 this is also
worthy of being included in a selection of these shrubs
v opulusguelder rose a native shrub of great beauty whether in
foliage flower or fruit the leaves are variously lobed or deeply
toothed large and handsome and the flower heads of good size flat
and composed of a number of small flowers the outer only being sterile
individually the flowers are dull and inconspicuous but being produced
in amazing quantity they have a very pleasing and effective appearance
the great bunches of clear pinky berries render a fairsized plant
particularly handsome and attractive and for which alone as also
beauty of autumnal foliage the shrub is well worthy of extensive
culture it grows fully 15 feet high and may frequently be seen as much
through v opulus sterilis snowball tree is one of the commonest
occupants of our shrubberies and a decidedly ornamentalflowering
shrub the large almost globular flower heads hanging from every branch
tip are too wellknown to require description and have made the shrub
one of the most popular in ornamental planting
v pauciflorum is a native of cold moist woods from labrador to alaska
and may best be described as a miniature v opulus it rarely grows more
than 4 feet high with small cymes of flowers that are devoid of the
neutral flowers of that species
v plicatum from japan 1846 is another very beautiful and desirable
shrub of rather dwarf spreading growth and having the leaves deeply
wrinkled plaited and serrated on the margins the flowers resemble
those of the commonly cultivated species but they are rather larger
and of a purer white it is a decidedly ornamental species of easy
growth in any good soil and where not exposed to cold winds
v prunifolium new england to carolina 1731 with plumlike leaves
and pretty white flowers is another freegrowing and beautiful north
american species
v pyrifoliumpearleaved viburnum pennsylvania to new jersey 1812
this is a rarelyseen but very ornamental species with ovalshaped
finelytoothed leaves that are borne on short slightlywinged stalks
about halfaninch long flowers sweetly scented white and in broad
corymbs the feathery appearance of the long projecting stamens each
tipped with a golden anther adding considerably to the beauty of the
flowers
v reticulatum and v laevigatum are rarely seen species but of interest
botanically if not for floral beauty
v tinuslaurustinus south europe 1596 so commonly cultivated a
shrub needs no description here sufficient to say that the handsome
evergreen foliage and pretty pinkywhite flowers assign to it a first
position amongst hardy ornamental flowering shrubs v tinus strictum
has darker foliage than the species is more upright rather more hardy
but not so profuse in the bearing of flowers v tinus lucidum
glossyleaved laurustinus of the several varieties of laurustinus has
the largest foliage finest flowers and altogether is of the most
robust growth it is unfortunately not very hardy probably in that
respect not even equalling the parent plant usually it does not flower
freely neither are the flowers produced so early as in the species but
individually they are much larger it is of tall growth and rarely
forms the neat dense bush for which the common shrub is so admired v
tinus rotundifolium has rounded leaves and v tinus rotundifolium
variegatum has irregularly variegated leaves
vinca
vinca majorbandplant cutfinger and larger periwinkle europe
britain for trailing over treestumps or rockwork this pretty
evergreen shrub has a distinctive value the bright green leaves and
showy deep blue flowers rendering it both conspicuous and ornamental v
major elegantissima is a decided variety the leaves being neatly and
evenly variegated and making the plant of great value for bank or
rockwork decoration
v minorlesser periwinkle this is of much smaller growth than the
preceding and differs too in not having the leafmargins ciliated
the variety v minor florealbo has white flowers those of the normal
plant being pale blue v minor florepleno differs in having double
blue flowers v minor foliis aureis has goldentinted leaves and v
minor foliis argenteis bears silvery mottled and very attractive
foliage
they are all of simple growth succeeding well in somewhat shady
situations and in by no means the richest of soil as they run about
freely and soon cover an extent of ground they are rendered of great
value for a variety of purposes
vitex
vitex agnuscastuschaste tree hemp tree and monks peppertree a
south european shrub 1670 growing from 6 feet to 10 feet high with
digitate leaves that are almost hoary beneath and spikes of small
violet flowers it is not very hardy although in some of the warmer
parts of southern england and ireland fairsized healthylooking
specimens are now and then to be met with as a wall plant however it
succeeds best and for which purpose with its neat foliage and pretty
flowers it is peculiarly suitable
vitis
vitis heterophylla humilifoliaturquoiseberried vine north china and
japan 1868 the leaves of this vine are three to five lobed and the
small flowers freely produced in slightly branching cymes the latter
are succeeded by their most interesting and attractive berries that
ripen in september and october they are pale chinablue marked all
over with very dark specks the stems grow to a height of 4 feet to 8
feet and should be trained against a wall in a sunny position to ripen
the berries the plant is perfectly hardy the variety v heterophylla
variegata is a dwarf lowgrowing plant with variegated leaves and is
used for pot work for covering the ground in subtropical bedding
designs and might be used to great advantage for rambling over large
stones in the rock garden
wistaria
wistaria chinensis syns w sinensis glycine chinensis and g
sinensischinese wistaria china 1816 this is the only species at
all common in gardens and by far the handsomest in cultivation it
justly ranks amongst the most beautiful of hardy climbing shrubs and is
invaluable as a wall plant or for clothing the bare stems of sparsely
foliaged trees the purplishlilac flowers are produced in long
drooping racemes in early summer w chinensis alba has pretty white
flowers w chinensis florepleno has not proved very satisfactory but
when seen at its best which is however but rarely the double flowers
are both beautiful and showy w chinensis variegata has badly
variegated foliage and w chinensis macrobotrys is a plant of great
beauty with very long racemes of pale lavender flowers but they vary a
good deal in colour those of some plants being almost white it is a
very desirable variety and one that when better known is sure to
attract attention
w frutescens syns glycine frutescens and thyrsanthus
frutescensnorth america 1724 this is a very handsome deciduous
climbing species from north america the flowers which appear towards
autumn are bluish purple and fragrant and borne in erect racemes it
is quite hardy and equally suitable with the chinese species for using
as a wall covering w frutescens magnifica is an improved form of the
species
w japonicajapan a bushlike species bearing white flowers but it
is rarely seen in cultivation it is however quite hardy and succeeds
well in the bush state at kew
w multijugajapan 1874 resembles somewhat our commonlycultivated
species and has pale purple flowers arranged in long racemes it is a
very ornamental and desirable species but the flowers are not borne in
great quantity
the wistarias are of simple culture but succeed best in rather rich
alluvial soil and where protection from cold winds is provided
xanthoceras
xanthoceras sorbifoliachina 1870 an extremely pretty flowered and
handsome leaved shrub but owing to its late introduction is not yet
well known so far it has proved itself perfectly hardy in this country
there being specimens at wide distances apart that have stood uninjured
through our past severe winters
the leaves are pale green and pinnate somewhat resembling those of the
rowan tree flowers five petalled creamy white sometimes very slightly
tinged with flesh colour with a coppery red or violetpurple centre
and disposed in racemes when fully expanded they are an inch across
and somewhat reflexed it flowers early in april with the appearance of
the leaves the blooms being produced in great abundance in spikelike
clusters fully seven inches long and succeeded by a small green
pearlike fruit this is one of the most distinct and handsome of
recently introduced shrubs and will when more widely disseminated be
largely planted for purely ornamental purposes it grows from 10 feet to
about 15 feet high
xanthorhiza
xanthorhiza apiifoliayellowroot pennsylvania 1776 a small growing
shrub with yellow creeping roots from which suckers are thrown up
profusely the leaves are irregularly pinnate and the minute flowers

beautiful plant with numerous leaves arranged in a dense rosette and
from 1 foot to 2 feet long by 2 inches broad flower scape rising to 5
feet or 6 feet in height and bearing numerous flowers that are each
about 2 inches deep there is a beautiful variegated form of this
species named y filamentosa variegata and one with much narrower
leaves than the typical species and known as y filamentosa
angustifolia
y gloriosathe mound lily united states 1596 this is another
wellknown hardy species with long sharppointed leaves and a
handsome much branched scape of flowers that are each about 2 inches
deep there are several varieties differing in colour of foliage
including y gloriosa glaucescens with decidedly glaucous foliage y
gloriosa superba with rigid leaves and a shorter and denser flower
scape and another with variegated leaves y gloriosa recurvifolia is
usually dwarfer in the stem than the type and more inclined to branch
than the other species and less rigid with recurving leaves that are
not so sharppointed the flower panicle is large and very much
branched
the yuccas all do well if planted in light loam of good quality
zelkova
zelkova acuminata syns z japonica and planera acuminatajapan

cassinaefoliasouth united states 1800 this is a distinct and
pretty hardy species a native of swampy lowlying districts it grows
about four feet high and bears pure white bellshaped
lilyofthevalley like flowers in great abundance during the summer in
too dry situations it becomes sparse of foliage and unhappy but grows
and flowers freely in light peaty soil z speciosa pulverulenta is a
very desirable variety the whole plant stems foliage and flowers
being of a pleasing light gray or white colour individually the flowers
are larger than those of the species
addenda
exochorda
exochorda grandiflora syn spiraea grandifloranorth china this
handsome shrub forms a much branched spreading bush about 4 feet to 6
feet high and flowers abundantly in may the habit is similar to that
of a shrubby spiraea but the pure white flowers are as large as those
of some of the species of cherry and quite unlike those of any known
species of spiraea the flowers are liable to injury sometimes from late
spring frosts but the plant itself is quite hardy as a bush on the
lawn it is nevertheless highly ornamental and desirable
myricaria

messrs james veitch  sons ltd
can supply the following rare and beautiful
japanese magnolias
which are among the finest recent additions to the british arboretum
and especially desirable for the lawn and park whether as single
specimens or in groups
magnolia hypoleuca
one of the largest of the deciduous magnolias the flowers are creamy
white measuring from six to seven inches in diameter when fully
expanded deliciously fragrant and produced in large numbers on the
adult tree and even on young plants their appearance is quite a usual
occurence in the autumn the tree is loaded with cones of brilliant
scarlet fruit six to eight inches long the large obovate leaves are
often a foot in length and half as much broad our mr james h veitch
during his recent journeys in japan frequently met with it at
considerable elevations and considers it the finest flowering tree in
that country
first class certificate royal horticultural society
magnolia parviflora
a smaller tree than the preceding and one of the finest lawn trees
ever introduced it has a handsome deciduous foliage the leaves are of
ovateoblong shape rather sharply pointed and from five to six inches
long the flowers which are freely produced are smaller than those of
m hypoleuca and with more oval segments of which the outer three
are light purplish pink and the inner three milkwhite
an excellent coloured plate of this species is published in the
garden of december 8th 1883 page 508
magnolia watsonii
a very fine magnolia resembling the preceding in habit and foliage
but in its flowers approaching nearer to m hypoleuca these are from
five to six inches in diameter cream colour on the inside and
exhaling a pleasant perfume like that of calycanthus the broad ring of
incumbent yellow stamens with bloodred filaments is a conspicuous
ornament of the expanded flower
a beautiful coloured plate of this species is given in the botanical
magazine tab 7157
well established young plants of each of the above magnolias 7s 6d
and 10s 6d each
