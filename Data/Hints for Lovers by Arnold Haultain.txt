plea confession and avoidance
   aphorism are seldom couched in such terms that they should be
taken as they sound precisely or according to the widest extent of
signification but do commonly need exposition and admit exception
otherwise frequently they would not only clash with reason and
experience but interfere thwart and supplant one another

the very essence of an aphorism is that slight exaggeration which makes
it more biting whilst less rigidly accurate

i on girls
a pearl a girl
browning
there are of course girls and girls yet at heart they are pretty much
alike  in age naturally they differ wildly  but this is a thorny
subject  suffice it to say that all men love all girlsthe maid of
sweet sixteen equally with the maid of untold age
  
there is something exasperatingly somethingorotherish about girls  and
they know itwhich makes them more somethingorotherish stillthere
is no other word for it
  
a girl is a complicated thing  it is made up of clothes smiles a
pompadour things of which space and prudence forbid the enumeration
here  these things by themselves do not constitute a girl which is
obvious nor is any one girl without these things which is not too
obvious where the things end and the girl begins many men have tried to
find out
many girls would like to be menexcept on occasions  at least so they
say but perhaps this is just a part of their somethingorotherishness
why they should want to be men men cannot conceive  men pale before
them grow hot and cold before them run before them and after them
swear by them and at them and a bit of a chit of a thing in short
skirts and lislethread stockings will twist ablebodied males round her
little finger
it is an open secret that girls are fonder of men than they are of one
anotherwhich is very lucky for the men
girls differ and the same girl is different at different times  when
she is by herself she is one thing when she is with other girls she is
another thing  when she is with a lot of men she is a third sort of
thing  when she is with a man    but this baffled even agur the son
of jakeh
as a rule a man prefers a girl by herself  this is natural  and yet is
said that you cannot have too much of a good thing  if this were true a
bevy of girls would be the height of happiness  yet some men would
sooner face the bulls of bashan
some foolish menprobably poetshave sought for and asserted the
existence of the ideal girl  this is sheer nonsense there is no such
thing  and if there were she could not compare with the real girl the
girl of flesh and bloodwhich as some one ought to have said are
excellent things in woman
other men equally foolish have regarded girls as playthings  i wish
these men had tried to play with them  they would have found that they
were playing with fire and brimstone  yet the veriest spitfire can be
wondrous sweet
sweet  yes  on the whole a girl is the sweetest thing known or
knowable  on the 6 whole of this terrestrial sphere nature has produced
nothing more adorable than the highspirited highbred girlof this
she is quite awareto our cost i speak as a man  the consequence is
her price has gone up and man has to pay high and pay all sorts of
thingsices sweets champagne drives churchgoings and sometimes
spotcash
men are always wishing they knew all about girls  it is a precious good
thing that they dontnot that this is in any way disparaging to the
girls  the fact is
a girl is an infinite puzzle and it is this puzzle that among other
things tickles the men and rouses their curiosity
what a man doesnt know about a girl would fill a saratoga trunk what
her does know about her would go into her workbox
  
the littlest girl is a little women  no boy knows thisand precious
few grown up men  thus
many a grown up man plays with a girl then finds himself in love with
her  as to the girl
always the girl knows whether the play is leading  she probably chooses
the game
  
very late in life does a man learn the truth and significance of that
ancient proverb that kissing goes by favour  for
the masculine mind is the slave of law and justice
aphrodite never heard of law or justice she was born at sea  that is to
say
few are the men who at some time in their lives have not wondered at the
vagaries of girlish complaisance the foolish the neerdowell the
bully the careless the cruelit is to these often that a girls
caress is given  and
curiously enough that is curiously enough as it seems to purblind
lawloving manshould the favored one be openly convicted that
alters not one whit his statue with the girl for
a girl having given her heart never recalls it not wholly she may
regret she never recoils  in other words
to the man of her own free lawless choice a girl is always loyal to
subsequent and subordinate attachments she is dutiful  so
even the renegade if loved by a girl will be upheld by that girl
through thick and thinsecretly it may be for often the girl
nevertheless devotedly and only under compulsion will he listen to the
detractor he may desert her or if he sticks to her he may beat her
no matter he holds her heart in the hollow of his hand  but but
few things mystify poor lawabiding man than this that the central the
profoundest the most portentous puzzle of the universethe weal of woe
of two highaspiring muchenduring youthful human souls should be the
sport of what seems to him the veriest and merest chance
  
the unconscious search of sweet sixteen is for in mathematical language
which will not sophisticate her the integral of loveyet
in the short years between sixteen and twenty a girls love will undergo
rapid and startling developments
  
a girl with lots of brothers has more chances of matrimony than a girl
with none she knows more of men especially of their weaknesses and
idiosyncrasies  and
to know the weaknesses and idiosyncrasies of men is perhaps a wifes
chief task unless it be to put up with them
  
often enough the freckled and fringrant girl wins over the professional
beauty
  
sometimes grownup girls are just as shy as little onesand for the
same reasons because there is no one who knows how to play with them
girls often play with love as if it were one of the amusements of life
but a day comes when love proves itself the most sensuous thing on earth
 and
a girl is quick to discover the kind of love that is required of her  as
a rule
many a girl who has been sore put to it to prove herself wholehearted
for of course
always every suitor expects whole heartedness and this every girl
instinctively knows  indeed
is not a halfhearted love or a halfhearted acceptress of love a
contradiction in terms
  
a certain measure of the sophisticated or unsophistication of a youthful
damsel may be found in her manner o f receiving the attentions of a
stranger in a station different from her own
young women themselves but rarely unsophisticated view with a certain
pitying sort of curiosity unsophisticatedness in men  and
a young mans unsophisticatedeness it is a great delight to a woman to
eradicate  yet
a girl regards with complex emotions the man who has blossomed under the
genial warmth of her rays the flattery to own powers is counterbalanced
by the evidence of lack of power in him
  
a girl thinks she detects flippancy in seriousness a woman thinks she
detects seriousness in flippancy
  
what would be conduct decidedly risqu in a city miss is often innocent
playfulness in a country maid
  
between the ages of sixteen and eighteen girls play with love as if it
were a doll very soon after twenty they discover it is a dynamo  this
is why
an early and clandestine engagement often works more havoc than
happiness for
either one of the parties to the concealed compact receives or pays
attention which perturb the other or a subsequent and acknowledged
lover looks askance at the previous entanglement  since even if
a clandestine engagement as is usually the case is merely a flirtation
with the emoluments which accompany a promise to marry those emoluments
are not nice things for a subsequent and avowed lover whether masculine
or feminine to think upon  lastly
a laxity with regard to the claims of courtship is apt to breed a laxity
with regard to the claims of wedlock  in short
flirtations like clandestine engagements are an affront to love
accordingly
to the engagementring should be as attached as much importance as to the
weddingring  indeed
a difficult and a delicate path it is that a girl has to tread through
lifeand often enough a dangerous yet with extraordinary deftness she
treads it  she must win her a mate yet has to pretend that the mate
wins her  she makes believe to be captured yet has herself to be intent
on the chase  to be wooed and wedded is the law of her being yet not
for one moment dares she to exhibit too great an alacrity to obey that
law for she knows instinctively that an easy victory prognosticates a
fickle victor  is she abundantly endowed with the very attributes that
make for wifeand motherhood a strong and swaying passion and an
affection unbounded she must hold them in leash with exemplary patience
for alas are they given the rein for a single passing moment instead
of being accounted unto her for righteousness they work her ruin  she
must win her one man and she must win him for life but she cannot pick
or choose for she must wait to be asked
if she make test of many admirers she is described as a flirt if
conscientious and demure she await her fate a desirable fate is by no
means assured
in truth it seems that too often a girl must dissemblehateful as
dissemblance in men  tis a hard road indeed that a girl has to travel
to win her a fellowfarer for life she must go out of her way to
accommodate so many travelers and this one is lured by this and that
one by that and another by something unnoticed by the throng  but an
she dissembles one iota too much her fellowfarers look askance and he
who eventually joins her for good upbraids her for that by which she won
dissemblance is indeed at once the boon and the bane of a girl without
it she thinks to be overlooked often enough a preposterous assumption
with it she is looked upon too much  and always
always a girl has to pretend that never did she descend to dissemblance
which nevertheless is sometimes absolutely true for
just now and then there happens that miracle of miracles where their
flames up in the man and their flames up in the maid in both at once
unaided and unlookedfor that divine and supramundane spark which
smolders lambent in every youthful breast when maid and man take mutual
fire at touch of hands and look of eyesfire lit at that vestal altar
which knows no source and burns for aye
ii on men
duskolon esti to thremma anthropus
plato
for man the overgrown boy life has commonly two and only two sides
work and play  happy he who has for a helpmate one who possesses the
faculty of increasing a zeal for the first and of adding a zest to the
second  wherein o woman thou mayest happily find the twofold secret
of thy lifework  for
man is a greedy animal he wants all or nothing  and fortunately for
him
women tacitly extol mans greed they will not be shared any more than
they will share
there is something canine in the masculine nature like a dog over a
bone it snarls at the very approach of a rival
  
it is curious but it is true that proud man becomes prouder andmore
curious stillat the same time humbler when weak woman gives him
somethinga look a smile a locket her hair a kiss herself
  
the greater a mans faith in himself the greater his mistress hers in
him  and perhaps the greater his mistress her faith in a man the
greater his in himself  for
a womans faith in a man works wonders
  
a man to whom a woman cannot look up she cannot love  yet
it is marvelous how a woman contrives to find something to look up to in
a man
  
many men forget the artistic tendency of the feminine temperament a
tendency which shows itself in many waystheir love of pretty things
of pretty ways and of pretty words  from which three alone we may
deduce the rule that
when with the woman he admires and whose admiration he seeks a man
cannot be too careful of his dress his speech and his manners
  
a believer in woman is a believer in good  and vice versa and mutatis
mutandis
  
mans standard of value of a woman is usually determined by the scale of
his own emotions  that is to say
the pedestal upon which a man places a woman a man always puts a woman
upon a pedestal is a pedestal erected solely by the effect upon himself
of her charms
  
a man may boast himself invincible by men never by woman
  
the ladykiller is always an object of attraction to ladies even to
those whom he makes no attempt to slay
  
it may perhaps be a thing as unreasonable as certainly it is
indisputable that however much wild oats a man may himself sow he
invariably entertains a very peculiar objection to any woman near or dear
to him entering upon this particular branch of agriculture
  
he is a fool who does not bear himself before his ladylove as a prince
among men
  
some men are so gallant that they will never be outdone by the woman who
encourages them  but it often leads to strange embarrassments and
entanglements
  
few things terrify a man more than the knowledge of a womans ability to
make her emotionswhen if ever he arrives at it
  
that is a very silly man who thing she can play one woman off against
another  for
in matters of emotional finesse the masculine instance is nowhere it is
blinded befogged befooled at every turn
heaven help the man who is dragged into a quarrel between two wrathful
ladies
  
three things there benay fourwhich man can never be sure how a
greatsoever his acumen his astuteness or his zeal a woman a race
horse a patent and the moneymarket  they defy both faith and fate
they should be the recreations not the resources of life and he is a
fool who stakes more than a portion of his substance on any one of them
  
what a paltry thing after all is man man uncomplemented by woman left
to himself he stagnates linked with a woman he risesor sinks  a
gentle touch stimulates him a confiding heart makes of him a new
creature  under the rays of feminine sympathy he expands who else would
remain inert  fame may allure him friends encourage him fortune cause
him a momentary smile but only woman makes him and fame friends
fortune all are naught if there be not at his side a sharer of his weal
a man will strive for fortune strip himself for friends scour the earth
for fame but were there no woman in the world to be won not one of
these things would he do
  
iii on women
ehret die fanen
schiller
from woman who ere she be there seems to emanate a potency ineffable
to manimpalpable invisible divine  it lies not in beauty or
grace not even in manner or mein and it requires neither wiles nor
artifice  it is not the growth of long and intimate acquaintance for
often it acts spontaneously and at once and neither the woman who
possesses it nor the man who succumbs to it can give it a name  for to
say that it consists in the effluence or influence of personality or
temperament of affinity or passion of sympathy or charm is to say
nothing save that we know not what it is   all unknown to herself it
wraps its owner round with airs the which to breathe uplifts the spirit
and yet may be perturbs the heart of man  even its effects are
recondite and obscure  it allures but how it allures now man shall
tell  it impels but to what does not appear  it rouses all manner of
hopes stirs sleeping ambition and desires and aspirations unappeasable
but for what purport or to what end none stays to inquire   it incites
sometimes it enthralls it innervates it exhaults  under its spell
reason is flung to the winds and matters of great mundane moment are
trivial and of no account for it bewilders the wit and snatches the
judgment of sane and rational men  it is most powerful in youth it is
most powerful upon youth yet some retain it till far on in years and no
age but feels its swaya veiled and mysterious force sometimes
daemonical often divine at once the delight and the despair of man
after all
the man who declares he understands women declares his folly  for
if woman were not such a mystery she would not be such an attraction
for again
what is known is ignored  but woman need have no cause for
apprehension besides
men may be classified women never  this is why
generalizing in the case of women is useless since
woman is a species of which every woman is a variety  and every man must
make up his mind to this that
every woman is a study in herself  however
if women were comprehensible to men men and women would be friends not
lovers but the race is safe the simple fact is that
womanliness is the supreme attraction in however fair or however frail a
personality it is embodied   and
the sacred function of all womanhood is to kindle in man the divine spark
by means 30 of the mystic flame that burns ever in the vestal breast
  
every true womans orbit is determined by two forces love and duty
which is another way of saying that
women like the lark are true to the kindred points of heaven and home
but
it is only when the two foci are coincident and identical that her orbit
becomes the perfect circle and her home becomes her heaven
  
a womans heart is an unfathomable ocean nothing ever filled it no one
ever plumbed it  at the surface are glancing waves or flying spume or
it may be raging billows beneath are silent depths invisible to man  a
thousand streams flow into it in vain  towards varying coastlines it
bears itself variously here placid and content there dashing furious
but none ever stamped his marked upon its brim and always it remains the
refluent reluctant sea  of it man knows only the waves that break or
ripple at his feet it betrays no 31 secrets it asks not to be
understood  storm and calm but stir or still its surface and what
things it hides forever engulfed no one may learn   subtle yet mighty
an eternal and entrancing mystery to man
a mans heart is the enclosing shore measurable impressionable
definite and overt thinking to house that sea shaping it over looking
it and staying and governing its tides  yet changed by it crumbling
before it yielding to it at once its guardian and its slave  yet
perhaps
the placidest of seas is that which is wholly landlocked
   
women apparently were made for men men for themselves  certainly
men seem to carry out this design of nature that they should be
ministered to by women
  
a woman asks a woman questions in order to discover something  she asks
a man questions in order to discover the man
  
he last thing that a woman will risk is her personal appearance  which
is saying a good deal for
a woman will risk an interview at an unseasonable hour but not in an
unseasonable frock
  
never never take a woman au pied de la letter
  
womens rights are to be loved
  
womens duties are to love
  
there is always something sovereign and monarchial about a woman like a
queens her wishes are her commands  and
in matrimony womans sovereignty is not abdicated  by no means it is
only transformed from an absolute into a constitutional monarch  she
acts then by and with the advice of her first lord  this is the ideal
state
  
womans true function as a citizen in this world is to spur men on to
high and noble action  and this quite unconsciously she does
womans true function as a woman in the world is to evoke mans most
fervid emotions and at the same time to keep them at their highest
level  and this she also doesperhaps not quite so unconsciously
  
they err who call women illogical  feminine logic is inexorable but it
proceeds per saltum  it is man who has laboriously to reason step by
step
  
the most wayward woman craves control to let a woman have her own way is
interpreted by her as indifference  and
the surest way to fail to please a woman is to let her do what she
pleases
  
woman is born to acting as the sparks fly upward  and
what a woman really is nobody knows least of all herself
to see a woman as she really is one must see her with her babe  for
it is curious but it is true that not even before the passionate and
accepted lover to whom she has utterly devoted herself can a woman bare
her heart as can she to her babe  perhaps we may go so far as to say
that
motherhood always partially eclipses wifehood
when the child comes the man stands aside  for
it is not within the capability of man to evoke or to develop the
totality of woman  there are feminine potentialities he is powerless to
awake  there is a portion of womanliness always hidden from him  to her
babe alone she opens the innermost recesses of her soul  for him she
wears no masks affect no accent plays no part  even her features take
on a different and unique expression before the offspring of her womb
never is she more womanly never so strong never so quite never so
selfcontained never so completely herself and never so beautify when
bending over her helpless infant son   and naturally for say what one
will
motherhood is the goal of womanhood  and
howsoever she comes by it a womans burthen is always to her that holy
thing  so
no one knows what a woman is like till she is a mother in other words
motherhood reveals womanhood and be it remembered
there be childless womenboth spinsters and wiveswho could mother
mankind in their bosoms  such women wield great influence  for
many a mere man there is has owed his all to a motherly woman
  
nor speech not restore nor expression of feature nor all combined
will ever reveal the real feelings of a woman  to unbosom herself is
impossible to woman  do not expect it for
definite and accurate utterance is not given to woman
  
the chief business of woman is first to get married second to get
others married
  
it is difficult to say which have played the greater havoc among men the
women with too much conscience or the woman with none
  
when a woman repulses beware  when a woman beckons be warier
  
woman are always prepared for emergencies
  
with woman tact and jealousy rarely go hand in hand tact and spite
never
the only instance in which a womans tact is apt to be at fault is in
detraction of a woman whom she regards as her rival
the instance in which a womans tact is seen as its best is in deploying
the men who she knows are rivals for her hand  and usually
when a woman has more than one admirer she not only deploys them but
tries to make them advance en echelon  for
few things disconcert a woman more than a multiple and simultaneous
attack delivered front a front  but
the way in which a woman will maneuver her attackers is marvelous
  
they say a woman cannot argue  hear her explain an indiscretion
  
an independent woman is a contradiction in terms  for
womans chief want is to feel that she is wanted  therefore it is that
with women cruelty is more easily borne than coldness  indeed
it is astonishing how much downright cruelty a woman will stand from the
man she loves or has loved  on the other hand
melancholy also attracts women  naturally
women are made to soothe to pity to comfort to delight  therefore it
is that
to see a strong man in a weak womans arms is a sight which should arouse
not our laughter but our1 envy  so it does
1 common gender
  
let not the simpleton think a woman will sympathize with his simplicity
no woman is a simpleton
what women admire is a subtle combination of forcefulness and gentleness
if a woman has to choose between forcefulness and gentleness always she
will sacrifice the latter  and
it is astonishing to what lengths forcefulness can go without endangering
a womans admiration  if it sweeps her off her feet    well
in nothing does a woman so clearly exhibit the inherent femininity of her
nature as in the delight with which at the bottom of her heart she
recalls moments when she has been swept off her feet   she may sigh over
them but
generally a womans sighs are by no means those of remorse
a woman never brings pure reason to bear upon her actions she acts by
sentiment 40 and she judges her acts by sentiment  this is why
even when a woman has deceived and betrayed she does not regard herself
culpable  always she says to herself she was driven to it and
therefore she is blameless  accordingly
a penitent woman is rare
even when a man with his socalled superior reason thinks he has proved
her wrong at the bottom of her heart she knows herself right
  
many have been the discussions as to womans most powerful weapon  the
simple fact is she is armed cap a pie2 indeed
every woman is a sort of feminine proteus not only in the myriad shapes
she assumes but also in her amenability to nothing but superior force
women form perhaps where men are concerned the single exception to the
rule that in union there is strength  one woman often enough is
irrepressible two be the second her own mother break the charm an
association of women is the feeblest of forces
2 cf cowper
they are all women and they dart
like porcupines from every part
anacreontics
  
all women are rivals  and this they never forget  consequently
mistrust a truce between hostile ladies
  
amongst women modesty is of infinitely more potent influence than is
ability  yet
to a womans modesty ability is a wonderfully enhancing setting  and
modesty is the most complex and the most varied of emotions  perhaps
when modesty and frailty go hand in hand there is no more delectable
combination known to men and aphrodite has not the subtle charm of a
cynthia  perhaps this is why such
a wondrous halo of romance hangs about the name of a heloise of a
marguerite of a marianna alcoforado of a concetta of afragola of a
catalina of robert le diables helena of isolde of lucia of bologna
the enchantress of ottaviano of francesca of guenevere of the sweet
seventeenyear old novice of andouillets margarita the fille who was
rosy as the morn of the beguine who nursed captain shandy of the
fille de chamber who walked along the quai de conti with yorick of
ameilia viviani the inspirer of shellys most ecstatic lyric of
drydens masqueloving lucretia  for after all
is the star any the less starry to the rapt stargazer when he finds it
to be a tremulous planet
cynthia may have blushed in heaven bit did the blush make her any less
lovely to the latmian
only in the clear and unclouded pool is the star undimmed embosomed
  
they say a woman is capricious  but the consistency of womans
capriciousness is only exceeded by the capriciousness of mans
consistency
man calls woman capricious simply because he is too stupid to comprehend
the laws by which she is swayed woman does not call man capricious
the inference is obvious
  
to women the profoundest mysteries of the universe give place to two
things a lover and a babybut perhaps these are the profoundest
mysteries of the universe
  
how many women there be who deeming themselves fitted to be the consorts
of kings yet comport themselves dutifully as the wives of wastrels and
indeed
given beauty cleverness and grace 44 there is no position to which a
woman could not aspire for
being woman she is ex officio queen
  
speak to a woman disparagingly of her sexshe is up in arms
speak to her disparagingly of a member of her sexwell she will not
be up in arms  the reason for her bellicosity in the former case is the
fact that
a woman always interprets abstract disparagement of her sex personally
and she is perfectly right
  
it is not only the woman who cannot be accounted quite as stainless as
the stars that sometimes trade on their charms
  
when a strongsouled woman wholly and unreservedly loves her love will
go to lengths passing the comprehension of man  for
women prefer an despot to a dependent
  
it is marvelous to what a pitch of demureness features by nature that the
most coquettish can be set
a mans features are often a clue to his character a womans rarely
so it comes about that
the owner of a seraphic face is often owner of a temper satanic
nevertheless
often enough a spice of diablerie in a woman at once enhances all her
charms
it is indeed fortunate for the men that so many women are unaware of the
power of their charms
  
a woman would much rather you lied to her concerning herself than that
you told her something unpleasant to hear
  
some women seem to be envious of some mens familiarity with immorality
  
it is by woman that a woman will be first suspected and it is by a woman
she will be last forgiven  the last thing a woman will ask you for is
your esteem  and yet
cast a slur upon a womans character and you are considered indiscreet
cast a slur upon a womans personal appearance and you are considered
culpable
  
fashion is a womans sole law  and
the surest evidence of strongmindedness in woman is to fly in the fact
of fashion
  
ridicule is womans keenest weapon it is the poisoned arrow in her
quiver  well is it for the men that she never or so rarely has
recourse to it
  
a woman is quick to discern the quality of the admiration bestowed upon
her
  
no one not even herself knows what a woman will do nextdoubtless
this is trite  but it is true as trite  yet men rarely find it out till
late in lifeand forget it as soon as found out
  
a woman can say more in a sigh than a man can say in a sermon
  
nothing piques a woman so much as indifference to her favors
indifference to her undiscovered passion she quite otherwise regards
  
the woman knows the male heart probably better than does it itself   she
knows above all things that to hold that heart she must never wholly
satisfy it  and manyand multiformand marvelousare the ruses by
which she accomplishes that end  and yet
women there are who firmly believe that were they to try they could
enthrall any man beyond possibility of extrication  and 48 so perhaps
they could but the achievement would require as much unscrupulousness as
it would seductiveness
the seductive and unscrupulous woman is hatred of women
  
under the gaze of a group of men whom she knows that her brilliancy
dazzles a woman like the snowclad hearth sparkles
under the gaze of a man by whom she knows she is passionately desired
like the same earth under the lordly sun she melts
  
all women think they can cozen men few women think they can cozen women
  
the women who perturb men most are those who combine too effectively
adorableness with desirableness
  
as in nature so in humanity flight on the part of the lady is not
always symbol of unwillingness of pursuit  on the other hand
feminine audacity by no means betokens feminine immodesty
feminine obduracy is invincible by man  luckily it is rare
  
men call women variable did she not vary men would tire  this women
instinctively know
women rightly dislike and disgust variability in men  for
women like best to be liked to lead gives them but paltry and temporary
pleasure  though this they do not always instinctively know or if
they do they conceal their knowledge  and
variability is incompatible with leadership
  
how delicately a loving woman reproves how defiantly an unloving
  
how many lonely womenmarried and unmarriedthe world contains only
these lonely women know
  
the feminine mtier par excellence is to allure  and
the subtle and elaborate means by which women will devise to intensify
the lure passes the comprehension o f men yet
in all ages to make herself attractive was as right and proper for the
woman as to make himself feared was for the man  besides
with women the art of attracting has long since become second nature
  
women are quick to recognize a rake  for
a rake always rouses curiosity never aversion
  
a worsted woman always either silently or volubly calls down a curse
upon her successful rivaland t is a curse that too often fails
many women handicap other women and they handicap them in multifarious
ways  probably the one most frequently used is lavishness of favors
the woman who is lavish of favors is hated of her stricter sisters but
before these what an air of bravado she wears
  
as a rule women are far better readers of character than are men  a
woman will often startle a man by her penetrating insight into character
and
many a man has been put on his guard by female institution
  
the fragilest woman will be ill content with suppressed embraces and
the ablestbodied woman loves being petted  even
a prude is a shy coquette
  
the man who judges of a woman by her letters is a foolher gesture
will contain more matter than her journal  besides
the woman who could punctuate could reason
  
the debut of a younger sister evokes mixed emotions
  
the prayeruttered or unexpressedof many an undowered young woman
is may a moneyed man fall in love with me  and she is not always
overcareful to add and may i fall in love with that moneyed man
  
if the new woman 3 turns out to be a fitter companion for men than
the old no man will complain of her novelty  yet
men regard the advent of the new woman rather askance  why because
to judge from certain feminine utterances the new woman seems more
inclined to aim at rivalry than at companionship with man
however there need be no fears as to the result since
such is the mysterious potency of womanhood that whether new or old
woman will always lead man captive  besides
as every new variety of fashion in dress seems becoming to women so it
is probable every variety of fashion in manners will become them also
but probably
the phrase the new woman is not unlike the phrase the new chemistry
the materials are the same what is new is the nomenclature
3 a phrase and not much more than a phrase much in vogue in europe
and america in the last two decades of the nineteenth century of the area
known as christian
  
a womans peccadilloes are generally worse than a mans at all events
they are more reprobated
   
abashment intensifies a womans love for him so making her abashed  and
there is a shame that is sweeter than joy  as
there is a fear more tremulous than delight for
mastery is a womans standard of man  and
there is an element of the freest and frankest savagery in the most
refined and spiritual of women  how otherwise
can any one explain the extraordinary fable of selene and pan4
and man
but that man was ever a savage  it may be added that
the defenselessness of woman is a conventional fiction she can avert an
attack by a look she can terminate a siege by a taunt
4 though browning tried  see dramatic idyls pan and luna
  
solomon has objurgated the invincibly garrulous woman  the invincibly
taciturn woman is so rare as to have escaped objurgation  yet she too is
a terror to men
  
every woman is suspicious and jealous of any woman that opens a mans
eyes even though she knows that
never was there a woman who could and would deliberately wholly enlighten
a man
and yet marvelous and curious amongst things curious and marvelous
will but a woman fling artifice to the winds and look and act and say as
great nature promptswildly willfully wantonlythat woman will
captivate as no feminine wiles will ever captivate
  
if the man were worth it many a woman would dispense with the marriage
ceremony  for
ah lovelovelovegiven love what else is needed unfortunately
love can never be sure of itselfmuch less of anything else
accordingly
the marriage contract is a device on the part of the community to provide
for the preservation of the home it makes the parties promise fidelity
but
precious few are the men who are worth the risking  unfortunately
more women succumb to strength of will than to strength of character
neither in general are women overcurious to enquire whether the
strength of character
neither in general are women over curious to enquire whether the
strength of the masculine will makes for good or for evil
so long as the masculine will overmaster the feminine the feminine mind
is satisfied  of course there are exceptions but as a rule
womenwhether young or old married or single strongminded or weak
are never happier than when they can depend on a man  accordingly
the lover or the husband who is weaker than and depends upon the woman
will some day rue his weakness and dependence  and yet
to see a strong male at her feetthat is exquisite to the woman  so
exquisite that
it is with difficulty that a woman refrains from exhibiting a mans
servitude to others   on the other hand
there is an element of intimidation in a resplendent woman  and of this
she is awarehence perhaps her power
  
a woman will attain her ends by adroit finesse where a man would blunder
into open hostility  and
it is well that man should blind his eyes to feminine wiles since
always a woman kindly pretends oblivion of masculine blunders
  
the woman whose tastes and refinements are above her station is
in pitiable plight she is too fastidious to espouse the men who would
marry her the men she would marry she rarely meets  for
the only thing that to love is insupportable is vulgarity  since
love romantic love the efflorescence and bloom of life is besmirched
unless tenderly touched
  
to generalize passes the wit of woman but in penetration she is
preternatural
  
what fascinates a woman is the man who unwittingly attracts her against
her will  but such a man rouses a combination of emotions comprehensible
only by women
  
a womans answer to an insuperable argument is a look  and a  most
cogent answer it is  indeed
speech is a womans least effective weapon rarely if ever does she
resort to it
in the affairs of life as in the affairs of love where men be
concerned it is upon her personality that she relies not upon her
speech whether written or uttered
her personal appearance is to a woman what his personal honor is to a
man it must be immaculate constant with the fashion of the hour and
strictly in accordance with her or his status in society  accordingly
dress and demeanorthese form the code of feminine ethics  even
deception on the part of a woman is merely diplomacy
women deceive only be cause man is too blind to see  that is to
say
since man in past ages has never allowed woman either freedom of action
or frankness of speech it is not to be expected of her that she should
be all at once an adept in their useto her credit be it said that
generally a woman deceives only n order to arouse or to retain the
admiration of man  for example
many a woman has surreptitiously made love to the manand few are the
men who have detected it
  
why this woman fascinates all who come within the sphere of their
influence and that women does not no earthly sage will ever know  as
well ask what makes one man a napoleon another a poltroon  so too
it is impossible for a woman to say i will be loved as it is for a man
to say i will be obeyedperhaps
love and power are divine miracles
  
at the risk of treading on delicate ground ground off which i shall be
hooted by the modern woman i venture to say that
the idea that a woman is the property of the man of her choice rail as
it as the woman may has not yet been ousted from the feminine mindand
heart  indeed
so firmly implanted in the feminine breast is the idea of the ownership
of her by the man that it is to the man who assumes and exercises
ownership that she clings  this is why
a woman easily changes her allegiance since
allegiance to a woman means loyalty to the man who assumes and
exercises ownership over her
let a man who a fractional part of a second evince the shadow of a doubt
of his proprietorshipat once he undermines a womans allegiance
consequently
it is folly for men to express amazement at the ease with which  a woman
will transfer herself and her affections
a woman will transfer herself bodily over and over again but only
because the previous owner lightly esteemed or weakly maintained his
ownership  as a matter of fact
in pristine days woman was naturally and necessarily the property the
chattel of the man marriage was not then a matrimonial syndicate of
two marriage meant that a woman sought a provider a supporter a
defender the man a mate for his delight his comfort and his solace a
keeper op is cave or hut a mother and nurse for his heirs  and
provision support and defense being in pristine days matters of
strength prowess or cunning naturally and necessarily pristine man 65
gained him and kept him a mate by strength prowess or cunning he
regarded that mate as his by right of force not as a partner in a
compact  and
the most complicated of modern communities has no whit altered the
relationship of man to mate conceal though it may the origin and history
of marriage  finally
no woman at the bottom of her heart has any objection to being owned
indeed though no woman would say it a man may
every woman at the bottom of her heart delights to be owned and tacitly
and secretly seeks the man who she thinks will glory in that ownership
and keep his property safenot only from material harms but from
temptations to changes of ownership in which last little fact lies a
curious truth
women like to be defended against themselves  in this little matter men
and women differ that any other man should dare for  one instant to
covet or alienate 5 that most precious of his possessions his mate
nothing rouses to a higher pitch mans unappeasable wrath than this
against the man so daring a womans wrath is never roused rather she
regards him as one having discernment and his daring is a commendable
compliment to herself  in fine and in short
allegiance to a man on the part of a woman means in her eyes loyalty
to him who properly exercises the right of ownership  in simple truth
a woman gives herself to a man to the man who proves himself worthy the
gift she is true
and this is why women all women even the new ones love being petted
and admired and made much of all their lives this but proves the
possession of the gift to be appreciated  besides
the male is the dominant animalnot necessarily in his cave or his hut
by no means but in the stress and struggle of life and women tacitly
though never openly look up to and admire this dominance even when
exercised over themselves since this in turn proves the masterfulness
the worth of the man albeit sometimes they rebel against it if carried
to far  at least
unless a man continues to exhibit his appreciation of the gift by word as
well as by deed the woman is apt to imagine that that appreciation is on
the wane
5 how women must laugh in their sleeves at the fact that one man may
sue another in a court of law for alienating his wifes affections
  
iv on love
amore che muove il sole e laltre stelle
dante
the beginning middle and end of loveis a sigh
  
all things point to the infinite and love more than all things else
  
complex as is the character of love here are two things which love
always does always it
refines the thoughts
 and heart enlarges
           milton
and
love dyes all things a cerulean hue  what a pity it is not a fast
color
  
love is the most antimonial of emotions it worships yet it will not
stop at sacrilege it will build about its object a temple of adoration
then desecrate the fane it will give all yet ruthlessly  seize
everything it delights in pleasing yet it sometimes wittingly wounds
its ineffable tenderness often merges into an inclemency extraordinary
symbol of universal duality it is at once demonical and angelic
  
nothing stands still in this world not even love it must grow or it
withers  and perhaps
that is the strongest love which surmounts the greatest number of
obstacles
  
love to some is an intoxicant to others an ailment  to all it is a
necessity
  
as is ones character so is ones love and
perhaps the deepest love is the quietest
  
love is as implacable as it is unappeasable  nay more
love is merciless as merciless to its votary as to its victim for
love would slay rather than surrender would forswear rather than forgo
  
some loves like some fevers render the patient immuneat all events
to that particular kind of contagion
many lovers are vaccinated in early youth
  
only love can comprehend and reciprocate love  this is why
if of two sensitive human souls the one loves passionately and the
other not at all the other is unwittingly blind and deaf to loves
clamors and claims the one may ardently urge the other but passively
yields
only the famished understand the pangs of the hungered
of a great and reciprocated love there is one and only one sign the
expression of the eyes  who that has seen it was ever deceived by its
counterfeit
did ever the same lovelight shine in the same eyes twice
the light of love in the eyes may take on a thousand forms exultant
jubilation a trustful happiness infinite appeasement or promises
untold an adoration supreme or a complex oblation tenderness
ineffable or heroic resolves implicit faith unquestioning confidence
abounding pity unabashed desire  
he who shall count the stars of heaven shall enumerate the radiances of
love
  
there is no art of loving 1 though as ovid says love must be guided
by art 2  yet
if love did not come by chance it would never come at all
1 ovid wrote not art of loving ars amandi he wrote on the
amatorial art ars amatoria
2 arte regendus amorars amatoria i 4
  
to each of us himself is the centre of the visible universe  but when
love comes it alters this ptolemaic theory  yet
it is a significant fact that love which more than any other thing in
this world is the great bringertogether of hearts begins its
mysterious work as a separator and puteratadistance  for
when love first dawns in the breast of youth it throws about its object
a sacred aureole which awes at the same time that it inspires the
faithful worshipper
  
can only two walk abreast in the path of love how many try to widen that
strait and narrow way
  
love raises everything to a higher plane but nothing higher than the man
or woman who is loved
is there anything about which love does not shed a halo indeed
love is a sort of transfiguration  and when on the mount we can very
truly say it is good for us to be here
if there is any sublunary thing equal in value to the true love of a
faithful woman it has not yet entered into the heart of man to conceive
true love makes all things loveableexcept perhaps the chaperon
was there ever man or woman yet who was not bettered by a true love
true love is ever diffident and fearful of its own venturesomeness 3
but this not every woman understands
too often the phantasm of love and not the verity wins the day 4
women who seek a real lover should beware the overbold one
3 cf la volupte nous rend hardis lamour nous rend timides
voltaire la pucelle chant vi
4 see leopardi storia del genere humano where the verities of truth
and love and justice never leave the throne of jove but their phantasms
are sent down amongst men
  
to merge the thee and the me into onethat is ever the attempt of love
it is impossible  yet perhaps
they are happiest who can longest disbelieve in the impossibility of this
amatorial fusion for it may be that such
incredulity is favorable to romance
  
love is not exactly a sacrifice it is an exchange  the lover indeed
gives his heart he expects another in return
  
love is like life no apparatus can manufacture it kill it and nothing
in the heavens above or in the earth beneath or in the waters under the
earth will resuscitate it
how many a forlorn human wight has tried to resuscitate love
  
to such heights does love exalt the lover that he or she will live for
days in the remembered delights of a look a word a gesture  but
one thing is impossible to love love cannot create love the intensest
and most fervent love is powerless to evoke a scintillation of love
love may worship it may adore it may transfigure it may exalt the
object of its devotion to the skies but it cannot cause that object to
emit one ray of love in return
  
hate may be concealed love never
  
the greater the imaginative altitude of love the lower the boiling
point  but
love cannot always be kept at high pressure
  
the young think love is the winningpost of life the old know it is a
turn in the course  nevertheless it is a fateful turn
  
in love the imagination plays a very large part  and this may be
variously interpreted  thus
by man love is regarded as a sort of sacred religion by woman as her
everyday morality  the former is the more exhilarating but the latter
is more serviceable  indeed
love and religion are very near akin both inspire and both elevate
and
if faith hope and charity are the basis of religion there never was
such as religion as love  and
love is the only religion in which there have been no heretics  why
because woman are at once its object and its priesthood
love art and religion are but different phases of the same emotion
awe reverence worship and sacrifice in the presence of the supreme
ideal
love knows no creed  nay more
love acknowledges no deity but itself and accepts no sanctions but its
own it is autonomous  and yet
and yet love sometimes feels constrained to offer a liturgical
acquiescence to the rubric of reason  in short
between the prelatical domination of reason and the recusant
protestantism of love there has ever been strife  or in plain language
there are two codes of ethics one that of the romantic heart the other
that of the practical head  who shall assimilate them
the heart in its profoundest depths feels that something is due to
reason and reason in its highest flights feels that something is due
to the heart
is there a divine duplicity in the human soul and yet after all
all love seeks is love  yet love little knows that
in seeking love love enters on an endless search   since
love is an endless effort to realize the ideal  for
love always beckons over insurmountable barriers to uninhabitable realms
promises insupportable possibilities lures to an unimaginable goal  yet
love has a myriad counterfeits  and
men and women interpret the word differently  even
different women interpret the word love differently  thus
to one woman love is as the rising of the sun it shines but once in her
whole lifeday it floods everything with its light it brightens the
world it dazzles her
to another woman love is as the rising of a star a fresh one may appear
every hour of her life and nor she nor her world is one whit affected by
its rays  indeed one would hardly err if he said that
many a woman really does not know whether she is in love or not  she
is soughtthat she perceives but which of her seekers is worthiest
which most zealous which merely takes her fancy and which appeals to
her hearton these matters she meditates longto the exasperation of
course of the individual seeker  accordingly
men carried away by their own passionate impulse detest calculation of
the part of women
since he  stakes his all on impulse in the matter of love says man why
should woman stay to consider foolish man he forgets that
a woman always weighs a mans declaration of loveand legitimately
and naturally perhaps legitimately because naturally for once again
what a woman stays to consider in the matter of love is not the potency
of the impulse of the moment but the permanent efficacy of the emotion
therefore it is that
woman unwittingly obeys great natures laws
  
many imagine that love is a thing like a chemical element with a fixed
symbol 84 and a rigid atomic equivalent  and so it may be but like the
philosophers stone hitherto it has defied detection in its elemental
form  the fact is probably that
love may be compared to a substance that is never found free and which
not only combines in all sorts of relationships with all sorts of
substances but also like many another chemical body takes on the most
varied forms not only in these relationships but also under varying
pressures and temperaturesor perhaps it would be better to say that
love may be compared to a musical note to the unthinking it is a simple
sound to the more experienced it is know to consist of endless and
complicated harmonical vibrations harmonizing with some and making
discord with other notes by regular but unknown laws differing
according to the timbre of the emitter reverberating under certain
conditions lost to the ear in others and only responding to resonators
vibrating synchronously with itself  lastly
there is a whole gamut of lovechanging that simile we may say that
love is not like the sun a unit and practically the same wherever seen
it is like light allpervading universally diffused and reflected and
refracted and absorbed in varying degrees and varying manners by various
objects  and
than a great and pure love can anyone point to anything on earth
greater and more purifying
the lesser luminary perturbs the tide of human passion the greater light
draws it upwardnone the less veritably because in tinted formless
vapor  this is symbolical of love
it is the nascent thing that evokes the keenest emotions the budthe
babedawnand the first beginnings of love  so
love like sunlight wears its most tender tints at dawn
  
it still remains a mystery that out of a townful of folk two particular
hearts should worry themselves into early graves because this one cannot
get that other  yet
it is almost enough to destroy ones faith in the uniqueness of love to
see from how narrow a circle of acquaintances men and women choose their
spouses were platos two halfsouls separated by the diameter of the
globethat were lamentable
  
the man often argues that esteem will grow into passion  the woman knows
that the argument is utterly fallacious  yet
unless passion is guarded by esteemas the calyx ensheaths the
corolla the former is prone to wither
in youthful love as in the enfolded bud esteem and passionlike calyx
and corollaseem one and identical
it is only the fullblown flower that displays its constituent parts
would that love could remain ever in bud
  
to some love comes like a flash to others as the burning of tinder
in all when real love is kindled it devours all that is combustible
but
all love like all fire needs not only ventilation but replenishing
unless the primal spark is nourished it will not glow
stifle love and it dies down  so
even the love of a married pair unless it retains something of the
romance of courtship is apt to go out
  
love takes no though of surroundings an empty compartment is as good as
a coppice  give it privacy it is satisfied
  
in love we would much rather give than take  yet if the giving is
onesided there is trouble  and
love brooks no half measures  again
trust a woman to calculate the breakingstrain of her lovers heart  but
she will never let him off with less than the maximum stress
  
when love is dead it is perhaps best soonest buried
  
in astronomy to determine the motions of three bodies mutually
attractive is admittedly difficult  it is easy compared with the same
problem in love
  
a mans work and a womans love though to each the sumtotal of life
are often things wholly and totally dissociated
man the egoist thinks that if the woman loves him by consequence she
will love his work  it may be but usually non sequitur for
few are the women who can understand a mans work
for thousands of years man has worked in the huntingfield in the
marketplace in the camp for an equal length of time woman has worked by
the cradle by the hearth  accordingly
man has two sides to his nature woman but one
man wears one aspect when facing the world he wears quite another aspect
when facing women
at their work men are rigid frigid austere sever peremptory
tyrannical downright
with women      humphwherefore
o strenuous and highaspiring man in thy work seek not from womans
love what womans love cannot give but set thy face 90 as a flint
bethink thee of the fate of anthony   for
mans chief business in the world is work
womans chief business in the world is love
mans love perhaps just because it is his plaything not his business
is more finely tempered than is womans and takes on a finer edge  for
this very reason it is the more easily turned and is the less useful
it is the pocketknife not the lancet that is oftener called into
requisition  also
mans love is usually a highly ephemeral affair
with a man love is like hunger or thirst he makes a great fuss over it
he forgets when it is appeased  yet
when passions trance is overpast it is fortunate if affection takes
its place  so too
in love it is the man who protests and
that man is fortunate who after marriage has not some dubious
reflections as to whether he has protested overmuch  for
in love it is the man generally who makes a fool of himself
  
love like murder will out  but
jill keeps her secret better than jack  for
a woman generally controls love a man is controlled by it  and
jills very power of makingbelieve to be fancy free exasperates jack
  
it is a purely feminine ruse to apply a test to loveboth her own and
that of her loverto prove it true  a man would as soon as think of
applying a match to a powder magazine to prove it combustible
love in womans eyes is the supreme and ultimate arbitrator  if she is
loved love in her eyes will condone anythinganything  for
to prefer honor to love is a maxim to women unknown  with them love is
honor  and therefore the maxim is meaninglessand needless
  
it is a sort of legalor rather charitablefiction that women should
surrender only to love  in fact
do not even the lightest of laises and thaises make a show of being
swayed by love and
no woman by too much love was ever spoiled  man remember
that
  
the logic of the emotions differs from the logic of the intellect  as to
the senses
alackaday the senses never reason
love sometimes wrecks its barque upon the rocks to prove that they harbor
no mirage
love sometimes forgets that it is possible to probe too far
love in pursuit of love sometimes vivisects as unconsciously as a
science in pursuit of life
  
women detect the dawn of love while it is still midnight with a man
that is to say
a woman knows a man is in love with her long before he is aware of it
himself  except perhaps in this once circumstance when she herself is
in love with somebody else  and this is a highly important circumstance
  
wholly to satisfy masculine infatuation is given to no woman  and
perhaps
wholly to satisfy feminine caprice is given to no man  so sometimes
the last refuge of an unrequited love is the belief that love will create
love  nothing can be more futile than such a faith  yet
love without hope has its mitigations but
how alleviate the pain of a love that mistook a simulated love for a true
one
a simulated love is a contradiction in terms
either one loves or one does not that is the conclusion of the whole
matter
  
love would rather suffer than forget
love would give the world to be able to exculpate a languid lover
a passionate love is perhaps always poignant
love disdains pity
a wounded love carries a scar to the grave
  
in love when honor is lost loss of shame soon follows  then indeed the
downward patch becomes precipitous
  
to some love never comes to some it comes too often but the same love
never recurs as never a bud opens twice happy he or she is who gains
bud blossom and fruit  since
the sweetest love is that wherein the odorous flower of passion ripens
into the nourishing fruitage of affection  but
love requires careful nature  and
the more exotic the love the more difficult its culturetrue an
orchid may life on air  yes but how torrid and vaporous an air
your sturdy mistletoe thrives on the humble apple a cattleya requires a
columbian forest
  
youth wonders at the amatory successes of middleage  youth knows not
that
in matters amatory age is no handicap
a girl in her teens will make love to a gentleman of fortyand vice
versa  in fact
the indiscreet impetuosity of youth succumbs before the astuteness of
age
the bachelor and the spinster both sometimes wonder that the benedick and
the bride are still their rivals for they know not that
in the amatorial art matrimony is no handicap  in short
there is no barrier at which love will balk  nay more
love will forgive anything
did love demand it love though it might blush would not blench  and
often love itself stands amazed at its own divine audacity  indeed
love loves to immolate itself for love  knowing that
to love nothing is common or unclean for
love like charity thinketh no evil  butremember that
it is only the uranian aphrodite 5 that dares essay a divine audacity
nevertheless
love is the most vulnerable of the emotions and
a love doubtful of itself would be cautiously accepted it is not a fact
that
to try to feel ones own pulse is to make the heart beat irregularly
so
to try to see in a mirror the love light in ones own eyes is to bedim
it  so too
if passion is not linked with affectionwoe worth the day when the
troth was plighted but given passion linked with affectionah
nothing nothing is criminal to love for love knows not conscience  or
rather
love upsets all conventional conditions  for
love creates a world of its own a world populated by twoand these
make their own lawsor make none  so
a woman will imbrue her hands with blood and a man will fling honor to
the winds and yet the twain regard each other as impeccant and
impeccabletill pippa passes then
love always awakes to the fact that not even a community of two can live
without law and that
though human laws may be outraged those divine may not  and assuredly
the ideal love is the divine love  and in ideal love
strange strange but true in a great and ardent love when at last that
is offered which was long sought there supervenes upon the lovers a
great tenderness which hesitates to make their own that for which they
yearned  almost it were as if
a psychic monitor warned the conqueror to be clement and the captive to
be kind  this
tenderness is the worship of the soul by the soul  and
of all tests of love tenderness is the truest  but indeed indeed
in love there are heights above heights depths beneath depths who shall
scale them who shall plumb

v on lovers
si vis amari ama
seneca
lovers think the world was made for themand so perhaps it was
  
to each other lovers are the most interesting personages alive but
onlookers regard them partly with amusement partly with pity partly
with compassionin the etymological sense of that word
  
the first wonder of every accepted lover is that he should be the
accepted lover of such a woman what the woman thinks    what the
woman thinks probably not even she herself knows   probably each woman
thinks her own thoughts
to doubt whether one is in love is to prove oneself out of it
  
to impress upon the lover the stillexisting necessity of refining gold
or painting the lily is out of the question  yet every woman attempts
it
  
if there is one proverb more distasteful than another to a
hotheaded lover it is that half a loaf is better than no bread
   
children dogs and old people are difficult to deceive  lovers who have
to use circumspection should remember this
  
a doubting lover should mark how and for whom his woman dresses
  
to die for a woman would perhaps to a young and ardent lover not be
difficult to wage incessant warfare with the world for her that perhaps
is not so easy  but it is the better test of love and perhaps also the
better preserver and replenisher of love  for
little as people seem to be aware of it love requires constant
replenishing no flame can burn without a feeding oil no pool overflow
with out a purling brook  yet
the first ecstasies of love often blind both lover and lass to the care
necessary for the nurture of love  indeed
to many treat love as if it were a passing whim whereas in sober reality
it is  or should be a lasting emotion
  
love with woman is like the tides  and
few women know the highwater mark of their love they are always
harboring the belief that it may rise still higher and often they await
that rise
  
it is but the reflection of himself in his mistress that many a foolish
lover loves
  
that aged spinster is a rare one who does not regret she did not accept
one of her lovers  but
that younger spinster is not to be envied who has to make choice of
several
youth glories in the multiplicity of its lovers age sometimes wishes it
had had but one
  
the unloved think lad the one thing needful  the beloved know that an
ocean of love could be swallowed up and the parched soul cry out athirst
  
it is not well either to confide or confess too much
a very small rock will wreck a very big ship and a very small slip will
spoil a very long life
  
the pain which lovers cause each otherthrough fickleness languidness
jealousy and the thousand natural shocks that love is heir tois not
altogether pain though at the moment it may seem the most poignant
anguish the human soul could suffer  one proof of this lies in the fact
that
there are few who would choose to have missed loves pangs altogether
perhaps the pleasure intermixed with loves pangs arises from the thought
that the other is the cause of our suffering   for
in all love it is the sacrifice of oneself for the other that brings
keenest joy  and yet
there is an element of selflove in the very extremest of love  since
love after all is a debtor and creditor affair  who ever loved with
no hope of return it is when one of the parties declares himor
herself insolvent that the account is closedwith many tears and sighs
on the part of the chief creditor  at all events
the intenser the love the more flawless does its object appear  for
the surest test of the sincerity of love is that it thinketh no evil
the surest test of a waning love is that it begins not to content itself
when it sees its object suffer
the surest test of a dead love is that it forgets how to be jealous
  
the fallingout of lovers true is a renewing may be of love 1 still it
is not to be recommended  in fact it might be said that
every fallingout of lovers true is a nail in loves coffin  yet
a blessing it is that in love we remember the sweet rather than the
bitter  for
love was ever bittersweet 2
1 amanitum irae amoris integratis est
   terrence andria iii 23
2 but i supposed innumerable people have said this before  no matter
  
the heart of a lover is like that bottom of a well all the beauties of
the starry heavens are revealed in it but when it sheds the light of its
countenance upon it all else is obliterated
  
was any lover ever loved enough or
did any ever hear of a tired lover nevertheless often
drink to me only with thine eyes says the youthful lover but when the
seance is over he goes out and orders beefsteak and bottled beer
  
what it really craves the lovers heart is impotent to express  yet it
is ever attempting
a lover is full of wishes as an egg is full of meat  but
what it really wishes no lover seems able to say  as a matter of fact
the endless task which the lover is ever attempting is a search for a
formula for the summation of an infinite series of which love is the
variablefew lovers seem to understand this
  
to kindle aspiration in her lover a woman herself need not be aspiring
for
whatever the talents of a man they are stimulated by contact with woman
since
an elevating influence seems to radiate from women we have but to come
into the light of their countenances for our own faces to shine as the
sun  indeed
physicists may talk as they like but lovers know a more subtle and a
more potent force than any yet revealed to them  it has not yet been
named but for the present it might be called psychicity 3

cup
  
if you wish to ascertain the relationship of a youthful pair watch their
eyes for
simulation is difficult to the eye
  
when the idol into which a woman has converted her lover is dethroned
she still worships her remembrance of her god and puts together and
treasures the broken pieces
when the idol into which has converted his loved one is dethroned he
generally changes his creed
  
a circumpsecting lover is a womans abhorrence  as a calculating
mistress is a mans
  
let a lover but put himself into the hands of his mistress and he is
safe  since
the man she really loves a woman will shield through thick and thin
through right and wrong  for
concerning a man the only question a woman asks is not is he right or
wrong but is he mine or anotherswe men therefore
leave a woman to get her lover out of a scrape
  
it is to be feared that the men and women who love but once and forever
are not usually to be found outside of romances
with women love is a river everflowing from the brook in girlhood
4 to the estuary of womanhood  like a river too
womans love is fed by all the streams it meets  on the other hand
with man love is a geyser
4 standing with reluctant feet
    where the brook and river meet
  longfellow maidenhood
  
the languishing lover has gone out of date he has been replaced by the
diverting one  and the change is significant of much
the early nineteenthcentury maid pretended to ignorance the early
twentiethcentury maid to omniscience
the early nineteenthcentury suitor protested but
the early twentiethcentury suitor has to contest  in the one case
the woman tacitly acknowledges an inequality  in the other case
the man has to openly to recognize his equal  nevertheless
the fundamental relationship between the sexes do not materially vary
from century to century much as conventional manners and customs may
for after all
always what a man seeks in a woman is love  and
in all love there is something perfectly and paradisiacally pristine
would the most emancipated woman have love otherwise at all events
perhaps the most womanly position a woman can occupy is with her head on
her lovers heart  at this the strongminded may scoff  they may
  
the obsession of the male heart by one woman ousts from it all other
women  thus
the accepted young man regards all women but the one as he would regard
fashionplates  to the young woman men continue to be men  that is to
say
a man dives headlong into love  a woman paddles into it  and the
womans hesitation at the brink of the stream exasperates the spluttering
man  in short
a mans heart is captured wholly and at a stroke  a womans heart
surrenders itself piecemeal
whereas with a man a trivial passion is usually an affair more of the
senses or of the imagination than of the heart with a woman every
passions is an affair of the heart
a man when first he is in love is absorbed in the contemplation of the
object of his love  a woman is similarly situated is capable of making
comparisons
it gives to womans curiosity a curious pleasure to compare the methods
of mens proposals
in love a woman is generally cool enough to calculate pros and cons a
man in similar plight is incapable of anything but folly
  
it is a feminine motto that a woman needs to be taught how to love
perhaps she does but most men will think one private tutor ought to
suffice and that tutor ought to be he  at all events
the last schoolmaster would be apt to regard with somewhat mixed feelings
the tuition of previous crammers
why go to the trouble of explaining away a first love if the second is
no whit its inferior unless it be to overcome
what a second love chiefly deplores is that it was not he or she who
first taught his or her loved one to love  is it not true also that
it is the first love that amazes that beautifies that consecrates
an illicit love beautifies and consecrates nothing
a maud leaves the daisies rosy not so faustine
many a woman has given her heart to one lover and herself to another
the first is always won the second is sometimes extorted  yet
it is wonderful how a woman will contrive to make all her lovers believe
they are winners
  
it often gives a lady a pleasure to give her lover a pang
  
not many but have tasted the bitterness of the conflict between the
desire of the flesh and the resentment of the spirit explain these terms
who may
  
to attempt by erring to cure an erring lover is to administer not an
antidote but an adjuvant  it works poison in the blood
when and if in a tortuous love a man arrives at a dont give a damn
stage he is not to be classed with the animals known as docile  and as
to a woman       but polite language has its limits
  
many a man has be exasperated not only by the audacity of his rival but
by the equanimity with which his ladylove views that audacity  he
forgets that as a rule
feminine complaisance varies directly as masculine audacity  and yet
often enough as a simple matter of fact 118 masculine diffidence is
vastly more potent than masculine audacity  and further
rarely need the complaisance that audacity evokes perturb the diffident
man since
rarely need the complaisance that audacity evokes perturb the diffident

the true woman may give her fingertips to the gallant she gives herself
to the worshiper  the pity o it is that
the worshiper cannot away with the complaisance that permits a woman to
give even her fingertips to the gallant  and
few are the women who have plumbed the silent and sensitive depths of the
diffidence of her devotee  the worst of it is
the devotee essays two things he would apotheosize the object of his
adoration and place her as a constellation among the stars yet he would
have her at the same time terrestrial and tangible  when the woman shows
herself terrestrial and tangible to others than he the faith of the
devotee is shaken  in fine
every lover attempts that impossible task the realization of the
heavenly ideal  perhaps
it is in aphelion that the corona appears most splendid
were perihelion to result is coalescence perhaps the photosphere would
be proved composed of terrestrial vapors  and if it did as no doubt it
would would it be at all bedimmed  for to the devout astrologer
nothing nothing will ever destroy beautyand therefore wonder  so
bodily beauty where love is priestess is a daedal spur to the loftiest
worship
the lover is ever worshipful and
where is worship nothing can be profane  so
in love there is nor taint nor stain  therefore
make o youthful lover the best and most of youth and love never will
either recur
  
vi on making love
mille modi veneris
ovid
there are as many ways of making love as there are of making soup  and
probably
there are as many kinds of love as there are of flavors  and
palatesboth sentimental and physicalevidently differ widely  and
yet
if you would know the secret of success with women it is said in a word
ardor  and
would ye o women know in a word the secret of success with men it lies
in responsiveness
  
in matters amatoryor rather preamatoryfeminine tactics are
infallible and consummate
let no man think to cope with feminine strategy
  
a rake has more chance than a ninnywhich doubtless has been said
before
  
in love as in all things indecision spells ruination  for
there is a curious antagonism between the sexes they are in a manner
foes not friends  the successful wooer is the captor the raptor the
bride is the capture the rapture 1 and
even she who is minded to be caught will not spare her huntsman the ardor
of the chase and lightly esteems him who imagines she is to be lightly
won
in the chesslike game of lovemaking no woman plays for checkmate the
game interests her too much to bring it to a finish  what pleases her
most is stalemate where though the king cannot be captured the
captress can maneuver without end
a man imagines he wins by strenuous assault  the woman knows the victory
was due to surrender
1 etymologically as well as metaphoricallyand veritably
  
wouldst thou ask ought of a woman question her eyes they are vastly
more voluble than her tongue  indeed
there is no question too subtle too delicate too recondite or too
rash for human eyes to ask or answer  and
he who has not learned the language of the eyes has yet to learn the
alphabet of love  besides
love speaks two languages one with the lips the other with the eyes
there is really a third but this is pentecostal at all events
lovers always talk in a cryptic tongue
there is but one universal language the ocularnot volapuk nor
esperanto is as intelligible or as efficacious as this
  
no woman can be coerced into lovethough she may be coerced into
marriage  and
man the clumsy wielder of one blunt weapon often enough stands agape at
his own powerlessness before the invulnerable woman of his desire
indeed
the battle between the coquettish maid and determined man is like the
battle between the retiarius and the mirmillio  the coquetry ensnares
the man as with a net against which his sword is useless
  
a womans emotions are as practical as a mans reason
a mans emotions are never practical  this is why
in the emotional matter of love men and women so often lash and perhaps
it is a beneficial thing for the race that a womans emotions are
practical  for
if neither the man nor the woman curbed the mettlesome pegasus emotion
methinks the colts and fillies would want for hay and oats
  
it is a moot question which is the more fatally fascinating the
uniformed nurse or the weeded widow  but
who has yet discovered the secret springs of fascination for example
how is it that certain eyes and lips will enthrall while others leave us
cold and inert
does the potency lie in the eyes and the lips or is there some
inscrutable and psychic power at all events who will explain how it is
that
a man will sometimes forsake the most beautiful of wives and a woman will
forsake the kindest of husbands to follow recklessly one who admits no
comparison with the one forsaken all we can say is that
the potency of personality exceeds the potency of beauty  for
powerful as is physical charm it counts not for all in the matter of
love  yet what it may be that does count and how and why it does count
no man living shall say  for
is even love aware of all its seeks and
is it given to any to grant all that love beseeches and yet
were all love sought bestowed what sequel
perhaps t were well to leave love but semisatisfied  at bottom the
real question is this what will win and keep me another heart  but
how to win and keep another heart that is a thing has to be found out
for oneselfif it be discoverable  and always by the experimental
method  since
in matters amatory there is no a priori reasoning possible  all we know
is that
there is nothing more potent than passion  and
the chasm which seems to innocence to yawn between virtue and frailty
is leapt by that pegasus passion at a boundbut he blinds his rider
in the feat
  
in spite of the poesy of love deeds are more potent than words
though perhaps it is well to pave the way for the one by the other
in spite too of the piety of love love laughs at promisesthat is
the promises that affect it
  
there is one miracle that women can always perform and always it
astonishes the man it is this to change from the recipient into the
appellant  that is to say
when woman usually regarded as the receiver becomes the giveror
rather the demandermans wonderment surpasses words  and let it be
remembered that
there is no recrossing this rubicon
  
mistrust a prolonged and obdurate resistance  either you are
outclassed or you are outexperienced  and besides
surrender after prolonged resistance rarely is brought about by emotion
  
a woman never really quite detests daring  this is why
much is a forgiving a daring man  so too
much is forgiven a pretty woman by the men
  
if the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water the
beginning of love is as when one kindleth a fire
  
the eye tells more than the tongue  and
if the eye and the tongue contradict each other believe the eye
  
there is an indifference that attracts and there is an indifference that
repels  he is a sagacious man and she is a sagacious woman who will
differentiate them  the question resolves itself into that which so
often puzzles the anglerhow much line to let out  about one thing
there need be no hesitation
when your fish is within reach be quick with the landingnetor even
with the gaff
  
in the matter of wooing soon enough does the young girl learn to prefer
the mature manners of the man of the world to the gaucheries of
inexperienced youth  as to the man

by what men are won most women seem thoroughly to comprehend
by what women are won few men know  perhaps
no woman knows by what she herself is won
one thing there is at all events to which woman will always succumb
tenderness  but remember dames that
tenderness is extremely difficult of simulation  or rather
tenderness is so delicate and deepseated a feeling that few care to
attempt its simulation
  
a woman who gives herself too freely is apt to regret the giving  in
time too she discovers that as a matter of fact
no woman can give her real self twice one or other gift will prove to be
a loan and
it is always and only the first recipient that causes a womans heart to
flutter and often it flutters long 144
a second gift is generally a mortgageif it is not a sale
a mortgage is difficult to bind for
there is a statute of limitations in love as there is in law  nor is the
former to be set aside by bond
that pair is in a parlous state when either party discovers that the
title was not properly searched  since
everybody expects a fee simplethough few deserve it god wot
  
perhaps the most durable conquest is the incomplete one  which sounds
illogical but it is well to remember that
repletion seems to cause in the man temporary indifference while
repletion causes in the woman enduring content  and in this we can
detect a significant distinction between the sexes namely the fact that
a single goal satisfies most women
no single goal ever yet satisfied the restless spirit of man
  
what gives keenest joy is the evocation of latent passion  for
each takes pleasure in believing that he or she alone can evoke this
passion  accordingly
the premature confession of passion and the confession of premature
passion both rankle in the breastand probably in the breast of both
penitent and confessor
  
what intensity of feeling a woman can throw into the enunciation of a
christian name there is perhaps no better clue to possession that this
for probably
not until a mans christian mane is ecstatically uttered is a woman
wholly his
  
men and women content with the different weapons  this is why
men are rarely intrepid in the presence of women but women rarely stand
in awe of mennothing differentiates the sexes more than this but
the psychological reason is difficult to discover  perhaps
the making of love is a sort of duel the conditions of which are that
the man shall doff all his armor and the woman may don all hers  indeed
the battle of lovemaking would be an unequal combat even were both
contestants fully panoplied for
a womans derision will pierce any mail  in fact
no armor is impervious to womans shaftsbe they those of laughter or
be they those of love  so
the veriest rou is vulnerable to the veriest maid  but
for each man she meets a woman carries in her quiver but one shaft  if
that misses its aim she is powerless it is like a dart without a thong
when thrown the man can close  but
always it devolves upon the man to take the initiative  but again
always the man must pretend that he takes no initiative  but again
always the woman must pretend that she gives no opportunity
the game of love is not only one of chance but one of skill
what irks man is that a woman pretends that she must be circumvented by
wiles  but
man was ever a clumsy wooer  nevertheless
it is only the man who thinks he is too venturesome   since
the iciest woman sometimes thaws  and
the austerer a woman the sweeter her surrender  and again
a woman is never sweeter than in surrender  accordingly
de laudace et encore de laudace et toujours de laudace2 should
be the motto of every wooer  since
audacity if beloved of women but it must be an audacity born of
sincerity and educated b y discretion  at all events
beware timidityit is fatal
2 danton
  
with women nothing is more conquering than conquest nothing so
irresistible as resistance  on the other hand
resistance on the part of the woman is an effort put forth for the
purpose of defeating its own object
  
a man prizes only what he has fought for  no one knows this better than
a woman  this is why
a womans capitulation she always makes to appear as a capture  and
where there are no defense works a woman will erect them
foolish that man who does not storm entrenchments for
resistance on the part of a woman is a wall which a man is expected to
leap  his agility is the measure of her approbation
  
arouse a womans interest and you arouse much  but
having failed disappear  yet
it takes very many futile attempts to make a failure  at the same time
importunity is an inferior weapon
  
a conditional surrender is no surrender  but
a womans surrender is in reality a desertion a going over to the enemy
thenceforward she is an ally  indeed
a womans capitulation is her conquest
  
let no amount of simulated austerity deter you the marble galatea came
to life at the prayer of a man
  
the number of modes in which a woman can say yes has not up to the
present be accurately enumerated but perhaps the one most frequently in
use is the negative imperative  and
many are the men who have puzzled long and painfully over the motives of
a womans no yet in nine cases out of ten a woman says no merely
because she feels herself on the brink of saying yes in other words
it is often mistrust of herself that leads many a woman to refuse it will
the lips the consent that is fluttering at her heart  perhaps that is
why
with woman yea and nay are meaningless and interchangeable terms
  
ware a show of excessive feeling  it is proof either that it is
shallow and evanescent or that it is put on  at all events
excessive feeling is rarely taken seriously  now
seriousness adds a spice to gallantry but like spice a little is
ample
  
many men think it is the woman who has to be persuaded  it is not the
woman it is her scruples  besides nemo repente turpissimusvel
turpissima  yet
by thirty scruples are either dormant or dominant
both of the callow youth of fifteen and the man of the world of
fortyfive swear by the woman of thirty
  
it may seem a paradox but it is a truism that in matters of love it
is the weaker and the defenseless sex that takes the initiative  in
other words
the woman makes the opportunity which the man takes  and
an opportunity missed is an opportunity lost  and
the woman is implacable to the man who sees the opportunity and takes it
not  since
with woman indifference is worse than insult  wherefore
never never disappoint a woman
  
spontaneous admiration is the sincerest flattery  those who know this
affect spontaneity  but it requires much art to conceal this art
you will oftener err upon the side of ultradelicacy in a compliment that
upon the side of barefacedness
do not imagine that excessive admiration can give offence  but remember
that
the eye can netter express admiration than can the tongue
the publicity with which a woman will receive admiration from a
male admirer 144 often is sufficient to astonish that admirer  but
often enough it is the admiration not the admirer that a woman covets
indeed
many a woman is in love with love 3 but not her lover but this no
lover can be got to comprehend
to flatter by deprecating a rival is a complement of extremely doubtful
efficacy
3 i seem to remember that somebody before has said something like this
before
  
a woman does not admire too clement a conqueror  she admits the right to
ovation  and to him who waives it she lightly regards
  
seek no steppingstones unless you mean to cross
he who gathers steppingstones and refrains from crossing is contempted
of women  indeed
every advance of which advantage is not taken is in reality a retreat
and remember too that though
sought interviews are sweet those unsought are sweeter  and
probably no son of adamand for the matter of that probably no
daughter of eveever quite looks back with remorse upon a semiinnocent
escapade  yet
the man who thinks he can at any time extract himself from any feminine
entanglement that he may choose to have raveled is a simpleton
  
the way of man with a maid may have been too wonderful for agur
nowadays the way of a man with a married woman would puzzle a wiser
than he
what is the attitude to be maintained towards the too complaisant spouse
of an honorable friend that is a problem will puzzle weak men without
end  of that fatal and fateful dilemma when a wife or a husband falls
victim to the wiles of another there are for the delinquent two and
only two horns and it is a moot question upon which it is preferable to
be impaled flighteither from the victor or the victrix  yet
to some it is no anomaly to pray gods blessing upon a liaison  but
these folk are to be pitied for
a clandestine love always works havochavoc to all three 4
4 cf platus malus clandestinus est amor damnum st merum
will men and women never learn what trouble they lay up in store for
themselves by breaking their plighted troths
    
vii on beauty
la beaute pour moi cest la divinite visible cest le bonheur
palpable cest le ciel descendu sur terre
theophile gautier
beauty they say is but skindeep  that is quite deep enough to enslave
mankind  as a matter of fact it is much deeper for to say nothing of
health and goodspirits
beneath true beauty lies an admirable or a loveable character   and
yetor perhaps and therefore
if by some mischance beauty should arouse our resentment with what
different eyes we regard it
  
the feeling for beauty is probably more highly developed in man than in
woman  n b perhaps this is the source of the beauty of women
nevertheless
it is a question that perhaps will never be settled how much value
should be placed upon mere beauty for
man soon tires of mere beauty  in fact man the inconstant creature
soon tires of mere anything
  
beauty should never be analyzed  at sight of graceful neck who speaks
of musculus sternocleidomastoideus at touch of moist red lips who
thinks upon the corpuscles of paccini
  
more women are wooed for their complexions than for their characters
  
could women only know it nothing can add to their charms how
provokingly delightful is the uniformed demureness of an hospital nurse
beside the elaborate bedizenments of a woman of fashion
  
the most beautiful thing known among men is a good woman  and this is
not an anomaly
  
she who captures a man by a single charm be it even beauty holds him by
a weak chain
think not it was merely beauty that made helen or cleopatra historic
beauty is much and grace is much but there is a charm more subtle and
potent than these
  
beauty without modesty is a rose without perfume the petals may delight
but they lack an ineffable savor  like a flower too
though the tangible petals are numbered and comptable the subtle perfume
eludes the sense and is inexhaustible  for
modesty is the exhalation of the soul at once it enhances as it
refines the potency of beauty  nay more
the sacrosanct aureole of modesty beautifies all it surrounds though it
diviner haze imperfection there is none  so
given a redolent balm and the lowliest herb becomes treasured and
precious  and
each human soul has its own individual essence
what folly were the violet to envy the rose since
beauty is much and grace is much and mien and demeanor and wit but a
prepotent and psychic essence there is transcending the power of these
and
as the suave and subtle essence is not distinct from but springs from
the tangible and numerable petals so the spirit perceives that its
fleshy vesture is not a thing apart to be donned or doffed at will to b
e contemned or left out of regards but indeed at integral and
inseparable portion of itself for
in the very woof and warp of flesh sprit is immanent and enmeshed
indeedthough in a mystic sense
vesture and wearer are mutually one  and yet
love ever essays the task of seeking out the psychic wearer beneath the
corporeal vestureoften with plaintive strife
when seeker and sought make a mutual searchthe starkest strife is
condoned  but alack
the mystic unity of the human soul is never wholly divulgednot even to
lovenot even to love
    
viii on courtship
un amant fait la court ou sattache son coeur
moliere
a woman really in love and sure of her lover delights in toying with a
sort of coquetry of love as if it pleased her to try to win over again
that the winning of which gave so exquisite a pleasure  and perhaps
the coquetry of love is the surest test of an unquestionable love  for
when possession can afford to play at pursuit this but proves possession
complete sometimes
an assumed love will resort to the pretty tricks of a real one in order
to assure its objector to reassure itself
surrender after a protracted siege has its advantages  at all events
both m and n can look back to more demisemi happy incidents when the
courtship has been long
happy that couple can laugh over the incidents of courtship afterwards
t is a portent of impending ill if they cannot
  
halfheartedness in courtship is not only suicidal it is murderous  on
the other hand remember that
in courtship there are various and varying stages but there is always
the homegallop  remember too that
what is suitable at one stage of courtship is ruinous at another and
it is only the old whip who knows when to push the pace
in courtship to force the running is hazardous  though we win the
victory loses its sweets  and
in courtship men too often ride on the snaffle in matrimony too often
on the curb
  
courtship asks for cash payment  matrimony has often to allow unlimited
credit  insolvency is not unknown
  
in courtship all auxiliaries but the rival  no one will impede a lover
save another lover
  
in the presence of a woman man is by nature a diffident animal the
women who recognize this are often the most successful indeed
many are the refined and gentle women who in after life regret that they
did not more openly cope with their less delicatelyminded sisters
nevertheless
nothing is more astonishing than a womans tact in encouraging a man
  
in courtship modulated and musical tones count for much  who with harsh
speech would assail a ladys ear
  
no woman thinks she can be wooed too often  and
few women can forgo an opportunity to fascinate
  
in courtship the woman is the whole world to the man in matrimony the
man is the whole world to the woman
  
in courtship the slightest suspicion of condescension is fatal  for
true love is a greater leveler than anarchy
  
in courtship the wooer to the wooed is in juliets phrase the god of
her idolatry in matrimony he is lucky if he is the idol of her deity
  
it is a question which is the sweeter a spontaneous courtship or one
that has sprung from friendship
in a spontaneous courtship there is all the charm of novelty
in a courtship that has grown out of affection there is all the
trustfulness of friendship  but
friendship and courtship are two totally distinct things
in courtship men and women meet on the flowerythorny common of love
in friendship men and women invite each other over to their respective
plots  so
a friend will show a friend all over his domain
a lover can but point out to the lover the flowers and thorns which
grow in the soil to which they are both strangers  162
  
it is an open question whether in matters prematrimonial the mode of
the french is not preferable to that of the anglosaxon whether that
is
prudence and prevision are not more certain harbingers of matrimonial
happiness of matrimonial happiness than are impulse and passion
the french couple when wedded are virtually strangers the anglosaxon
have already together enacted some scenes of the matrimonial drama  yet
it is an open question also whether
a more durable domestic affection is not built up from the pristine
foundation of total ignorance than from that of a partial
acquaintanceship
the american elizabeth patterson before she became madame jerome
bonaparte could write i love jerome bonaparte and i prefer to be his
wife were it only for a day to the happiest union
the continentalized madame jerome bonaparte twentysix years after she
had ceased to be miss elizabeth patterson could write do we not know
how easily men and women free themselves from the fetters of love and
that only the stupid remain caught in these pretended bonds 1 after
all
little do any couple know of each other before marriage  besides
does not a delightful romance envelope the nuptials of strangers at all
events even if precaution is a foe to impulse few will be found to deny
that
strangeness is by no means inimical to passion  perhaps then
fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts can form a better judgment as to
the suitability and adaptability to each other of two young ardent and
headstrong boys and girls can these themselves since
fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts know full well that impulse and
passion often prove materials too friable for the manystoried fabric of
marriage  at all events
the french mode of contracting a marriage precludes the possibility of
perilous and precocious affairs of the heart  perhaps
the mistake that ardent and headstrong boys and girls make is in thinking
that impulse and passion are the keys of paradise their
elders know that impulse and passion are sometimes the keys of purgatory
prudence and prevision are not keys to any supernal or infernal
existence they are merely guidebooks to a terrestrial journey at all
events it is significant that which might be added as a lemma
widows rarely choose unwisely
1 quoted by c de varigny in the revue des deux mondes of january the
15th 1893
  
over that muchbethoughtof muchsurmisedaboutthing a proposal of
marriage every young woman weaves a preconceived halo of romance but
in nineteen cases out of twenty a proposal is either unexpected or
disappointing that is
many a girl has almost held her breath with anxiety as she saw the great
question coming then almost cried with vexation at the way it came
for often
either the wrong man proposes or the right man proposes stupidly
the woman looks for ideal surroundings a dramatic situation and
impassioned and poetic utterance usually
the man seizes a commonplace opportunity andstutters probably
the ideal proposal occurs only in novels  and yetand yet
perhaps after all the real proposal is more complimentary to woman than
is the ideal at least perhaps
the aberration and obfuscation of the man is proof once i of her
potency and ii of his sincerity
did man keep his head would woman be quite so sure of his heart yet it
may be that in these matter woman is liable to err since
rarely if ever does a womans heart run away with her head  when it
does
ah the momentary bliss of an unreasoning emotion yet
woman does right to keep her head for
almost every womans happiness depends upon what she does with her
heartunless indeed she elects to go through life homeless childless
and unenspoused for
though it is the wife that makes the home it is the man who must provide
for it  and since
man by nature is probably nomadic and polygamic not his to debate
whether to give rein to emotion  woman by nature is in far different
case
for the sake of her child woman must bind the nomad to herself
accordingly
it is woman who is the true agglutinator and civilizer of society
therefore it comes about that
to order wisely her emotions is the inherited instinct of woman
wherefore
woman is the conserver of the nationand this in more senses than one
    
ix on men and women
dio fa gli uomini e e s appaino
salviati
there are two elements of character which a man should possess develop
and maintain unstained if he would find favor in feminine eyes the first
is bravery the second indomitableness of resolution  so likewise
there are two elements of character which a woman should possess
develop and maintain unstained if she would find favor in masculine
eyes the first is sympathy the second sweetness of temper
  
a curious and latent hostility divides the sexes  it seems as they could
not approach each other without alarums and excursions  always the
presence of the one rouses anxiety in the breast of the other they stand
to arms they resort to tactics they maneuver  and
men and women approach each other vizored and in armor  but it is often
only to conceal the craven heart that beats beneath the brazen cuirass
  
men judge of women not so much by their intrinsic worth as by the
impression women make upon them  and women know this since
all women are alive to the fact that the impressing 1 of men is the
important function of life  accordingly
great stress is and is naturally laid by women upon dress and the
subtleties of the toilette  for
in matters of the heart man is led by the heart and not by the head 2
and why not since
it is generally a sweetheart not a hard head that a man wants in
short
men are oftener vanquished by a look than by logic by a gracious smile
than by good sense by manner and even by dress than by mental
development or depth  this is to say
a man judges a woman by her appearance
a woman judges a woman by her motives and
a woman judges of a womans motives by what she knows of her ownso
it comes about that
to a man a womans heart is something mysterious  but
women who know their own hearts have little difficulty in reading
others
1 it is perhaps highly unfortunate that to this word is attached a
twofold signification
2 though as mr grant allen has endeavored to show this is a
scientific a method as any
  
no units of measurement yet devised are adequate for the computation of
the power wielded by a beautiful woman
  
that is a significant fact and probably could we fathom all the
profundities and unravel all the entanglements of the relations between
the sexes as deep and as intricate as significant that no woman thinks
a man can pay her a higher compliment than to wish to make her his own
for though
woman thinks man her ultimate aim and desire nature knows that man is
but the steppingstone to the child  in the end woman agrees with
nature we may go farther and say
women are nearer the eternal laws than are men  men govern themselves by
the laws they themselves make women are lawless laws are for the
temporal the fleeting for a given individual in a given society for a
particular race in a particular clime  such laws are obeyed by women
only under compulsion  they more farseeing than men instinctively
peer far beyond the ephemeral rules manufactured by men into the realm
of laws eternal and immutable these she obeys implicitly
unquestioninglymuch to mans amazementand it may be his
mortification for he sees that she is freer than he  this is why
for the man she truly loves a woman will sacrifice everything
everything  the same generous sentiment cannot by any means be
attributed to man
  
both the wise man and the wise womanbut here i am reminded of the
recipe for hare soup
  
between the sexes there is in reality but one linkthe link amatory
and
so long as nature maintains two sexes so long will men and women hug
yet chafe under that slender but invisible bond
not even cupid and psyche avoided a misunderstandingin spite of the
devotion of the other  and
if men and women differ in matters amatory it is because men and women
have trodden different evolutionary paths
the man given up to the chase for pelts or pelf and careful of his
status in the tribe thinks only of himself and the present
the woman her sole care the nurture of her offspring thinks only of her
progeny and the future   but since
the family is the unit of the state therefore
the state makes laws not for love but for the family
happy that family the parents of which are bound by cosmic not by
municipal affection  nevertheless
say what one will  love scoffs at laws howsoever marriage and divorce
may be regulated by parliamentary statute
man as a member of a political community may make marriage laws to suit
that communitylaws to suit that communitylaws de vinculo
matrimonii and laws de mensa et thoro decrees nisi prius and
decrees absolute but
law can no more bind the affections than it can bind the sweet influences
of the pleiades  and yet at bottom
beneath all municipal and parochial regulations a great and cosmic law
does govern the relations of the sexes and
the lightest whim of the lightest lady has a definite perhaps a cosmic
fount and origin
  
a man can never know too much perhaps a woman can  and
it is a question how far a man admires a woman who knows too much  for
if there is nothing a man can teach a woman not even of the ways of
love the man is apt to be chagrined  besides
too much knowledge is inimical to romance
  
war is a mans true trade love womans
  
there is no stronger argument against the equality of the sexes than a
womans hand  it was made to toil no to place in her lovers  in
truth
is there anything more fragile in nature than a womans hand but put it
in her lovers and what a force it has
anomaly of anomalies with women fragility delicacy dependence
beauty graceit is by these weak weapons that she wins  so
we watch a demure damsel of some sixteen sunny summers much as we watch a
delicate dynamo of some thousand kilowatts
both seem so calm so quiescent  yet both we know can generate such
startling energy can bring about such marvelous results
  
many women forget that things which men have no objection to their female
friends doing they often have a very particular objection to their
mothers sisters and wives doing  so too they often forget that
it is not the girl he flatters compliments and is conspicuously
attentive to that the man always marries  perhaps this goes to show
that
there is a deeper and more serious current in the flow of male emotions
which much as light and fitful breezes may stir the surface is moved
only by and mingles only with a similar and confluent stream  for
it is not mans highest instincts that are stimulated by the more
superficial of feminine blandishments though no doubt many a man there
is has been made permanently captive by their lure  the truth is that
man is a manysided creature he will reflect many different rays but it
is only under the ray that pierces the surface and irradiates the
interior that he truly glows
  
woman does not lean upon man because she is inferior but rather because
she is his supporter just as
the buttress leans upon the building but the building would fall without
the buttress  that is
womans dependence upon man is his chief source of strength  those who
cannot understand this may be left to their ignorance
  
it is not all women who comprehend the exaltation of mind into which some
men are thrown by their presence  indeed
men put a higher value upon a womans complaisance than she does herself
to a women feminine concession appear trivial  is it any wonder then
that
woman calls mans jealousy unreasonable in reality
the affianced man thinks he has gotten him an angel from heaven  it is
not within the bounds of mortal male comprehension that such an angel
should sully her wings
  
women know their sexwhich if it is a truism is a truism that men
often forget  and
few things permit a man to see so far into the subtleties and intricacies
of feminine hearts as a squabble between two of them over himself
  
a man in defeat generally turns to woman  a woman in defeat is either
scornful silent or both
a man in depression falls back upon his only weapon brute force  a
woman in like circumstances does the same  but her weapon is personal
charm
  
in matters amatory and maternal a woman will risk more than will a man
in fact
in matters amatory and maternal woman is the truly combative animal
  
many are the members of the one sex that are entrapped by the wiles of
the other but it often happens that the entrapper afterwards rues the
capture as much asor even more thanthe entrapped  so it often
happens that
girls who are deliberately seeking husbands think love may be won by
artifice  not until well on in years do
women know that by men love and artifice are considered mortal foes
to win him a wife by artifice would be to a man a thing impossible and
abhorrent yet
to win her a husband by artifice is to a woman a thing quite natural
but
when if ever the man discovers that he was won by artifice there are
apt to be several bad quarters of an hour  for when all is said and
done
the man free and easy thoughtless and untrammeled knowing he may pick
and choose never chooses tilltillthere comes the woman he thinks
he wants  then he says point blank he wants her
should it ever be revealed to him that his want was the result of her
artifice a very different complexion is put upon that want  on the
other hand
the woman deprived of the power of choice trammeled by convention
bound to wait till asked for quite naturally resorts to artifice  and
yet curiously enough and a thing incomprehensible by man
a man whom a woman has won by sheer artifice she can love to the end of
her life  but after all
what a refuge to man is workor play alas
women has no refuge  so
men cannot suffer long women do
a man flies to work or sport or to the gamingtable or to drink  a
woman      
he who can tell what a woman does in the sorrow of the soul will tell us
much
some women in sorrow of soul eat out their hearts in silence other
women in sorrow of soul will tell us much
some women in sorrow of soul eat out their hearts in silence other
women in sorrow of soul eat out the hearts of others not in silence
but
take a taciturn woman seriously  for always
a taciturn woman has suffered much
a taciturn woman is a lonely one  and probably
it is only women who really know loneliness
give a man a full meal and an outlet for his energyhe is fairly
contented for
a man always has friends or a club women rarely have either
  
the most superb of physical charms are powerless unless fired by
imagination as the most destructive of explosives is harmless without a
cap or a detonator  but
given a detonator and the coarsest powder can work tremendous havoc
  
what precisely will bring a particular man to her feetthat is par
excellence the feminine problem and many and various are the
experiments by which she tries to resolve it  and
few are the men who learn that were won by experiment  for
man succumbs to his emotions  he cannot comprehend how it is that
into feminine emotion calculation often enters
  
as there are two classes of warriors so there are two classes of women
there is the warrior who conquers the world from sheer love of conquest
an alexander a genghis khan an attila a napoleon and there is the
warrior who captures a kingdom for the sake of possessionsuch is your
norman william
so there is the woman whom no conquest contentsaholibah cleopatra
mesalina faustine and there is the woman who is happy with a husband
and homedeborah vlmnia calpurnia mother of gracchi
  
one thing from men women cannot abide and this is a hostile and
reasonable attitude  and naturally since
it is only mans reason that is hostile to women  and
when a man clothes himself with reason as with a garment woman slinks
away  and quite naturally
reason and emotion are mortal foes and
it is on the field of emotion that the battle of love must be fought
for
in the battle of love the woman chooses and entrenches her position the
man has to act on the offensive  but
only emotion can cope with emotion reason but beats the air  wherefore
a wise man will neither oppose nor appeal to a woman through reason
  
who can penetrate to the motives of a womans coaxings yet
foolish is the man who questions the motives of a womans coaxings  yet
not to be sure of a womans coaxingsnot upon this side phlegethon is
there a more poignant position
  
in loving one woman a man believes in all women  and
not till a woman is loved are her fingertips objects of devoutest
worship   on the other hand
it cannot be said that in loving one man a woman believes in all men
which little distinction is proof perhaps that
love blinds the eyes of men but opens the eyes of women  in other
words
passion obfuscates mans prevision it does not obfuscate  a womans
man gives the rein to passion or ere he knows whither it leads
a woman gives the rein to passion only after she has found out whither it
leads  but when the goal is known perhaps
women are more implacable votaries of the implacable goddess than are
men  that is the say
a woman keeps her head till she can give her heart then she gives it
utterly
a man perhaps because he has no heart soon enough loses his head  so
before the gift a womans qualms exasperate the man
after the gift the mans indifference exasperates the woman
  
it is folly to think that love and friendship exhaust the varieties of
human relationships
the relationships between earthly souls are as complex and multiform as
those between heavenly bodies
in one thing does friendship excel love it is always reciprocal one
friend presupposes another  not so a lover
friendship is largely a masculine sentimentexcept among schoolgirls
the friendship that exists between a man and a woman should be called by
another name  it cannot be wholly platonic 3 it need not be wholly
dantesque yet women generally strive to make it the one and men often
try to make it the other  and yet again
how many women there be would if they could transmute love into
friendship that is to say
women regard a mans friendship as a delicate flattery to themselves yet
they instinctively know though they try hard to forget that a mans
friendship for a woman is extremely likely to transcend the bounds of
friendship
if only friendship would keep within bounds how many women deceive
themselves into thinking that were devoutly to be wished yet probably
as a matter of fact
the very woman who avers she regrets that your friendship is not mere
platonic would resent the platonism did it exist  possibly not every
woman will understand this  assuredly no woman will admit it and yet
it is impossible to conjecture in what an exchange of confidences may
terminate it may be a kiss or it may be a quarrel  but
confidences are evoked rather by friendship than by love
a woman will tell a man friend what she will not tell a lover
few lovers will understand this fewer still will believe it   yet it is
true and the explication of its truth would be long and complex  this
much may be said
love idealizes friendship does not  at the same time
love probes the innermost recesses of the womanly nature and until the
woman is wholly won
the woman resents the inspection of love  she knows that
to stimulate love the woman must conceal not reveal
to stimulate love the woman must conceal not reveal  furthermore
never was there a man who could be at once friend and lover
which is only one more proof that
never will the sexes understand each other
3 i use the word in its purely conventional sense
  
the male was ever the more susceptible sex   and for this reason
next to sympathy flattery is perhaps womans most effective weapon  and
no masculine shield there is which womans flattery will not pierce  for
manman alert in the hunt keen in business circumspect with his
fellows terrible in war man is pristine and simple in matters
emotional and an easy prey to emotional wiles  in the long journey of
evolution from amoeba to man
the masculine sex has developed muscle and mind
the feminine sex developed and perfected the emotions  accordingly
mans emotions are the primitive weapons of a savage
womans emotions are arms of precision  yet
sometimes woman deplores the unequal contestperhaps deplores her
tooeasy victory  since
in domestic life the weapons are laid aside the pair are then
presumablyunarmed and defenseless  for though
a mat has to be won by weapons
marriage should be a treaty of peace thenceforth the combatants are
allies
many a man when ensnared has been amazed at the size of the meshes
only a woman knows by what open methods floundering men are captured
  
he who by reasoning thinks to find out woman must either be a
philosopher or a foolprobably both
less of a philosopher and more of a fool is he who thinks to extract from
woman her reasons for her actions  the woman who can give reasons for an
action is yet to be born  the reason is plain
women act upon intuition not upon reason  and
he who could make a logical sorites out of feminine intuitions could make
a philosophical system out of nautical almanacs  and yet probably
could we only determine her orbit a womans intuitions are as exact as
the paths of the planets  unfortunately
such are the perturbations to which a womans orbit is exposed that no
masculine astronomy can construct its ephemeris  alack
how many anxious stargazers are there among men the orbit of the
ordinary male man it is not as difficult for a woman to compute inasmuch
as
the ordinary male man revolves unusually about two foci his appetites
and his ambitionswhich is the major and which the minor    
however
you may trust women to know when he is in periand when in aphelion
many a spouse has no difficulty in explaining away to her lord actions
about the character of which even his initiate friends have no shadow of
doubt  for
a womans perception is preternatural  but no it is natural enough
since
from the days of the first woman to the days of the new one love its
wiles and its whims has been the serious business of woman
  
women know much better than men that stolen bread is sweetest  in
consequence
men steal almost everything they get from womenat least they think
they do  which is the same thing
  
if the sexes were to change places more marriage licenses would be taken
out
  
frailty says man thy name is womanand then he takes advantage
of it
  
at arms length it is difficult to offer a helping hand  yet it is
hazardous to reduce that distance
  
neglect is the unpardonable sin in a womans eyes  woe to the man who is
guilty of it
  
if a woman possessed only a mans tact what fallingsout there would be
  
mans summum bonum is to combine a comfortable home with congenial club
womans summum bonum is the almost equally incompatible combination of a
wellregulated family and the height of fashionable gaiety
mans infinum malum is domestic distraction
womans infinum malum is social exile
  
between man and man to lay another under pecuniary obligation is to
jeopardize friendship  between man and woman a like cause brings about
an opposite result
  
the man with something of the feminine about him often knows better than
his more masculine rivals how to work upon feminine susceptibilities
  
most women know how much to leave to a mans imaginationbut then
man has not much imagination  besides
mans imagination is always highly complimentary to woman
  
affinity covereth a multitude of sins
  
to attract sometimes requires temporary repulsion  but
some women miscalculate their satellites orbit  with the result that
either it rushes on to certain destruction or it passes beyond the
limits of gravitation
the woman who to one man is no more than the substratum of frock and
bonnet is to another man the centre of gravity of the created cosmos
when she is such centre to more than one man her horoscope is difficult
to cast
  
when one heart lays siege to another  both sides throw up entrenchments
and this even when both belligerents are ready to negotiate for
surrender  but
never never show that you expect capitulation  and
flank movements are not to be recommended
  
in conversation the last thing a woman expects from a man is
information unless it be information concerning himself  in fact
talk is a mere subterfuge  it is what is left unsaid that tells
nevertheless
when once the troth has been plighted both m and n try to utter what has
been left unsaid  but always with indifferent success  alack and
welladay
can love ever say what it feels
  
it is difficult to say to which sex it is a greater compliment that
widows always prove such successful fascinators  either they still have
a penchant for mankind despite their intimate acquaintance with himin
which case the men may congratulate themselves or else they have so
completely found men out that they find no difficulty in entrapping them
in which case it is the womens turn to applaud
  
when our feelings are unwittingly hurt by a beautiful woman the pain is
largely tempered by a subtle pleasure which proceeds from a feeling
that inasmuch as we have been undeservedly pained we merit her
sympathy perhaps even her affection
  
women seek not so much mans esteem as his admiration  in fact
  
women would rather attract than inspireindeed by him who dared it
might be added that
women would rather be kissed than be sonnettedwhich is mighty lucky
for the majority of men
  
the most interesting man or woman iswell perhaps the one most
interested in us
the least interesting man or woman iswell perhaps the one most
interested in himor herself
  
never fear but that one woman will urge your suit with another unless
of course that other is a rival for
matchmaking is one of the most fascinating of feminine avocations
  
when a woman allows it to be understood that she considers herself
irresistible to the other sex she draws upon herself the odium of her
own  by the other sex however such a woman is very differently
regarded  indeed
men regard the avowed coquette not at all with malice but with a very
opposite feeling of which perhaps amusement admiration and a certain
amicable defiance are the chief ingredients
  
it is only mountains that are volcanic or are snowcapped the plains
know nothing of extremes of frigidity or fire
  
to the woman whom he has ceased to love the man is sometimes
unconsciously cruel
towards the man whom she has ceased to love the woman commonly acts a
part
  
for a woman to humiliate one man in the presence of another is an offence
which neither of the men is likely to forget  nor will the one man have
a less unpleasant recollection of it than the other
  
it is curious to listen to the explanations by one woman of the reasons
of the attractiveness of another woman  very apt is she to say that the
other woman is too free and easy too liberal of her favors too
expansive of her sympathy too exhibitive of her charmsahem
women know women  and
women know that women know men  and
women know that men do not know womenahemmen in this respect are
somewhat different
a man usually regards not ungenerously the qualities of his successful
rival a woman never  the former will candidly admit the possession of a
more potent charm the latter will trace it to the crudest of causes  in
a word
the unsuccessful man blames not his rival nor the women he loses but
himself
the unsuccessful woman blames never herself but either the outrageous
meretriciousness of her rival or the blindness of the man she loses
from which it may once more be deduced that
the unsuccessful woman blames never herself but either the outrageous
meretricousness of her rival or the blindness of the man she loses
from which it may once more be deduced that
men are won by more primitive means than are women  and alas for men
alas also for many women
the majority of men are so blind so abominably blind that they cannot
distinguish the women who are really in love with them from the women
who pretend to be in love with them but are not  for because
so completely do women know men that it is easy for any woman to delude
any man  this is one of the reasons why
every woman is the rival of every other woman
this woman will be herself her own true simple and virtuous self will
resort to no subterfuge adopt no meretricious methods scorn to rely
upon tactics or strategy be ever reserved reluctant shyyet fail
this other woman will openly and blatantly overtly and unconcernedly
assail the masculine heart with word and look and gestureand win
ach the purblindess of the masculine heart how it exasperates even
the woman
  
that man has sunk low who cannot recognize and respect the remnant of sex
even in a degraded woman
  
woman can persuade themselvesand menfar more easily than can a man
of the propriety of their actions
  
man is powerless before an injured woman  he has no more dangerous foe
than this
  
it is the man who seeks excuses  the woman braves it out
  
coquetry is loves ladysmaid  she is accessory and ancillary to love
she bedizens love she tricks her out in gay apparel
when loves lord and master enters my ladys maid is dismissed  it
might be as well sometimes to recall her and
nudity ousts coquetry
  
chastity is a word with as many shades of meaning as there are peoples
perhaps as there are individualsupon the face of this habitable
world
women think chastity is a virtue primarily insisted upon and enforced by
men  they mistake  t is a virtue primarily insisted upon and enforced
by women  for
when that divine unique thing love comes to a woman if she be not
chaste it is she who deplores the fact  the man may easily enough be
deceived her own heart a woman can never deceive besides
with what righteous indignation women themselves visit unchastity
  
between the sexes resentment is the worst of defensive weapons in the
hands of a man it is like a cowhide shield opposed to mauser bullets in
the hands of a woman like a parasol on a cloudy day  since
woman penetrates resentment by ridicule man treats it with dull
indifference  and
a snub from a woman is never forgotten  and for two reasons because
a the lord of creation hates to be floored by the jiujitsu of feminine
raillery and because
b the last thing a man expects from a ministering angel is mundane
mockery  besides
deliberate derision murders not only affection but admiration
  
a blush needs no apologies  why because
always a blush is spontaneous uncontrollable and
if there is any one thing a man likes to see it is a spontaneous an
uncontrollable action in woman
when the man has declared himself hers and hers alone has given proof of
the truth of such declaration has bound the woman to himself by terms
dictated by herself then but not till then the woman acts spontaneously
and without control then she blushes  but
seek not impulsive masculine lover to explore too many of the mysteries
of this thy feminine helpmeet  perchance she feels herself so much above
thee that she blushes to give the herself  perchance she regards thee so
much a symbol of the godlike that she blushes for because she is not
more worthy  but far more probably she blushes for because she betrays
to thee a mortal a divine and cosmic secret  for
there is a divine and cosmic secret hidden beneath every blush
  
ah man man peccant impulsive passionate man little knowest thou of
the divine and cosmic secret that underlies love
to thee o man it may be t is a momentary flash that irradiates the
world and reveals for a moment a sky above that world
to thee o woman t is the reverberating thunder that echoing rolls
for ever after unceasing in thy ears  is this why
between a man and a woman a single look will sometimes change the
complexion of an intimacy of a lifetime and
not until that look comesnot until eyes look into eyes with a
penetration supernaturalis acquaintanceship metamorphosed into love
  
it is a favorite fiction amongst women that a rejected suitor either will
not marry or marries the first girl he meets  because
to marry another woman after having offered inalienable and unalterable
fidelity to one would otherwise be a blow to amour propere and yet
strangely enough or perhaps not so strangely
this is a fiction but rarely maintained with regard to her own cardiac
transportations  and for this reason
woman is and knows herself to be a multiple personality
man a tyro in emotions is cast in a simpler mould  so
a woman may donate herself piecemeal or over and over again yet deem
herself perfectly loyaland perhaps naturally and legitimately for
that man who will comprehend and appreciate all the intricacies of
feminine emotion        but there is no such being existent
indeed even
selfrevelation is a task no daughter of eve has achieved
  
to sum up between men and women
the consummation of love is a bodily oblation the outcome of spiritual
obsessionmust i explain this  no i shall not  suffice it to say
that
the heavenly aphrodite is true friend to the earthly4  so
nothing offends love since love finds in all that savors of the mortal
only a symbol and epitome of the supernatural  and
there is in love a cosmic force and secret incomprehensible
incommunicable by man
is not after all love the one supreme and significant fact of the
cosmos indelible indecipherable efflorescing in man emerging from the
material idealizing the carnal pointing to an inscrutable a spiritual
goal can it be that
if we could explain love we should explain the cosmos what if we could
explain why it is that no one single isolated portion of the cosmos can
live aloneand vaunt itself in itself sufficient5 but must seek
some other single and isolated portion of the cosmos in order that that
very cosmos shall continue shall evolve shall go towards its goal   
do we put our finger here upon some curious and recondite cosmic
fact utterly transcending our mean comprehension

x on jealousy
   la jalousie    monster odieux
moliere
ware jealousy as you would ware wire for it no psychiater has yet
discovered a balm
  
to make an experiment of jealousy is to make a very hazardous experiment
indeed
  
jealousy is no proof of love for
often jealousy is but rancor under a sense of humiliation  indeed
jealousy is a sign of weakness
the lover whose selfconfidence assures him of his preeminence fears no
rival  yet
male selfconfidence is peculiarly vulnerable where women be concerned
since
as no man knows what it is appeals to a woman he does not know on what
to pride himself
even an othello is jealous of even an iago  yet
it is only the spectators who see the folly of othello
desdemonas usually are helpless as they are oblivious
  
the illicitly favored lover is never jealous of the husband but of
another illicitly favored lover how jealous he is  but
jealousy like modesty and like virtue varies with every time and
clime what is customary in cairo would rouse consternation in kent and
what goes on in vienna shocks new england  so
how the husband favored lover differs also with every time and clime
here he is mulcted in damages there he is shot down in a third place he
is tolerated
how the woman thinks her husband should treat the illicitly favored lover
that you shall never find out
  
the edacity of jealousy is unappeasable
a wronged lover  in his pain looks for more pain to bear like a martyr
in an ecstasy he cries out for further tortures  in love one always
sees higher unreachable heights in jealousy always deeper unreachable
depths  and
there is no wound but leaves its cicatrix
  
mistrust an unexpected change of front  so
does your erstwhile frowning lady smile cherchez lhomme or la femme
since
to arouse jealousy in another feminine breast is sometimes the motive of
feminine complaisance  indeed
few women can forgo an opportunity of arousing jealousy whether in a
feminine or in a masculine breastbethink thee of this little fact o
man when next thy lady comports herself thee wards ultragraciously
to see the girl of thy hearteven if so be she not thine nor not
nearly thinecomport herself with another as she does with theeah
that gives a twinge to the masculine heart  nay lesser things than this
will perturb this irascible organ that the other should admire her
charmsthat she should accept such admiration    yet what cares
she that these discomfort a man for
a mans discomfiture is naught to a woman  in sooth
take a woman to task for her conduct and with how soft an answer she
will turn away your wrath how deftly make light of your rivals
advances
  
man when he has won him a woman is in his great greed of possession
infinitely chagrined that he was not master of her past as of her present
and futurethis goes by the name of la jalousie retrospective
  
women never know quite how to regard a mans jealousy  it flatters her
yet it pains her  she is the cause of it yet she would believe it
causeless  she deplores it yet she would not have it quite away  it is
proof of love yet it is fatal to love  how to treat it puzzles her
implicit obedience to the mans wishes lowers her in her own eyes and
consequently so she thinks in his  yet so rabid is the emotion she
fears to provoke it too far  it places her in a quandary  she never
knows what will evoke it she never knows what course it will run
whether it will cement her lovers affections or whether it will
dissipate them forever
it is loves most dangerous foe and it is dangerous because it is
insidious  if there is any one thing that puts a womans wits to the
test it is a mans jealousy
  
the sheerest and most insensate folly a man can commit towards a woman is
to let her know that another woman is cognizant of her jealousy of her
he may give the latter a very keen pleasure but he gives the former a
very keen pang  for
the cause of jealousy a woman may condone the divulgence of her jealousy
she will never forgive
  
what irritates a jealous man is the actions that cause his jealousy
what irritates a jealous woman is the person who is the cause of her
jealousy  in other words
a jealous swain upbraids his mistress
a jealous mistress objurgates her rival
  
xi on kisses and kissing
sag mir wer einst das kussen efrund
das war ein gluhend glucklicher mund
er kusste und dachte nichts daberi
heine
many are the varieties of kisses as many probably as the varieties of
kisses as many probably as the variety of lipsand of the owners
thereof  and
a kiss may mean so very muchor so very little  wherefore
look not upon the lips when they are redfor although
a kiss is a small thing so is a spark  and always though
a smile is an open window a kiss is an open door
strangestrangethat from the momentary contact of lip with lip an
infinitesimal surface of epithelial tissue there an be called up from
the deeps of the soul emotions strange as deep emotions vague and
thrilling emotions to the which to give utterance those lips are
themselves all powerless  and
when to the conjoined lips there is added the bliss of an upturned eye
and embracing arms      ah welladay
there are edens for us still if only we will eat not of the forbidden
fruit
  
the value of a kiss is determined by the personage on whom it is
bestowed not by the from whom it is besought which if it needs any
explanation means this that
it is the man who ardently desires the kiss that puts the value upon that
kiss not the woman of whom it is desired  yet women know that
as with commodities so with kissings the greater the rarity the
greater the vale
osculatory transactions there be as lasting in their results as transient
in their causes
  
a cheek surreptitiously brushed in the dark is preferable to lips
premittedly pressed by day
  
what an extraordinary multiplicity of maneuvers a man will perform for
just one kiss but
with the precise numerical equivalent of the expression just one kiss
algebra has not yet been found quite able to grapple  it is believed
however to belong to permutations and combinations
there is a very decided but wholly indefinable line of demarcation
between the kissed and the unkissed woman  in other words
the status quo ante exosculationem can never be reestablished
hitherto the kisses may have been friends henceforward they may be  
they may be       but
who shall say to what kissing may lead besides
much more kissing than is supposed goes by purchase than by favor  all
which probably will be greek to the uninitiated nevertheless and at
all times and in all places
a kiss is like faith it is the evidence of things not seen the
substance of things hoped for
  
how appalling the immensity of the results due to the minutest of causes
a burning city from a lighted match a lifelong tragedy from a stolen
kiss in truth
fate is often another name for folly
  
a woman who is afraid of a kiss knows much  amongst other things
perhaps that
kisses like misfortunes rarely come singlyand bear many things in
their train
  
despite the varieties of beards and mustachios never will you hear from
your osculatrix the source of her knowledge of that variety
if by any chance the divulgence leaks outhow the girl beshrews the
mischance for though the man may hold his peace she knows that she
gives him to think
  
it takes two to make a quarrel  yes and it takes two to make the
reconciliating kiss
  
xii on engagements and on being engaged
chalepon to mae philaesai
chalepon de kai philaesai
anacreon
perhaps the pleasantest and most satisfactory period in a girls life is
the time of her first youthful engagement
never is a girl more jubilant never more buoyant never so charming so
blithesome or so debonair as when she is the gazetted abouttobe bride
of the man of her girlish choice  for
during her engagement a girl is owned and petted and
ownership and petting are dear to womenwhether young or old
ownership is proof at all events that she is of value to the manelse
the man would not sought to make her his and
petting is proof that the man properly appreciates the value  yet
meanwhile anomalous as it may sound
the engaged girl is still her own property and is practically free
besides
what more delectable to a girl than to have captured and kept a real man
this flatters her uplifts her makes of her a woman at once she holds
her head higher she carries herself with an air she shows off her
capture besides also
the engaged girl is looked up to by her compeers is congratulated y her
elders  even if she keeps the engagement secret these compeers and
congratulatresses do not sometimes alas to her detrimentin
addition to all this
what delight so unique as the preparation of the trousseau 239
trousseaut is a name of mystical import to man
a womans trousseau is symbol of two thingsand perhaps dimly indicative
of a third
i it proveswhat needs no proofthat such is the unselfish nature
of love never can it give enough never enhance too much the gifts it
gives  accordingly the bride goes to the man appareled and bedecked to
the best of her ability
ii it is a subtle tribute to the sensibility of man of the man in
love who is stimulated and pleased by dainty it may be diaphanous
raiment  lastly since even that supernal thing love is not unconcerned
with matters practical
iii it bespeaks as prophetic suspicion of the little fact that perhaps
it is well to go to her husbands home abundantly provided with dainty
raiment inasmuch as the man not in love is not always so delicately
sensible of their need
  
a girls first engagement is peculiarly sweet long does she remember
long meditatively dwell upon its pettiest incidents for if any man
dared give utterance to so outrageous an assumption
the emoluments of a promise to marry are as sweet to the donatress as
undoubtedly they are to the accepterand why not pray nevertheless
a certain practical sobriety supervenes upon subsequent affairs of the
heart  for
the recurrence of love is apt to spoil its romance  and yetand yet
it is a question which woman after woman has put herself in vain
whether t would have been wiser to have accepted and retained the
romantic love of unthinking youth or to have waited for the more sober
affection of the years of discretion
perhaps a girl hardly knows all that is meant by that thing called love
or what is entailed upon her by that thing called an engagement  she
has played with love so much that when a real and serious love is
offered her she still thinks it the toy that amused her  but
soon enough does the man if he is earnestand a man never proposes
unless he is in earnestenlighten the girl of his choice for
to a man love never is a toythough mere lust may be
men never play with love as do girls they play with lustas they
play with bats and balls and firearms
when men fall in love they fall in love with a vengeance and
the seriousness with which the man falls in love startles the girl
the man demands so much is so exacting so peremptory so unyielding so
frightfully selfish so terribly jealous of the slightest look or smile
or gesture bestowed upon any other than he that the girl      
well the girl probably begins to think either that the man is an
unreasonable brute or that her girlish notions of love were somewhat
astray  then one or two things happens either the man goes off in a
huff or the girl mends her ways
  
the recurrence of a love is a great shock to love  love thinks itself a
think unique unalterable supreme a thing not made out of the flux and
change of earthly affairs but heavenborn and descended from the skies
that it should go and come seems to destroy the fundamental conception of
love
  
the affianced man thinks he has won him the sweetest the most sacrosanct
thing that ever trode gods earth outside of eden a bundle of blisses a
compact little mass of exquisite mysteries whose every tint and curve
and motion are to him sources of wonderment and delight he is at once
humbled and exalted he thanks high heaven for the gift for that comport
himself worthy of such gift for that this wondrous and mysterious little
thing called a woman should of her own accord put herself in his arms
to be by him and by him alone cherished and nurtured till death them do
partthis indeed gives the mail heart a very sobering a very ennobling
thrill for beneath the heaving breast he so passionately loves behind
the eyes into the depths of which he so passionately looks there stirs
he knows that ineffable that indefinable thing a womans heart and
that to him has been committed the keeping of that heartthis rouses in
him the manly virtues as no other thing rouses them  strong is the man
who can live up to these emotions sage the woman who knows what she has
aroused
  
the philanderer or the flirtto whom lovemaking and lovetaking have
been a pasttimeis appalled at the seriousness of love when real love
is offered him or her  for often enough
the philanderer or the flirt thinks compliments and cajolery the food of
love in time they discover that love is a veritable sarcophagus
  
many an accepted lover both masculine and feminine tries to make up for
coldness of passion by warmness of affection a subterfuge of dubious
efficacy  for though
affection seeks affection passion is only appeased by passion  yet
when one loves passionately and the other languidly accepts it is well
perhaps for that other sometimes to be a little unfaithful to the truth
1 and to simulate an unfelt ardor  but always this is of questionable
value for
love abhors simulation of anything even of ardor
1 tennyson love and duty
  
if mutual confidence is not established at the moment of betrothal it
will never afterwards be established  and
woeful will be the plight of those between whom mutual confidence is not
then established  for
mutual confidence is the only atmosphere in which love can breathe
  
an engaged man like a hungry man is an irascible man  and
how often a fiance is sore put to it not only to satisfy him but to
pacify him
  
a woman will often blandly ask why the two rivals to her hand should not
be friends yet it is significant of much that she does her utmost to
keep them apart indeed
in no instance are a womans tact and finesse so exercised as in playing
off one man against anotherand yet usually she delights in the task
for
beingmadeloveto is to women what killingwhether of men or of
animalsis to men  in a word
to be sought after is to woman what war or the chase is to man
  
the woman a woman accepts a man then and there he becomes her lord and
master  and this she unconsciously knowsnay expects  if the man
does not then and there exercise his lordship and show his mastery he
will find it difficult to do it later on  but of course
no woman will ever be got to admit that her newlywon man is her master
nevertheless it is counsel that every man should lay to heart for
unless a woman is dominated ne not dominated over she tries to get
the upper hand  and
only two instances there are in which the woman should retain the upper
hand when the man is either a philosopher or a fool
when a man is both and the combination is not uncommon she would be a
fool if she did not retain the upper hand but
little does a woman esteem him to does not swaynay who does not
sacrifice it may be her to his will
  
of that engaged pair who can confidingly speak the one t the other of the
dawn of their mutual attraction little need be feared if they cannot
very much may be feared  for
love without confidence is as defunct as faith without works  for
if m cannot confide in n it probably means that k and l have or that o
and p will
  
so tremendous are the results of the gift of self that nature herself
seems to have ordained that the feminine sacrifice shall be utter and
complete  for
a mans interests may be many and and behold a bold girl will appear and
carry off the shy man perhaps to the lifelong chagrin and sorrow of all
three
often oh how often an awkward and sophisticated youth and a prim maid
with downcast eyes will sit together waltz together and the one never
get one inch the nearer to the other though soul and mind and body crave
a closer union  the youth would give the solid earthnay the solid
earth would be naughtto gain him the courage to clasp the maiden to
his breast yet so intense his awe he would not strain a spiders web
to risk the maids good willthe maidwho shall say what passes in
her mind that the youth should adventure she could wish yet his very
hesitancy bespeaks his devotion true  were he to fall about her neck
embrace her close and demand the kiss of lovemost like she would
recoil aghastat first yet if he desistedshe would also recoil
aghastwhat should he do poor awkward youth what sheone thing
onlookers will do smile and simper and smile again but in their
inmost heart of hearts they will envy that awkward youth that simple
maid  for because in this the first symptoms of unsolicited and
reciprocal love they will recognize something of the divine and mystical
nature of love itself of love untrammeled by convention or law of love
itself in its purity its intensity its diffidence its terrifying yet
restraining force

xiii on marriage and married life
ariston andri ktaema sympathaes gunae
hippothoon
marriage laws are framed not for or by the likes and dislikes of men and
women but by the exigencies of social often of political economy
therefore
men and womens likes and dislikes are obliged to conform to the usages
demanded by social and political economy so
in turkey women accept with a good grace the custom of a plurality of
wives in tibet men accept with good grace a plurality of husbands  in
the western world    humph
always will there be everywhere prevalent a latent hostility between the
likes and dislikes of men and women on one hand and the laws enforced by
a social and political community on the other  this is why
always there will be those who will try to reform the marriage state
some looking only to the likes and dislikes of men and women others only
to the advantages which shall accrue to the state  so
some there will be will always advocate a loosening of the marriage bond
others who will seek to make it indissoluble  both should remember that
the unit of the state is the family therefore the state makes laws not
to suit the tastes or convenience of the husband and the wife but for
the good and preservation of the family  all of which surely is right
and proper since
it is the business of the state to make laws governing the welfare of the
generations to come  in fine
the childrenthey are the pivot about which all matrimonial
controversies should turn
reformers of marriage laws should seek a preventative not a cure since
it is doubtful whether the ills of matrimony are really curable for
generally speaking
matrimonial incompatibility is a malignant not a benignant disease its
prognosis is doubtful nor does it run a regular course
  
many are the women who soon after marriage silently turn over in their
minds this little problem whether it were better to marry the man they
loved but who did not love them or to marry the man who loved them but
to whom they were indifferent  and
the man a woman ultimately marries will give her no clue to the solution
and for the following reasons
i he fond wight does not know that any such problem is agitating her
little brain and
ii she of course dare not divulge the factors of the problem in
short
most marriages are brought about by the following simple yet fateful
consideration the man marries the woman he wants the woman marries the
man who wants her  the two propositions though apparently identical
often produce results very far from identical  and yet
sometimessometimesthat glorious dream comes true in which a hale
and heartwhole youth implants the first pure passionate kiss upon the
lips of a hale and heartwhole girlah happy twain for them the sun
shines the great earth spins and constellations shed their selectest
influence  t is a dream that all youth dreams  t is a dream makes
wakeful life worth living
ah the wild dream of youth the maenad dream the springtime dream
of the maid the dim dim dream of stalwart man offering a love supreme
without alloy and taking forceful a love as flawless as supreme a
steady breast on which to lean strong circling arms a face set firm
against the world a face that softens only to her upturned eyes that
seek the lover who is hers and hers alone a dream of music color and
the swaying dance of rivals splendidly outshone of home and friends
and trappings of raiment retinue of ordered bliss and by and by in a
still dimmer faroff time a time unwhispered to herself of
babyfingers baby lips      
of the youthful man a vivid dream involved unsteady shifting a dream
of lust and love and smoke and flame and fame of cuirass and horse and
saber of blood  and battle of high place  of many dominated by his
look and gesture of mighty man and orders issued preemptory not to be
gain said also of lithe arms a supple waist sweetlysoft entwining
limbs a gentle girlish woman all his own who never was anothers and
always will be his and an heir and household godsah the wild dream
of youth
youths dream ye while ye may and you ye aged i charge ye do not wake
them it is the dream makes wakeful life worth living  and yetand
yet
sometimessometimes alack and fie for shame things come to such a
pass between husband and wife that a modus viviendi has to be tacitly
agreed upon  in that case alas
too often between husband and wife it depends upon who is the better
actor and liarto their shame be it said  but before this happens
much else must have happened  for
here and there ahem we meet a woman who is like the moon she circles
sedately round and dutifully faces the planet to which she is united
but that planet does not know that she is irradiated and warmed by a
fardistant suna sun which symbolizes ahem duty or necessity or
affection for her children or tell it not in gath affection for
another
and here and there ahem we meet a man who like the sun shines
steadfastly enough upon his own earth but shines also all unbeknown to
earth upon other earthsand errant cometsand small aerolites
  
as it is usually physical or sentimental characteristics that bring a man
and a woman into the field of mutual attraction so it is generally
physical or sentimental characteristics that drag them apart  thus
a clever wife will put up with a stupid husband and an intellectual man
will get on admirably with a dull but domestic woman  but
if either party to the marriage contract disregards or is unable to
appease the demands made upon him or her for sympathy or emotion there
is likely to be trouble for
sentiment not intellect is the cementing material in marriage and
if a man and wife cannot effuse a mutual sentiment gradually they will
grow apart  indeed
the demands of the emotions are at once more imperious and tyrannical
and more fastidious and critical than are the demands of the mind  of
all of which what is the moral  this
the married pair who would live in amity not to say in affection must
so live as that each shall persuade the other is the sole personage under
the roof of heaven that he or she desires  alas
the unwritten motto of many a married couple is the heart knoweth its
own bitterness
  
marriage reveals the moods of a man
what is an ideal marriage that perhaps in which the man is to the woman
at once friend husband and lover  but some people prefer these
functions distinct
that is a happy marriage in which a womans husband is also her
confidant and always
husband and wife should move like binary stars revolving about a common
centre mutually attractive and unless closely viewed presenting a
single impression
  
matrimony is sometimes a terrible iconoclast  whether it throws down the
images of false or of true gods depends on the religion of the
worshipper
  
it would be difficult sometimes to determine whether constancy was an
autogenous or enforced virtue
  
never play pranks with your wife your horse or your razor
  
there is a thing which not gold nor favor nor even love can buy  its
true name is secret but it is content to be called sympathy
accordingly
let no man or woman think when he or she has won wife or husband all has
been won that is necessary  for
if sympathy cannot be gained from one quarter it will probably be sought
in another
  
at the moment of the formation of a matrimonial syndicate of two each
member of this as yet unincorporated jointstock company verily believes
that each has put into the concern his whole real and personal property
yet it is to be feared that although
the woman possibly invests her whole capital the manoften no
doubt unwittingly to himselfretains not a few unmatured bonds and
debentures  that is to say
love it is to be feared is often enough a bargain in which the woman
comes off secondbest  for
a woman gives herself man accepts the gift
rarely if ever does a man give himself  he cannot  his work his
play his politics his friends his clubthese are matters to him
highly important
to a woman the only highly important things are her husband and her
home
  
a woman rules until she tries to rulewhich will be an enigma to many
out of a wifes obedience will grow her governance never out of her
dominancethose who think this sheer nonsense are welcome to think
so  but it is worth thinking about
  
a man ought to rule his wife  granted  but he cannot do this unless he
rules himself  the colonel of a regiment cannot command if he himself
breaks the kings or the states regulations  and
an uncontrolled wife deems her husband indifferentor weak
the number of husbands who though they think they rule yet in reality
are ruled  would astonishnot their wives but themselves
it is customary to call the man the head of the household yet between
man and wife it is a question after all whether it is not the stronger
will and the cooler judgment that should and generally does guide the
family independent of sex or custom
  
as in the solar spectrum so in love beyond and intermingled with the
visible rays of passion are numerous actinic but invisible rays of
affection invisible to careless spectators but known and felt by the
recipients  these too must be introduced if the connubial domicile is
to be warmed as well as illuminated
  
the marriage tie loosens all other ties  in fact
neither men or women are always aware of the absoluteness of the marriage
tie thenceforward the woman belongs not to her own people hardly to
herselfas to the man well
often a wife will actually be jealous of the time and attention her
husband spends on things and matters unconnected with herhis work
his playhis politicshis friendshis club
  
many are there who still believe that the marriage service like a legal
indenture irrevocably entails the whole estate of a human heart  in
sober truth
there never was a married couple yet who had not to purchase their own
happiness  and
the only charms that increase in value as time goes on are the charms of
character beside these those of person and even those of mind are
weak  in short
in marriage as in every human relationship it is character that avails
and prevails naught else
  
chemists draw a distinction between a chemical and a mechanical mixture
moralists might discover the same in marriage
  
to encircle monogamy with an everincreasing halo of romancethat is a
problem deserving of study
monogamy is one of the disharmonies of life it seems as i have said to
be the decree of politics rather than of nature
but surely polygamy or polyandry would be more disharmonious still
  
marriage renders no one immune  that is to say
unless husband and wife both avoid infection both can catch amatory
fevers
  
the woman who has learned how to minister to a mans creature comforts
has learned much  and
it has disconcerted many a young wife to discover how important a part of
her education this is since
it is certainly sometimes hard to reconcile a suitors poetic
protestations with a spouses prosaic requisitions
  
in the game of life a man may venture many stakes a womans fate is
determined by a single throw of the dice  thus
how often it happens that a young and inexperienced maid will look about
her will weigh and consider will pick and choose and when she thinks
she has found a man to her purpose will set her cap at him will attract
him enslave him bring him to her feet make him propose accept him as
husband give him all the sweets of engagement regard herself and
proclaim herself his affianced brideall with most prudentialit may
be most praiseworthymotives  on a sudden the man discovers that
this was no real attachment but a fictitious almost an enforced one
that the methods so he thinks were artificial the results delusive
what happens the man withdrawspolitelygallantly twas a mistake
he is sorry they are unsuited he did not know his own mind he is
sorryand so on and so forth  they separate  and in this
concatenation of circumstances action for breach of promise is out of
the questionbesides often enough the girl through pride or
through sheer chagrin at the indifference of the man pretends
acquiescencewhat happens to the man nothing  if his senses were
stirred he himself is heartwhole  he gave nothing he merely received
he proposes again to somebody else is accepted marries happily rears a
family what happens to the girl everything  the man gave her nothing
she gave allher lips her looks the recesses of her heart the
premonitions of the gift of her self for when she leant on him looked
up to him clung to him felt his strong encircling arms was perturbed
by his ardor she gave that which was not to give again  such woman is
to be pitied  for however much she may strive to make it appear that
she gave nothing that she had all to give again not even her own soul
will bear her witness and sooner or later a subsequent lover and such
girl accepts the first lover that offers will find a void where he hoped
to find an inexhaustible treasure  for the woman cannot forever keep up
a fictitious affection and languid looks and eyes that will not
brighten and smiles which are so evidently forced bespeak her
sympathies elsewherebut as heine said this is an old story often
repeated 1  wherefore
let us pity women the dice they throw are their heartsand they have
only one throwwhen they have thrown away their heartspity women
men have so many dice to throw income status title virility fortune
fame good spirits good connections good looks an air a figure a
soulstirring voice manners breeding force a good name a good bank
account  the pity o it is that
the whole marriage question revolves about a single point
the man wants him a womana woman who shall be his and only his
the woman wants her a head of a home  and here again and once again we
see the difference between the sexes
the one thing that the man wants is a mate
the one thing that a woman wants is a head and provider of a
household
the mans thoughts never go beyond the woman
the womans thoughts always and at once travel far beyond the manto
the children the household the home this is great natures inexorable
law  but little knows the woman and less knows the man that the nubile
girl is merely obeying great natures inexorable law
what price woman pays for her high office for in this implicit
unquestioning and unconscious obedience to nature she performs perhaps
her highest function  on all accounts therefore let us
pity women they obey so faithfully great natures law and nature  so
often plays them falseso very false and so very often  besides
the woman who gives her hand without her heart finds in time that she has
made a sorry bargaina sorrier bargain perhaps that the woman who
gives her heart with out her hand  for
passionately as a man desires a woman the passionatelydesired woman
will in time discover that unless she gives her heart with her hand her
gift suffers depreciation  and
unless a woman gives her heart how can she give her aid surely
unless a mans armor is buckled on for the strife of life by feminine
sympathy the fight is apt to be a sorry one at best since
a womans true business is to back her husband if she leaves him in the
lurch there is little hope for him  for of a truth
the strongest man is handicapped in the struggle for existence unless he
knows and feels that his wife is at his sidenot pushing him so much as
leaning upon him

to simulate passion for an hour is possible to simulate a lifelong
lovethat is hard  for
love is a thing unique and unalterable in spite of its various alloys
clip the coin and it will not pass current  for
ideal matrimony is founded on a monometallic basis no amount of silver
will be accepted for gold  and yet
how often m loves and n accepts the love poor m also in the long run
poor n
that indeed is a happy marriage where m gives and wants just what n
wants and gives where m and n just want each other  for
give and take is the rule of a community of two as it is of a community
of ten thousand
the ideal and probably impossible industrial community is that in which
demand and supply are in exact equipoise  the same holds good in
matrimony
in wedlock a virtuous has probably less force than a vicious example
that is to say
a frivolous spouse is more apt to drag the couple down than is a serious
spouse apt to lead the couple up and
many a mate there is both masculine and feminine feels like a packmule
treading a precipitous pass
  
of every audrey her touchstone should be able proudly to say a poor 
  thing sir but mine own  in other words
the homely violet deserves as tender cherishing as the rare exotic
  
what portion of himself or herself any one complicated physical and
psychological human being really and truly conveys to another by means
of the simple contract known as the plighted troth or that of a larger
deed called the called the solemnization of matrimony is a riddle
difficult of solution and as to how much one may claim on the strength
of one or other of these indentures that is a more difficult problem
still
in no amatorial contract probably is it possible to include or to
enumerate all the hereditaments messuages or appurtenances involved
certainly
how great so ever the community of interest m and n remain for ever m
and n
is there not always something in the eternal feminine which cannot
quite coalesce with the ephemeral masculine probably
trust your wife with your purse and seven times out of ten it will grow
heavy
  
many a woman by man is accepted at her face value
many a man by woman is taken on trust  it is difficult to tell whether
more bad debts are contracted by giving credit than by taking at face
value  for
the promissory note of marriage is undated and unendorsed  but
children act as collateral security
  
how often a girl even an affianced girl accustomed to a multiplicity of
admirers forgets the man of her ultimate choice she must then and there
set above all other claimants
if the man the woman chooses for husband does not stand in her estimation
absolutely first and all other claimants nowhere there is bound sooner or
later to be trouble  for
no man will play second fiddle to any body or any thing and
the realm amatory is a monarchial not a republican one  in all realms
there must be a ruler whether elected or hereditary
always a divided sway results in schism whether in the family or in the
state  and although
often enough the wife proves herself the more effective sovereign the
forms of monarchy must be conceded to the man even though the executive
is left to the woman
  
how often the only breast to which one can go on to rain out the heavy
mist of tears is the one inhibited
  
two wills are not so easily blended into one as that the task may be left
to cupid  yet
unless cupid has a hand in blending two wills it is bound to be a sorry
business at best
always and in all wedlock there comes a time when will conflicts with
will
if both wills are inflexible one must breakor both will fly apart
but
love and tact will relieve many a strain  though sometimes one discovers
that
human eyes have a certain store of tears  it is not difficult to weep
them all away  however
in the final rupture between man and wife it is the children that turn
the scales  but o ye young husbands and wives remember that
youth regards the whole world as its friend age finds itself desolate in
the midst of friends  wherefore
o youth cleave unto the wife of thy bosom since
a loving wife is worth a multitude of friends
sweet are friends and fame is sweet but sweeter far a wifely heart
whereon to lay a weary head  but
each married pair must solve its own difficulties as best it can  if any
advice were worth the offering it would be this
o ye husbands and o ye wives if not for your own sakes then for your
childrens lead a straight clean honorable life any other sort of
life leads to despicability to dismalness to disasterwhich only
means after all that
in the marriage relation as in every relationthe social the
industrial the commercial the politicalit is conduct it is
character that counts nothing else

xiv on this human heart
the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can
know it
holy writ
it does not take much to make two hearts beat faster than one
  
the heart can deceive itself when it cannot deceive anotherwhich
will be cold comfort to some lovers though it may console others
  
to admit a sacred visitant into the inner recesses of the human heart
those recesses must be neat indeed  remember too that you can
never expect an angel to act as a charwoman the sweeping must be done by
the owner  lastly
unless each heart is permitted access to the other their union is
fictitious perhaps perilousexplain these tropes who can
  
no man can tell to whom a womans heart belongs not even the man who
calls the woman his  and
let no man imagine that when he has won him a woman he has won him a
womans heart  since
sometimes a woman will give her heart to one man and her troth to
another  besides
many a heart is hard to readespecially if it is a palimpsest  indeed
many are illegible to their owners  nevertheless
that the woman should not know her own heart as so often happens
terrifies the woman as much as it exasperates the man  yet
that must be a curious love that causes the heart to hesitate  and yet
many a man has debated for months whether to propose or not and
sometimes a woman will accept on a friday the man that she refused
pointblank of a tuesday  but perhaps
where the heart hesitates it is not so much a case of love as a case of
convenience  for
an overwhelming love leaves the heart of either doubt or debate  but
alas
the human heart seems to be an anatomical engine of such intricate and
delicate mechanism that its workings are uncontrollable even by its
owner
is a constant heart as hard a thing to manufacture in the world of life
as is an immobile thing in the world of matter and matter so they say
is immobile only at absolute zerowhen bereft of even molecular motion
a thing impossible to produce and which to produce would require
incalculable pressure and almost incalculable cold
is there no chemical formula for fixing the impression of the heart
who really held burns his heart in thrall nelly fitzpatrick or mary
campbell or ellison begbie or margaret chalmers or charlotte hamilton or
jenny cruikshank or anne park or jean armour or mrs whelpdale or mrs
agnes mclehose and who the heart of goethegretchen or kitty shonkopf
or frederica brion or charlotte buff or lily shonemann or the countess
augusta or charlotte van stein or bettina brentano or mariana von
willemeror his wife christina vulpius
however whether it is a provision of nature or whether it is due to the
perversity of man probably the feminine heart is far more constant than
the masculine and perhaps any one of goethes or of burns his inamoratas
would have clung to him had he been faithful to her  and yet
would you have had shelley stick to harriet westbrooke and how shall one
interpret his feelings for amelia viviani  what would have happened if
keats had lived and married fanny brawneshe who flirted with somebody
else while he was sick and did not even know that he was a poet yet she
was an inspiration to keats as mary godwin and amelia viviani were to
shelley 1 ought byron to have said no to claire or lady caroline
lamb or the countess guiccioli or any one of the many maids and matrons
that besieged his heart could anything have kept rosina wheeler and
bulwer lytton side by siderosina wheeler to whom before marriage
lytton could find write oh my dear rose where shall i find words to
express my love for you and to whom after marriage he wrote madam
the more i consider your conduct and your letter the more unwarrantable
they appear
god in heaven what a pitiful game it all is and alas as george sand
says all this you see is a game that we are playing but our heart
and life are the stakes and that has an aspect which is not always
pleasing 2
1 see the dedication of the revolt of islam and see the
epipsychidion
2 letter to alfred de musset
  
many a mans heart has been treated as a football  yes but many a
womans heart has been treated as a shuttlecock
  
human beings there areboth men and womenout of whom at a mere
touch virtue seems to go converse with them is stimulating contact
enthralling  and yet
powerful as physical or as mental attraction may be permanently to
retain the attracted object requires a profounder force  perhaps
though
beauty and grace and brilliancy may attract it is only something far
more deepseated that retains  in other words
charm of body and mind may appeal to body and mind only the heart
appeals to the heart  those who know not this and they are
many permit the heart to leak through the senses with the result that
when demands are made upon the heart that cistern is found to have run
dry  so
to philanderers and to flirts when a great and true love comes they do
not comprehend it and they cannot appreciate it wherefore
wouldbe lover keep thy heart intact until it be required of thee
  
you need not imagine that because you have once been permitted to see
some way down into a human heart that you will necessarily ever again be
so permitted
  
hard words break no bones  but they often break hearts
  
drink is too often the refuge of the masculine and a rich husband the
refuge of the feminine broken heart
  
extreme youth thinks the world is a toyshopwhere anything may be had
for the asking old age regards it as a museumwhere nothing may be
touched
  
no heart under repeated temperings can remain forever keen  and
as a little body sometimes has a very big pain so an aching heart
wonders that it can bear so much   and
what takes place in the quiet deeps of a troubled heart who shall know
  
the way to the heart is not through the head
between heart and heart there are many channels  but three are in
universal use the eyes the lips and the fingertips  now the
greatest of these is the eyes
  
the masculine heart will never wholly understand the feminine nor the
feminine the masculine o the pity o it and yet after all
the human heart is much more the same whether it beats under a cuirass
or under a corset
between the masculine heart and the feminine perfect frankness is
perhaps of questionable import  but why it is difficult to say
perhaps because
the aspirations and desires of the human heart are infinite and
unappeasable  to attempt to formulate them is to frustrate them  for
it is as impossible for any two human hearts  as it is impossible for
any two material things to occupy the same space  especially when we
remember that
between the masculine heart and the feminine is a great gulf fixed  nay
rather
from youth to age each human heart seems unwittingly to build about
itself a high and ever highergrowing wall impenetrable indelapidable
not to be scaled by the look or speech or gesture
never can heart coalesce with heart  and yet
the absolute and intimate coalescence of heart with heartis not this
after all the consummation that every lover seeks to attempt that
consummation by mere speech it is this that is of questionable import
since
between heart and heart speech is the paltriest of channels
what a thinyet what an invisible and impenetrablefilm separates
those two worlds the one that of the visible audible and tangible
the world of chatter and laughter of convention often of makebelieve
and the other the world of deep and voiceless emotions of the feelings
which know not how to give themselves utterance of affections which
crave so much and are so impotent to say or to seek what they crave it
is like a layer of ice separating the hidden and soundless deeps from the
aerial world of noise and motionwhat would not one heart give to
break the icy crust and see and know what was really passing in another
and how often we drown if we do break through
the isolation of the individual human heart is complete  it is the most
pathetic past in the universe and it is that against which the
individual human heart rebels most
there must be some profound and cosmic problem underlying this fact which
no philosophyand no religioncan solve  that it is pathetic seems
to prove it temporary earthly a matter of time and space  but when
will the individual human heart coalesce with the heart of the universe
which perhaps is the goal of all life for
it may be that these little terrestrial human individuals which we call
men and women are after all only tiny and temporary centers of conscious
activity in an ocean of infinite consciousness as atoms are but tiny and
temporary centers of energy in an ocean of infinite ether  could we see
the sum total of supreme and infinite consciousness at a glance perhaps
individual men and women would dissolve into a mighty unity could see
and comprehend the whole of the luminiferous ether  well perhaps
love is the only known means by which the individual heart can make any
expansion whatsoever beyond its own bounds  yet alas
nothing seems to break down the barriers of sense  the human heart beats
its ineffectual wings in vain against the walls of its fleshly
tabernacle  will nothing unite the boy and the girl will nothing bring
the man and the woman really together yet the boy thinks that were the
girl wholly his he and she would be happy and the man thinks that were
the woman and he to share every thought and every emotion he and she
would want naught else  is the amalgamation impossible is the
coalescence of thought and feeling outside the bounds of human
possibility what then impels mankind to crave it to attempt it to
sacrifice so much for itthere is a cosmic puzzle here with which nor
philosophy nor psychology nor religion has yet attempted to grapple
after all pitiful as it may be lamentable as it may be it is true and
it must be said that this human heart of ours goes through life hungry
very hungry and unappeased   for what it hungers what it has missed
whereto it looks for sustenance it itself does not know  thus
this feminine heart sighs without ceasing for because that other
masculine heart upon which it staked all its all and an all that meant
so much proved callous and indifferent
that masculine heart ceases not to curse itself for resorting to such
hasty and violent methods by which to obtain for itself an ephemeral and
passing pleasure
this feminine heart eats out its life with remorse for because it gave
itself so unthinkingly when asked  though of a survey it thought that
asking was a thing prompted by impulses as noble as they seemed divine
and
that masculine heart when the tidal wave of heated passion has subsided
wonders how it was led captive by lures so deceptive and untried
m regrets and regrets in vain that he did not await a purer and more
permanent passion and
n chews for a lifetime the cud of persistent remorse for an hours
poignant pleasure
ach this human heart knows nothing of itself nor anything of its fellow
beating hearts  if it follows its bent it is cracked if it holds
itself in leash it aches  if it calls reason to aid its soaring hopes
are dashed its romance spoiled and it itself reduced to the level of a
machine that calculates  if it acts on impulse and meeting a heart that
beats so it thinks in unison unites itself with it often enough that
other soon palpitates to a different rhythm or itself cannot keep time
and all things go awry
poor aching beating human heart it cannot reason it cannot count the
cost  to it seems that impulse divine and mighty impulse is the sole
law of the earth in time it learns that impulse the mightiest the
divinest though it may be law in heaven is sometimes a veritable
nemesis on earth it gives freely gladly without compunction it finds
the gift rewarded by consequences too pitiful for tears
alas this human heart can no one advise it is there no advice will help
it must it always go wrong and always sufferwell
if one loves one dare not reason if one reasons it is difficult to
love
  
there seems to be something cosmic something transcending the bounds of
the visible and tangible universe in the desires and cravings of this
same human heart this little human heart beating blindly beneath a
waistcoat or a blouse  its owner is little bigger than a beetle or an
ant and the habitat of that owner is a speck in space a pygmy in
comparison with sirius or arcturus and invisible from the
ultratelescopic confines of vision
what it makes the desires and cravings of this human heart more
important more importunate to its owner than the measuring of the
vastest space why is it that the longings the hopes the
disappointments the desperate aspirations and the passionate loves of
little human hearts should cause to their possessors such prepotent
commotions such poignant qualms rigel and betelgeuse and algol rush
through space and about them probably circle numerous planets inhabited
by countless and curious beings each and all perhaps possessing hearts
as perturbable as our own  and yet if our own little earthly jack
cannot get our own little earthly jill what cares jack what happens to
vega or capella or to the great nebula in orion jack wants jill and
that want is to jack the only thing in the sidereal heavens that matters
the curious and perhaps semicomical but whollypathetic thing about the
whole matter is this that though undoubtedly our little planet is part
of and has a place in this great sidereal universe and consequently all
our jacks and jills are related to all the jacks and jills everywhere
else yet each little human heart behaves as it were the only heart in
the sumtotal of created things if it enjoys it calls upon all that is
to congratulate it if it suffers it cries aloud to high heaven to
avenge its wrongs it comports itself as if it and it alone were the only
sensitive things in existencethat is curious  that it wrongs may
have been wrought by itself that is fate may have been determined in the
reign of chaos and old night or ere even cosmic nebulae were born it
does not dream if jill is indifferent or jack moroseeither is enough
to cause jack or jill to curse god and die  is there some archetypal and
arcanal secret in this the extreme the supernal egoism of the human
heart
of all of which what is the moralhumph frankly i do not know what
is the moral  only this i see that each little heart creates its own
little universe the bees the that of its hive and the fields mans
that of his earth and the stars  what may be above or beyond the stars
man no more knows than the bee knows what is beyond the fields  the
heartbe it mans or a beesis the centre of its selfmade sphere
some day perhaps mans sphere will extend as far beyond the stars as
today it extends beyond the fields  thenwho knowsperhaps
unlimited senses and an uncircumcised intellect may find themselves
commensurate with this highaspiring heart and an emancipated and
ecstatic jack unite with a congenial jill
that there is a universe is apparent that it is one and complete we
suppose that there are in it jacks and jills is indubitable that these
jacks and jills crave mutual support sympathy love friendship
wifehood sistership companionship brotherhood is also indubitable
if therefore the whole scheme of the universe is not a farce what does
this craving of love for lover mean and yet
it is quite impossible to conceive of a universe of love in which all
the claims of heart and soul and senses shall be eternally and infinitely
satisfied nevertheless on this little earth perhaps
ill betides the heart that leans overmuch on another for alas
not even the entire immolation of one heart for another will satisfy that
otherindeed indeed
in this life would one seek comfort and solace one must seek itin
ones own self or in ones god  for
only one of two things can comfort to put the world under ones feet
or to keep a god over ones head only
he who is captain of his soul or he who commits his soul to god can
rise above fate
there is a vacuum in every human heart  and the human heart abhors it as
much as nature
what will fill this cardiac void no mortal to this moment has found out
art cries beauty and tries to depict it philosophy cries truth
and strives to define it religion cries good and does its best to
embody it and numberless lesser voices in the wilderness cry power
or gold or workwhich is a narcotic or excitementwhich is
an intoxicant and a manytoned changeful siren with sweetlysaddening
music cries love  and one pursues a phantom and another clasps a
shadow and a third cloaks his eyes with a transparent veil or steeps
his senses in floods that will not drownno what the human heart
wants it does not know  and what is more
pathetic problem amongst problems pathetic often it puzzles this human
heart to distinguish between the things which it is right and proper to
seek wherewith to fill that void and the things which are wrong and
improper  furthermore
how apt is the heart to seek in the illegitimate for the satisfaction
which the legitimate fails to giveproblems ancient as eden
what does it want this human heart what does it so earnestly desire so
strenuously seek all about it and about are beauty friendship mirth
and gladness the sea and the earth and the sky color and music and
song and to each if he wills it wife or husband and children and
homewanting iswhatah
one lesson this human heart has to learn so easy to put into words so
difficult to carry out by deed is this
to get the human heart must give
the heart eats out itself causes its own emptiness creates its own
void
the selfish and egoistical life breeds always the vapid and vacuous
heart
would you appease your own hunger feed the hungry hearts around you
do you crave fullness of joy give joy to the joyless
would you fill your own cavity satisfy your craving attain your desire
find what you seek givegivegive  the more the better for
the greater the donation the greater the repletion
nature gives gives lavishly wantonly unquestioningly
every atom of soil every drop of sap goes to produce flowers and fruit
and seed root and branch and leaf are but carefully constructed means by
which to transmute sunshine and soil and flower and fruit and seed  no
tree lives for itself
shall then this human heart live for itself gather and store up for
its own delectation for its own good
there is no such thing as ones own good
goodness is mutual is communal is only guided by giving and receiving
wherefore
o frail weak human heart seek thou out carefully constructed means by
which to transmute sunshine and soil and showers into flowers and fruit
