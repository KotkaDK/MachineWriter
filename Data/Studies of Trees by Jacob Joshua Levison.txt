preface
in presenting this volume the author is aware that there are several
excellent books dealing with one phase or another of tree life already
before the public it is believed however that there is still need for
an allround book adapted to the beginner which gives in a brief and
not too technical way the most important facts concerning the
identification structure and uses of our more common trees and which
considers their habits enemies and care both when growing alone and
when growing in groups or forests
in the chapters on the identification of trees the aim has been to
bring before the student only such characters and facts as shall help
him to distinguish the tree readily during all seasons of the year
special stress is laid in each case on the most striking peculiarities
possible confusion with other trees of similar appearance is prevented
as far as possible through comparisons with trees of like form or habit
only such information is given concerning the structure and requirements
of trees as will enable the reader better to understand the subsequent
chapters in the second half of the book practical application is made
of the students general knowledge thus acquired and he is acquainted
with the fundamental principles of planting care forestry wood
identification and nature study
the author recognizes the vastness of the field he is attempting to
cover and the impossibility of even touching in a small handbook of
this character on every phase of tree study he presumes no further
yet he hopes that by adhering to what is salient and by eliminating the
less important though possibly interesting facts he is able to offer
a general and elementary rsum of the whole subject of value to
students private owners farmers and teachers
in the preparation of chapter viii on our common woods their
identification properties and uses considerable aid has been received
from prof samuel j record author of economic woods of the united
states acknowledgment is also due to the us forest service for the

introduction
a good many popular books on trees have been published in the united
states in recent years the continually increasing demand for books of
this character indicates the growing public interest not only in the
trees that we pass in our daily walks but also in the forest considered
as a community of trees because of its aesthetic and protective value
and its usefulness as a source of important economic products
as a nation we are thinking more about trees and woods than we were
wont to do in the years gone by we are growing to love the trees and
forests as we turn more and more to outdoor life for recreation and
sport in our ramblings along shady streets through grassy parks over
wooded valleys and in mountain wildernesses we find that much more than
formerly we are asking ourselves what are these trees what are the
leaf flower twig wood and habit characteristics which distinguish
them from other trees how large do they grow under what conditions of
soil and climate do they thrive best what are their enemies and how can
they be overcome what is their value for wood and other useful
products what is their protective value are they useful for planting
along streets and in parks and in regenerating forests how can the
trees of our streets and lawns be preserved and repaired as they begin
to fail from old age or other causes all these questions and many more
relating to the important native and exotic trees commonly found in the
states east of the great lakes and north of maryland mr levison has
briefly answered in this book the authors training as a forester and
his experience as a professional arboriculturist has peculiarly fitted
him to speak in an authoritative and interesting way about trees and
woods
the value of this book is not in new knowledge but in the simple
statement of the most important facts relating to some of our common
trees individually and collectively considered a knowledge of trees
and forests adds vastly to the pleasures of outdoor life the more we
study trees and the more intimate our knowledge of the forest as a unit
of vegetation in which each tree each flower each animal and insect
has its part to play in the complete structure the greater will be our
admiration of the wonderful beauty and variety exhibited in the trees
and woods about us

studies of trees
chapter i
how to identify trees
there are many ways in which the problem of identifying trees may be
approached the majority attempt to recognize trees by their leaf
characters leaf characters however do not differentiate the trees
during the other half of the year when they are bare in this chapter
the characterizations are based as far as possible on peculiarities
that are evident all year round in almost every tree there is some one
trait that marks its individuality and separates it at a glance from
all other trees it may be the general form of the tree its mode of
branching bark bud or fruit it may be some variation in color or in
case of the evergreen trees it may be the number and position of the
needles or leaves the species included in the following pages have thus
been arranged in groups based on these permanent characters the
individual species are further described by a distinguishing paragraph
in which the main character of the tree is emphasized in heavy type
the last paragraph under each species is also important because it
classifies all related species and distinguishes those that are liable
to be confused with the particular tree under consideration
group i the pines
illustration fig 1twig of the austrian pine
how to tell them from other trees the pines belong to the coniferous
    class of trees that is trees which bear cones the pines may be
    told from the other coniferous trees by their leaves which are in
    the form of needles two inches or more in length these needles
    keep green throughout the entire year this is characteristic of all
    coniferous trees except the larch and cypress which shed their
    leaves in winter
illustration fig 2twig of the white pine
    the pines are widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere
    and include about 80 distinct species with over 600 varieties the
    species enumerated here are especially common in the eastern part of
    the united states growing either native in the forest or under
    cultivation in the parks the pines form a very important class of
    timber trees and produce beautiful effects when planted in groups
    in the parks
how to tell them from each other the pine needles are arranged in
    clusters see fig 1 each species has a certain characteristic
    number of needles to the cluster and this fact generally provides
    the simplest and most direct way of distinguishing the different
    pines
    in the white pine there are five needles to each cluster in the
    pitch pine three and in the scotch pine two the austrian pine
    also has two needles to the cluster but the difference in size and
    character of the needles will distinguish this species from the
    scotch pine
the white pine pinus strobus
distinguishing characters the tree can be told at close range by the
    number of needles to each cluster fig 2 there are five needles
    to each cluster of the white pine they are bluish green slender
    and about four inches in length
    at a distance the tree may be told by the right angles which the
    branches form with the main trunk fig 3 no other pine shows this
    character
form and size a tall tree the stateliest of the evergreens
range eastern north america
soil and location prefers a deep sandy soil but will grow in almost
    any soil
enemies sucking insects forming white downy patches on the bark and
    twigs the white pine weevil a boring insect and the white pine
    blister rust a fungus are among its principal enemies
illustration fig 3the white pine
value for planting aside from its value as an ornamental tree the
    white pine is an excellent tree to plant on abandoned farms and for
    woodlands and windbreaks throughout the new england states new
    york pennsylvania and the lake states
commercial value the wood is easily worked light durable and will
    not warp it is used for naval construction lumber shingles
    laths interior finish wooden ware etc
other characters the fruit is a cone four to six inches long
comparisons the tree is apt to be confused with the bhotan pine
    pinus excelsa which is commonly grown as an ornamental tree
    the bhotan pine however has needles much longer and more drooping
    in appearance
the pitch pine pinus rigida
distinguishing characters here there are three needles to each
    cluster fig 4 they are dark yellowishgreen needles about four
    inches long the roughlooking branches of the tree may be seen
    studded with cones throughout the year and clusters of leaves
    may be seen sprouting directly from the trunk of the tree see
    fig 5 the last two are very characteristic and will distinguish
    the tree at a glance
form and size it is a low tree of uncertain habit and extremely rough
    looking at every stage of its life it is constantly full of dead
    branches and old cones which persist on the tree throughout the
    year
range eastern united states
soil and location grows in the poorest and sandiest soils where few
    other trees will grow in new jersey and on long island where it is
    native it proves so hardy and persistent that it often forms pure
    stands excluding other trees
illustration fig 4twig of the pitch pine
enemies none of importance
value for planting well adapted for the sea coast and other exposed
    places it is of extremely uncertain habit and is subject to the
    loss of the lower limbs it frequently presents a certain
    picturesqueness of outline but it could not be used as a specimen
    tree on the lawn
illustration fig 5the pitch pine
commercial value the wood is coarse grained and is used for rough
    lumber fuel and charcoal
other characters the fruit is a cone one to three
inches long persistent on the tree for several years
the scotch pine pinus sylvestris
distinguishing characters there are two needles to each cluster and
    these are short compared with those of the white pine and
    slightly twisted see fig 6 the bark especially along the
    upper portion of the trunk is reddish in color
form and size a mediumsized tree with a short crown
range europe asia and eastern united states
soil and location will do best on a deep rich sandy soil but will
    also grow on a dry porous soil
enemies in europe the scotch pine has several insect enemies but in
    america it appears to be free from injury
value for planting suitable for windbreaks and woodland planting many
    excellent specimens may also be found in our parks
commercial value in the united states the wood is chiefly used for
    fuel though slightly used for barrels boxes and carpentry in
    europe the scotch pine is an important timber tree
comparisons the scotch pine is apt to be confused with the austrian
    pine pinus austriaca because they both have two needles to
    each cluster the needles of the austrian pine however are much
    longer coarser straighter and darker than those of the scotch
    pine fig 1 the form of the austrian pine too is more
    symmetrical and compact
illustration fig 6twig of the scotch pine
    the red pine pinus resinosa is another tree that has two
    needles to each cluster but these are much longer than those of the
    scotch pine five to six inches and are straighter the bark which
    is reddish in color also differentiates the red pine from the
    austrian pine the position of the cones on the red pine which
    point outward and downward at maturity will also help to
    distinguish this tree from the scotch and the austrian varieties
group ii the spruce and hemlock
how to tell them from other trees the spruce and hemlock belong to the
    evergreen class and may be told from the other trees by their
    leaves the characteristic leaves of the spruce are shown in fig
    9 those of the hemlock in fig 10 these are much shorter than the
    needles of the pines but are longer than the leaves of the red cedar
    or arbor vitae they are neither arranged in clusters like those of
    the larch nor in feathery layers like those of the cypress they
    adhere to the tree throughout the year while the leaves of the
    larch and cypress shed in the fall
    the spruces are pyramidalshaped trees with tall and tapering
    trunks thickly covered with branches forming a compact crown they
    are widely distributed throughout the cold and temperate regions of
    the northern hemisphere where they often form thick forests over
    extended areas
    there are eighteen recognized species of spruce the norway spruce
    has been chosen as a type for this group because it is so commonly
    planted in the northeastern part of the united states
    the hemlock is represented by seven species confined to temperate
    north america japan and central and western china
illustration fig 7the norway spruce
how to tell them from each other the needles and branches of the spruce
    are coarse those of the hemlock are flat and graceful the
    individual leaves of the spruce fig 9 are foursided and green or
    blue on the under side while those of the hemlock fig 10 are
    flat and are marked by two white lines on the under side
the norway spruce picea excelsa
distinguishing characters the characteristic appearance of the
    fullgrown tree is due to the drooping branchlets carried on main
    branches which bend upward fig 7
leaf the leaves are dark green in color and are arranged spirally
    thus making the twigs coarser to the touch than the twigs of the
    hemlock or fir in crosssection the individual leaflet is
    quadrilateral while that of the pine is triangular
form and size a large tree with a straight undivided trunk and a
    wellshaped conical crown fig 7
range northern europe asia northern north america
soil and location grows in cool moist situations
enemies the foliage of the spruce is sometimes affected by red
    spider but is apt to be more seriously injured by drought wind
    and late frosts
value for planting commonly planted as an ornamental tree and for
    hedges it does well for this purpose in a cool northern climate
    but in the vicinity of new york city and further south it does not
    do as well losing its lower branches at an early age and becoming
    generally scraggly in appearance
illustration fig 8a group of hemlock
commercial value the wood is light and soft and is used for
    construction timber paper pulp and fuel
other characters the fruit is a large slender cone four to seven
    inches long
comparisons the white spruce picea canadensis may be told from
    the norway spruce by the whitish color on the under side of its
    leaves and the unpleasant pungent odor emitted from the needles
    when bruised the cones of the white spruce about two inches long
    are shorter than these of the norway spruce but are longer than
    those of the black spruce
    it is essentially a northern tree growing in all sorts of locations
    along the streams and on rocky mountain slopes as far north as the
    arctic sea and alaska it often appears as an ornamental tree as far
    south as new york and pennsylvania
    the black spruce picea mariana may be told from the other
    spruces by its small cone which is usually only about one inch in
    length in new england it seldom grows to as large a size as the
    other spruce trees
    it covers large areas in various parts of northern north america and
    grows to its largest size in manitoba the black spruce has little
    value as an ornamental tree
    the colorado blue spruce picea parryana or picea pungens
    which is commonly used as an ornamental tree on lawns and in parks
    can be told from the other spruces by its paleblue or sagegreen
    color and its sharppointed coarsefeeling twigs its small size
    and sharppointed conical form are also characteristic
    it grows to a large size in colorado and the middle west in the
    eastern states and in northern europe where it is planted as an
    ornamental tree it is usually much smaller
illustration fig 9twig of the norway spruce
hemlock tsuga canadensis
distinguishing characters its leaves are arranged in flat layers
    giving a flat horizontal and graceful appearance to the whole
    branch fig 8 the individual leaves are dark green above lighter
    colored below and are marked by two white lines on the under side
    fig 10
    the leaves are arranged on little stalks a characteristic that does
    not appear in the other evergreen trees
form and size a large tree with a broadbased pyramidal head and a
    trunk conspicuously tapering toward the apex the branches extend
    almost to the ground
range the hemlock is a northern tree growing in canada and the united
    states
soil and location grows on all sorts of soils in the deepest woods as
    well as on high mountain slopes
enemies none of importance
value for planting the hemlock makes an excellent hedge because it
    retains its lowest branches and will stand shearing in this respect
    it is preferable to the spruce it makes a fair tree for the lawn
    and is especially desirable for underplanting in woodlands where
    the shade from the surrounding trees is heavy in this respect it is
    like the beech
commercial value the wood is soft brittle and coarsegrained and is
    therefore used mainly for coarse lumber its bark is so rich in
    tannin that it forms one of the chief commercial products of the
    tree
other characters the fruit is a small cone about  of an inch long
    which generally hangs on the tree all winter
illustration fig 10twig of the hemlock
group iii the red cedar and arborvitae
how to tell them from other trees the red cedar juniper and
    arborvitae may be told from other trees by their leaves which
    remain on the tree and keep green throughout the entire year these
    leaves differ from those of the other evergreens in being much
    shorter and of a distinctive shape as shown in figs 12 and 13 the
    trees themselves are much smaller than the other evergreens
    enumerated in this book altogether there are thirtyfive species
    of juniper recognized and four of arborvitae the junipers are
    widely distributed over the northern hemisphere from the arctic
    region down to mexico in the new world and in northern africa
    china and japan in the old world the arborvitae is found in
    northeastern and northwestern america china and japan the species
    mentioned here are those commonly found in america
how to tell them from each other the twigs of the arborvitae are
    flat and fanlike as in fig 13 the twigs of the red cedar are
    needleshaped or scalelike as in fig 12 the foliage of the
    arborvitae is of a lighter color than that of the red cedar which
    is sombre green the arborvitae will generally be found growing in
    moist locations while the red cedar will grow in dry places as
    well the arborvitae generally retains its lower branches in open
    places while the branches of the red cedar start at some distance
    from the ground
red cedar juniperus virginiana
illustration fig 11the red cedar
distinguishing characters the tree can best be told at a glance by its
    general form size and leaves it is a mediumsized tree with a
    symmetrical conelike form fig 11 which however broadens
    out somewhat when the tree grows old its color throughout the year
    is dull green with a tinge of brownish red and its bark peels in
    thin strips
illustration
fig 12atwig of young cedar
fig 12btwig of cedar older tree
leaf in young trees the leaf is needleshaped pointed and marked by a
    white line on its under side fig 12a in older trees it is
    scalelike fig 12b and the white line on its under side is
    indistinct
range widely distributed over nearly all of eastern and central north
    america
soil and location grows on poor gravelly soils as well as in rich
    bottom lands
enemies the cedar apple commonly found on this tree represents a
    stage of the apple rust and for that reason it is not desirable to
    plant such trees near orchards its wood is also sometimes attacked
    by small boring insects
value for planting its characteristic slender form gives the red cedar
    an important place as an ornamental tree but its chief value lies
    in its commercial use
commercial value the wood is durable light smooth and fragrant and
    is therefore used for making leadpencils cabinets boxes
    mothproof chests shingles posts and telegraph poles
other characters the fruit is small round and berrylike about the
    size of a pea of dark blue color and carries from one to four bony
    seeds
other common names the red cedar is also often called juniper and
    red juniper
comparisons the red cedar is apt to be confused with the low juniper
    juniperus communis which grows in open fields all over the
    world the latter however is generally of a low form with a flat
    top its leaves are pointed and prickly never scalelike and they
    are whitish above and green below its bark shreds and its fruit is
    a small round berry of agreeable aromatic odor
arborvitae northern white cedar thuja occidentalis
distinguishing characters the branchlets are extremely flat and
    fanlike fig 13 and have an agreeable aromatic odor when
    bruised the tree is an evergreen with a narrow conical form
illustration fig 13twig of the arborvitae
leaf leaves of two kinds one scalelike and flat the other keeled
    all tightly pressed to the twig see fig 13
form and size a close conical head with dense foliage near the base
    usually a small tree but in some parts of the northeastern states
    it grows to medium size with a diameter of two feet
range northern part of north america
soil and location inhabits low swampy lands in the state of maine
    often forming thick forests
enemies very seldom affected by insects
value for planting is hardy in new england where it is especially used
    for hedges it is also frequently used as a specimen tree on the
    lawn
commercial value the wood is durable for posts ties and shingles the
    bark contains considerable tannin and the juices from the tree have
    a medicinal value
other characters the fruit is a cone about  inch long
other common names arborvitae is sometimes called white cedar and
    cedar
comparisons the arborvitae is apt to be confused with the true white
    cedar chamaecyparis thyoides but the leaves of the latter are
    sharppointed and not flattened or fanshaped
chapter ii
how to identify treescontinued
group iv the larch and cypress
how to tell them from other trees in summer the larch and cypress may
    easily be told from other trees by their leaves these are
    needleshaped and arranged in clusters with numerous leaves to each
    cluster in the case of the larch and feathery and flat in the case
    of the cypress in winter when their leaves have dropped off the
    trees can be told by their cones which adhere to the branches
    there are nine recognized species of larch and two of bald cypress
    the larch is characteristically a northern tree growing in the
    northern and mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere from the
    arctic circle to pennsylvania in the new world and in central
    europe asia and japan in the old world it forms large forests in
    the alps of switzerland and france
    the european larch and not the american is the principal species
    considered here because it is being planted extensively in this
    country and in most respects is preferable to the american species
    the bald cypress is a southern tree of ancient origin the
    wellknown cypress of montezuma in the gardens of chepultepec having
    been a species of taxodium the tree is now confined to the swamps
    and river banks of the south atlantic and gulf states where it
    often forms extensive forests to the exclusion of all other trees
    in those regions along the river swamps the trees are often
    submerged for several months of the year
how to tell them from each other in summer the larch may be told from
    the cypress by its leaves compare figs 14 and 16 in winter the
    two can be distinguished by their characteristic forms the larch is
    a broader tree as compared with the cypress and its form is more
    conical the cypress is more slender and it is taller the two have
    been grouped together in this study because they are both coniferous
    trees and unlike the other conifers are both deciduous their
    leaves falling in october
illustration fig 14twig of the larch in summer
the european larch larix europaea
distinguishing characters its leaves which are needleshaped and about
    an inch long are borne in clusters close to the twig fig 14
    there are many leaves to each cluster this characteristic together
    with the spirelike form of the crown will distinguish the tree at
    a glance
leaf the leaves are of a lightgreen color but become darker in the
    spring and in october turn yellow and drop off the cypress which
    is described below is another conebearing tree which sheds its
    leaves in winter
illustration fig 15twig of the larch in winter
form and size a mediumsized tree with a conical head and a straight
    and tapering trunk see fig 90
range central europe and eastern and central united states
soil and location requires a deep fresh welldrained soil and needs
    plenty of light it flourishes in places where our native species
    would die grows very rapidly
enemies the larch is subject to the attacks of a sawfly which has
    killed many trees of the american species a fungus trametes
    pini which causes the tree to break down with ease is another of
    its enemies
value for planting a wellformed tree for the lawn it is also useful
    for group planting in the forest
commercial value because its wood is strong and durable the larch is
    valuable for poles posts railroad ties and in shipbuilding
illustration fig 16twig of the cypress
other characters the fruit is a small cone about one inch long
    adhering to the tree throughout the winter
illustration fig 17the bald cypress
comparisons the tree is apt to be confused with the american larch
    also known as tamarack and hackmatack but differs from it in
    having longer leaves cones twice as large and more abundant and
    branches which are more pendulous
    the larch differs from the bald cypress in the broader form of its
    crown and the clusterlike arrangement of its leaves the twigs of
    the bald cypress are flat and feathery the larch and bald cypress
    have the common characteristics of both shedding their leaves in
    winter and preferring to grow in moist or swampy soils the larch
    especially the native species forms the wellknown tamarack swamps
    of the north the bald cypress grows in a similar way in groups in
    the southern swamps
bald cypress taxodium distichum
distinguishing characters the feathery character of the twigs fig
    16 and the spirelike form of the tree fig 17 which is taller
    and more slender than the larch will distinguish this species from
    others
illustration fig 18cypress knees
leaf the leaves drop off in october though the tree is of the
    conebearing kind in this respect it is like the larch
form and size tall and pyramidal
range the cypress is a southern tree but is found under cultivation in
    parks and on lawns in northern united states
soil and location grows naturally in swamps but will also do well in
    ordinary welldrained good soil in its natural habitat it sends
    out special roots above water these are known as cypress knees
    fig 18 and serve to provide air to the submerged roots of the
    tree
enemies none of importance
value for planting an excellent tree for park and lawn planting
commercial value the wood is light soft and easily worked it is used
    for general construction interior finish railroad ties posts and
    cooperage
other characters the bark is thin and scaly the fruit is a cone
    about an inch in diameter the general color of the tree is a
    dull deep green which however turns orange brown in the fall
comparisons the cypress and the larch are apt to be confused
    especially in the winter when the leaves of both have dropped the
    cypress is more slender and is taller in form the leaves of each
    are very different as will be seen from the accompanying
    illustrations
group v the horsechestnut ash and maple
how to tell them from other trees the horsechestnut ash and maple
    have their branches and buds arranged on their stems opposite each
    other as shown in figs 20 22 and 24 in other trees this
    arrangement is alternate as shown in fig 19
how to tell these three from each other if the bud is largean inch to
    an inch and a half longdark brown and sticky it is a
    horsechestnut
    if the bud is not sticky much smaller and rusty brown to black
    in color and the ultimate twigs of an olive green color are
    flattened at points below the buds it is an ash
illustration fig 19alternate branching beech
    if it is not a horsechestnut nor an ash and its small buds have
    many scales covering them the specimen with branches and buds
    opposite must then be a maple each of the maples has one
    character which distinguishes it from all the other maples for the
    sugar maple this distinguishing character is the sharp point of
    the bud for the silver maple it is the bend in the terminal
    twig for the red maple it is the smooth graycolored bark for
    the norway maple it is the reddish brown color of the full round
    bud and for the box elder it is the greenish color of its
    terminal twig
    the form of the tree and the leaves are also characteristic in each
    of the maples but for the beginner who does not wish to be burdened
    with too many of these facts at one time those just enumerated
    will be found most certain and most easily followed
illustration fig 20opposite branching horsechestnut
the horsechestnut
aesculus hippocastanum
distinguishing characters the sticky nature of the terminal bud and
    its large size about an inch long the bud is dark brown in
    color see fig 20
leaf five to seven leaflets usually seven fig 21
form and size mediumsized tree pyramidal head and coarse twigs
range europe and eastern united states
soil and location prefers a deep rich soil
enemies the leaves are the favorite food of caterpillars and are
    subject to a blight which turns them brown prematurely the trunk is
    often attacked by a disease which causes the flow of a slimy

other common names the red maple is sometimes known as swamp maple
illustration fig 33twig of norway maple
comparisons the red maple is apt to be confused with the silver maple
    but the latter can be distinguished by its turnedup twigs and scaly
    bark over the whole trunk of the tree which presents a sharp
    contrast to the straight twig and smooth bark of the red maple the
    latter has a bark similar to the beech but its branches are
    opposite while those of the beech are alternate

other characters the bark of the trunk is smooth and yellowishgreen
    in young trees and grayish brown in older specimens the flowers
    appear in the early part of april the fruit takes the form of
    yellowishgreen keys which hang on the tree till late fall
other common names the box elder is also commonly known as the

group vi trees told by their form elm poplar gingko and willow
how to tell them from other trees the trees described in this group are
    so distinctive in their general form that they may for the
    purpose of study be grouped together and distinguished from all
    other trees by this characteristic
how to tell them from each other the american elm is vaselike in
    shape the lombardy poplar is narrow and spirelike the gingko
    or maidenhair tree is odd in its mode of branching and the
    weeping willow is extremely pendulous
american elm ulmus americana
distinguishing characters the tree can be told at a glance by its
    general branching habit the limbs arch out into a widespreading
    fan or vaselike crown which loses itself in numerous fine
    drooping branchlets see fig 37
illustration fig 37american elm
leaf the leaves are simple alternate and from 2 to 5 inches long
illustration fig 38english elm in winter
form and size it is a tall tree with a trunk that divides a short
    distance above ground its general contour together with the
    numerous branches that interlace its massive crown give the elm an
    interesting and stately appearance which is unequaled by any other
    tree
illustration fig 39lombardy poplar
range eastern north america
soil and location the elm prefers a deep rich and moist soil but will
    adapt itself even to the poor soil of the city street
enemies the leopard moth a woodboring insect and the elm leaf
    beetle a leafeating insect are the two most important enemies of
    the tree their ravages are very extensive
value for planting the tree has a character of its own which cannot be
    duplicated for avenue or lawn planting
commercial value the wood is strong and tough and therefore has a
    special value for cooperage agricultural implements carriages and
    shipbuilding
other characters the buds are small brown and smooth while those
    of the european elms are covered with down the small side twigs
    come out at almost right angles to the larger terminal twigs which
    is not the case in other species of elm
illustration fig 40leaf of carolina poplar
other common names white elm
comparisons the english elm ulmus campestris is also a tall
    dignified tree commonly seen under cultivation in america but may
    be told from the american species by the difference in their general
    contour the branches of the english species spread out but do not
    arch like those of the american elm and the bark of the english elm
    is darker and coarser fig 38 little tufts of dead twigs along the
    main branches and trunk of the tree are characteristic of the
    english elm and will frequently help to distinguish it from the
    american elm
    the camperdown elm may be recognized readily by its dwarf size and
    its low drooping umbrellashaped crown
lombardy or italian poplar populus nigra var italica
distinguishing characters its tall slender spirelike form and
    rigidly erect branches which commence low on the trunk make this
    tree very distinct at all seasons of the year see fig 39
leaf triangular in shape similar to that of the carolina poplar but
    smaller see fig 40
range asia europe and north america
soil and location the poplar is easily grown in poor soil in any
    location and is very hardy
value for planting the tree has a distinctive form which makes it
    valuable for special landscape effects it is also used for shelter
    belts and screening like all poplars it is short lived and will
    stand pruning well
commercial value none
illustration fig 41carolina poplar
comparisons the carolina poplar or cottonwood populus deltoides
    can be told from the lombardy poplar by its wider crown and its more
    open branching fig 41 it may be recognized by its big terminal
    twigs which are light yellow in color and coarser than those of the
    lombardy poplar fig 42 its bark is smooth light and
    yellowishgreen in young trees and dark gray and fissured in older
    specimens its large conical glossy chestnutbrown bud is also
    characteristic fig 42 its flowers in the form of large catkins
    a peculiarity of all poplars appear in the early spring the
    carolina poplar is commonly planted in cities because it grows
    rapidly and is able to withstand the smoke and drouth conditions of
    the city where other trees however can be substituted with
    success the poplar should be avoided its very fast growth is
    really a point against the tree because it grows so fast that it
    becomes too tall for surrounding property and its wood being
    extremely soft and brittle the tree frequently breaks in
    windstorms in many cases it is entirely uprooted because it is not
    a deeprooted tree its larger roots which spread near the
    surface upset the sidewalk or prevent the growth of other
    vegetation on the lawn while its finer rootlets in their eager
    search for moisture penetrate and clog the joints of neighboring
    water and sewer pipes the tree is commonly attacked by the
    oystershell scale an insect which sucks the sap from its bark
    and which readily spreads to other more valuable trees like the elm
    the female form of this tree is even more objectionable than the
    male because in the early spring the former produces an abundance
    of cotton from its seeds which litters the ground and often makes
    walking dangerous the only justification for planting the carolina
    poplar is in places where the conditions for tree growth are so poor
    that nothing else will grow and in those cases the tree should be
    cut back periodically in order to keep it from becoming too tall and
    scraggly it is also desirable for screening in factory districts
    and similar situations
illustration fig 42bud of the carolina poplar
    the silver or white poplar populus alba may be told from the
    other poplars by its characteristic smooth whitishgreen bark
    often spotted with dark blotches fig 43 the leaves are
    silverywhite and downy on the under side the twigs are dark green
    in color and densely covered with a white down it grows to very
    large size and forms an irregular widespreading broad head which
    is characteristically different from that of any of the other
    poplars
illustration fig 43bark of the silver poplar
    the quaking aspen populus tremuloides the largetoothed
    aspen populus grandidentata and the balsam poplar or balm of
    gilead populus balsamifera are other common members of the
    poplar group the quaking aspen may be told by its reddishbrown
    twigs narrow sharppointed buds and by its small finely toothed
    leaves the largetoothed aspen has thicker and rather downy buds
    and broader and more widely toothed leaves the balsam poplar has a
    large bud thickly covered with a sticky pungent gelatinous
    substance
gingko or maidenhair tree gingko biloba
illustration fig 44gingko trees
distinguishing characters the peculiar branches of this tree emerge
    upward from a straight tapering trunk at an angle of about 45
    and give to the whole tree a striking oriental appearance which is
    quite different from that of any other tree fig 44
leaf like that of a leaflet of maidenhair fern fig 45
range a native of northern china and introduced into eastern north
    america
soil and location the gingko will grow in poor soils
enemies practically free from insects and disease
illustration fig 45leaves of the gingko tree
value for planting it makes a valuable tree for the street where heavy
    shade is not the object and forms an excellent widespreading
    specimen tree on the lawn
other characters the fruit consists of a stone covered by sweet
    illsmelling flesh the tree is dioecious there being separate male
    and female trees the male tree is preferable for planting in order
    to avoid the disagreeable odor of the fruit which appears on the
    female trees when about thirty years old the male tree has a
    narrower crown than the female tree the buds fig 46 are very odd
    and are conspicuous on the tree throughout the winter the leaves of
    the gingko shed in the winter in this respect the tree is like the
    larch and the bald cypress
illustration fig 46bud of the gingko tree
    the gingko belongs to the yew family which is akin to the pine
    family it is therefore a very old tree the remains of the forests
    of the ancient world the gingko in its early life is tall and
    slender with its few branches close to the stem but after a time
    the branches loosen up and form a widespreading crown in the
    orient it attains enormous proportions and in this country it also
    grows to a fairly large size when planted on the open lawn or in
    groups far apart from other trees so that it can have plenty of room
    to spread it then produces a picturesque effect of unusual
    interest
weeping willow salix babylonica
distinguishing characters all the willows have a single caplike scale
    to the bud and this species has an unusually drooping mass of
    slender branchlets which characterizes the tree from all others
    fig 47
illustration fig 47weeping willow
form and size it grows to large size
range asia and europe and naturalized in eastern united states
soil and location prefers moist places near streams and ponds
enemies none of importance
value for planting the weeping willow has a special ornamental effect
    in cemeteries and along lakes and river banks in parks
commercial value it is used in the united states for charcoal and for
    fuel
comparisons the pussy willow salix discolor may easily be told
    from the other willows by its small size it is often no higher than
    a tall shrub its branches are reddish green and the buds are dark
    red smooth and glossy the predominating color of the twigs and
    buds in the pussy willow is therefore a shade of red while in the
    weeping willow it is yellowish green
group vii trees told by their bark or trunk sycamore birch beech
blue beech ironwood and hackberry
how to tell them from other trees the color of the bark or the form of
    the trunk of each of the trees in this group is distinct from that
    of any other tree
how to tell them from each other in the sycamore the bark is
    mottled in the white birch it is dull white in the beech it
    is smooth and gray in the hackberry it is covered with numerous
    corky warts in the blue beech the trunk of the tree is fluted
    as in fig 54 and in the ironwood the bark peels in thin
    perpendicular strips
illustration fig 48bark of the sycamore tree
the sycamore or plane tree platanus occidentalis
distinguishing characters the peculiar mottled appearance of the
    bark fig 48 in the trunk and large branches is the striking
    character here the bark produces this effect by shedding in large
    thin brittle plates the newly exposed bark is of a yellowish green
    color which often turns nearly white later on round seed balls
    about an inch in diameter may be seen hanging on the tree all
    winter in this species the seed balls are usually solitary while
    in the oriental sycamore a european tree similar to the native one
    they appear in clusters of two or occasionally of three or four
    see fig 49
illustration fig 49seedballs of the oriental sycamore note one
seedball cut in half
illustration fig 50gray or white birch trees
leaf the stem of the leaf completely covers the bud this is a
    characteristic peculiar to sycamores
form and size a large tree with massive trunk and branches and a broad
    head
range eastern and southern united states
soil and location prefers a deep rich soil but will adapt itself even
    to the poor soil of the city street
enemies the sycamore is frequently attacked by a fungus gloeosporium
    nervisequum which curls up the young leaves and kills the tips of
    the branches late frosts also often injure its young twigs the
    oriental sycamore which is the european species is more hardy in
    these respects than the native one and is therefore often chosen as
    a substitute
value for planting the occidental sycamore is now planted very little
    but the oriental sycamore is used quite extensively in its place
    especially as a shade tree the oriental sycamore is superior to the
    native species in many ways it is more shapely faster growing and
    hardier than the native one both sycamores will bear transplanting
    and pruning well
illustration fig 51bark of the black or sweet birch
commercial value the wood of the sycamore is coarsegrained and hard to
    work used occasionally for inside finishing in buildings
other names buttonball buttonwood
comparisons the oriental sycamore platanus orientalis an
    introduced species is apt to be confused with the occidental
    sycamore but may be told from the latter by the number of seed
    balls suspended from the tree in the case of the oriental species
    the seed balls hang in pairs or rarely three or four together
    in the occidental the seed balls are generally solitary and very
    rarely in pairs
gray or white birch betula populifolia
distinguishing characters the dullwhite color of the bark on the
    trunk and the dark triangular patches below the insertion of the
    branches distinguish this tree see fig 50 the bark of the young
    trunks and branches is reddishbrown in color and glossy the bark
    adheres closely to the trunk of the tree and does not peel in loose
    shaggy strips as in the case of the yellow or golden birch it is
    marked by small raised horizontal lines which are the lenticels or
    breathing pores these lenticels are characteristic of all birch and
    cherry trees in addition to the distinction in the color of the
    bark an important character which distinguishes the gray birch from
    all other species of birch is found in the terminal twigs which
    are rough to the touch
form and size a small tree frequently grows in clumps
range eastern united states
soil and location the gray birch does best in a deep rich soil but
    will also grow in poor soils
enemies the bronzebirch borer a wooddestroying insect and
    polyporus betulinus a fungus are its chief enemies
value for planting its graceful habit and attractive bark gives the
    tree an important place in ornamental planting it may be used to
    advantage with evergreens and produces a charming effect when
    planted by itself in clumps
illustration fig 52bark of the beech
illustration fig 53buds of the beech tree
commercial value the wood is soft and not durable it is used in the
    manufacture of small articles and for wood pulp
other characters the fruit is a catkin
comparisons the paper birch betula papyrifera is apt to be
    confused with the gray birch because both have a white bark the
    bark of the paper birch however is a clear white and peels off in
    thin papery layers instead of being close it very seldom shows any
    dark triangular markings on the trunk its terminal twigs are not
    rough and its trunk is usually straighter and freer from branches
    the black or sweet birch betula lenta has a bark similar to
    the gray birch except that its color is dark gray see fig 51 the
    twigs have an aromatic taste
illustration fig 54trunk of blue beech
illustration fig 55bark of the ironwood
    the yellow birch betula lutea has a yellowish or golden bark
    which constantly peels in thin ragged horizontal films
    the european white birch betula alba has a dullwhite bark
    like the native white birch but has smooth terminal twigs instead
    of rough ones it is commonly seen in the united states on lawns and
    in parks
american beech fagus americana
distinguishing characters the closefitting smooth gray bark will
    tell this tree from all others except the red maple and yellowwood
    see fig 52 the red maple may then be easily eliminated by noting
    whether the branches are alternate or opposite they are alternate
    in the beech and opposite in the maple the yellowwood may be
    eliminated by noting the size of the bud the bud in the
    yellowwood is hardly noticeable and of a golden yellow color while
    that of the beech is very long slender and sharppointed and
    chestnut brown in color see fig 53
form and size it grows tall in the woods but on the open lawn spreads
    out into a massive roundheaded tree
range eastern canada and united states
soil and location prefers a rich welldrained soil but will grow in
    any good soil
enemies aphides or plant lice that suck the sap from the leaves in
    spring and early summer are the chief enemies of the tree
value for planting the pleasing color of its bark its fine spread of
    branches which gracefully droop down to the ground and its
    autumnal coloring make the beech a favorite for lawn and park
    planting the several european species of beech are equally
    charming
illustration fig 56bark of the hackberry
commercial value the wood is strong closegrained and tough it is
    used mainly for cooperage tool handles shoe lasts chairs etc
    and for fuel
other characters the fruit is a prickly burr encasing a sharply
    triangular nut which is sweet and edible
comparisons the european beech fagus sylvatica and its weeping
    purpleleaved and fernleaved varieties are frequently met with in
    parks and may be told from the native species by its darker bark
    the weeping form may of course be told readily by its drooping
    branches the leaves of the european beeches are broader and less
    serrated than those of the american beech
blue beech or hornbeam carpinus caroliniana
distinguishing characters the fluted or muscular effect of its
    trunk will distinguish the tree at a glance fig 54
leaf doubly serrated otherwise the same as that of ironwood
form and size a lowspreading tree with branches arching out at various
    angles forming a flattened head with a fine slender spray
range very common in the eastern united states
soil and location grows in low wet woods
enemies none of importance
value for planting its artistic branching and curious trunk give the
    tree an important place in park planting
commercial value none
other characters the bark is smooth and bluish gray in color
comparisons the blue beech or hornbeam is often confused with the
    ironwood or hop hornbeam ostrya virginiana the ironwood
    however has a characteristic bark that peels in perpendicular
    short thin segments often loose at the ends see fig 55 this is
    entirely different from the close smooth and fluted bark of the
    blue beech the color of the bark in the ironwood is brownish while
    that of the blue beech is bluishgray the buds of the ironwood are
    greenish with brown tips while the bud of the blue beech shows no
    green whatever
hackberry celtis occidentalis
distinguishing characters the tree may be told readily from other trees
    by the corky tubercles on the bark of the lower portion of the
    trunk see fig 56
leaf has three predominating veins and is a bit more developed on one
    side than on the other
form and size a small or mediumsized tree with a single stem and broad
    conical crown
range united states and canada
soil and location grows naturally in fertile soils but will adapt
    itself to almost sterile soils as well
enemies the hackberry is usually free from disease though often its
    leaves are covered with insect galls
value for planting it is extensively planted as a shade tree in the
    middle west and is frequently seen as an ornamental tree in the
    east
commercial value it has little economic value except for fuel
other characters the fruit is berrylike with a hard pit the fleshy
    outer part is sweet
other common names nettle tree sugarberry
group viii the oaks and chestnut
how to tell them from other trees the oaks are rather difficult to
    identify and in studying them it will often be necessary to look
    for more than one distinguishing character the oaks differ from
    other trees in bearing acorns their leaves have many lobes and
    their upper lateral buds cluster at the top of the twigs the
    general contour of each oak presents a characteristic branching and
    sturdiness uncommon in other trees
    the chestnut differs from other trees in bearing burs and its
    bark is also distinctly characteristic
how to tell them from each other there are two groups of oaks the
    white oak and the black oak the white oaks mature their acorns
    in one year and therefore only acorns of the same year can be
    found on trees of this group the black oaks take two years in which
    to mature their acorns and therefore young acorns of the present
    year and mature acorns of the previous year may be found on the same
    tree at one time the leaves of the white oaks have rounded
    margins and rounded lobes as in fig 57 while those of the black
    oaks have pointed margins and sharp pointed lobes as shown in figs
    60 62 and 64 the bark of the white oaks is light colored and
    breaks up in loose flakes as in fig 58 while that of the black
    oaks is darker and deeply ridged or tight as in figs 59 and 61 the
    white oak is the type of the white oak group and the black red and
    pin oaks are types of the other for the characterization of the
    individual species the reader is referred to the following pages
illustration fig 57leaf and fruit of white oak quercus alba
white oak quercus alba
distinguishing characters the massive ramification of its branches is
    characteristic of this species and often an easy clue to its
    identification the bark has a light gray colorlighter than
    that of the other oaksand breaks into soft loose flakes as in
    fig 58 the leaves are deeply lobed as in fig 57 the buds are
    small round and congested at the end of the years growth the
    acorns usually have no stalks and are set in shallow rough cups
    the kernels of the acorns are white and palatable
form and size the white oak grows into a large tree with a
    widespreading massive crown dissolving into long heavy twisted
    branches when grown in the open it possesses a short sturdy trunk
    in the forest its trunk is tall and stout
range eastern north america
illustration fig 58bark of white oak quercus alba
soil and location the white oak thrives in almost any welldrained
    good deep soil except in a very cold and wet soil it requires
    plenty of light and attains great age
enemies the tree is comparatively free from insects and disease except
    in districts where the gipsy moth is common in which case the
    leaves of the white oak are a favorite food of its caterpillars
illustration fig 59bark of black oak quercus velutina
value for planting the white oak is one of the most stately trees its
    massive form and its longevity make the tree suitable for both lawn
    and woodland planting but it is not used much because it is
    difficult to transplant and grows rather slowly
commercial value the wood is of great economic importance it is heavy
    hard strong and durable and is used in cooperage construction
    work interior finish of buildings and for railroad ties furniture
    agricultural implements and fuel
comparisons the swamp white oak quercus platanoides is similar to
    the white oak in general appearance of the bark and form and is
    therefore liable to be confused with it it differs from the white
    oak however in possessing a more straggly habit and in the fact
    that the bark on the under side of its branches shags in loose
    large scales its buds are smaller lighter colored and more downy
    and its acorns are more pointed and with cups more shallow than
    those of the white oak the tree also grows in moister ground
    generally bordering swamps
illustration fig 60leaf and fruit of black oak quercus
velutina
black oak quercus velutina
distinguishing characters the bark is black rough and cut up into
    firm ridges especially at the base of the tree see fig 59 the
    inner bark has a bright yellow color the leaves have sharp
    points and are wider at the base than at the tip as shown in fig
    60 the buds are large downy and sharp pointed the acorns are
    small and have deep scaly cups the inner margins of which are
    downy the kernels are yellow and bitter
form and size the tree grows in an irregular form to large size with
    its branches rather slender as compared with the white oak and with
    a more open and narrow crown
range eastern north america
soil and location it will grow in poor soils but does best where the
    soil is rich and well drained
enemies none of importance
value for planting the black oak is the poorest of the oaks for
    planting and is rarely offered by nurserymen
commercial value the wood is heavy hard and strong but checks readily
    and is coarse grained it is of little value except for fuel the
    bark is used for tannin
other common names yellow oak
comparisons the black oak might sometimes be confused with the red
    and scarlet oaks the yellow bitter inner bark will distinguish
    the black oak from the other two the lightcolored smooth bark of
    the red oak and the dark ridged bark of the black oak will
    distinguish the two while the bark of the scarlet oak has an
    appearance intermediate between the two the buds of the three
    species also show marked differences the buds of the black oak are
    covered with hairs those of the scarlet oak have fewer hairs and
    those of the red are practically free from hairs the leaves of each
    of the three species are distinct and the growth habits are
    different
red oak quercus rubra
distinguishing characters the bark is perpendicularly fissured into
    long smooth light gray strips giving the trunk a characteristic
    pillar effect as in figs 61 and 94 it has the straightest trunk
    of all the oaks the leaves possess more lobes than the leaves of
    any of the other species of the black oak group see fig 62 the
    acorns the largest among the oaks are semispherical with the cups
    extremely shallow the buds are large and sharp pointed but not as
    large as those of the black oak they also have a few fine hairs on
    their scales but are not nearly as downy as those of the black oak
illustration fig 61bark of red oak
form and size the red oak is the largest of the oaks and among the
    largest of the trees in the northern forests it has a straight
    trunk free from branches to a higher point than in the white oak
    see fig 94 the branches are less twisted and emerge at sharper
    angles than do those of the white oak
range it grows all over eastern north america and reaches north farther
    than any of the other oaks
soil and location it is less fastidious in its soil and moisture
    requirements than the other oaks and therefore grows in a great
    variety of soils it requires plenty of light
illustration fig 62leaf and fruit of red oak
enemies like most of the other oaks this species is comparatively free
    from insects and disease
value for planting the red oak grows faster and adapts itself better to
    poor soil conditions than any of the other oaks and is therefore
    easy to plant and easy to find in the nurseries it makes an
    excellent street tree is equally desirable for the lawn and is
    hardly surpassed for woodland planting
commercial value the wood is hard and strong but coarse grained and is
    used for construction timber interior finish and furniture it is
    inferior to white oak where strength and durability are required
pin oak quercus palustris
distinguishing characters its method of branching will characterize
    the tree at a glance it develops a welldefined main ascending
    stem with numerous drooping side branches as in fig 63 the
    buds are very small and sharp pointed and the leaves are small as in
    fig 64 the bark is dark firm smooth and in close ridges the
    acorn is small and carries a light brown striped nut wider than
    long and bitter the cup is shallow enclosing only the base of the
    nut
illustration fig 63pin oaks in winter
form and size the pin oak is a mediumsized tree in comparison with
    other oaks it develops a tall straight trunk that tapers
    continuously through a pyramidal crown of low drooping tender
    branches
range eastern north america
soil and location it requires a deep rich moist soil and grows
    naturally near swamps its roots are deep and spreading the tree
    grows rapidly and is easily transplanted
enemies none of importance
value for planting the pin oak is an extremely graceful tree and is
    therefore extensively used for planting on lawns and on certain
    streets where the tree can find plenty of water and where conditions
    will permit its branches to droop low
commercial value the wood is heavy and hard but coarse grained and
    liable to check and warp its principal use is in the construction
    of houses and for shingles
illustration fig 64leaf and fruit of pin oak
chestnut castanea dentata
distinguishing characters the bark in young trees is smooth and of a
    marked reddishbronze color but when the tree grows older the bark
    breaks up into diamondshaped ridges sufficiently characteristic
    to distinguish the tree at a glance see fig 65 a close
    examination of the terminal twig will show three ridges and two
    grooves running down along the stem from the base of each leaf or
    leafscar the twig has no true terminal bud the fruit a large
    round bur prickly without and hairy within and enclosing the
    familiar dark brown sweet edible nuts is also a distinguishing mark
    of the tree
leaf the leaves are distinctly long and narrow they are from 6 to 8
    inches long
form and size the chestnut is a large tree with a massive trunk and
    broad spreading crown the chestnut tree when cut sprouts readily
    from the stump and therefore in places where the trees have once
    been cut a group of two to six trees may be seen emerging from the
    old stump
illustration fig 65trunk of chestnut tree
range eastern united states
soil and location it will grow on rocky as well as on fertile soils and
    requires plenty of light
enemies during the past nine years nearly all the chestnut trees in the
    united states have been attacked by a fungus disease diaporthe
    parasitica mur which still threatens the entire extinction of
    the chestnut trees in this country no remedy has been discovered
    and all affected trees should be cut down and the wood utilized
    before it decays and becomes worthless no species of chestnut tree
    is entirely immune from this disease though some species are highly
    resistant
value for planting the chestnut is one of the most rapidly growing
    hardwood trees but on account of its disease which is now
    prevalent everywhere it is not wise to plant chestnut trees for the
    present
commercial value the wood is light not very strong and liable to warp
    it is durable when brought in contact with the soil and is therefore
    used for railroad ties fenceposts poles and mine timbers it is
    also valuable for interior finish in houses and for fuel its bark
    is used in the manufacture of tanning extracts and the nuts are sold
    in cities in large quantities

how to identify treescontinued
group ix the hickories walnut and butternut
how to tell them from other trees and from each other the hickory
    trees though symmetrical have a rugged appearance and the
    branches are so sturdy and black as to give a special distinction
    to this group the buds are different from the buds of all other
    trees and sufficiently characteristic to distinguish the various
    species of the group the bark is also a distinguishing character
    the walnut and butternut have chambered piths which distinguish
    them from all other trees and from each other
shagbark hickory hicoria ovata
distinguishing characters the yellowish brown buds nearly as large as
    those of the mockernut hickory are each provided with two long
    dark outer scales which stand out very conspicuously as shown in
    fig 67 the bark in older specimens shags off in rough strips
    sometimes more than a foot long as shown in fig 68 these two
    characters will readily distinguish the tree at all seasons of the
    year

    soils but prefers a deep and rather moist soil
enemies the hickory bark borer scolytus quadrispinosus is its
    principal enemy the insect is now killing thousands of hickory
    trees in the vicinity of new york city and on several occasions has
    made its appearance in large numbers in other parts of the country
value for planting it is difficult to transplant grows slowly and is
    seldom found in nurseries
illustration fig 67bud of the shagbark hickory
commercial value the wood is extremely tough and hard and is used for
    agricultural implements and for the manufacture of wagons it is
    excellent for fuel and the nuts are of great value as a food

    with yellowish brown downy scales which do not project like
    those of the shagbark hickory see fig 69 the twigs are extremely
    coarse the bark is very tight on the trunk and branches and has a
    close hard wavy appearance as in fig 70
leaf the leaf consists of 5 7 or 9 leaflets all of which are large and
    pubescent and possess a distinct resinous odor
form and size a tall tree with a broad spreading head

soil and location the mockernut hickory grows on a great variety of
    soils but prefers one which is rich and welldrained
enemies the same as for the shagbark hickory
value for planting it is not commonly planted
commercial value the wood is similar to that of the shagbark hickory
    and is put to the same uses
other characters the fruit is a nut larger and covered with a shell
    thicker than that of the shagbark the husk is also thicker and
    separates into four segments nearly to the base the kernel is small
    and sweet
other common names bigbud hickory whiteheart hickory
comparisons the pignut hickory hicoria glabra sometimes called
    broom hickory or brown hickory often has a shaggy bark but differs
    from both the shagbark and the mockernut hickory in possessing buds
    very much smaller twigs more slender and leaflets fewer the nut
    has a thinner husk which does not separate into four or five
    segments the tree prefers drier ground than the other hickories
illustration fig 69bud of the mockernut hickory
    the bitternut hicoria minima can be told from the mockernut
    and other species of hickory by its bud which has no scales at all
    the color of its bud is a characteristic orange yellow the bark is
    of a lighter shade than the bark of the mockernut hickory and the
    leaflets are more numerous than in any of the hickories varying
    from 7 to 11 its nuts are bitter
black walnut juglans nigra
distinguishing characters by cutting a twig lengthwise it will be seen
    that its pith is divided into little chambers as shown in fig
    71 the bud is dark gray and satiny the bark is dark brown and
    deeply ridged and the fruit is the familiar round walnut
illustration fig 70bark of the mockernut hickory
form and size a tall tree with a spreading crown composed of stout
    branches in the open it grows very symmetrically
range eastern united states
soil and location the black walnut prefers a deep rich fertile soil
    and requires a great deal of light
enemies the tree is a favorite of many caterpillars
value for planting it forms a beautiful spreading tree on open ground
    but is not planted to any extent because it is hard to transplant
    it grows slowly unless the soil is very deep and rich develops its
    leaves late in the spring and sheds them early in the fall and
    produces its fruit in great profusion
commercial value the wood is heavy strong of chocolate brown color
    and capable of taking a fine polish it is used for cabinet making
    and interior finish of houses the older the tree usually the
    better the wood and the consumption of the species in the past has
    been so heavy that it is becoming rare the european varieties which
    are frequently planted in america as substitutes for the native
    species yield better nuts but the american species produces better
    wood
illustration fig 71twig of the black walnut note the large
chambers in the pith
illustration fig 72twig of the butternut note the small chambers
in the pith
other characters the fruit is a large round nut about two inches in
    diameter covered with a smooth husk which at first is dull green
    in color and later turns brown the husk does not separate into
    sections the kernel is edible and produces an oil of commercial
    value
    the leaves are compound and alternate with 15 to 23 leaflets to
    each
comparisons the butternut juglans cinerea is another tree that
    has the pith divided into little chambers but the little chambers
    here are shorter than in the black walnut as may be seen from a
    comparison of figs 71 and 72 the bark of the butternut is light
    gray while that of the black walnut is dark the buds in the
    butternut are longer than those of the black walnut and are light
    brown instead of gray in color the form of the tree is low and
    spreading as compared with the black walnut the fruit in the
    butternut is elongated while that of the black walnut is round the
    leaves of the butternut have fewer leaflets and these are lighter in
    color

    species under cultivation differ from the native species in having
    buds and leaves smaller in size more numerous and darker in color
the magnolias
the various species of magnolia trees are readily distinguished by their
buds they all prefer moist rich soil and have their principal value as
decorative trees on the lawn they are distinctly southern trees some
species under cultivation in the united states come from asia but the
two most commonly grown in the eastern states are the cucumber tree and
the umbrella tree

    deeply ridged as shown in fig 81 the buds are hardly
    noticeable the twigs sometimes bear small spines on one side the
    leaves are large compound and fernlike the individual leaflets
    are small and delicate
form and size the locust is a mediumsized tree developing a slender
    straight trunk when grown alongside of others see fig 82
range canada and united states
soil and location the locust will grow on almost any soil except a wet
    heavy one it requires plenty of light
enemies the locust borer has done serious damage to this tree the
    grubs of this insect burrow in the sapwood and kill the tree or make
    it unfit for commercial use the locust miner is a beetle which is
    now annually defoliating trees of this species in large numbers
value for planting it has little value for ornamental planting
commercial value though shortlived the locust grows very rapidly it
    is extremely durable in contact with the soil and possesses great
    strength it is therefore extensively grown for fenceposts and
    railroad ties locust posts will last from fifteen to twenty years
    the wood is valuable for fuel

    catalpa is preferable to the common catalpa for planting
commercial value the wood is extremely durable in contact with the soil
    and is consequently used for posts and railroad ties
other characters the flowers which appear in late june and early
    july are large white and very showy
other common names indian bean western catalpa
comparisons the white flowering dogwood cornus florida is a small
    tree which also has its leaves in whorls of three or sometimes
    opposite it can be readily told from other trees however by the
    small square plates into which the outer bark on the trunk divides
    itself see fig 85 and by the characteristic drooping character of
    its branches it is one of the most common plants in our eastern
    deciduous forests it is extremely beautiful both in the spring and
    in the fall and is frequently planted for ornament there are many
    varieties of dogwood in common use
white mulberry morus alba
a small tree recognized by its small round reddish brown buds and
light brown finely furrowed wavy looking bark
the tree probably a native of china is grown under cultivation in
eastern canada and united states it grows rapidly in moist soil and is
not fastidious in its light requirements its chief value is for
screening and for underplanting in woodlands
the red mulberry morus rubra is apt to be confused with the white
mulberry but differs in the following characters the leaves of the red
mulberry are rough on the upper side and downy on the under side
whereas the leaves of the white mulberry are smooth and shiny the buds
in the red are larger and more shiny than those of the white
the osage orange toxylon pomiferum is similar to the mulberry in
the light golden color of its bark but differs from it in possessing
conspicuous spines along the twigs and branches and a more ridged bark
chapter iv
the structure and requirements of trees
to be able fully to appreciate trees their mode of life
their enemies and their care one must know something of
their structure and life requirements
structure of trees among the lower forms of plants there is very little
    distinction between the various partsno differentiation into root
    stem or crown often the lower forms of animal and vegetable life
    are so similar that one cannot discriminate between them but as we
    ascend in the scale the various plant forms become more and more
    complex until we reach the tree which is the largest and highest
    form of all plants the tree is a living organism composed of cells
    like any other living organism it has many parts every one of
    which has a definite purpose the three principal parts are the
    stem the crown and the root
  the stem if we examine the crosssection of a tree fig 86 we will
    notice that it is made up of numerous rings arranged in sections of
    different color and structure the central part is known as the
    pith around the pith comes a dark closegrained series of rings
    known as the heartwood and outside the heartwood comes a lighter
    layer the sapwood the cambium layer surrounds the sapwood and
    the bark covers all the cambium layer is the most important
    tissue of the tree and together with part of the sapwood
    transports the water and food of the tree it is for this reason
    that a tree may be hollow without heart and sapwood and still
    produce foliage and fruit
illustration fig 86the crosssection of a tree
  the crown the crown varies in form in different species and is
    developed by the growth of new shoots from buds the bud grows out
    to a certain length and forms the branch afterwards it thickens
    only and does not increase in length new branches will then form
    from other buds on the same branch this explains in part the
    characteristic branching of trees fig 87
illustration fig 87characteristic form and branching of trees
the trees in the photograph are pin oaks
    the leaves are the stomach and lungs of the tree their broad
    blades are a device to catch the sunlight which is needed in the
    process of digesting the food of the tree the leaves are arranged
    on the twigs in such a way as to catch the most sunlight the leaves
    take up the carbonic acid gas from the air decompose it under the
    influence of light and combine it with the minerals and water
    brought up by the roots from the soil the resulting chemical
    combinations are the sugars and starches used by the cambium layer
    in building up the body of the tree a green pigment chlorophyll
    in the leaf is the medium by which with the aid of sunlight the
    sugars are manufactured
illustration fig 88roots of a hemlock tree in their search for
water
    the chlorophyll gives the leaf its green color and this explains
    why a tree pales when it is in a dying condition or when its life
    processes are interfered with the other colors of the leafthe
    reds browns and yellows of the fall or springare due to other
    pigments these are angular crystals of different hues which at
    certain times of the year become more conspicuous than at others a
    phenomenon which explains the variation in the colors of the leaves
    during the different seasons
    it is evident that a tree is greatly dependent upon its leaves for
    the manufacture of food and one can therefore readily see why it
    is important to prevent destruction of the leaves by insects or
    through overtrimming
  the root the root develops in much the same manner as the crown its
    depth and spread will vary with the species but will also depend
    somewhat upon the condition of the soil around it a deep or a dry
    soil will tend to develop a deep root while a shallow or moist soil
    will produce a shallow root fig 88
    the numerous fine hairs which cover the roots serve the purpose of
    taking up food and water from the soil while the heavy roots help
    to support the tree the roothairs are extremely tender are easily
    dried out when exposed to the sun and wind and are apt to become
    overheated when permitted to remain tightly packed for any length of
    time these considerations are of practical importance in the
    planting of trees and in the application of fertilizers it is these
    fine rootlets far away from the trunk of the tree that have to be
    fed and all fertilizers must therefore be applied at points some
    distance from the trunk and not close to it where merely the large
    supporting roots are located in the cultivation of trees the same
    principle holds true
requirements of trees trees are dependent upon certain soil and
    atmospheric conditions which influence their growth and development
  1 influence of moisture the form of the tree and its growth and
    structure depend greatly upon the supply of moisture botanists
    have taken the moisture factor as the basis of classification and
    have subdivided trees into those that grow in moist places
    hydrophytes those that grow in medium soils mesophytes and
    those that grow in dry places xerophytes water is taken up by
    the roots of the tree from the soil the liquid absorbed by the
    roots carries in solution the mineral saltsthe food of the
    treeand no food can be taken up unless it is in solution much of
    the water is used by the tree and an enormous amount is given off in
    the process of evaporation
illustration fig 89dead branches at the top caused by insufficient
water
    these facts will explain some of the fundamental principles in the
    care of trees to a tree growing on a city street or on a lawn where
    nature fails to supply the requisite amount of water the latter
    must be supplied artificially especially during the hot summer
    months or else dead branches may result as seen in fig 89 too
    much thinning out of the crown causes excessive evaporation and too
    much cutting out in woodlands causes the soil to dry and the trees
    to suffer for the want of moisture this also explains why it is
    essential in wooded areas to retain on the ground the fallen
    leaves in decomposing and mixing with the soil the fallen leaves
    not only supply the trees with food material but also tend to
    conserve moisture in the ground and to prevent the drying out of the
    soil raking off the leaves from wooded areas a practice common in
    parks and on private estateshurts the trees seriously some soils
    may have plenty of moisture but may also be so heavily saturated
    with acids or salts that the tree cannot utilize the moisture and
    it suffers from drought just the same as if there had been no
    moisture at all in the soil such soils are said to be
    physiologically dry and need treatment
    in the development of disease moisture is a contributing factor
    and therefore in cavities or underneath bandages where there is
    likely to be an accumulation of moisture decay will do more damage
    than in places that are dry and exposed to the sun
  2 influence of soil soil is made up of fine particles of sand and
    rock and of vegetable matter called humus a tree will require a
    certain soil and unsuitable soils can be very often modified to
    suit the needs of the tree a deep moderately loose sandy loam
    however which is sufficiently aerated and well supplied with
    water will support almost any tree too much of any one constituent
    will make a soil unfit for the production of trees if too much clay
    is present the soil becomes stiff if too much vegetable matter is
    present the soil becomes sour the physical character of the soil
    is also important by physical character is meant the porosity which
    results from breaking up the soil this is accomplished by ploughing
    or cultivation in nature worms help to do this for the soil but
    on streets an occasional digging up of the soil about the base of
    the tree is essential
    humus or the organic matter in the soil is composed of litter
    leaves and animal ingredients that have decayed under the influence
    of bacteria the more vegetable matter in the humus the darker the
    soil and therefore a good soil such as one finds on the upper
    surface of a welltilled farm has quite a dark color when however
    a soil contains an unusual quantity of humus it is known as muck
    and when there is still more humus present we find peat neither
    of these two soils is suitable for proper tree growth
illustration fig 90a tree in the open note the full development
of the wide crown with branches starting near the ground the tree is
the european larch
  3 influence of light light is required by the leaves in the process
    of assimilation cutting off some of the light from a tree affects
    its form this is why trees grown in the open have widespreading
    crowns with branches starting near the ground as in fig 90 while
    the same species growing in the forest produces tall lanky trees
    free from branches to but a few feet from the top as in fig 91
    some trees can endure more shade than others but all will grow in
    full light this explains why trees like the beech hemlock sugar
    maple spruce holly and dogwood can grow in the shade while the
    poplar birch and willow require light it also explains why in
    the forest the lower branches die and fall offa process known in
    forestry as natural pruning the influence of light on the form of
    trees should be well understood by all those who plant trees and by
    those designing landscape effects
illustration fig 91a tree in the forest note the tall stem free
from branches and the small narrow crown
  4 influence of heat trees require a certain amount of heat they
    receive it partly from the sun and partly from the soil evaporation
    prevents the overheating of the crown the main stem of the tree is
    heated by water from the soil therefore trees in the open begin
    growth in the spring earlier than trees in the forest because the
    soil in the open is warmer shrubs begin their growth earlier than
    trees because of the nearness of their crowns to their root systems
    this also explains why a warm rain will start vegetation quickly
    too much heat will naturally cause excessive drying of the roots or
    excessive evaporation from the leaves and therefore more water is
    needed by the tree in summer than in winter
  5 influence of season and frost the life processes of a tree are
    checked when the temperature sinks below a certain point the tree
    is thus during the winter in a period of rest and only a few
    chemical changes take place which lead up to the starting of
    vegetation in eastern united states growth starts in april and
    ceases during the latter part of august or in early september the
    different parts of a tree may freeze solid during the winter without
    injury provided the tree is a native one exotic trees may suffer
    greatly from extreme cold this is one of the main reasons why it is
    always advisable to plant native trees rather than those that are
    imported and have not yet been acclimatized frosts during
    midwinter are not quite as injurious as early and late frosts and
    therefore if one is going to protect plants from the winters cold
    it is well to apply the covering early enough and to keep it on
    late enough to overcome this difficulty
    the mechanical injuries from frost are also important snow and
    sleet will weigh down branches but rarely break them while frost
    will cause them to become brittle and to break easily those who
    climb and prune trees should be especially cautious on frosty days
  6 influence of air on the under side of leaves and on other
    surfaces of a tree little pores known as stomata may be found in
    the bark of birch and cherry trees these openings are very
    conspicuous and are there known as lenticels these pores are
    necessary for the breathing of the tree respiration whereby
    carbonic acid gas is taken in from the air and oxygen given out the
    process of assimilation depends upon this breathing process and it
    is therefore evident that when the stomata are clogged as may occur
    where a tree is subjected to smoke or dust the life processes of
    the tree will be interfered with the same injurious effect results
    when the stomata of the roots are interfered with such interference
    may occur in cases where a heavy layer of soil is piled around the
    base of a tree where the soil about the base of a tree is allowed
    to become compact where a tree is planted too deep or where the
    roots are submerged under water for any length of time in any case
    the air cannot get to the roots and the tree suffers nature takes
    special cognizance of this important requirement in the case of
    cypress trees which habitually grow under water here the trees are
    provided with special woody protuberances known as cypress knees
    which emerge above water and take the necessary air see fig 18
conclusions from the foregoing it will be seen that trees have certain
    needs that nature or man must supply these requirements differ
    with the different species and in all work of planting and care as
    well as in the natural distribution of trees it is both interesting
    and necessary to observe these individual wants to select species
    in accordance with local conditions and to care for trees in
    conformity with their natural needs
chapter v
what trees to plant and how
the following classification will show the value of the more important
trees for different kinds of planting the species are arranged in the
order of their merit for the particular object under consideration and
the comments accompanying each tree are intended to bring out its
special qualifications for that purpose
conditions for tree growth in one part of the country differ from those
of another and these lists especially applicable to the eastern states
may not at all fit some other locality

quality of trees trees grown in a nursery are preferable for
    transplanting to trees grown in the forest nurserygrown trees
    possess a welldeveloped root system with numerous fibrous rootlets
    a straight stem a symmetrical crown and a welldefined leader
    trees grown in neighboring nurseries are preferable to those grown
    at great distances because they will be better adapted to local
    climatic and soil conditions the short distances over which they
    must be transported also will entail less danger to the roots
    through drying for lawn planting the branches should reach low to
    the ground while for street purposes the branches should start at
    about seven feet from the ground for street planting it is also
    important that the stem should be perfectly straight and about two
    inches in diameter for woodland planting the form of the tree is
    of minor consideration though it is well to have the leader well
    defined here as well as in the other cases see fig 95
when and how to procure the trees the trees should be selected in the
    nursery personally some persons prefer to seal the more valuable
    specimens with leaden seals fall is the best time to make the
    selection because at that time one can have a wider choice of
    material selecting thus early will also prevent delay in delivery
    at the time when it is desired to plant
when to plant the best time to plant trees is early spring just before
    growth begins and after the frost is out of the ground from the
    latter part of march to the early part of may is generally the
    planting period in the eastern states
    where one has to plant both coniferous and deciduous trees it is
    best to get the deciduous in first and then the conifers
how to plant the location of the trees with relation to each other
    should be carefully considered on the lawn they should be
    separated far enough to allow for the full spread of the tree on
    streets trees should be planted thirty to thirtyfive feet apart
    and in case of the elm forty to fifty feet in woodlands it is
    well to plant as close as six feet apart where small seedlings are
    used and about twelve feet apart in the case of trees an inch or
    more in diameter an abundance of good soil one to two cubic yards
    is essential with each tree where the specimens used are an inch or
    two in diameter a rich mellow loam such as one finds on the
    surface of a welltilled farm is the ideal soil manure should
    never be placed in direct contact with the roots or stem of the
    tree
    protection of the roots from drying is the chief precaution to be
    observed during the planting process and for this reason a cloudy
    day is preferable to a sunny day for planting in case of
    evergreens the least exposure of the roots is liable to result
    disastrously even more so than in case of deciduous trees this is
    why evergreens are lifted from the nursery with a ball of soil
    around the roots all bruised roots should be cut off before the
    tree is planted and the crown of the tree of the deciduous species
    should be slightly trimmed in order to equalize the loss of roots by
    a corresponding decrease in leaf surface
    the tree should be set into the tree hole at the same depth that it
    stood in the nursery its roots where there is no ball of soil
    around them should be carefully spread out and good soil should be
    worked in carefully with the fingers among the fine rootlets every
    root fibre is thus brought into close contact with the soil more
    good soil should be added in layers and firmly packed about the
    roots the last layer should remain loose so that it may act as a
    mulch or as an absorbent of moisture the tree should then be
    thoroughly watered
illustration fig 95specifications for a street tree
after care during the first season the tree should be watered and the
    soil around its base slightly loosened at least once a week
    especially on hot summer days where trees are planted on streets
    near the curb they should also be fastened to stakes and protected
    with a wire guard six feet high see fig 95 wire netting of
    inch mesh and 17 gauge is the most desirable material
illustration fig 96a home nursery austrian pines in front
suggestions for a home or school nursery schools farms and private
    estates may conveniently start a tree nursery on the premises and
    raise their own trees twoyear seedling trees or fouryear
    transplants are best suited for this purpose these may be obtained
    from several reliable nurseries in various parts of the country that
    make a specialty of raising small trees for such purposes the cost
    of such trees should be from three to fifteen dollars per thousand
    the little trees which range from one to two feet in height will
    be shipped in bundles immediately upon arrival the bundles should
    be untied and the trees immersed in a pail containing water mixed
    with soil the bundles should then be placed in the ground
    temporarily until they can be set out in their proper places in
    this process the individual bundles should be slanted with their
    tops toward the south and the spot chosen should be cool and shady
    at no time should the roots of these plants be exposed even for a
    moment to sun and wind and they should always be kept moist the
    little trees may remain in this trench for two weeks without injury
    they should then be planted out in rows each row one foot apart for
    conifers and two feet for broadleaf trees the individual trees
    should be set ten inches apart in the row careful weeding and
    watering is the necessary attention later on
chapter vi
the care of trees
study i insects injurious to trees and how to combat them
in a general way trees are attacked by three classes of insects and
the remedy to be employed in each case depends upon the class to which
the insect belongs the three classes of insects are
1 those that chew and swallow some portion of the leaf as for
example the elm leaf beetle and the tussock gipsy and browntail
moths
2 those that suck the plant juices from the leaf or bark such as the
san jos scale oystershell and scurfy scales the cottony maple
scale the maple phenacoccus on the sugar maples and the various
aphides on beech norway maple etc
3 those that bore inside of the wood or inner bark the principal
members of this class are the leopard moth the hickorybark borer the
sugarmaple borer the elm borer and the bronzebirch borer
the chewing insects are destroyed by spraying the leaves with arsenate
of lead or paris green the insects feed upon the poisoned foliage and
thus are themselves poisoned
the sucking insects are killed by a contact poison that is by spraying
or washing the affected parts of the tree with a solution which acts
externally on the bodies of the insects smothering or stifling them
the standard solutions for this purpose are kerosene emulsion soap and
water tobacco extract or limesulfur wash
illustration fig 97a gaspower spraying apparatus
the boring insects are eliminated by cutting out the insect with a
knife by injecting carbon bisulphide into the burrow and clogging the
orifice immediately after injection with putty or soap or in some cases
where the tree is hopelessly infested by cutting down and burning the
entire tree
illustration fig 98a barrel handpump spraying outfit
for information regarding the one of these three classes to which any
particular insect belongs and for specific instructions on the
application of a remedy the reader is advised to write to his state
entomologist or to the us bureau of entomology at washington dc the
letter should state the name of the tree affected together with the
character of the injury and should be accompanied by a specimen of the
insect or by a piece of the affected leaf or bark preferably by both
the advice received will be authentic and will be given without charge
illustration fig 99eggmasses of the tussock moth
when to spray in the case of chewing insects the latter part of may
    is the time to spray the caterpillars hatch from their eggs and
    the elm leaf beetle leaves its winter quarters at that time in the
    case of sucking insects the instructions will have to be more
    specific depending upon the particular insect in question some
    sucking insects can best be handled in may or early june when their
    young emerge others can be effectively treated in the fall or
    winter when the trees are dormant
how to spray thoroughness is the essential principle in all spraying
    in the case of leafeating insects this means covering every leaf
    with the poison and applying it to the under side of the leaves
    where the insects generally feed in the case of sucking insects
    thoroughness means an effort to touch every insect with the spray
    it should be borne in mind that the insect can be killed only when
    hit with the chemical the solution should be well stirred and
    should be applied by means of a nozzle that will coat every leaf
    with a fine mistlike spray mere drenching or too prolonged an
    application will cause the solution to run off special precautions
    should be taken with contact poisons to see that the formula is
    correct too strong a solution will burn the foliage and tender
    bark
spraying apparatus there are various forms of spraying apparatus in the
    market including small knapsack pumps barrel handpumps and
    gasolene and gaspower sprayers figs 97 and 98 hose and nozzles
    are essential accessories onehalf inch threeply hose of the best
    quality is necessary to stand the heavy pressure and wear two
    50foot lengths is the usual quantity required for use with a barrel
    handpump each line of hose should be supplied with a bamboo pole
    10 feet long having a brass tube passed through it to carry the
    nozzle the vermorel nozzle is the best type to use the cost of a
    barrel outfit including two lines of hose nozzles and truck
    should be from 30 to 40 power sprayers cost from 150 to 300 or
    more
spraying material
  arsenate of lead should be used in the proportion of 4 pounds of the
    chemical to 50 gallons of water a brand of arsenate of lead
    containing at least 14 per cent of arsenic oxide with not more than
    50 per cent of water should be insisted upon this spray may be used
    successfully against caterpillars and other leafeating insects in
    the spring or summer
  whaleoil soap should be used at the rate of 1 pounds of the soap
    to 1 gallon of hot water if applied to the tree in winter as a
    spray in summer use 1 pound of the soap to 5 gallons of water this
    treatment is useful for most sucking insects
  limesulfur wash is an excellent material to use against sucking
    insects such as the san jos scale and other armored scales the
    application of a limesulfur wash when put on during the dormant
    season is not likely to harm a tree and has such an excellent
    cleansing effect that the benefits to be derived in this direction
    alone are often sufficient to meet the cost of the treatment
    limesulfur wash consists of a mixture boiled one hour of 40
    pounds of lime and 80 pounds of sulfur in 50 gallons of water it
    may be had in prepared form and should then be used at the rate of 1
    gallon to about 9 gallons of water in winter or early spring before
    the buds open at other times of the year and for the softerbodied
    insects a more diluted mixture possibly 1 part to 30 or 40 parts of
    water should be used varying with each case separately
  kerosene emulsion consists of onehalf pound of hard soap 1 gallon
    of boiling water and 2 gallons of kerosene it may be obtained in
    prepared form and is then to be used at the rate of one part of the
    solution to nine parts of water when applied in winter or to the
    bark only in summer use 2 gallons of the solution to a 40gallon
    barrel of water when applying it to the leaves in the summer
    kerosene emulsion is useful as a treatment for scale insects
  tobacco water should be prepared by steeping onehalf pound of
    tobacco stems or leaves in a gallon of boiling water and later
    diluting the product with 5 to 10 gallons of water it is
    particularly useful for plant lice in the summer
the life history of an insect in a general way all insects have four
    stages of transformation before a new generation is produced it is
    important to consider the nature of these four stages in order that
    the habits of any particular insect and the remedies applicable in
    combating it may be understood
    all insects develop from eggs fig 99 the eggs then hatch into
    caterpillars or grubs which is the larva stage in which most
    insects do the greatest damage to trees the caterpillars or grubs
    grow and develop rapidly and hence their feeding is most ravenous
    following the larva stage comes the third or pupa stage which is
    the dormant stage of the insect in this stage the insect curls
    itself up under the protection of a silken cocoon like the tussock
    moth or of a curled leaf like the browntail moth or it may be
    entirely unsheltered like the pupa of the elm leaf beetle after the
    pupa stage comes the adult insect which may be a moth or a
    beetle
    a study of the four stages of any particular insect is known as a
    study of its life history the important facts to know about the
    life history of an insect are the stage in which it does most of its
    feeding and the period of the year in which this occurs it is also
    important to know how the insect spends the winter in order to
    decide upon a winter treatment
important insects
the elm leaf beetle
life history the elm leaf beetle fig 100 is annually causing the
    defoliation of thousands of elm trees throughout the united states
    several successive defoliations are liable to kill a tree the
    insects pass the winter in the beetle form hiding themselves in
    attics and wherever else they can secure shelter in the middle of
    may when the buds of the elm trees unfold the beetles emerge from
    their winter quarters mate and commence eating the leaves thus
    producing little holes through them while this feeding is going on
    the females deposit little bright yellow eggs on the under side of
    the leaves which soon hatch into small larvae or grubs the grubs
    then eat away the soft portion of the leaf causing it to look like
    lacework the grubs become full grown in twenty days crawl down to
    the base of the tree and there transform into naked orangecolored
    pupae this occurs in the early part of august after remaining in
    the pupa stage about a week they change into beetles again which
    either begin feeding or go to winter quarters
remedies there are three ways of combating this insect first by
    spraying the foliage with arsenate of lead in the latter part of
    may while the beetles are feeding and repeating the spraying in
    june when the larvae emerge the spraying method is the one most to
    be relied on in fighting this insect a second though less
    important remedy consists in destroying the pupae when they
    gather in large quantities at the base of the tree this may be
    accomplished by gathering them bodily and destroying them or by
    pouring hot water or a solution of kerosene over them in large
    trees it may be necessary to climb to the crotches of the main limbs
    to get some of them the third remedy lies in gathering and
    destroying the adult beetles when found in their winter quarters
    the application of bands of burlap or tanglefoot or of other
    substances often seen on the trunks of elm trees is useless since
    these bands only prevent the larvae from crawling down from the
    leaves to the base and serve to prevent nothing from crawling up
    scraping the trunks of elm trees is also a waste of effort

5 overwintered beetle enlarged 6 fresh brightly colored beetle
enlarged 7 under surface of leaf showing larvae feeding 8 leaf eaten
by larvae 9 leaf showing holes eaten by beetles
the tussock moth
life history this insect appears in the form of a redheaded
    yellowcolored caterpillar during the latter part of may and in
    june and july the caterpillars surround themselves with silken
    cocoons and change into pupae the mature moths emerge from the
    cocoons after a period of about two weeks and the females which
    are wingless soon deposit their eggs on the bark of trees on
    twigs fences and other neighboring objects these eggs form white
    clusters of nearly 350 individual eggs each and are very
    conspicuous all winter see fig 101
remedies there are two ways of combating this insect 1 by spraying
    with arsenate of lead for the caterpillars during the latter part of
    may and early june 2 by removing and destroying the egg masses in
    the fall or winter

the gipsy moth
life history this insect imported from europe to this country in 1868
    has ever since proved a serious enemy of most shade forest and
    fruit trees in the new england states it even feeds on
    evergreens killing the trees by a single defoliation
    the insect appears in the caterpillar stage from april to july it
    feeds at night and rests by day the mature caterpillar which is
    dark in color may be recognized by rows of blue and red spots along
    its back after july egg masses are deposited by the female moths
    on the bark of trees and on leaves fences and other neighboring
    objects here they remain over the winter until they hatch in the
    spring the flat egg masses are round or oval in shape and are
    yellowishbrown in color see fig 102
remedies spray for the caterpillars in june with arsenate of lead and
    apply creosote to the egg masses whenever found
the browntail moth
life history this insect was introduced here from europe in 1890 and
    has since done serious damage to shade forest and fruit trees and
    to shrubs in the new england states
    it appears in the caterpillar stage in the early spring and
    continues to feed on the leaves and buds until the last of june
    then the caterpillars pupate the moths come out and in july and
    august the egg clusters appear these hatch into caterpillars which
    form nests for themselves by drawing the leaves together here they
    remain protected until the spring see fig 103
remedies collect the winter nests from october to april and burn them
    also spray the trees for caterpillars in early may and especially in
    august with arsenate of lead

the fall webworm
the caterpillars of this insect congregate in colonies and surround
themselves with a web which often reaches the size of a foot or more in
diameter these webs are common on trees in july and august cutting off
the webs or burning them on the twigs is the most practical remedy
illustration fig 105branch showing work of the leopard moth larva
the leopard moth
life history this insect does its serious damage in the grub form the
    grubs which are whitish in color with brown heads and which vary in
    size from 38 of an inch to 3 inches in length fig 104 may be
    found boring in the wood of the branches and trunk of the tree all
    winter fig 105 the leopard moth requires two years to complete
    its round of life the mature moths are marked with dark spots
    resembling a leopards skin hence the name fig 106 it is one of
    the commonest and most destructive insects in the east and is
    responsible for the recent death of thousands of the famous elm
    trees in new haven and boston fig 107
illustration fig 106the leopard moth
remedies trees likely to be infested with this insect should be
    examined three or four times a year for wilted twigs dead branches
    and strings of expelled frass all of which may indicate the
    presence of this borer badly infested branches should be cut off
    and burned trees so badly infested that treatment becomes too
    complicated should be cut down and destroyed where the insects are
    few and can be readily reached an injection of carbon bisulphide
    into the burrow the orifice of which is then immediately closed
    with soap or putty will often destroy the insects within
illustration fig 107elm tree attacked by the leopard moth
the hickory bark borer
life history this insect is a small brown or black beetle in its mature
    form and a small legless white grub in its winter stage the beetles
    appear from june to august in july they deposit their eggs in the
    outer sapwood immediately under the bark of the trunk and larger
    branches the eggs soon hatch and the grubs feed on the living
    tissue of the tree forming numerous galleries the grubs pass the
    winter in a nearly fullgrown condition transform to pupae in may
    and emerge as beetles in june
remedies the presence of the insect can be detected by the small holes
    in the bark of the trees and the fine sawdust which is ejected from
    these holes when the insects are active it is important to
    emphasize the advisability of detecting the fine sawdust because
    that is the best indication of the actual operations of the hickory
    bark borer these holes however will not be noticeable until the
    insect has completed its transformation in summer the infested
    trees show wilted leaves and many dead twigs holes in the base of
    the petioles of these leaves are also signs of the working of the
    insect since the insect works underneath the bark it is
    inaccessible for treatment and all infested trees should be cut down
    and burned or the bark removed and the insects destroyed this
    should be done before the beetles emerge from the tree in june
plant lice or aphides
these often appear on the under side of the leaves of the beech norway
maple tulip tree etc they excrete a sweet sticky liquid called
honeydew and cause the leaves to curl or drop spraying with
whaleoil soap solution formed by adding one pound of the soap to five
gallons of water is the remedy
study ii tree diseases
because trees have wants analogous to those of human beings they also
have diseases similar to those which afflict human beings in many cases
these diseases act like cancerous growths upon the human body in some
instances the ailment may be a general failing due to improper feeding
and in other cases it may be due to interference with the life processes
of the tree
how to tell an ailing tree whatever the cause an ailing tree will
    manifest its ailment by one or more symptoms
    a change of color in the leaves at a time when they should be
    perfectly green indicates that the tree is not growing under normal
    conditions possibly because of an insufficiency of moisture or
    light or an overdose of foreign gases or salts withering of the
    leaves is another sign of irregularity in water supply dead tops
    point to some difficulty in the soil conditions or to some disease
    of the roots or branches spotted leaves and mushroomlike growths
    or brackets protruding from the bark as in fig 108 are sure signs
    of disease
    in attempting to find out whether a tree is healthy or not one
    would therefore do well to consider whether the conditions under
    which it is growing are normal or not whether the tree is suitable
    for the location whether the soil is too dry or too wet whether
    the roots are deprived of their necessary water and air by an
    impenetrable cover of concrete or soil whether the soil is well
    drained and free from foreign gases and salts whether the tree is
    receiving plenty of light or is too much exposed and whether it is
    free from insects and fungi
    if after a thorough examination it is found that the ailment has
    gone too far it may not be wise to try to save the tree a timely
    removal of a tree badly infested with insects or fungi may often be
    the best procedure and may save many neighboring trees from
    contagious infection for this however no rules can be laid down
    and much will depend on the local conditions and the judgment and
    knowledge of the person concerned
illustration fig 108a bracket fungus elfvingia megaloma on a
tulip tree
fungi as factors of disease the trees the shrubs and the flowers with
    which we are familiar are rooted in the ground and derive their food
    both from the soil and from the air there is however another
    group of plantsthe fungithe roots of which grow in trees and
    other plants and which obtain their food entirely from the trees or
    plants upon which they grow the fungi cannot manufacture their own
    food as other plants do and consequently absorb the food of their
    host eventually reducing it to dust the fungi are thus
    diseaseproducing factors and the source of most of the diseases of
    trees
    when we can see fungi growing on a tree we may safely assume that
    they are already in an advanced state of development we generally
    discover their presence when their fruiting bodies appear on the
    surface of the tree as shown in fig 109 these fruiting bodies are
    the familiar mushrooms puffballs toadstools or shelflike brackets
    that one often sees on trees in some cases they spread over the
    surface of the wood in thin patches they vary in size from large
    bodies to mere pustules barely visible to the naked eye their
    variation in color is also significant ranging from colorless to
    black and red but never green they often emulate the color of the
    bark fig 110
    radiating from these fruiting bodies into the tissues of the tree
    are a large number of minute fibers comprising the mycelium of
    the fungus these fibers penetrate the body of the tree in all
    directions and absorb its food the mycelium is the most important
    part of the fungous growth if the fruiting body is removed another
    soon takes its place but if the entire mycelium is cut out the
    fungus will never come back the fruiting body of the fungus bears
    the seed or spores these spores are carried by the wind or
    insects to other trees where they take root in some wound or crevice
    of the bark and start a new infestation
illustration fig 109the fruiting body of a fungus
    the infestation will be favored in its growth if the spore can find
    plenty of food water warmth and darkness as these conditions
    generally exist in wounds and cavities of trees it is wise to keep
    all wounds well covered with coal tar and to so drain the cavities
    that moisture cannot lodge in them this subject will be gone into
    more fully in the following two studies on pruning trees and tree
    repair
illustration fig 110the birchfungus rot polyponis betulinus
fr note the similarity in the color of the fruiting body and bark of
the tree
    while the majority of the fungi grow on the trunks and limbs of
    trees some attack the leaves some the twigs and others the roots
    some fungi grow on living wood some on dead wood and some on both
    those that attack the living trees are the most dangerous from the
    standpoint of disease
the chestnut disease the disease which is threatening the destruction
    of all the chestnut trees in america is a fungus which has within
    recent years assumed such vast proportions that it deserves special
    comment the fungus is known as diaporthe parasitica murrill
    and was first observed in the vicinity of new york in 1905 at that
    time only a few trees were known to have been killed by this
    disease but now the disease has advanced over the whole chestnut
    area in the united states reaching as far south as virginia and as
    far west as buffalo fig 111 shows the result of the chestnut
    disease
    the fungus attacks the cambium tissue underneath the bark it enters
    through a wound in the bark and sends its fungous threads from the
    point of infection all around the trunk until the latter is girdled
    and killed this may all happen within one season it is not until
    the tree has practically been destroyed that the disease makes its
    appearance on the surface of the bark in the form of brown patches
    studded with little pustules that carry the spores when once
    girdled the tree is killed above the point of infection and
    everything above dies while some of the twigs below may live until
    they are attacked individually by the disease or until the trunk
    below their origin is infected
    all species of chestnut trees are subject to the disease the
    japanese and spanish varieties appear to be highly resistant but
    are not immune other species of trees besides chestnuts are not
    subject to the disease
illustration fig 111chestnut trees killed by the chestnut
disease
    there is no remedy or preventive for this disease from the nature
    of its attack which is on the inner layer of the tree it is
    evident that all applications of fungicides which must necessarily
    be applied to the outside of the tree will not reach the disease
    injections are impossible and other suggested remedies such as
    boring holes in the wood for the purpose of inserting chemicals are
    futile
    the wood of the chestnut tree within three or four years after its
    death is still sound and may be used for telephone and telegraph
    poles posts railroad ties lumber and firewood
spraying for fungous diseases where a fungous disease is attacking the
    leaves fruit or twigs spraying with bordeaux mixture may prove
    effective the application of bordeaux mixture is deterrent rather
    than remedial and should therefore be made immediately before the
    disease appears the nature of the disease and the time of treatment
    can be determined without cost by submitting specimens of affected
    portions of the plant for analysis and advice to the state
    agricultural experiment station or to the united states department
    of agriculture
    bordeaux mixture the standard fungicide material consists of a
    solution of 6 pounds of copper sulphate blue vitriol with 4 pounds
    of slaked lime in 50 gallons of water it may be purchased in
    prepared form in the open market and when properly made has a
    brilliant skyblue color spraying with bordeaux mixture should be
    done in the fall early spring or early summer but never during
    the period when the trees are in bloom
study iii pruning trees
fundamental principles
trees are very much like human beings in their requirements mode of
life and diseases and the general principles applicable to the care of
one are equally important to the intelligent treatment of the other the
removal of limbs from trees as well as from human beings must be done
sparingly and judiciously wounds in both trees and human beings must
be disinfected and dressed to keep out all fungus or disease germs
fungous growths of trees are similar to human cancers both in the
manner of their development and the surgical treatment which they
require improper pruning will invite fungi and insects to the tree
hence the importance of a knowledge of fundamental principles in this
branch of tree care
illustration fig 112a tree pruned improperly and too severely
time too much pruning at one time should never be practiced fig 112
    and no branch should be removed from a tree without good reason for
    so doing dead and broken branches should be removed as soon as
    observed regardless of any special pruning season because they are
    dangerous unsightly and carry insects and disease into the heart of
    the tree but all other pruning whether it be for the purpose of
    perfecting the form in shade trees or for increasing the production
    of fruit in orchard trees should be confined to certain seasons
    shade and ornamental trees can best be pruned in the fall while the
    leaves are still on the tree and while the tree itself is in
    practically a dormant state
proper cutting all pruning should be commenced at the top of the tree
    and finished at the bottom a shortened branch excepting in poplars
    and willows which should be cut in closely should terminate in
    small twigs which may draw the sap to the freshly cut wound where a
    branch is removed entirely the cut should be madeclose and even
    with the trunk as in fig 113 wherever there is a stub left after
    cutting off a branch the growing tissue of the tree cannot cover it
    and the stub eventually decays falls out and leaves a hole see
    fig 114 which serves to carry disease and insects to the heart of
    the tree this idea of close cutting cannot be overemphasized
    where large branches have to be removed the splitting and ripping
    of the bark along the trunk is prevented by making one cut beneath
    the branch about a foot or two away from the trunk and then
    another above close to the trunk
illustration fig 113branches properly cut close to the trunk
too severe pruning in pruning trees many people have a tendency to cut
    them back so severely as to remove everything but the bare trunk and
    a few of the main branches this process is known as heading
    back it is a method however which should not be resorted to
    except in trees that are very old and failing and even there only
    with certain species like the silver maple sycamore linden and
    elm trees like the sugar maple will not stand this treatment at
    all the willow is a tree that will stand the process very readily
    and the carolina poplar must be cut back every few years in order
    to keep its crown from becoming too tall scraggy and unsafe
illustration fig 114a limb improperly cut note how the stub is
decaying and the resulting cavity is becoming diseased
covering wounds the importance of immediately covering all wounds with
    coal tar cannot be overstated if the wound is not tarred the
    exposed wood cracks as in fig 115 providing suitable quarters for
    disease germs that will eventually destroy the body of the tree
    coal tar is by far preferable to paint and other substances for
    covering the wound the tar penetrates the exposed wood producing
    an antiseptic as well as a protective effect paint only forms a
    covering which may peel off in course of time and which will later
    protrude from the cut thus forming between the paint and the wood
    a suitable breeding place for the development of destructive fungi
    or disease the application of tin covers burlap or other bandages
    to the wound is equally futile and in most cases even injurious
illustration fig 115result of a wound not covered with coal tar
the exposed wood cracked and decay set in
special considerations
pruning shade trees here the object is to produce a symmetrical crown
    and to have the lowest branches raised from the ground sufficiently
    high to enable pedestrians to pass under with raised umbrellas such
    pruning should therefore necessarily be light and confined to the
    low limbs and dead branches
pruning lawn trees here the charm of the tree lies in the low reach of
    the branches and the compactness of the crown the pruning should
    therefore be limited to the removal of dead and diseased branches
    only
pruning forest trees forest trees have a greater commercial value when
    their straight trunks are free from branches in the forest nature
    generally accomplishes this result and artificial pruning seldom has
    to be resorted to trees in the forest grow so closely together that
    they shut out the sunlight from their lower limbs thus causing the
    latter to die and fall off this is known as natural pruning in
    some european forests nature is assisted in its pruning by workmen
    who saw off the side branches before they fall of their own accord
    but in this country such practice would be considered too expensive
    hence it is seldom adopted
tools used in pruning
good tools are essential for quick and effective work in pruning two or
three good saws a pair of poleshears a polesaw a 16foot single
ladder a 40foot extension ladder of light spruce or pine with hickory
rungs a good pruning knife plenty of coal tar a firecan to heat the
tar a polebrush a small hand brush and plenty of good rope comprise
the principal equipment of the pruner
suggestions for the safety of tree climbers
1 before climbing a tree judge its general condition the trunk of a
tree that shows age disease or wooddestroying insects generally has
its branches in an equally unhealthy condition
2 the different kinds of wood naturally differ in their strength and
elasticity the soft and brash woods need greater precautions than the
strong and pliable ones the wood of all the poplars the ailanthus the
silver maple and the chestnut catalpa and willow is either too soft or
too brittle to be depended upon without special care the elm hickory
and oak have strong flexible woods and are therefore safer than
others the red oak is weaker than the other oaks the sycamore and
beech have a tough crossgrained wood which is fairly strong the
linden has a soft wood while the ash and gum though strong and
flexible are apt to split
3 look out for a limb that shows fungous growths every fungus sends
fibers into the main body of the limb which draw out its sap the
interior of the branch then loses its strength and becomes like a
powder outside appearances sometimes do not show the interior
condition but one should regard a fungus as a danger sign
4 when a limb is full of holes or knots it generally indicates that
borers have been working all kinds of galleries through it making it
unsafe the silver maple and sycamore maple are especially subject to
borers which in many cases work on the under side of the branch so
that the man in the tree looking down cannot see its dangerous
condition
5 a dead limb with the bark falling off indicates that it died at least
three months before and is therefore less safe than one with its bark
tightly adhering to it
6 branches are more apt to snap on a frosty day when they are covered
with an icy coating than on a warm summer day
7 always use the polesaw and poleshears on the tips of long branches
and use the polehook in removing dead branches of the ailanthus and
other brittle trees where it would be too dangerous to reach them
otherwise
8 be sure of the strength of a branch before tying an extension ladder
to it
study iv tree repair
where trees have been properly cared for from their early start wounds
and cavities and their subsequent elaborate treatment have no place but
where trees have been neglected or improperly cared for wounds and
cavities are bound to occur and early treatment becomes a necessity
there are two kinds of wounds on trees 1 surface wounds which do not
extend beyond the inner bark and 2 deep wounds or cavities which may
range from a small hole in a crotch to the hollow of an entire trunk
surface wounds surface wounds fig 116 are due to bruised bark and a
    tree thus injured can no longer produce the proper amount of foliage
    or remain healthy very long the reason for this becomes very
    apparent when one looks into the nature of the living or active
    tissue of a tree and notes how this tissue becomes affected by such
    injuries
illustration fig 116a surface wound properly freed from decayed
wood and covered with coal tar
    this living or active tissue is known as the cambium layer and is
    a thin tissue situated immediately under the bark it must
    completely envelop the stem root and branches of the trees the
    outer bark is a protective covering to this living layer while the
    entire interior wood tissue chiefly serves as a skeleton or support
    for the tree the cambium layer is the real active part of the
    tree it is the part which transmits the sap from the base of the
    tree to its crown it is the part which causes the tree to grow by
    the formation of new cells piled up in the form of rings around the
    heart of the tree and it is also the part which prevents the
    entrance of insects and disease to the inner wood from this it is
    quite evident that any injury to the bark and consequently to this
    cambium layer alongside of it will not only cut off a portion of
    the sap supply and hinder the growth of the tree to an extent
    proportional to the size of the wound but will also expose the
    inner wood to the action of decay the wound may at first appear
    insignificant but if neglected it will soon commence to decay
    and thus to carry disease and insects into the tree the tree then
    becomes hollow and dangerous and its life is doomed
    injury to the cambium layer resulting in surface wounds may be due
    to the improper cutting of a branch to the bite of a horse to the
    cut of a knife or the careless wielding of an axe to the boring of
    an insect or to the decay of a fungous disease see fig 117
    whatever the cause the remedy lies in cleaning out all decayed
    wood removing the loose bark and covering the exposed wood with
    coal tar
    in cutting off the loose bark the edges should be made smooth
    before the coal tar is applied loose bark put back against a tree
    will never grow and will only tend to harbor insects and disease
    bandages too are hurtful because underneath the bandage disease
    will develop more rapidly than where the wound is exposed to the sun
    and wind the application of tin or manure to wounds is often
    indulged in and is equally injurious to the tree the secret of all
    wound treatment is to keep the wound smooth clean to the live
    tissue and well covered with coal tar
    the chisel or gouge is the best tool to employ in this work a sharp
    hawkbilled knife will be useful in cutting off the loose bark coal
    tar is the best material for covering wounds because it has both an
    antiseptic and a protective effect on the wood tissue paint which
    is very often used as a substitute for coal tar is not as
    effective because the paint is apt to peel in time thus allowing
    moisture and disease to enter the crevice between the paint and the
    wood
illustration fig 117a neglected surface wound note the rough
surface of the wound the want of a coal tar covering and the fungous
growth that followed
cavities deep wounds and cavities are generally the result of stubs
    that have been permitted to rot and fall out surface wounds allowed
    to decay will deepen in course of time and produce cavities
    cavities in trees are especially susceptible to the attack of
    disease because in a cavity there is bound to exist an
    accumulation of moisture with this there is also considerable
    darkness and protection from wind and cold and these are all ideal
    conditions for the development of disease
    the successful application of a remedy in all cavity treatment
    hinges on this principal conditionthat all traces of disease
    shall be entirely eliminated before treatment is commenced
    fungous diseases attacking a cavity produce a mass of fibers known
    as the mycelium that penetrate the body of the tree or limb on
    which the cavity is located in eliminating disease from a cavity
    it is therefore essential to go beyond the mere decaying surface
    and to cut out all fungous fibers that radiate into the interior of
    the tree where these fibers have penetrated so deeply that it
    becomes impossible to remove every one of them the tree or limb
    thus affected had better be cut down fig 118 the presence of
    the mycelium in wood tissue can readily be told by the discolored
    and disintegrated appearance of the wood
    the filling in a cavity moreover should serve to prevent the
    accumulation of water and where a cavity is perpendicular and so
    located that the water can be drained off without the filling the
    latter should be avoided and the cavity should merely be cleaned out
    and tarred fig 116 where the disease can be entirely
    eliminated where the cavity is not too large and where a filling
    will serve the practical purpose of preventing the accumulation of
    moisture the work of filling should be resorted to
illustration fig 118a cavity filled in a tree that should have
been cut down note how the entire interior is decayed and how the tree
fell apart soon after treatment
    filling should be done in the following manner first the interior
    should be thoroughly freed from diseased wood and insects the
    chisel gouge mall and knife are the tools and it is better to
    cut deep and remove every trace of decayed wood than it is to leave
    a smaller hole in an unhealthy state the inner surface of the
    cavity should then be covered with a coat of white lead paint which
    acts as a disinfectant and helps to hold the filling corrosive
    sublimate or bordeaux mixture may be used as a substitute for the
    white lead paint a coat of coal tar over the paint is the next
    step the cavity is then solidly packed with bricks stones and
    mortar as in fig 119 and finished with a layer of cement at the
    mouth of the orifice this surface layer of cement should not be
    brought out to the same plane with the outer bark of the tree but
    should rather recede a little beyond the growing tissue cambium
    layer which is situated immediately below the bark fig 120 in
    this way the growing tissue will be enabled to roll over the cement
    and to cover the whole cavity if it be a small one or else to grow
    out sufficiently to overlap the filling and hold it as a frame holds
    a picture the cement is used in mixture with sand in the proportion
    of onethird of cement to twothirds of sand when dry the outer
    layer of cement should be covered with coal tar to prevent cracking
illustration fig 119a cavity in the process of being filled
illustration fig 120the same cavity properly filled
trees that tend to split certain species of trees like the linden and
    elm often tend to split generally in the crotch of several limbs
    and sometimes in a fissure along the trunk of the tree midwinter is
    the period when this usually occurs and timely action will save the
    tree the remedy lies in fastening together the various parts of the
    tree by means of bolts or chains
    a very injurious method of accomplishing this end is frequently
    resorted to where each of the branches is bound by an iron band and
    the bands are then joined by a bar the branches eventually outgrow
    the diameter of the bands causing the latter to cut through the
    bark of the limbs and to destroy them
    another method of bracing limbs together consists in running a
    single bolt through them and fastening each end of the bolt with a
    washer and nut this method is preferable to the first because it
    allows for the growth of the limbs in thickness
illustration fig 121diagram showing the triplebar method of
fastening limbs
    a still better method however consists in using a bar composed of
    three parts as shown in fig 121 each of the two branches has a
    short bolt passed through it horizontally and the two short bolts
    are then connected by a third bar this arrangement will shift all
    the pressure caused by the swaying of the limbs to the middle
    connectingbar in case of a windstorm the middle bar will be the
    one to bend while the bolts which pass through the limbs will
    remain intact the outer ends of the short bolts should have their
    washers and nuts slightly embedded in the wood of the tree so that
    the living tissue of the tree may eventually grow over them in such
    a way as to hold the bars firmly in place and to exclude moisture
    and disease the washers and nuts on the inner side of the limbs
    should also be embedded
    a chain is sometimes advantageously substituted for the middle
    section of the bar and in some cases where more than two branches
    have to be joined together a ring might take the place of the
    middle bar or chain
    bolts on a tree detract considerably from its natural beauty and
    should therefore be used only where they are absolutely necessary
    for the safety of the tree they should be placed as high up in the
    tree as possible without weakening the limbs
chapter vii
forestry
study i what forestry is and what it does
although forestry is not a new idea but as a science and an art has
been applied for nearly two thousand years there are many persons who
still need an explanation of its aims and principles
forestry deals with the establishment protection and utilization of
forests
by establishment is meant the planting of new forests and the cutting
of mature forests in such a way as to encourage a natural growth of new
trees without artificial planting or seeding the planting may consist
of sowing seed or of setting out young trees the establishment of a
forest by cutting may consist of the removal of all mature trees and
dependence upon the remaining stumps to reproduce the forest from
sprouts or it may consist of the removal of only a portion of the
mature trees thus giving the young seedlings on the ground room in
which to grow
by protection is meant the safeguarding of the forest from fire wind
insects disease and injury for which man is directly responsible here
the forester also prevents injury to the trees from the grazing and
browsing of sheep and goats and keeps his forest so well stocked that
no wind can uproot the trees nor can the sun dry up the moist forest
soil
illustration fig 122a forest of bull pine cut on forestry
principles photograph taken on the black hills national forest south
dakota
by utilization is meant the conservative and intelligent harvesting of
the forest with the aim of obtaining the greatest amount of product
from a given area with the least waste in the quickest time and
without the slightest deterioration of the forest as a whole the
forester cuts his mature trees only and generally leaves a sufficient
number on the ground to preserve the forest soil and to cast seed for
the production of a new crop in this way he secures an annual output
without hurting the forest itself he studies the properties and values
of the different woods and places them where they will be most useful
he lays down principles for so harvesting the timber and the
byproducts of the forest that there will be the least waste and injury
to the trees which remain standing he utilizes the forest but does not
cut enough to interfere with the neighboring watersheds which the
forests protect

crowns of the trees have met the trees are fifteen years old and in
many cases every other tree had to be removed
forestry therefore deals with a vast and varied mass of information
comprising all the known facts relating to the life of a forest it does
not deal with the individual tree and its planting and carethat would
be arboriculture nor does it consider the grouping of trees for
aesthetic effectthat would be landscape gardening it concerns itself
with the forest as a community of trees and with the utilization of the
forest on an economic basis
each one of these activities in forestry is a study in itself and
involves considerable detail of which the reader may obtain a general
knowledge in the following pages for a more complete discussion the
reader is referred to any of the standard books on forestry
the life and nature of a forest when we think of a forest we are apt to
    think of a large number of individual trees having no special
    relationship to each other closer observation however will reveal
    that the forest consists of a distinct group of trees sufficiently
    dense to form an unbroken canopy of tops and that where trees grow
    so closely together they become very interdependent it is this
    interdependence that makes the forest different from a mere group of
    trees in a park or on a lawn in this composite character the
    forest enriches its own soil from year to year changes the climate
    within its own bounds controls the streams along its borders and
    supports a multitude of animals and plants peculiar to itself this
    communal relationship in the life history of the forest furnishes a
    most interesting story of struggle and mutual aid different trees
    have different requirements with regard to water food and light
    some need more water and food than others some will not endure much
    shade and others will grow in the deepest shade in the open a
    tree if once established can meet its needs quite readily and
    though it has to ward off a number of enemies insects disease and
    windstormits struggle for existence is comparatively easy in the
    forest the conditions are different here the treeenemies have to
    be battled with just as in the open and in addition instead of
    there being only a few trees on a plot of ground there are
    thousands growing on the same area all demanding the same things
    out of a limited supply the struggle for existence therefore
    becomes keen many falling behind and but few surviving
illustration fig 124measuring the diameter of a tree and counting
its annual rings
    this struggle begins with the seed at first there are thousands of
    seeds cast upon a given area by the neighboring trees or by the
    birds and the winds of these only a few germinate animals feed on
    some of them frost nips some and excessive moisture and unfavorable
    soil conditions prevent others from starting the few successful
    ones soon sprout into a number of young trees that grow thriftily
    until their crowns begin to meet when the trees have thus met the
    struggle is at its height the side branches encroach upon each
    other fig 123 shut out the light without which the branches
    cannot live and finally kill each other off the upper branches vie
    with one another for light grow unusually fast and the trees
    increase in height with special rapidity this is natures method of
    producing clear straight trunks which are so desirable for poles
    and large timber in this struggle for dominance some survive and
    tower above the others but many become stunted and fail to grow
    while the majority become entirely overtopped and succumb in the
    struggle see fig 139
    but in this strife there is also mutual aid each tree helps to
    protect its neighbors against the danger of being uprooted by the
    wind and against the sun which is liable to dry up the rich soil
    around the roots this soil is different from the soil on the open
    lawn it consists of an accumulation of decayed leaves mixed with
    inorganic matter forming together a rich composition known as
    humus the trees also aid each other in forming a close canopy
    that prevents the rapid evaporation of water from the ground
    the intensity of these conditions will vary a great deal with the
    composition of the forest and the nature and habits of the
    individual trees by composition or type of forest is meant the
    proportion in which the various species of trees are grouped ie
    whether a certain section of woodland is composed of one species or
    of a mixture of species by habit is meant the requirements of the
    trees for light water and food
illustration fig 125mountain slopes in north carolina well covered
with forests
    some trees will grow in deep shade while others will demand the
    open in the matter of water and food the individual requirements
    of different trees are equally marked
    the natural rapidity of growth of different species is also
    important and one caring for a forest must know this rate of
    growth not only as to the individual species but also with respect
    to the forest as a whole if he knows how fast the trees in a
    forest grow both in height and diameter he will know how much
    wood in cubic feet the forest produces in a year and he can then
    determine how much he may cut without decreasing the capital stock
    the rate of growth is determined in this way a tree is cut and the
    rings on the crosssection surface are counted and measured see
    fig 124 each ring represents one years growth the total number
    of rings will show the age of the tree by a study of the rings of
    the various species of trees on a given plot the rate of growth of
    each species in that location can be ascertained and by knowing the
    approximate number of trees of each species on the forest area the
    rate of growth of the whole forest for any given year can be
    determined

forests prevent soil erosion and floods forests help to regulate the
    flow of streams and prevent floods most streams are bordered by
    vast tracts of forest growths the rain that falls on these forest
    areas is absorbed and held by the forest soil which is permeated
    with decayed leaves decayed wood and root fibers the forest floor
    is moreover covered with a heavy undergrowth and thus behaves like
    a sponge absorbing the water that falls upon it and then permitting
    it to ooze out gradually to the valleys and rivers below a forest
    soil will retain onehalf of its own quantity of water ie for
    every foot in depth of soil there can be six inches of water and
    when thus saturated the soil will act as a vast underground
    reservoir from which the springs and streams are supplied fig
    125 cut the forest down and the land becomes such a desert as is
    shown in fig 126 the soil leaves branches and fallen trees dry
    to dust are carried off by the wind and with the fall of rain the
    soil begins to wash away and gullies such as are shown in fig 127
    are formed streams generally have their origins in mountain slopes
    and there too the forests impeding the sudden run off of the
    water which is not immediately absorbed prevent soil erosion
illustration fig 128flood in pittsburgh pa
    where the soil is allowed to wash off frequent floods are
    inevitable rain which falls on bare slopes is not caught by the
    crowns of trees nor held by the forest floor it does not sink into
    the ground as readily as in the forest the result is that a great
    deal of water reaches the streams in a short time and thus hastens
    floods at other periods the streams are low because the water which
    would have fed them for months has run off in a few days the farms
    are the first to suffer from the drouths that follow and during the
    period of floods whole cities are often inundated fig 128 shows
    such a scene the history of forestry is full of horrible incidents
    of the loss of life and property from floods which are directly
    traceable to the destruction of the local forests and on the other
    hand there are many cases on record where flood conditions have
    been entirely obviated by the planting of forests france and
    germany have suffered from inundations resulting from forest
    devastation and more than a hundred years ago both of these
    countries took steps to reforest their mountain slopes and thereby
    to prevent many horrible disasters

forest
how forests are established new forests may be started from seed or
    from shoots or suckers if from seed the process may be carried on
    in one of three ways
    first by sowing the seed directly on the land
    second by first raising young trees in nurseries and later setting
    them out in their permanent locations in the forest this method is
    applicable where quick results are desired where the area is not
    too large or in treeless regions and large open gaps where there
    is little chance for new trees to spring up from seed furnished by
    the neighboring trees it is a method extensively practiced abroad
    where some of the finest forests are the result the us
    government as well as many of the states maintain foresttree
    nurseries where millions of little trees are grown from seed and
    planted out on the national and state forests fig 129 shows men
    engaged in this work the fundamental principles of starting and
    maintaining a nursery have already been referred to in the chapter
    on what trees to plant and how
    the third method of establishing a forest from seed is by cutting
    the trees in the existing forest so that the seed falling from the
    remaining trees will with the addition of light and space readily
    take root and fill in the gaps with a vigorous growth of trees
    without artificial seeding or planting this gives rise to several
    methods of cutting or harvesting forests for the purpose of
    encouraging natural reproduction the cutting may extend to single
    trees over the whole area or over only a part of the whole area
    where the cutting is confined to single trees the system is known
    as the selection system because the trees are selected
    individually with a view to retaining the best and most vigorous
    stock and removing the overcrowding specimens and those that are
    fully mature or infested with disease or insects
    fig 130 is a diagrammatic illustration of the operation of this
    system in another system the cutting is done in groups or in
    strips and the number of areas of the groups or strips is extended
    from time to time until the whole forest is cleared this system is
    illustrated in fig 131 still another method consists in
    encouraging trees which will thrive in the shade such as the beech
    spruce and hemlock to grow under lightdemanding trees like the
    pine this system presents a twostoried forest and is known by
    that name the under story often has to be established by planting
illustration fig 131diagrammatic illustration of the group or
strip system
    in the system of reproducing forests from shoots or suckers all
    trees of a certain species on a given area are cut off and the old
    stumps and roots are depended upon to produce a new set of sprouts
    the strongest of which will later develop into trees the coniferous
    trees do not lend themselves at all to this system of treatment
    and among the broadleaf trees the species vary in their ability to
    sprout some like the chestnut and poplar sprout profusely others
    sprout very little
how forests are protected forestry also tries to protect the forests
    from many destructive agencies wasteful lumbering and fire are the
    worst enemies of the forest fungi insects grazing wind snow and
    floods are the other enemies
illustration fig 132the result of a forest fire the trees
lodgepole pine and englemann spruce are all dead and down photograph
taken in the colorado national forest colorado
    by wasteful lumbering is meant that the forest is cut with no regard
    for the future and with considerable waste in the utilization of the
    product conservative lumbering which is the term used by foresters
    to designate the opposite of wasteful lumbering will be described
    more fully later in this study
    protection from fire is no less important than protection from
    wasteful lumbering forest fires are very common in this country and
    cause incalculable destruction to life and property see fig 132
    from ten to twelve million acres of forestland are burnt over
    annually and the timber destroyed is estimated at fifty millions of
    dollars the history of forestry abounds in tales of destructive
    fires where thousands of persons have been killed or left
    destitute whole towns wiped out and millions of dollars in
    property destroyed in most cases these uncontrollable fires
    started from small conflagrations that could readily with proper
    firepatrol have been put out
    there are various ways of fighting fires depending on the character
    of the firewhether it is a surface fire burning along the
    surface layer of dry leaves and small ground vegetation a ground
    fire burning below the surface through the layer of soil and
    vegetable matter that generally lines the forest floor or a top
    fire burning high up in the trees
    when the fire runs along the surface only the injury extends to the
    butts of the trees and to the young seedlings such fires can be put
    out by throwing dirt or sand over the fire by beating it and
    sometimes by merely raking the leaves away
    ground fires destroy the vegetable mold which the trees need for
    their sustenance they progress slowly and kill or weaken the roots
    of the trees
illustration fig 133a top fire near bear canyon arizona
    top fires fig 133 are the most dangerous destroying everything
    in their way they generally develop from surface fires though
    sometimes they are started by lightning they are more common in
    coniferous forests because the leaves of hardwoods do not burn so
    readily checking the progress of a top fire is a difficult matter
    some fires will travel as rapidly as five miles an hour and the
    heat is terrific the only salvation for the forest lies in many
    cases in a sudden downpour of rain a change of wind or some
    barrier which the fire cannot pass a barrier of this kind is often
    made by starting another fire some distance ahead of the principal
    one so that when the two fires meet they will die out for want of
    fuel in wellkept forests strips or lanes free from inflammable
    material are often purposely made through the forest area to
    furnish protection against top fires carefully managed forests are
    also patrolled during the dry season so that fires may be detected
    and attacked in their first stages lookout stations watchtowers
    telephoneconnections and signal stations are other means frequently
    resorted to for fire protection and control notices warning campers
    and trespassers against starting fires are commonly posted in such
    forests fig 143
illustration fig 134sheep grazing on holy cross national forest
colorado the drove consists of 1600 sheep of which only part are shown
in the photograph
    the grazing of sheep goats and cattle in the forest is another
    important source of injury to which foresters must give attention
    in the west this is quite a problem for when many thousands of
    these animals pass through a forest fig 134 there is often very
    little young growth left and the future reproduction of the forest
    is severely retarded grazing on our national forests is regulated
    by the government
    as a means of protection against insects and fungi all trees
    infested are removed as soon as observed and in advance of all
    others whenever a lumbering operation is undertaken
illustration fig 135a typical montana sawmill
how forests are harvested forestry and forest preservation require that
    a forest should be cut and not merely held untouched but it also
    demands that the cutting shall be done on scientific principles and
    that only as much timber shall be removed in a given time as the
    forest can produce in a corresponding period after the cutting the
    forest must be left in a condition to produce another crop of
    timber within a reasonable time see fig 122 these fundamental
    requirements represent the difference between conservative lumbering
    and ordinary lumbering besides insuring a future supply of timber
    conservative lumbering or lumbering on forestry principles also
    tends to preserve the forest floor and the young trees growing on
    it and to prevent injury to the remaining trees through fire
    insects and disease it provides for a working plan by which the
    kind number and location of the trees to be cut are specified the
    height of the stumps is stipulated and the utilization of the wood
    and byproducts is regulated
    conservative lumbering provides that the trees shall be cut as near
    to the ground as possible and that they shall be felled with the
    least damage to the young trees growing near by the branches of the
    trees after they have been felled must be cut and piled in heaps
    as shown in fig 122 to prevent fire when the trunks sawed into
    logs are dragged through the woods care is taken not to break down
    the young trees or to injure the bark of standing trees waste in
    the process of manufacture is provided against uses are found for
    the material ordinarily rejected and the best methods of handling
    and drying lumber are employed fig 135 shows a typical sawmill
    capable of providing lumber in large quantities
    in the utilization of the byproducts of the forest such as
    turpentine and resin forestry has devised numerous methods for
    harvesting the crops with greater economy and with least waste and
    injury to the trees from which the byproducts are obtained fig
    136 illustrates an improved method by which crude turpentine is
    obtained
illustration fig 136gathering crude turpentine by the cup and
gutter method this system devised by foresters saves the trees and
increases the output
forestry here and abroad forestry is practiced in every civilized
    country except china and turkey in germany forestry has attained
    through a long series of years a remarkable state of scientific
    thoroughness and has greatly increased the annual output of the
    forests of that country
    in france switzerland austria hungary norway sweden russia
    and denmark forestry is also practiced on scientific principles and
    the government in each of these countries holds large tracts of
    forests in reserve in british india one finds a highly efficient
    forest service and in japan forestry is receiving considerable
    attention
    in the united states the forest areas are controlled by private
    interests by the government and by the states on privately owned
    forests forestry is practiced only in isolated cases the states
    are taking hold of the problem very actively and in many of them we
    now find special forestry commissions authorized to care for vast
    areas of forest land reserved for state control these commissions
    employ technically trained foresters who not only protect the state
    forests but also plant new areas encourage forest planting on
    private lands and disseminate forestry information among the
    citizens new york state has such a commission that cares for more
    than a million acres of forest land located in the northern part of
    the state many other states are equally progressive
    the united states government is the most active factor in the
    preservation of our forests the government today owns over two
    hundred million acres of forest land set aside as national forests
    there are one hundred and fifty individual reserves distributed as
    shown in fig 137 and cared for by the forest service a bureau in
    the department of agriculture each of the forests is in charge of a
    supervisor he has with him a professional forester and a body of
    men who patrol the tract against fire and the illegal cutting of
    timber some of the men are engaged in planting trees on the open
    areas and others in studying the important forest problems of the
    region fig 138
illustration fig 137map showing our national forests
illustration fig 138government foresters in missouri studying the
growth and habits of trees they are standing in water three feet deep
    where cutting is to be done on a national forest the conditions are
    investigated by a technically trained forester and the cutting is
    regulated according to his findings special attention is given to
    discovering new uses for species of trees which have hitherto been
    considered valueless and the demand upon certain rare species is
    lessened by introducing more common woods which are suitable for use
    in their place
    aside from the perpetuation of the national forests the us
    forest service also undertakes such tree studies as lie beyond the
    power or means of private individuals it thus stands ready to
    cooperate with all who need assistance
study ii care of the woodland
almost every farm large private estate or park has a wooded area for
the purpose of supplying fuel or for enhancing the landscape effect of
the place in most instances these wooded areas are entirely neglected
or are so improperly cared for as to cause injury rather than good in
but very few cases is provision made for a future growth of trees after
the present stock has gone proper attention will increase and
perpetuate a crop of good trees just as it will any other crop on the
farm while the attractiveness of the place may be greatly enhanced
through the intelligent planting and care of trees
how to judge the conditions a close examination of the wooded area may
    reveal some or all of the following unfavorable conditions
    the trees may be so crowded that none can grow well a few may have
    grown to large size but the rest usually are decrepit and
    overtopped by the larger trees they are therefore unable for the
    want of light and space to develop into good trees fig 139 shows
    woodland in such condition
illustration fig 139woodland which needs attention the trees are
overcrowded
    there may also be dead and dying trees trees infested with
    injurious insects and fungi and having any number of decayed
    branches the trees may be growing so far apart that their trunks
    will be covered with suckers as far down as the ground or there may
    be large open gaps with no trees at all here the sun striking
    with full force may be drying up the soil and preventing the
    decomposition of the leaves grass soon starts to grow in these open
    spaces and the whole character of the woodland changes as shown in
    figs 140 and 141
illustration fig 140first stage of deterioration the woodland is
too open and grass has taken the place of the humus cover
    where any of these conditions exist the woodland requires
    immediate attention otherwise as time goes on it deteriorates
    more and more the struggle for space among the crowded and
    suppressed trees becomes more keen the insects in the dying trees
    multiply and disease spreads from tree to tree under such
    conditions the soil deteriorates and the older trees begin to
    suffer
illustration fig 141second stage of deterioration the surface
soil of the wooded area has washed away and the trees have died
    the attention required for the proper care of woodland may be summed
    up under the four general heads of soil preservation planting
    cutting and protection
improvement by soil preservation the soil in a wooded area can best be
    preserved and kept rich by doing two things by retaining the
    fallen leaves on the ground and by keeping the ground well covered
    with a heavy growth of trees shrubs and herbaceous plants the
    fallen leaves decompose mix with the soil and form a darkcolored
    material known as humus the humus supplies the tree with a
    considerable portion of its food and helps to absorb and retain the
    moisture in the soil upon which the tree is greatly dependent a
    heavy growth of trees and shrubs has a similar effect by serving to
    retain the moisture in the soil
improvement by planting the planting of new trees is a necessity on
    almost any wooded area for even where the existing trees are in
    good condition they cannot last forever and provision must be made
    for others to take their place after they are gone the majority of
    the wooded areas in our parks and on private estates are not
    provided with a sufficient undergrowth of desirable trees to take
    the place of the older ones thus also the open gaps must be
    planted to prevent the soil from deteriorating
    waste lands on farms which are unsuited for farm crops often offer
    areas on which trees may profitably be planted these lands are
    sufficiently good in most cases to grow trees thus affording a
    means of turning into value ground which would otherwise be
    worthless it has been demonstrated that the returns from such
    plantations at the end of fifty years will yield a six per cent
    investment and an extra profit of 15197 per acre the expense
    totaling at the end of fifty years 30703 the value of the land
    is estimated at 4 per acre and the cost of the trees and planting
    at 7 per acre the species figured on here is white pine one of
    the best trees to plant from a commercial standpoint with other
    trees the returns will vary accordingly
illustration fig 142a farm woodlot
    the usual idea that it costs a great deal to plant several thousand
    young trees is erroneous an ordinary woodlot may be stocked with a
    wellselected number of young trees at a cost less than the price
    generally paid for a dozen good specimen trees for the front lawn
    it is not necessary to underplant the woodlot with big trees the
    existing big trees are there to give character to the forest and the
    new planting should be done principally as a future investment and
    as a means of perpetuating the life of the woodlot young trees are
    even more desirable for such planting than the older and more
    expensive ones the young trees will adapt themselves to the local
    soil and climatic conditions more easily than the older ones their
    demand for food and moisture is more easily satisfied and because
    of their small cost one can even afford to lose a large percentage
    of them after planting
    the young plants should be twoyearold seedlings or threeyearold
    transplants
    twoyearold seedlings are trees that have been grown from the seed
    in seed beds until they reach that age they run from two to fifteen
    inches in height depending upon the species
    threeyearold transplants have been grown from the seed in seed
    beds and at the end of the first or second year have been taken up
    and transplanted into rows where they grow a year or two longer
    they are usually a little taller than the twoyearold seedlings
    are much stockier and have a better root system for this reason
    threeyearold transplants are a little more desirable as stock for
    planting they will withstand drought better than seedlings
    the best results from woodland planting are obtained with
    nativegrown material such stock is stronger hardier and better
    acclimated foreigngrown stock is usually a little cheaper owing
    to the fact that it has been grown abroad under cheap labor
    conditions
    the trees may be purchased from reputable dealers of whom there are
    many in this country these dealers specialize in growing young
    trees and selling them at the low cost of three to ten dollars per
    thousand in states in which a forestry commission has been
    inaugurated there have also been established state nurseries where
    millions of little trees are grown for reforestation purposes in
    order to encourage private tree planting the forestry commissions
    are usually willing to sell some of these trees at cost price under
    certain conditions to private land owners inquiries should be
    made to the state forestry commission
    great care must be taken to select the species most suitable for the
    particular soil climatic and light conditions of the woodlot the
    trees which are native to the locality and are found growing
    thriftily on the woodlot are the ones that have proven their
    adaptability to the local conditions and should therefore be the
    principal species used for underplanting a list from which to
    select the main stock would therefore vary with the locality in
    the eastern states it would comprise the usual hardy trees like the
    red pin and scarlet oaks the beech the red and sugar maples the
    white ash the tulip tree sycamore sweet gum and locust among the
    deciduous trees the white austrian red pitch and scotch pines
    the hemlock and the yew among the conifers
    with the main stock well selected one may add a number of trees and
    shrubs that will give to the woodland scene a pleasing appearance at
    all seasons the brilliant autumnal tints of the sassafras
    pepperidge blue beech viburnum juneberry and sumach are
    strikingly attractive the flowering dogwood along the drives and
    paths will add a charm in june as well as in autumn and an
    occasional group of white birch will have the same effect if planted
    among groups of evergreens additional undergrowth of native
    woodland shrubs such as new jersey tea redberried elder and
    blueberry for the eastern states will augment the naturalness of
    the scene and help to conserve the moisture in the soil
    two or three years growth will raise these plants above all grass
    and low vegetation and a sprinkling of laurel rhododendron hardy
    ferns and a few intermingling colonies of native wild flowers such
    as bloodroot false solomons seal and columbines for the east as
    a ground cover will put the finishing touches to the forest scene
    as to methods of planting the little trees the following
    suggestions may prove of value as soon as the plants are received
    they should be taken from the box and dipped in a thick puddle of
    water and loam the roots must be thoroughly covered with the mud
    then the bundles into which the little trees are tied should be
    loosened and the trees placed in a trench dug on a slant the dirt
    should be placed over the roots and the exposed parts of the plants
    covered with brush or burlap to keep away the rays of the sun
    when ready for planting a few plants are dug up set in a pail with
    thin mud at the bottom and carried to the place of planting the
    most economical method of planting is for one man to make the holes
    with a mattock these holes are made about a foot in diameter by
    scraping off the sod with the mattock and then digging a little hole
    in the dirt underneath a second man follows with a pail of plants
    and sets a single plant in this hole with his hands see fig 129
    making sure that the roots are straight and spread out on the bottom
    of the hole the dirt should then be packed firmly around the plant
    and pressed down with the foot
improvement by cutting the removal of certain trees in a grove is often
    necessary to improve the quality of the better trees increase their
    growth make the place accessible and enhance its beauty cutting
    in a wooded area should be confined to suppressed trees dead and
    dying trees and trees badly infested with insects and disease in
    case of farm woodlands mature trees of market value may be cut but
    in parks and on private estates these have a greater value when left
    standing the cutting should leave a clean stand of wellselected
    specimens which will thrive under the favorable influence of more
    light and growing space considerable care is required to prevent
    injury to the young trees when the older specimens are cut and
    hauled out of the woods the marking of the trees to be removed can
    best be done in summer when the dead and live trees can be
    distinguished with ease and when the requisite growing space for
    each tree can be judged better from the density of the crowns the
    cutting however can be done most advantageously in winter
    immediately after cutting all diseased and infested wood should be
    destroyed the sound wood may be utilized for various purposes the
    bigger logs may be sold to the local lumber dealers and the smaller
    material may be used for firewood the remaining brush should be
    withdrawn from the woodlot to prevent fire during the dry summer
    months
    in marking trees for removal a number of considerations are to be
    borne in mind besides the elimination of dead diseased and
    suppressed trees when the marker is working among crowding trees of
    equal height he should save those that are most likely to grow into
    fine specimen trees and cut out all those that interfere with them
    the selection must also favor trees which are best adapted to the
    local soil and climatic conditions and those which will add to the
    beauty of the place in this respect the method of marking will be
    different from that used in commercial forestry where the aim is to
    net the greatest profit from the timber in pure forestry practice
    one sees no value in such species as dogwood ironwood juneberry
    sumac and sassafras and will therefore never allow those to grow up
    in abundance and crowd out other trees of a higher market value but
    on private estates and in park woodlands where beauty is an
    important consideration such species add wonderful color and
    attractiveness to the forest scene especially along the roads and
    paths and should be favored as much as the other hardier trees one
    must not mark too severely in one spot or the soil will be dried out
    from exposure to sun and wind when the gaps between the trees are
    too large the trees will grow more slowly and the trunks will
    become covered with numerous shoots or suckers which deprive the
    crowns of their necessary food and cause them to die back where
    the trees are tall and slim or on short and steep hillsides it is
    also important to be conservative in marking in order that the stand
    may not be exposed to the dangers of windfall no hardandfast rule
    can be laid down as to what would constitute a conservative
    percentage of trees to cut down this depends entirely on the local
    conditions and on the exposure of the woodlot but in general it is
    not well to remove more than twenty per cent of the stand nor to
    repeat the cutting on the same spot oftener than once in five or six
    years the first cutting will of course be the heaviest and all
    subsequent cuttings will become lighter and lighter until the
    woodlot is put in good growing condition on private estates and
    parks where beauty is the chief aim the woodland should be kept as
    natural informal and as thick as possible where the woodland is
    cut up by many paths and drives density of vegetation will add to
    the impression of depth and distance
protection this subject has already been discussed considerably in the
    previous study on forestry and here it becomes necessary merely to
    add a few suggestions with special reference to private and park
    woodlands
    guarding woodlands from fire is the most important form of
    protection surface fires are very common on small woodland holdings
    and the damage done to the standing vegetation is generally
    underestimated an ordinary ground or surface fire on a woodland
    area will burn up the leaflitter and vegetable mold upon which the
    trees depend so much for food and moisture and will destroy the
    young seedlings on the ground where the fire is a little more
    severe the older trees are badly wounded and weakened and the
    younger trees are frequently killed outright insects and disease
    find these trees an easy prey and all related forest conditions
    commence to deteriorate
    constant watchfulness and readiness to meet any emergency are the
    keynote of effective fire protection notices similar to the one
    shown in fig 143 often help to prevent fires it is also helpful to
    institute strict rules against dropping lighted matches or tobacco
    or burning brush when the ground is very dry or leaving smouldering
    wood without waiting to see that the fire is completely out there
    should be many roads and footpaths winding through the woodland in
    order that they may serve as checks or fire lanes in time of fire
    these roads and paths should be kept free from brush and leaves and
    should be frequently patrolled when made not too wide
    unpretentious and in conformity with the natural surroundings such
    drives and paths can become a very interesting feature of the place
    winding through the woodland exposing its charms and affording
    opportunity for pleasant driving and walking the borders of the
    paths can be given special attention by placing the more beautiful
    native shrubs in prominent positions where they can lend increased
    attractiveness
    in case of fire it should be possible to call for aid by telephone
    directly from the woodland and to find within easy reach the tools
    necessary to combat fire it is also important to obtain the
    cooperation of ones neighbors in protecting the adjoining
    woodlands because the dangers from insects disease and fire
    threatening one bit of woodland area are more or less dependent upon
    the conditions in the adjoining woodland
illustration fig 143poster suitable for private woodlands and
forest parks the translations in italian and polish have been used by
the writer in this particular instance to meet the local needs
    as to other forms of protection passing mention may be made of the
    importance of keeping out cattle sheep and hogs from the woods of
    eliminating all insects and disease of keeping the ground free from
    brush and other inflammable material of retaining on the ground all
    fallen leaves and keeping the forest well stocked with little trees
    and shrubs
forest lands may be exempted from taxation in new york and other states
    there exists a state law providing for exemption or reduction in
    taxes upon lands which are planted with forest trees or maintained
    as wooded areas the object of the law is to encourage home forestry
    and to establish fairness in the agricultural landtax law by
    placing forest lands in the same category with other cropproducing
    lands for detailed information and a copy of the law one should
    address the local state forestry commission
chapter viii
our common woods their identification properties and uses
woods have different values for various practical purposes because of
their peculiarities in structure a knowledge of the structural parts of
wood is therefore necessary as a means of recognizing the wood and of
determining why one piece is stronger heavier tougher or better
adapted for a given service than another
structure of wood if one examines a crosssection of the bole of a
    tree he will note that it is composed of several distinct parts as
    shown in fig 145 at the very center is a small core of soft tissue
    known as the pith it is of much the same structure as the pith of
    cornstalk or elder with which all are familiar at the outside is
    the bark which forms a protective covering over the entire woody
    system in any but the younger stems the bark is composed of an
    inner live layer and an outer or dead portion
    between the pith at the center and the bark at the outside is the
    wood it will be noted that the portion next to the bark is white or
    yellowish in color this is the sapwood it is principally through
    the sapwood that the water taken in by the roots is carried up to
    the leaves in some cases the sapwood is very thin and in others it
    is very thick depending partly on the kind of tree and partly on
    its age and vigor the more leaves on a tree the more sapwood it
    must have to supply them with moisture
illustration fig 144pine wood magnified 30 times
    very young trees are all sapwood but as they get older part of
    the wood is no longer needed to carry sap and it becomes
    heartwood heartwood is darker than the sapwood sometimes only
    slightly but in other instances it may vary from a lightbrown
    color to jet black it tends to fill with gums resins pigments and
    other substances but otherwise its structure is the same as that of
    the sapwood
illustration fig 145crosssection of oak
    the wood of all our common trees is produced by a thin layer of
    cells just beneath the bark the cambium the cambium adds new
    wood on the outside of that previously formed and new bark on the
    inside of the old bark a tree grows most rapidly in the spring and
    the wood formed at that time is much lighter softer and more
    porous than that formed later in the season which is usually quite
    hard and dense these two portions known as early wood or spring
    wood and late wood or summer wood together make up one years
    growth and are for that reason called annual rings trees such as
    palms and yucca do not grow in this way but their wood is not
    important enough in this country to warrant a description
illustration fig 146white oak wood magnified 20 times
    if the end of a piece of oak wood is examined a number of lines
    will be seen radiating out toward the bark like the spokes in a
    wheel these are the medullary rays they are present in all
    woods but only in a few species are they very prominent to the
    unaided eye these rays produce the flakes or mirrors that make
    quartersawed radially cut wood so beautiful they are thin plates
    or sheets of cells lying in between the other wood cells they
    extend out into the inner bark
    while much may be seen with the unaided eye better results can be
    secured by the use of a good magnifying glass the end of the wood
    should be smoothed off with a very sharp knife a dull one will
    tear and break the cells so that the structure becomes obscured
    with any good hand lens a great many details will then appear which
    before were not visible in the case of some woods like oak ash
    and chestnut it will be found that the early wood contains many
    comparatively large openings called pores as shown in figs 146
    and 147 pores are crosssections of vessels which are little
    tubelike elements running throughout the tree the vessels are
    water carriers a wood with its large pores collected into one row
    or in a single band is said to be ringporous fig 146 shows such
    an arrangement a wood with its pores scattered throughout the
    years growth instead of collected in a ring is diffuseporous
    maple as shown in fig 152 is of this character
illustration fig 147example of the black oak group quercus
coccinea magnified 20 times
    all of our broadleaf woods are either ringporous or diffuseporous
    though some of them like the walnut are nearly half way between
    the two groups
    if the wood of hickory for example be examined with the magnifying
    lens it will be seen that there are numerous small pores in the
    late wood while running parallel with the annual rings are little
    white lines such as are shown in fig 149 these are lines of wood
    parenchyma wood parenchyma is found in all woods arranged
    sometimes in tangential lines sometimes surrounding the pores and
    sometimes distributed over the crosssection the dark hornlike
    portions of hickory and oak are the woodfibers they give the
    strength to wood
    in many of the diffuseporous woods the pores are too small to be
    seen with the unaided eye and in some cases they are not very
    distinct even when viewed with a magnifier it is necessary to study
    such examples closely in order not to confuse them with the woods of
    conifers
    the woods of conifers are quite different in structure from
    broadleaf woods though the difference may not always stand out
    prominently coniferous woods have no pores their rays are always
    narrow and inconspicuous and wood parenchyma is never prominent
    the woods of the pines spruces larches and douglas fir differ
    from those of the other conifers in having resin ducts fig 144
    in pines these are readily visible to the naked eye appearing as
    resinous dots on crosssections and as pin scratches or dark lines
    on longitudinal surfaces the presence or absence of resin ducts is
    a very important feature in identifying woods hence it is very
    important to make a careful search for them when they are not
    readily visible
how to identify a specimen of wood the first thing to do in identifying
    a piece of wood is to cut a smooth section at the end and note
    without the magnifier the color the prominence of the rays and
    pores and any other striking features if the pores are readily
    visible the wood is from a broadleaf tree if the large pores are
    collected in a ring it belongs to the ringporous division of the
    broadleaf woods if the rays are quite conspicuous and the wood is
    hard and heavy it is oak as the key given later will show close
    attention to the details of the key will enable one to decide to
    what group of oaks it belongs
    in most cases the structure will not stand out so prominently as in
    oak so that it is necessary to make a careful study with the hand
    lens if pores appear their arrangement both in the early wood and
    in the late wood should be carefully noted also whether the pores
    are open or filled with a frothlike substance known as tyloses
    wood parenchyma lines should be looked for and if present the
    arrangement of the lines should be noted
illustration fig 148magnified about 8 times
    if no pores appear under the magnifying lens look closely for resin
    ducts if these are found note whether they are large or small
    numerous or scattered open or closed lighter or darker than the
    wood note also whether the late wood is very heavy and hard
    showing a decided contrast to the early wood or fairly soft and
    grading into the early wood without abrupt change weigh the piece
    in your hand smell a freshcut surface to detect the odor if any
    and taste a chip to see if anything characteristic is discoverable
    then turn to the following key
key
i woods without poresconifers or socalled softwoods
a woods with resin ducts
1 pines fig 144 resin ducts numerous prominent fairly evenly
    distributed wood often pitchy resinous odor distinct clear
    demarcation between heart and sapwood there are two groups of
    pinessoft and hard
  a soft pines wood light soft not strong eventextured very
    easy to work change from early wood to late wood is gradual and the
    difference in density is not great
  b hard pines wood variable but typically rather heavy hard and
    strong uneven textured fairly easy to work change from early wood
    to late wood is abrupt and the difference in density and color is
    very marked consequently alternate layers of light and dark wood
    show the wood of nearly all pines is very extensively employed in
    construction work and in general carpentry
2 douglas fir resin ducts less numerous and conspicuous than in the
    pines irregularly distributed often in small groups odorless or
    nearly so heartwood and sapwood distinct the wood is of two kinds
    in one the growth rings are narrow and the wood is rather light and
    soft easy to work reddish yellow in color in the other the growth
    rings are wide the wood is rather hard to work as there is great
    contrast between the weak early wood and the very dense late wood of
    the annual rings
    douglas fir is a tree of great economic importance on the pacific
    coast the wood is much like hard pine both in its appearance and
    its uses
3 spruces resin ducts few small unevenly distributed appearing
    mostly as white dots wood not resinous odorless the wood is white
    or very light colored with a silky luster and with little contrast
    between heart and sapwood it is a great deal like soft pine though
    lighter in color and with much fewer and smaller resin ducts the
    wood is used for construction carpentry oars sounding boards for
    musical instruments and paper pulp
4 tamarack resin ducts the same as in the spruces the color of the
    heartwood is yellowish or russet brown that of the distinct sapwood
    much lighter the wood is considerably like hard pine but lacks the
    resinous odor and the resin ducts are much fewer and smaller
    the wood is used largely for crossties fence posts telegraph and
    telephone poles and to a limited extent for lumber in general
    construction
b woods without resin ducts
1 hemlock the wood has a disagreeable rancid odor is splintery not
    resinous with decided contrast between early and late wood color
    light brown with a slight tinge of red the heart little if any
    darker than the sapwood hemlock makes a rather poor lumber which is
    used for general construction also for crossties and pulp
2 balsam fir usually odorless not splintery not resinous with
    little contrast between early and late wood color white or very
    light brown with a pinkish hue to the late wood heartwood little if
    any darker than the sapwood closely resembles spruce from which it
    can be distinguished by its absence of resin ducts
    the wood is used for paper pulp in mixture with spruce also for
    general construction to some extent
3 cypress odorless except in darkcolored specimens which are somewhat
    rancid smooth surface of sound wood looks and feels greasy or waxy
    moderate contrast between early and late wood color varies from
    straw color to dark brown often with reddish and greenish tinge
    heartwood more deeply colored than the sapwood but without distinct
    boundary line
    wood used in general construction especially in places where
    durability is required also for shingles cooperage posts and
    poles
4 red cedar has a distinct aromatic odor wood uniformtextured late
    wood usually very thin inconspicuous color deep reddish brown or
    purple becoming dull upon exposure numerous minute red dots often
    visible under lens sapwood white red cedar can be distinguished
    from all the other conifers mentioned by the deep color of the wood
    and the very distinct aromatic odor
    wood largely used for pencils also for chests and cabinets posts
    and poles it is very durable in contact with the ground
    western red cedar is lighter softer less deeply colored and less
    fragrant than the common eastern cedar it grows along the pacific
    coast and is extensively used for shingles throughout the country
5 redwood wood odorless and tasteless uniformtextured light and
    weak rather coarse and harsh color light cherry close inspection
    under lens of a small split surface will reveal many little resin
    masses that appear as rows of black or amber beads which are
    characteristic of this wood
    redwood is confined to portions of the pacific coast it is used for
    house construction interior finish tanks and flumes shingles
    posts and boxes it is very durable
ii woods with poresbroadleaf or socalled hardwoods
a ringporous
1 woods with a portion of the rays very large and conspicuous
oak the wood of all of the oaks is heavy hard and strong they may be
    separated into two groups the white oaks and the red or black oaks
  a white oaks pores in early wood plugged with tyloses collected in
    a few rows fig 146 the transition from the large pores to the
    small ones in the late wood is abrupt the latter are very small
    numerous and appear as irregular grayish bands widening toward the
    outer edge of the annual ring impossible usually to see into the
    small pores with magnifier
  b red or black oaks pores are usually open though tyloses may
    occur fig 147 the early wood pores are in several rows and the
    transition to the small ones in late wood is gradual the latter are
    fewer larger and more distinct than in white oak and it is
    possible to see into them with a hand lens
    the wood of the oaks is used for all kinds of furniture interior
    finish cooperage vehicles crossties posts fuel and
    construction timber
2 woods with none of the rays large and conspicuous
a pores in late wood small and in radial lines wood parenchyma in
inconspicuous tangential lines
chestnut pores in early wood in a broad band oval in shape mostly
    free from tyloses pores in late wood in flamelike radial white
    patches that are plainly visible without lens color medium brown
    nearly odorless and tasteless chestnut is readily separated from
    oak by its weight and absence of large rays from black ash by the
    arrangement of the pores in the late wood from sassafras by the
    arrangement of the pores in the late wood the less conspicuous
    rays and the lack of distinct color
    the wood is used for crossties telegraph and telephone poles
    posts furniture cooperage and tannin extract durable in contact
    with the ground
b pores in late wood small not radially arranged being distributed
singly or in groups wood parenchyma around pores or extending winglike
from pores in late wood often forming irregular tangential lines
1 ash pores in early wood in a rather broad band occasionally
    narrow oval in shape see fig 148 tyloses present color brown
    to white sometimes with reddish tinge to late wood odorless and
    tasteless there are several species of ash that are classed as
    white ash and one that is called black or brown ash
  a white ash wood heavy hard strong mostly light colored except
    in old heartwood which is reddish pores in late wood especially
    in the outer part of the annual ring are joined by lines of wood
    parenchyma
  b black ash wood more porous lighter softer weaker and darker
    colored than white ash pores in late wood fewer and larger and
    rarely joined by tangential lines of wood parenchyma
    the wood of the ashes is used for wagon and carriage stock
    agricultural implements oars furniture interior finish and
    cooperage it is the best wood for bent work
illustration fig 149hickory wood magnified 45 times
2 locust pores in early wood in a rather narrow band round variable
    in size densely filled with tyloses color varying from golden
    yellow to brown often with greenish hue very thin sapwood white
    odorless and almost tasteless wood extremely heavy and hard
    cutting like horn locust bears little resemblance to ash being
    harder heavier of a different color with more distinct rays and
    with the pores in late wood in larger groups
    the wood is used for posts crossties wagon hubs and insulator
    pins it is very durable in contact with the ground
c pores in late wood comparatively large not in groups or lines
wood parenchyma in numerous fine but distinct tangential lines

hickory fig 149 pores in early wood moderately large not abundant
    nearly round filled with tyloses color brown to reddish brown
    thick sapwood white odorless and tasteless wood very heavy hard
    and strong hickory is readily separated from ash by the fine
    tangential lines of wood parenchyma and from oak by the absence of
    large rays
    the wood is largely used for vehicles tool handles agricultural
    implements athletic goods and fuel
d pores in late wood small and in conspicuous wavy tangential bands
wood parenchyma not in tangential lines
elm pores in early wood not large and mostly in a single row fig 150
    several rows in slippery elm round tyloses present color brown
    often with reddish tinge odorless and tasteless wood rather heavy
    and hard tough often difficult to split the peculiar arrangement
    of the pores in the late wood readily distinguishes elm from all
    other woods except hackberry from which it may be told by the
    fact that in elm the medullary rays are indistinct while they are
    quite distinct in hackberry moreover the color of hackberry is
    yellow or grayish yellow instead of brown or reddish brown as in
    elm
    the wood is used principally for slack cooperage also for hubs
    baskets agricultural implements and fuel

    the others very fine color light brown tinged with red the wood of
    the hard maple is very heavy hard and strong that of the soft
    maples is rather light fairly strong maple most closely resembles
    birch but can be distinguished from it through the fact that in
    maple the rays are considerably more conspicuous than in birch
    the wood is used for slack cooperage flooring interior finish
    furniture musical instruments handles and destructive
    distillation
3 tuliptree yellow poplar or whitewood rays all fine but distinct
    color yellow or brownish yellow sapwood white wood light and soft
    straightgrained easy to work

    tulip tree color reddish brown often with irregular dark streaks
    producing a watered effect on smooth boards thick sapwood
    grayish white wood rather heavy moderately hard crossgrained
    difficult to work
    the best grades of figured red gum resemble circassian walnut but
    the latter has much larger pores unevenly distributed and is less
    crossgrained than red gum
    the wood is used for finishing flooring furniture veneers slack
    cooperage boxes and gun stocks

    distillation
6 cottonwood rays extremely fine and scarcely visible even under lens
    color pale dull brown or grayish brown wood light soft not
    strong straightgrained fairly easy to work cottonwood can be
    separated from other light and soft woods by the fineness of its
    rays which is equaled only by willow which it rather closely
    resembles the wood is largely used for boxes general construction
    lumber and pulp
how to judge the quality of wood to know the name of a piece of wood
    means in a general way to know certain qualities that are common
    to all other pieces of wood of that species but it does not explain
    the special peculiarities of the piece in question or why that
    particular piece is more suitable or unsuitable for a particular
    purpose than another piece of the same species the mere
    identification of the wood does not explain why a particular piece
    is tougher stronger or of darker color than another piece of the
    same species or even of the same tree the reason for these special
    differences lies in the fact that wood is not a homogeneous material
    like metal within the same tree different parts vary in quality
    the heartwood is generally heavier and of deeper color than the
    sapwood the butt is superior to the top wood and the manner in
    which the wood was sawed and dried will affect its quality knots
    splits checks and discoloration due to incipient decay are defects
    worth considering wood that looks lusterless is usually defective
    because the lack of luster is generally due to disease woods that
    are hard wear best hardness can be determined readily by striking
    the wood with a hammer and noting the sound produced a clear
    ringing sound is a sign of hardness the strength of a piece of wood
    can be judged by its weight after it is well dried heavy woods are
    usually strong a large amount of late wood is an indication of
    strength and the production of a clear sound when struck with a
    hammer is also an evidence of strength
chapter ix
an outdoor lesson on trees
the importance of nature study in the training of the child is now well
recognized the influences of such study from the hygienic moral and
aesthetic point of view are far reaching and cannot be expressed in
dollars and cents in his association with nature the child is led to
observe more closely and to know and to be fond of what is truly
beautiful in lifebeautiful surroundings beautiful thoughts and
beautiful deeds he is inspired with reverence for law order and truth
because he sees it constantly reflected in all works of nature the
social instinct is highly developed and even the parents are often
bettered through the agency of their children
the only way however to study natureespecially plantsis to study
it out of doors our present tendency to gather in cities demands the
upbuilding influences of trips into the open in order to equip the child
mentally and physically to face the world and its work with the strength
and tenacity characteristic of the countrybred moreover the study of
objects rather than books is an axiom in modern education and here too
we can readily see that the best way to study trees is to take the pupil
to the trees such studies are more lasting than book study because they
emphasize the spirit and the goal rather than the petty facts
educators and parents are now recognizing the value of outdoor trips
for their children and are beginning to indulge in them quite
frequently in many instances teachers about to take out their children
for a day have inquired of the writer how to go about giving a general
field lesson when they reached the park or woodland the purpose of this
chapter is to answer such a question and yet it is evident that it
cannot be answered completely what to observe out doors and how to
present ones impressions is a broad question and varies with the
knowledge and ability of the teacher as well as with the age and
experience of the children the how and the what in nature study is of
greater import than the hard dry facts and that must be left entirely
to the teacher a few suggestions however may not be amiss
1 general observations with a view to character building first of all
    it is important to remember that the great value of all tree and
    nature study is the inculcation in the minds of the children of an
    appreciation and love for the beautiful inspiring them to love
    trees generally means more than teaching them to know trees mere
    facts about trees taught in an academic way are often no more
    lasting than the formulae in trigonometry which most of us have long
    ago forgotten the important thing is that permanent results be left
    and nothing else will produce such lasting impressions as the study
    of trees out of doors
illustration fig 153trees have individuality
    general observations about trees can be made by pointing out the
    beauty and character of the individual forms and branching their
    harmony in their relations to each other as factors of a beautiful
    composition and the wealth of shades and colors in their leaves
    bark and flowers compare for instance the intricate ramification
    of an american elm with the simple branching of a sugar maple the
    sturdiness of a white oak with the tenderness of a soft maple the
    wide spread of a beech with the slender form of a lombardy poplar
    the upward pointing branches of a gingko with the drooping form of a
    weeping willow at close range each of these trees reveals itself
    as an individual with a character quite its own at little distance
    you may see them grouped together subordinating their individuality
    and helping to blend into a beautiful composition with a character
    all its own there is nothing more inspiring than the variety of
    greens in the spring foliage the diversity of color in the spring
    blossoms and the wonderful display of autumnal tints offered by the
    sweet gum sassafras dogwood black gum red maple sugar maple
    scarlet oak blue beech sorrel tree ash and gingko the white bark
    of the gray birch the dark bark of the black oak the gray of the
    beech the golden yellow of the mulberry and the mottled bark of the
    sycamore are interesting comparisons the smooth bark of the
    mockernut hickory contrasts greatly with the shaggy bark of the
    shagbark hickorymembers of the same family and yet how different
    a wonderful opportunity is thus offered for a comparative study of
    human natureindividuality and community life all reflected in
    trees
    with this preliminary study and with the addition of some remarks on
    the value of trees as health givers and moral uplifters the child
    is interested and attracted the lesson so far has attained its aim
2 specific observations with a view to training the observative powers
    the childs training in closeness of observation and scientific
    precision may be the next consideration his enthusiasm will now
    prompt him to lend his interest for greater detail we can teach him
    to recognize a few of the common trees by their general
    charactersan american elm by its fanshaped form a gray birch by
    its white bark a white pine by the five needles to each cluster a
    horsechestnut by its opposite branching and big sticky bud and a
    willow by its drooping habit after that we may introduce if the
    age of the pupils justifies more details extending to greater
    differences which distinguish one species from another
    the lesson might continue by pointing out the requirements of trees
    for water and light find a tree on some slope where the roots are
    exposed and another which is being encroached upon by its neighbor
    and show how in one case the roots travel in search of water and
    food and in the other the branches bend toward the light growing
    more vigorously on that side compare the trees on the open lawn
    with those in the grove and show how those in the open have grown
    with branches near the ground while those in the woodland are
    slender tall and free from branches to some distance above the
    ground point out the lenticels on the bark of birch and sweet
    cherry trees and explain how trees breathe compare this process
    with that of the human body you may now come across an old stump
    and here you can point out the structure of the woodthe sapwood
    cambium and bark you can illustrate the annual rings and count the
    age of the tree at another point you may find a tree with a wound
    or bruised bark and here you can readily make a closer study of the
    cambium layer and its manner of growth
    the adaptation of plants to the seasonal changes opens another
    interesting field of study for beginners if the season is the fall
    or winter note how the trees have prepared themselves for the
    winters cold by terminating the flow of sap by dropping their
    leaves too tender to resist the winters cold and by covering their
    buds with scales lined with down on the inside observe how the
    insects have spun for themselves silken nests or remain preserved in
    the egg state over the winter if the season is spring or summer the
    opposite may be noted see how everything turns to life how the
    buds are opening the leaves emerging the sap running seeds
    germinating and flowers blooming
    the soil conditions on the lawn and in the grove furnish another
    interesting feature of comparison and study in the grove you can
    demonstrate the decomposition of the fallen leaves the formation of
    humus and its value to the tree the importance of the forest soil
    as a conservator of water and its relation to stream flow and soil
    erosion can be brought out at this juncture an eroded bank and a
    slope covered with trees and shrubs would provide excellent models
    for this study a consideration of the economic value of the trees
    would also be in place
3 civic lessons reflected in trees the community life of trees in the
    grove their growth struggles for light and food and their mutual
    aid can be brought out and compared with the community life among
    people the trees may here be seen struggling with each other for
    light and food forcing each others growth upward some winning out
    and developing into stalwart and thrifty specimens and others
    becoming suppressed or entirely killed on the other hand they may
    be seen helping each other in their community growth by protecting
    each other from windfall and by contributing to the fertility of the
    forest soil in dropping their leaves and shading the ground so that
    these fallen leaves may decompose readily
illustration fig 154trees also grow in communities
4 enemies of trees an old stump or tree may be seen crumbling away
    under the influence of fungi and here the children may be shown the
    effects of tree diseases both as destroyers of life and as
    upbuilders because fungi turn to dust the living trees and build
    up others by furnishing them with the decomposed wood matter
    insects too may be invading the old dead tree and something of
    their nature habits and influences may be gone into they may be
    shown as wood borers leaf eaters or sap suckers all injurious to
    the tree on the other hand they may be shown as seed disseminators
    and as parasites on other injurious insects all benefactors
    forest fires as an enemy of trees might be touched upon by noting
    how easily the leaves may be ignited and a surface fire started when
    the season is dry top and ground fires emanating from surface fires
    can then be readily explained
illustration fig 155trees blend together to form a beautiful
composition
5 expression the pupils have by this time been taught to feel the
    beautiful to observe carefully and to reason intelligently and they
    may now be trained to express themselves properly this may be
    accomplished by asking them to remember their observations and to
    write about them in the classroom the lesson may be supplemented
    with effective reading about trees and forests interesting reading
    matter of this sort can be found in abundance in childrens readers
    in special books on the subject and in arbor day manuals published
    by the various state education departments
6 preparation in order to save time looking for objects of interest
    and for the purpose of correlating the various observations so that
    all will follow in orderly sequence it is well for the teacher or
    leader to go over the ground beforehand and note the special
    features of interest the various topics can then be given some
    thought and a brief synopsis can be drawn up to serve as a
    memorandum and guide on the trip
    it is also well to be provided with a hatchet to cut into some
    decayed stump a trowel to dig up the forest soil a knife for
    cutting off twigs and a hand reading glass for examining the
    structural parts of the various objects under observation a camera
    is always a valuable asset because the photographs hung in the
    classroom become records of great interest to all participants
7 suggestions for forming tree clubs a good way to interest children
    in trees and nature study is to form among them a tree club the
    idea has been fully developed in brooklyn ny newark nj and
    other cities and consists of forming clubs of children in the public
    schools and private institutions for the purpose of interesting them
    in the trees around their school and their homes the members of
    these clubs are each given the tree wardens badge of authority and
    assigned to some special duty in the preservation of the local
    trees a plan of study and of outdoor trips is laid out for them by
    their director and at stated periods they are given illustrated
    lectures on trees and taken to the neighboring parks or woodlands
