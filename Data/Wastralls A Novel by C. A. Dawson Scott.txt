trevorrick river was but a little stream to have fretted so deep a cleft
between the hills as that which sloped from the main road of tregols
parish to the sea  from the source to the engulfing sands was barely a
mile and the twinkling waters if full and fierce in winter showed a
summer fear of their own broad steppingstones nevertheless the sharp
declivities the juttings of rock even the shelves and crags and walls
of dark head had been formed by the gnawing of this tiny but persistent
flow
the valley ran east and west  the sun rising beyond st cadic mill
poured its noon warmth over hember and sank behind the sheltered plateau
on which stood the old home of the rosevears  the dying beams however
could not reach the deepset windows of wastralls for the crest of dark
head reared itself between the farmstead and the harsh threat of the
atlantic  the house lay in a fold of land hidden equally from those
who moved upon the face of the waters and those who might be said
though their habitations were at a distance to neighbour it  as a
refuge in troublous times the position had its value and there were
indications that this shelf of rock had been many centuries ago the
nest of some wild brood
upon their heels had followed as descendants or conquerorsthe script is
too nearly obliterated to be readmen who in their own strong person
represented the law  the gateposts of wastralls were crowned with the
eggshaped stones which indicated that it was a manorhouse and that
its owner had the right to dispense justice  within the house and
occupying a space from wall to wall was the ancient justice room but
its stately uses had long been abated its irrevocable decisions had
lost their force in the autumn of its days it had become a lumberroom
and more lately a bedchamber
a century ago from the mill at the head of the valley to the wreckers
hut on the foreshore trevorrick had been the property of one man  of
peasant stock how freathy rosevear came by land and money was matter of
surmise  he had gone out one morning a poor man and had come home
rich  little need however to invent tales of hidden treasure
witchcraft divination when the caves in morwen cove made so safe a
storehouse when the wreckers hut stood behind the teeth of the mad
rip when the lanes that converged upon the townsthe towns in which
queer commodities could always be soldwere so deep and secret
whatever the sources of his income as fortunes went in that remote
district freathy rosevear was accounted wealthy  he was also a man to
take the eye  big florid fair he might have stepped out of a holbein
canvas and tales of his unusual strength were told and retold of a
winters evening in the cottages  did his wife complain the store of
wreck was running low  forthwith he had gone out caught the first of
the homing donkeys and carried it load and all into her presence
with a fardel for my ladyso the story
the man was as saul to a kingless folk a head and shoulders above the
multitude  like the last of the tudor monarchs he brought the people
among whom he lived material wellbeing and like other outstanding
personalities stamped his impress on the current coin before he died
he was old squire and as such he lived in the long memory of the
countryside  not that to them his death was the final exit from the
stage of his influence and activities  though they followed him to his
burying though they saw the sods falling earth to earth they could not
believe that abundant penetrating imperial vitality could be resolved
into its elements recognizing that neither heaven nor hell was the
fitting place for it they showed their faith in the life after death by
a hardy belief that old squire though rendered invisible was still
among them
when this mans grip upon trevorrick relaxed the land fell to his three
legitimate sons for his other children and he had done his part in
peopling the neighbourhood he had provided during his life  the
legitimate sons freathy constantine and tom were good farmers all
but cast in an ordinary mould  they lived they replenished the earth
and in the fullness of time went back to it dust to dust  a younger
constantine now owned the mill a younger tom tilled the fat slopes of
hember and wastralls the cradle of the race was become the property
of freathys only child his daughter sabina  every rood of land in the
valley was still rosevear property and the cousins shut in by their
hill boundaries formed a community conscious at once of its kinship and
its isolation
of the three farms wastralls was the largest and most important
across the valley were wide commonsthe wastrallsonce bare blown sand
but now converted by spire grass into turf for the fattening of
redbrown bullocks  on the heavy land between the house and the little
stream were orchards and cornfields while behind the cliffs tethered
in pairs to prevent them being blown over the edge a flock of sheep
nibbled the short grass  the manor itself was a low twostoried oblong
of country stone and with its courts and outhouses seemed as much an
excrescence of the rocky ground as more solid outcroppings  a grey
irregularity by day it sank when twilight fell into its surroundings
at dawn st cadic mill was a black tower against the saffron at dusk
hember windows flamed with reflections of the west but both at dawn and
dusk wastralls was more a presumption than a fact  the house was older
than hember older than the mill and its obscurity suggested that the
forgotten builder had hoped the stormgod might take wastralls in his
stride that death might fail among so many grey swells and hummocks
to distinguish it
the place had been built to house two families  a dividing wall cut the
fine chambers on the western front from the lowpitched rooms that
looked across the yard a green door stout and with a heavy lock was
set in the dividing wall to allow of communication between the oldtime
lord of the manor and the bailiff who tilled his fields but the
families living back to back having different modes of egress and
ingress the one taking the field path the other the road preserved
each its privacy when old squire brought a wife to wastralls she
preferring the homeliness of the farmstead had made it their
dwellingplace  from thenceforward the life of the house centred in the
roomy whitewashed kitchen and the fine chambers swept and shuttered
were only used on ceremonial occasions  old squire had no use for state
or trappings and when his son freathy reigned in his stead the lesser
man asked no greater luxury than had satisfied his sire
this second freathy married a woman so indistinct that it was a wonder
he had seen her sufficiently well to fall in love  she ruled wastralls
with a boneless hand and used her knees for praying rather than
scrubbing of this vague colourless creature was born the vital
brighthaired sabina  her father welcomed her as a beginning first a
maid and then a child but his wifes effort left her exhausted  the
tonic air of the valley made it difficult for her to die but she failed
a little month by month until unnoticed she was able to slip into
her grave  freathys thought was must marry again try to get a boy
twont do to let a maid be heir of the land  but he was comfortable
as a widower more comfortable than he had been during dushas pious
slatternly existence and time the inexorable drew the daisy quilt
about his neck while he yet procrastinated
for lack of a son freathy had taken his daughter with him about the
farm  his thoughts being of the cattlemarket of soils and crops it
was of such matters that he spoke and sabina picked up the lore of the
seasons as naturally as another child learns to sew and cook  her
father was a man who drank not continuously but at intervals which
like a perspective of posts showed diminishing interspaces  the child
accepted his habits as she accepted rain and shine and when he was
under the influence of liquor did her young best to grapple with his
duties  by the time he diedfrom the effects of a night spent
inadvertently in the openshe had gathered a little store of experience
had indeed been farming wastralls for over a year  freathy intending
to remarry and leave hearty sons had not troubled to make a will and
the girl of oneandtwenty succeeded to an unencumbered freehold of five
hundred acres the manorhouse and what remained of old squires
savings
offers of help came from both hember and st cadic each was willing to
work wastralls with his own land each hoped sabina might listen to a
cousinly tale of love  she however having inherited the robust
confidence of her grandfather was determined to undertake on her own
account the adventure of farming  nor were tom and constantine rosevear
altogether surprised they had not played with her as children without
recognizing her quality and if they wondered what hand shed make of
it it was as those whose hearts prophesy unto them
the brothers who had inherited hember and st cadic had died young but
each had left a son  tom the owner of hember thought that as its
fields marched with those of wastralls he ought to marry his cousin
while constantine sought her because the glint of her bright hair had
dazzled him  a fine maid was sabina blue eyes flush with rounded
cheeks not the passionate eyes of old squire but the blue of
icedepths when the sun is shining in a clear sky and when it was a
question of marriage she found the straight sticks who offered
themselves for weapon and support were of a too familiar wood  she
would go a little farther into the forest
    arise up maid all in your gown of green
      for summer is acome into day
    you are as fine a lady as wait upon the queen
      in the merry morning of may
    arise up maid out of your bed
      for summer is acome into day
    your chamber shall be strewed with the white rose and the red
      in the merry morning of may 
 padstow hobbyhorse song
the green waves of the atlantic roll strange flotsam into the sandy bays
of that bitter coast and the sea hungry though it be can give up more
than the dead one summer on the bosom of a forgotten sunset a boat had
drifted into morwen cove to strand when the tide turned amid the weed
and rubbish of the foreshore in it swollen with cold unconscious
nearly dead lay a waif the survivor of some obscure wreck  leadville
byron a hind who with his childless wife lived over the disused
fishcellars at wastralls chanced upon the boat its contents stirred
the father in him and as he carried home the bit of human waste his
anxiety was lest it might be reclaimed indeed he never quite lost his
fear that what the sea had given the land that unknown of towns and
country beyond the hills might take  if inquiries were made however
they did not reach trevorrick and the child a lusty blackbrowed
youngster grew to manhood without further change in his surroundings
his native tongue had been unintelligible to the villagers and he could
not give himself a name  his fosterparents therefore felt themselves
justified in calling him leadville  if his name were ever discovered he
could return to it meanwhile he was buttressed against the curiosity of
strangers  as was only natural the byrons bred him to work on the land
and at eighteen wastrallsthe delectable hillside the edge of cliff
the tumuli of the ancient folkwere all he knew indeed it required a
cataclysm to prove to him that he was not a clod of wastralls earth
in outward seeming the lad was not unlike the people among whom he
lived  a little more swarthy with a more sombre expression in his dark
eyes a broader chest than was often seen he might have passed for a
cornishman  the difference was one of temperament and it was a
difference so great that never to the end of his life was he to be
other to them than a foreigner
one autumn after a rainy reedy summer a summer of losses mr
rosevear was forced to believe he could work the farm with fewer
labourers and young byron being the last to join the little band of
hinds must be the first to go  the lad took his dismissal hardly  by
dewing the land with his sweat he had made it his and against his will
a deep and narrow will he could not be disinherited  he considered
himself as much part of wastralls as a bush of tamarisk in the hedge
as however he must go he listened to his fosterfathers suggestion
and returned temporarily to the great waters which had spewed him up
he went but in every ships wake in the reek of foreign cities in the
wind that blew from home he saw visions of those few fields which to
him were the world  he had the inward eye of the dreamer and as the
year turned saw spring drawing her green skirts over the hillside and
hanging the orchard with her gossamers  he saw the dandelions starring
the thick grass by the river the lush dark grass in which he had rolled
himself moved by the ecstasy of life and to him the salt sea was barren
and unprofitable a desert upon which he must go to and fro until the
days of his pilgrimage were accomplished  the death of old byron
brought the wanderer back to hindoo cottageas the fishcellars were
calledonly to find that the wife had followed her man and that
heleadville the youngerwas again without even the semblance of a human
tie  he had not loved the old couple love did not at any time come
easily to him and all the emotion of which he was capable had long been
concentrated upon wastralls but he was anxious to secure his
fosterfathers berth as teamster  to the outpourings of the neighbours
he listened unheeding and presently took his way to the farmhouse there
to learn that rosevear had been laid in a neater ditch than that of his
inadvertent choice and that sabinabig ripe fair a woman who might
have stepped out of the elizabethan agereigned in his stead
the opportunity was selfevident and byron back in his place and once
more happy soon realized that his hearts desire was within reach  it
was not sabina that he wanted but wastralls and that again not for
ambitions sake but because his late experience had taught him the
value of security  asking no more of life than permission to spend his
youth his strength his passion on the land he found consent in
sabinas awakening interest  she had disdained the easykindled fires
of tom of constantine and of the tregols lads but the sombre glow in
byrons eyes was disturbing it moved her as something unknown and full
of a strange promise that promise which is in the rising sap and
germinating seed  the neighbours expressed a kindly apprehension for
though marriage between persons of different race may be eugenically
sound it seldom brings happiness to the individual but sabina was
beyond reason for in the stranger she had found her mate
within a month the banns were called and a little later the oddly
assorted couple pushed off into matrimony whereas however byron
believed himself to be marrying wastrallsthe good farm and the waste
lands by the seamaking it for ever flesh of his flesh his in
indissoluble union sabina did not intend to endow her lover with her
worldly goods  she held the land by right of inheritance and by a
worthier right that of the farmer who deals understandingly with her
fields  although she cultivated the farm in the way that had brought
prosperity to the family her stock was pedigree and realized good
prices her seed was the best procurable and she was always ready to try
new manures and dressings  she was not a woman of ideas neither was
she reactionary but a fold of old squires mantle hung from her
shoulders and as the neighbours said to give the maid her due hers
a firstrate farmer  she loved her farm but as a sportsman loves a
good dog  she exacted from it the utmost it could give and was its
considerate master but she could have no conception of leadvilles
attitude if it had been explained to her that he loved the land as a
man loves a woman she would have doubted her informant and if
convinced have thought her husband a fool for his pains  as it was
when he attempted to assert his new rights as he did immediately after
their marriage she stared in surprise
oo told you to give the orders to the inds when ive got a tongue of
me own
i thought i was savin of ee a lot of trouble
i dont want yer to do my work for me  i can do it meself
i should think you got enough to do indoors without goin outdoors
workin  i dont see what a woman want to be out in all weathers for
sabina laughed goodhumouredly  my dear feller i always bin outdoor
rain or fine dont make any difference to me
well my dear youll lose all they good looks o yours  i dont like
to see women all burned up  youll be an old woman before youm a young
one
i dont care what i be and i dont believe a word you say is true
onyow i shall chance it
well tis the mans place to teel the land
a fine mess youd make of it too  look at the mill fields  if con
turned the ditches out they wouldnt be so wet even tom dont keep is
fields so clean as mine
i dont care bout that baint a womans work
aw git away  tidnt all women that want to farm but those that do
letm av it  tis just whether they can farm or cant
well i think its my business as im yer usband you ought to let me
av it
whats the good to let you av it you dunno nothing about farmin
you bin to sea most all yer life  tis years an years since you
ploughed a bit o ground
a dark colour came into the bridegrooms cheek ow can you say that
when i was brought up on the land  i knaw all about farm work  aving
married you to av the farms my due
sabina sat very straight in her chair  now once for all said she
lets settle this matter  wastralls is mine and i dare you to so much
as lay a finger on it if you want to farm so much as all that higher
polnevas is to let and its fields are joinin ours  why dont you go
over and take that  ill let you av the money for that but you wont
av wastralls
byron had not expected opposition  sabina being a woman would
naturally be glad to have the outdoor work taken off her hands  his
surprise at her attitude was so intense that he stared at her in a
helpless silence until she clinched the matter by exclaiming in her
hearty freshair voice tis no good for ee to think anything about
it
this phrase opened the floodgates  usually somewhat silent he had
moods when the words tumbled over each other in a multitude beyond
counting  perceiving he had miscalculated he set to work to retrieve
his error and during the course of the evening learnt many things but
not how to make sabina change her mind the poor man desperately
afraid did all he knew  he entreated and she smiled he blustered and
she laughed he cajoled and she warmed to him but though she warmed
she did not weaken  her first word was her last tis no good for ee
to think anything about it
byron was helpless  he could not win her to his will neither could he
break her  she was capable as she let him see of separating from him
if he appealed to the hinds they would side with her  her cousins at
hember and st cadic the neighbours in the adjacent valleys would take
her part
turning the matter over however he perceived that time by giving
sabina fresh interests fresh cares might prove his friend  nurslings
tie the mother to the house and when the babies came his wife would have
her hands full  she must let go what she could not hold and he would
be ready to pick up bit by bit what she let fall
in this hope he settled to his new life  it was unthinkable that he
should attempt to farm higher polnevas when his mind was filled with
wastralls  of a brooding nature through which at times flames of
emotion broke he was content to spend his days thinking out and
dwelling on the changes he would make when his opportunity came
sabinas farming cautious and wellconsidered chafed him  he wanted
the land to bring forth a hundredfold where she now gave a mere return
he was her lover asking of her all that she could give eager only to
have the exploiting of her possibilities  to make her fruitful was to
be his work  he saw the seed swell in her bosom the silent marvel of
growth the harvest that should reward his husbandry and because out
of the heart the mouth speaketh when he talked it was of intensive
farming of the money that lay in sugarbeet strawberries asparagus
of marketgardening and the use of glass  thereby he damaged his cause
for sabina listening came to the conclusion that she had married an
unpractical dreamer  if he believed in his theories why did he not rent
land and prove them  that he only talked satisfied her that she had
been right in her refusal to let him farm wastralls and her grip on the
land tightened  the kindly fields deserved better of her than that she
should put them at the mercy of a dreamer
whether or no the mans life that she led did her disservice it is
certain that no children came to modify the situation  in the loft the
carved wooden cradle lay with only the wind to set it arock below the
rooms were as empty of new life as is a whispering conch  the bustle of
the farm was like the swish of water about a rock islet that little
spot of sterility and stagnation at the heart of multitudinous life
sabina who had natural instincts who had mothered a bibulous father
and many a bit of life from the fields and hedges was disappointed but
her feeling was mild compared with that of her husband  his children
were to have delivered wastralls into his hand assuaged at last the
long ache of his passion but the years turned on their axes going as
they had come  at first byron bore himself with a good courage after
the unprofitable days of his seafaring it was enough to watch the
tamarisk stems warming into red life to spend the daylight wandering
over the wellknown ground to return at night to the grey house on its
shelf of rock  if after a while these delights palled it was because
they led nowhither
meanwhile under sabinas judicious management the farm prospered
neither cared to spend the one because she had no wants the other
because what he desired could not be bought  with every year the bank
stocking grew heavier also the mans heart and every year found his
thoughts fixed more bitterly upon his disappointment  sabina saw but
without understanding her man was moody foolish too with his perpetual
harping on his rights but she was not thereby alienated for wise or
unreasonable he was her man  though she envied tom his houseful of
daughters and constantine his big sons her own lack left her the more
leisure to care for her husbands comfort  the standard of living at
wastralls was higher than that of the surrounding farms  byron ate
according to his fancy and lay soft was given indeed those things to
which he was indifferent and denied that after which he hungered
im kep like a prize bullock he said morosely when what i want is
to be workin and doin for meself
well my dear oo told you not to work  theres plenty to do theres
that fouracre field why dont yer go and plough up that stead of in
ere mumpin about
as though i was yer ind
what still wantin to be maister
iss an shall be till i die
now look ere  if you want money to buy polnevas you can av it but
wastralls you will never av
well if i cant av wastralls i wont av nothing but you mark my
wordshe bent towards her and brought one hand with a thump into the
palm of the otherif i cant av it by itch i will by crook
not so long as i live then anyow
byron was slightly underhung a formation which gives the face a look of
strength and purpose  we shall see some day which of us is the
strongest of the two
the woman happy in her work and with her main affection satisfied
could answer with reasonable goodhumour well my dear feller tis my
land and i must do my duty by it  tis im responsible not you to the
folks up yonder and a movement of her bright head indicated the
burialground at church town  im sorry youre disappointed but i
cant elp it
oh hang itsorry
well i be sorry  id like for ee to av everything to make yer
appy but wastralls i cant give  she smiled at him in her friendly
fashion a sweet inviting smile  i do my best to make it up to yer in
other ways and that you know
iss i want bread and you do give me a stone  he turned away leaving
her as ever uncomprehending it was impossible for her to think of him
as other than a child who for his own sake must be denied and
prevented who was hers to care for and in ways that could not harm
him to indulge  the truth to her as to so many of us would have been
unbelievable
the breakup of the situation was due to an accident sabina had driven
a young horse to the fair at st columb major and this animal excited
by the unwonted traffic the smells and the noise became unmanageable
plunging down the hill he came into collision with a heavy van  the
prancing feet slipped and he fell shooting his driver over the shafts
though clear of horse and cart she was flung with considerable violence
against the front wheel of the van  this startled the van horses and
the heavy lumbersome creatures with a prodigious clatter started up
the street  sabina rendered unconscious by the blow she had received
had fallen between the wheels and the van lurching forward passed over
her
it was thought at first that she was killed but the crushed woman who
later that afternoon was admitted to the little hospital at stowe was
still breathing  as the case seemed hopeless the husband was sent for
and byron in a ferment of excitement came pounding in on the heels of
the messenger  his horse was in a lather when he checked him at the
hospital gate  poor sabina poor old girl it was a terrible thing for
her to die as she lived away from home like that  no doubt er ead
was full of the farmin never once thought of dyin but the lorrd
would be merciful
if shes goin to die dont ee keep it from me he said to dr
derek who was in charge of the case  id rather knaw the worst
and as he explained to the neighbours on his return home after
being allowed to glance at the unconscious face on the pillow the poor
doctor ee couldnt give me no encouragement
                              chapter ii
the sight of sabina her florid face grey against the white bandages
her pale lips open to facilitate the drawing of difficult breath had
convinced her husband that she could not possibly recover  that evening
he called the hinds together told them what had happened and for the
first time gave them their orders  as he went back into the house old
george biddick who had been many years on the farm and was of a
noticing disposition drew the attention of a newcome labourer to the
receding figure
speaks as though ed been maister all the time dont e  an carries
isself pretty straight too considerin as em bowed wi grief
i dont spose e realize things yet said jim a rosevear from across
the hills  must av been tarrble shock forn
the other man glanced sideways out of small brown eyes and gave a
noncommittal grunt  he was queerly shaped with a highshouldered
short body and long legs and being related to most of the cottagers
was known generally as uncle george
dunno so much about that  missus is so strong as a dunkey he said
as he returned to his work of bedding down the horses an she may
chate the crows yet
but jim rosevear was not listening his thoughts had run before him up
the road to where at the stone stile a maid would be waiting  the
rest of the world might be concerned with death but he was young and
his concern was with life more life
when on the following day byron rode over to the hospital he was told
that his wife still breathed but that an operation had become
necessary an operation which it was scarcely possible she could
survive  he found it difficult to understand why it must be
why punish er so  wouldnt it be better to let er die quiet than to
ack er about
the wheel of the van had gone over both legs crushing together bone and
flesh and the surgeon proposed to amputate  the limbs were injured
beyond hope of saving and it was explained that their removal might
give the patient a chance
do you think then sir said the anxious husband that shell be
better if she av the operation
she may  the condition is critical and unless the operation is
performed she might at any moment take a turn for the worse  he was
afraid bloodpoisoning might set in
i shouldnt av thought shed be strong enough to bear it
dr dereks opinion was that sabina would probably die on the
operatingtable and this without putting it into so many words he
managed to convey  as soon as byron understood although the idea of
the amputation was curiously repugnant to him he gave leave for it to
be attempted  sabina had to die poor soul and it was hard on her that
the doctors should think it necessary to try their experiments on her
should not be able to leave her in possession of her limbs  still 
theirs the responsibility
byron was allowed to remain in the hospital till the result of the
operation was known  he sat in an austerely furnished waitingroom and
through his mind coursed dim memories of sabina handsome and active
sabina vaulting the gates and climbing like a boy sabina with her free
gait and her hearty openair voice  from the other side of the picture
the sabina whose mangled limbs were at that moment being cut from her
body he sedulously turned his gaze  that she should be thus mutilated
was abhorrent to him
dr derek his spickandspan brightness a little dimmed and his eyes
tired came in at last  shes still alive byron
i didnt think she would be sir
the doctor hummed and hawed  the operation had been long and delicate
and he was weary but he could not let the man take away with him an
illusory hope
we have to reckon he said gravely with the shock to the system
you dont think returned byron in his deep rumbling bass as theres
much chance for er then sir
the condition is very serious
i shall be lost without er even as tis he stared before him out of
the window and the melancholy of his rough unkempt appearance impressed
the other man
are you alone at wastralls he asked contrasting in a mind as neat as
his body his trim small house on the main street of stowe with the
grey homestead and irregular outbuildings of the lonely farm
ive a woman that do the housework but she go ome by night
sounds a bit dreary  dr derek was essentially a town bird  the
noise of footsteps on the pavement of voices in the street was music
to him
well its what wem accustomed to said byron carefully an after
all wem pretty and busy  o course i got the farm to see to as missus
is ere
yes yes of course
i was wonderin sir if you could send out and let me knaw ow shes
gettin on  course i should be delighted to set by er if she knawed
me but seein as poor sawls gone past that and ive so much to do
im better off ometill im wanted
ive no doubt it could be arranged  ill speak to matron about it
thank you sir an of course anything she want she can av only
send in and let me knaw  moneys no object when its er life
you can trust me byron  everything possible will be done for her
said the other gravely only im afraid
the first bulletin that reached wastralls told byron to prepare for the
worst  his wife was still alive but sinking
that day he went about the farm in a ferment of emotion  poor sabina
poor soul but if she had to die better now when he was in his prime
she had had a good time and now it was his turn  he trod the fields as
blessed souls may walk in paradise  the dear land the land he loved
deep as dozmare was his and he had got it fairly he had not pushed his
wife out of it accident had befriended himoh happy accident
when he came in from his work he took down a wellthumbed list and
wrote an order for glass for frames for certain muchadvertised
manures and for young plants  the season was advanced and if he hoped
for a speedy result he must not lose time  the next bulletin dropping
on his happy absorption gave but little hope that sabina would see
another dawn  she was alive and no more
byron who was at breakfast found his hunger easily satisfied  the
letter had been meat and drink thoughts indeed of a day spent
striding over the cornish moors of a night in the sacred haunted
solitudes of rowtor passed through his mind but while he was
considering them his glance fell upon the honeysuckle of the porch
long the pride of sabinas heart its untidy growth had been to him an
eyesore here then was the outlet for his passionate elation an outlet
too symbolic of his mood  with his own hands he pulled it up digging
out the roots so that nothing remained from which a fresh shoot might
spring jealousy an old jealousy the jealousy of the brooding years
was in the action
wastralls which had been sabinas was to affront him with no memories
of a past humiliation  the new wastralls was always to have been his
at the end of the week he was surprised to learn that sabina still
hovered between life and death  riding into stowe he sought out dr
derek and was reassured to find he took a pessimistic view of the case
though acknowledging that mrs byron showed great vitality the surgeon
did not think she would outlive the week  he condoled with the farmer
and byron satisfied that all was well went back to his work
a wagon drawn by three great brown horses had brought from wadebridge
the various articles which the farmer lavish for the first time in his
life had ordered having sabinas savings upon which eventually to draw
he had commanded glass manures plants in abundance the little band
of labourers accustomed to mrs byrons caution looked on with the
stolid disapproval of men averse to change  the delicate processes of
marketgardening were new to them and they did not think the new scheme
should have been inaugurated while she lay on her deathbed  the farmer
found them irritatingly slow but did not realize that this seeming
stupidity was the cautious expression of their unwillingness  if the
mistress died this man would be their employer therefore their wisest
course was to be outwardly docile but a little hard to teach  they
talked among themselves however and what is more spread the tale of
byrons doings over the countryside
wind of it had already been wafted up the valley at hember and st
cadic the cousins after trying the one for sabinas land the other for
her love had long since settled to a second choice  tom rosevear
indeed had gone back to an earlier fancy a girl with whom both he and
sabina had been at school  isolda raby was the daughter of a fishseller
and her marriage with the prosperous farmer had been for her a rise in
life  since the time they had sat on the same school bench she had
been sabinas most intimate cronythe only interruption to their
friendship being caused by the frailty the landhunger of man  but
tom after some plain speaking on sabinas part had returned to his
isolda and the friendship had not only been revived but placed on a
wider more satisfactory basis
when sabina met with her accident mrs toms heart was wrung  an
imaginative tenderhearted woman she felt an anxious desire to be a
stay and a comfort to do something however small to mitigate her
friends sufferings  there was at first little that she could do beyond
keeping an eye on poor sabinas household and seeing that leadville did
not lack food or service  after the first anxious days however she
was allowed into the hospital and from that time her eldest daughter
being able to tend house in her stead she spent as many hours at her
friends bedside as the rules of the place permitted  at first sabina
was for long periods unconscious  she took nourishment she drowsed
she suffered many and various discomforts but it seemed to her that
whenever she came to the surface her glance fell on the comforting
vision of isolda the same pretty matronly isolda who with kind talk
and kinder offices had for so long pervaded her daily life  sabina was
so badly injured in such incessant pain so low in herself that she
took little interest in her surroundings  to hear the familiar click of
the knittingneedles to open her weary eyes on that understanding
smile was however some sort of pleasure
when mrs tom heard that byron was busy with carpenters and masons
putting up glasshouses and introducing a new system of tillage she was
not so much surprised as indignant  she had not gone in and out of
wastralls every day for so many years without becoming aware of the
husbands disappointment and impatience she understood that he like
her own tom had loved the land not the woman  he however had not
been able to adapt himself and his life was a daily weariness though
she allowed that the result was a judgment on him she found it in her
kind heart to wish that he could have had his way  the mad impatience
which made him inaugurate farreaching changes in anticipation of his
wifes death met however with scant sympathy from mrs tom  a woman
of moderate councils whose very civility sprang from a sincere
kindliness the fact that byron went so far as to tear up sabinas
honeysuckle while she yet breathed put him beyond the pale
when the talk reached mrs toms ears sabina was still undecided
whether to attempt the weary climb back to health or slip quietly away
the loss of her limbs inclined her to the latter course  she could not
bear to contemplate life as a cripple  the thought of the fields over
which she had ridden of the marketplace in which she had bought and
sold of the whole familiar countryside was unbearable  better lie
quiet up at church town than go limping where she had once leaped and
run  mrs tom coming into the ward at a moment when sabina with i
dont want any o that old trade was refusing good nourishment
decided that the truth might be as good for her as a tonic
how be ee today sbina how be gettin on
the injured woman looked at her with weary bloodshot eyes  i dunno  i
dont feel very special
isolda seated herself on a cane chair facing the patient and took out
her knitting  as she made not only her husbands stockings but those of
her five daughters she had always one on hand  what do ee feel
like
my dear life i suffer like a turk  id soon be dead as livin
mrs toms face expressed her sympathy  av ee got much pain
yes i ache something awfulin my legs
the other stared in surprise  in yer legs  but you avent got any
well seem like i av them
mrs rosevear laughed  if that doesnt beat everything
the sufferer moved restlessly on her pillow  id rather be out on
goolland than like i be now
 gulland a barren islet off the north coast of cornwall
looking at the hollows of the face once so appleround isoldas heart
misgave her
i feel continued mrs byron in a dragging voice that i cant stand
much more of this
nonsense youll cheat the crows yet
dont care whether i do or no  what is there for a woman like me
ive neither chick nor chield
well theres leadville to think about
sabina sighed  hed cut a poor shine without me but therei dunno
her voice trailed away into silence
mrs toms heart began to beat more quickly  well she ventured
hes workin pretty and ard now
hes got to keep the thing going assented the wife
hes doin moren that
sabinas voice was still languid but she showed a little interest
whats ah doin then
a cart come over from wadebridge o thursday piled up wi boxes and
bags  now just let me turn this heel
boxes and bags murmured the wife  good gracious  whats ah going
to do with that
after a few seconds given to her work mrs tom looked up  hes
teelin the lil medder wi sugarbeet
the others mind dulled by suffering and loss of blood took time to
grasp the significance of this statement sugarbeet she said
slowly but im goin to ave the lil medder teeled wi dredgecorn
you baint there to give the orders
sabinas lips took a firmer line  i wont av it teeled wi that
newfangled trade  you telln so
better telln yourself i reckon  she glanced shrewdly at her friend
for sabinas unexpected illness had put new thoughts into mrs toms
head  she was not greedy but the most selfeffacing creature will
scheme a little for its young  i reckon hed do far different if you
wasnt ere
you think so  sabina shut her eyes the better to realize the
situation  the news had been stimulating and when she spoke again her
voice was stronger  i dont think as im goin round land this time
isolda
i do hope an pray as you arent my dear soul
what else is ah doin
tom went down to seen last night thought as ee might be lonely in
that big ouse all by imself and leadville was tellin im he didnt
believe in the way missis was farmin  hed like to try and see what
the landd grow best  he saidterbacca
terbacca  i should think he was maze  never heard tell of such a
thing  whatever next is he gwine grow
he think the land would grow vegetables as tis the right sort o soil
and that tis wasted in corn
sabina gave a feeble snort  what do ee know about soilsa sailor
she shook her head  as long as i live hell never have nothing to do
with wastralls
mrs rosevears needles clicked in agreement  as long as you do live
sbina
iss why not me livin  i ent older than he is and theres no reason
i should turn up my trotters first at least i dont see why i should
well all live till we die sure enough but its been touch and go
lately with you
ill live in spite ofn said mrs byron
i hope you will my dear but sposin you dont mrs byron returned
her friends glance with a startled look  ah iss sposin  she saw
at last what her death would have meant both to her husband and her
kinsfolk  well i make no promises but i do see now where im to
iss i can see through a very small hole and im not too old to learn
sabina had been effectually roused  possessions that are menaced
increase in value and as long as leadville was making changes at
wastralls she would not want to die
theres things as you cant alter she said thinking sabina should be
prepared for what could not now be helped
what cant i alter
heve pulled up the honeysuckle by the porch
a fugitive colour dyed the wan cheeks  have ee now the old villain
whatever for  the honeysuckle as my poor old mother planted
sabinas thoughts were finally diverted from her own trials and lame or
not she was now only too anxious to stop this meddling with what was
hers
hes always after something new  leadville could not have known that
she treasured the climber  she was sure he would not knowingly have
hurt her feelings whenever he did anything that to her was
incomprehensible sabina put it down not to design but want of
thought  she was of those who cannot see into the heart of a matter
i like the old things best she continued and her eyes those
impersonal eyes which were the blue of a december sky shone with new
purpose  well have no more of they doins  wheres that trade nurse
wanted for me to take  i feel i could drink some now
byron busy putting his plans into execution nearly forgot on what
their success hung  he had thrown himself into the work with the
eagerness of a man in all ways extreme  he was living his dream and he
was happy  after one or two noncommittal post cards from dr derek
however came the news that though her husband would be wise not to
build on it mrs byron was holding her own  by this time some of the
glasshouses were up and the land below the house which should have
been in dredgecorn was planted with sugarbeet  for the first time
byron felt a qualm of anxiety  he had not imagined it possible sabina
could survive the amputation of her legs  in giving leave for the
operation to be performed he had believed that he was hasteningwith
the doctors kind assistancethe inevitable end  with a sinking heart
he now began to wonder whether he had underestimated her vitality  what
if after all she should recover  she was a sound harmonious being
whom exposure and a simple strenuous life had only toughened  if any
one could survive so terrible an accident it would be she
that day he did his work in perturbation of spirit he had no illusions
as to what sabina would think of the changes he was making  she would
be stubbornly opposed to every one of them and sabinas stubbornness was
the force with which for so long he had had to reckon a gleam of hope
came with the thought that even if she recovered she would no longer be
able to manage the farm  a poor cripple could not get about the fields
especially such upanddown fields as those of wastralls she would be
obliged to appoint a deputy and who so suitable as the man she had
married
he cursed the impatience which had led him astray if he had waited the
matter would have arranged itself in accordance with his wishes  now
if sabina recovered it was only too likely that she would make it
difficult for him to carry out his schemes  he tried to imagine what
form her opposition would take but though he had lived beside her for
so long the writing on the wall was in characters he could not
interpret
to add to his anxieties the man was finding himself short of money  one
of his counts against sabina was that when they married she had refused
to have her banking account put in their joint names  tedn a womans
business to sign cheques he had told her in a futile attempt to bring
her to his way of thinking
she smiled as at a good joke  i dont think you ever signed a cheque
in your life
i didn marry yer for yer money he assured her hastily
dont bother yerself about it then  i done business for my old dad
all the time you was to sea and id be a pretty malkin if i didn knaw
more about signin cheques than you do
im told i ought to be able to draw cheques on your account
shouldnt listen to all you ear  if you want money go and work
fort  ill lend ee any to start with
there never ought to be two purses between man and wife  they should
share alike
when you got something she assured him we will
in spite of her words she had not been niggardly  as much as byron
asked for he received and believing that all was rightly his he had
taken as much as he wanted he had seen however no reason to save and
now found himself unable to pay for what he had ordered  sabina was too
ill to be approached and when he took the tale of his difficulties to
hember he found tom rosevear civil as usual but evasive  he did not
say much but it was evident the improvements did not meet with his
approval that he could not understand byrons initiating them while his
wife lay at deaths door  the trifling loan which the farmer succeeded
in raising did not do more than pay the wages of the extra workmen the
carpenters and masons he was employing and as time passed and his
agent at wadebridge began to press for the money owing byron found
himself awkwardly placed  money he must have but when he tried to
raise it on his expectations he discovered that the security was not
considered good  the obvious course was to tell liddicoat to send the
bills in to sabina but this as he well knew would entail on him
unpleasant consequences  meanwhile the injured woman was slowly gaining
ground  isoldas tale had roused in her not only the will to live but
the will to overcome as far as might be the disabilities of her
condition  in the days when she was accounted handsome she had been
without selfconsciousness and she did not develop it now that she knew
herself to be a poor remnant  what were looks when the heart was
beating warmly and the mind was clear  her mutilation being the result
of accident it did not occur to her that any oneany one to whom she
looked for love and tendernessmight find her repulsive
after the operation was performed byron had inquired after her welfare
but had not come to see her  although so happily occupied he felt at
times a little uneasy sabinas attraction for him had been her flawless
health and the amputation aroused in him not pity but a faint stirring
of repugnance  he sent her a message that he must be on the spot to
see to things and undemonstrative herself and not yet instructed as
to the nature of the things she had accepted his excuse  a day came
however when he felt that he must overcome his unwillingness to see for
himself the difference in her which the operation had made  liddicoat
was pressing for payment and he had other liabilities  he rode into
stowe therefore rode at his usual breakneck pace and having stabled
his horse called at the hospital
although his visit was unexpected sabina had had the long leisure of a
slow convalescence in which to arrange her thoughts and make plans for
the future  leadville had tried to take advantage of her being ill  he
had thought that when she recovered she would accept the changes he had
introduced  he had acted like a child without thought of the
consequences  the foolish fellow sabina was not angered  she had
always been an indulgent wife and she could overlook this attempt to
steal a march on her as she had overlooked his many efforts to get the
management of the farm into his hands
looking neither to the right nor to the left byron dragged his
reluctant feet up the ward  sabina who disliked sewing and did not
care to read had been lying back on her pillows her hands folded on
the white sheet  as she caught sight of the wellknown figure a little
flush of surprised pleasure spread over her pale cheeks  she was very
glad to see him  in her eyes his breadth and heaviness the strong
growth of his black hair the jut of his square chin were so many
attractions  she had always admired his strength and the evidences of
it in deep chest and hairy skin were to her taste  she could have
wished however that he would look up would answer her ready smile
instead of staring before him like a bull who is not quite certain
whether the people he is encountering are friend or foe she had no
suspicion that every step her husband took was more unwilling than the
last
the moment came when he must look at her  his furtive glance swept in
one unhappy second the bed and its occupant then he bent forward and
gave her a clumsy kiss  the truth was not as bad as he had feared by
some deft arrangement of the clothes the bed gave a false impression
as far as appearances went the woman in it might have been in possession
of her limbs byron escaping the shock he had expected experienced
however one of a different kind  the face he touched was indeed that
of his wife but it was changed  sabinas redgold hair which had been
rippling and abundant the very symbol of her gay vitality had lost its
colour when he last saw her a bandage had concealed it now white as
that bandage it framed a face lined and haggard
whymy dear life he stammered staring ow your air av altered
she put a hand to her head  yer didnt know well cant be elped
yer air was awful pretty  the change troubled him vaguely he was
not pleased to find that his wife who had kept her looks beyond the
average should have aged
i reckon im as god made me but i was never one to trouble about my
looks  she sought for words to express her thought  red air or
white im the same
iss he said and continued to look at her thoughtfully
she might be the same woman but her effect upon others and in
particular on himself would be different ow be ee
ive ad a prettily and draggin time but now im doin grand
he uttered a rough sound of no meaning but she took it to be
congratulatory
i shall be up afore long
up he murmured glancing sideways at the bed
i shall get raby gregor to make me a little trolly so that i can get
about
he pushed his chair farther away  in spite of appearances she was not a
woman but the distorted remnant of one  a shiver ran down his spine
you baint thinkin ofof tryin to get about
me not gettin about  iss  youve never seen me settin down wi me
ands folded
but youll find thingsll be different now he stammered he thought
of the trolly as some sort of wheelchair he had no conception of his
wifes inventiveness or of her indifference to comment  youve been a
strong woman but you cant look to be that again
the resolute look he knew so well came into sabinas eyes and for a
moment he doubted whether after all she would not conquer her
disabilities  i baint strong now she said but a month or twoll
make all the difference  ill soon be up and about again
the momentary doubt passed  i wouldnt make too sure of that then
he told her  the fact that wastralls had not so much flat land as would
make a football field was reassuring  no wheelchair whatever the
power of its directing will could climb up and down those fields
im hopin said sabina obstinately to teel wastralls as i av
before
we must see ow you do frame
baint a matter of gettin about she continued guessing his
thoughts  i know wastralls like the palm of my hand every itch and
stitch of it and the indsll carry out my orders  i can trust old
george biddick to see as the others do their work  ive planned it
all
and me asked leadville grimly
my dear feller you dont like farmin you wouldnt make no and at
it you an your old rigmaroles
i cd teel wastralls so as it brought in double what you get now
she shook her head  you baint goin to try
it was as well for her peace of mind that eyes cannot speak  that this
mutilated trunk of a woman should still be in a position to withstand
him  his great chest heaved with bitter emotion but he did not answer
come said sabina peaceably  tell me how things is going
he stared out of the window until he had mastered himself sufficiently
to speak  i came to ask mun for what you aw liddicoat
aw liddicoat  a smiling light came into her eyes  how much do i
awn
couldnt tell ee for a pound or two but if you was to draw out a
cheque for me i could fulln soon as i get ome
you send me in the bill and ill payn after ive checkedn
byrons face darkened  he would not be able to hide from her much
longer the changes he had attempted what did it matter  she could only
be angry  he thought he would be glad if she were  theres the mens
moneythree weeks awin
i given isolda yesterday  i expect shes paidn by now
you ought to ave give it to me and i could av paidn
so i should av she answered peaceably if youd been in to see me
but i give it to isolda instead
he was not to be placated  looks mighty queer you dont trust me with
the money  ive to keep the place goin and if i dont pay the inds
whos to know im maister
theres no need for you baint maister  you may blate morning till
night you wont av wastralls no never for come to that i dont
trust ee
sbina
she held up her hand  you do take too much on your own ead
he knew then that the tale of his imprudent labours had run before him
and that she was expressing her disapproval  she was not angry with
him a mother is not angry when she sequestrates a forbidden toy  i
always thought he stammered making no further mystery of the matter
that we should grow sugarbeet
an you was welcome to try itat polnevas  now come it baint too
late to put the lil medder in dredgecorn  youd better see tot at
once or ill av tom dot
he cried out at that last humiliation and it was still the same cry the
cry his wife thought so unreasonable youd put tom rosevear over me
youd take away what belong to me
long to you  i should like to know ow it come yours
you give it me you give it me when we married
never
in his disappointment and rage he stumbled over his words  youll see
youll see  iss youll see whether i wont av it or no
tis mazedness of ee to think so she answered come be sensible
ill pay for these old fads of yours and you can pilen away where you
mind to  ill pay this once but twas a fulish game for ee to play
and maybe youll see that before youm done
                             chapter iii
near st cadic mill at the head of the valley a hamlet had gathered a
few deepset cottages built of cliff stone and planted irregularly about
a smithy  sheltered by a rise in the land from sea winds their gardens
were rich with produce  a green broadened from their little gates and
in the wall of the smithy had been set a scarlet postbox a flaring
touch of the official in a land sufficient unto itself
in these houses which were known far and wide as cottages dwelt a
cobbler who was also the barber of the community mrs bate the
stripper her friend aunt louisa blewett the seamstress one or two
independent labourers and an old sailor  here too was the dolphin
where could be obtained a little muddy cider and some homebrewed also
the village shop the selfrespecting and thrifty community was like a
family which having grown up and married had continued to live in a
group separated only by the walls of their homes and gardens  ties
acknowledged and unacknowledged linked them linked them also with the
farmer folk and as all respected the axiom that you must not step on
a cornishmans tail the hamlet was to the outward eye an abode of
peace
mrs byrons accident had caught the imagination of her humble
neighbours  for years they had watched her riding about a wholesome
hearty woman with a ripe cheek and a commanding eye  not one of them
but had had experience of her vigour and capacity she was now reduced
to a helplessness greater than that of child or dotard and to her
helplessness was added the mystery of mutilation
during the long light weeks the cottagers sat at their doors of an
evening and while charley brenton trimmed hair in the front garden
discussed the inopportune event
i was almost sure there was ill luck comin said mrs bate the woman
who was stripper or nurse for the hamlet that is to say who laid out
the dead
the man upon whom the barber was operating was a brenton from the
neighbouring valley of polscore the gossip was new to him
ow dyer think so he asked
i blieve she was illwished  never mind ow i think so you wait an
see  my belief theres they av got an evil eye on er
aunt louisa blewett looked up from her sewing  she was a peculiarly
neat and clean old woman who spent her time going from one house to
another mending and making for the long families  she did not speak
but her toothless mouth worked as if over a choice morsel
i thought the witches were all gone years ago remarked the stranger
brenton
well there is witches only they dont come out in their true colour
asserted mrs bate whose mother was said to have been the last in
tregols
besides urged old hawken the sailor who was sitting on a stone
awaiting his turn at charley brentons hands whos goin to do mrs
byron any arm  a nicer woman never lived  shes noted for er
kindness at christmas time or any other time
iss iss we knaw shes well liked said mrs bate noncommittally
unlike aunt louisa she had still an occasional milestone of tooth  the
old women were handsome now and what must they have been when they were
the village belles  still i blieve theres one that bear er a
grudge  i dont mention any names but you can think oo you like
go along you dont think as ed do er a mischief do yer
hush
for some time the sound of approaching hoofs had been carried to them on
the still air of the evening and the voices died into silence as
leadville byron on his black stallion clattered by  the animal was as
usual flecked with foam the master stained with the mud of the road
returning from his humiliating interview with sabina he had found in
the hard gallop up hill and down an outlet for his rage and
disappointment  what did he care if he lamed the horse  whirling
through the hamlet he noticed the curious cottagers no more than the
birds in the hedges
ow e do ride said old hawken as the furious figure melted into the
growing dusk and only the beat of the hoofs reached the listeners a
beat which in turn was merged in the distant sound of the tide  one of
these days ell break is neck
tis like es tearin away from something said aunt louisa suddenly
do ee think said mrs bate lowering her voice do ee think th
old squire knaw whats happenin above ground
if e do said hawken e must find it terrble ard for that feller
to be in is place
and alterin things said aunt louisa
old squire said mrs bate mysteriously can look afters own  you
mark my words thiccy feller ont av all is own way
willie brenton took the towel from his neck and handed it to the sailor
your turn mr awken
the old man got up painfully  my feets terrble knucklin today and
my poor laigs is stiff with the rheumatism but still theym bettern no
laigs  i wonder ow poor mrs byronll manage
this was a matter of interest to the cottagers  they supposed that for
the cooking and cleaning mrs byron would employ one of themselves
mrs bate who had not been married had yet grandchildren old enough to
go out to service
weve all worked there in an out she said but now the poor
thingll av to av some one there altogether shell be so helpless as
a baby
i bet she wont said aunt louisa folding together a patched garment
and preparing to go indoors for the night  mrs byronll frighten us
all yet for what she can do
i reckon she ont av the eaft to go about the work as she used to
my mind tell me shes done for said hawken
aunt louisa nodded her trim grey head in the direction of church town
not till shes laid alongside the old squire she said and going in
shut her door with the precision of touch characteristic of her every
movement
at wastralls the following morning byron went as usual into the yard
two breeding sows black as a caves mouth were wandering about and on
a heap of straw in the sun lay an old sheepdog  the dog wagged its
tail but unfortunately did not rise and the mans sore heart
registered its laziness as an affront
sheps gone past for work he said to george biddick who was standing
by waiting for orders
iss i blieve e is  gettin blind
better givem a dose  you come to me at twelve and ill av it ready
for ee  he cast a vindictive look at the old dog  and biddick
iss sir
ive changed my mind about the lil medder  im afraid tis too late
for sugarbeet this year ill av it teeled in dredgecorn
he went back to the kitchen a roomy whitewashed place the rafters of
which were dark above the blue flagstones stones which had been worn
smooth by feet trampling for a little to and fro then going as they
had come  in a wallcupboard to the right of the slabrange the farmer
kept such matters as ammunition packets of seed medicaments for the
stock  crossing the kitchen with a step which was light for so
largeframed a man he stood for a moment contemplating the medley of
articlesbluestone cattlesalts turpentine oakmarbles which had been
through the coffee grinder bottles of red drinkwhich confronted him
by the last named stood a small blue bottle with an orange label  he
had bought it some time ago he had used it on old and useless animals
he would pour out a little now and give it to biddick for the sheepdog
but the rest he would put by again  he felt that to rid the place of
shep would be a satisfaction  if only other things which stood in his
way which refused to recognize his authority could be got rid of as
easily
sabinas interview with her husband had made her realize how necessary
she was to him  she thought of him as a foolish child who the moment
it was left to its own devices got into mischief  the conviction that
she stood between leadville and disaster was soothing it increased her
wish to live and was as good as a tonic not that tonics were necessary
for once she had turned the first difficult corner she made good
progress and when raby gregor came to discuss with her the trolly she
had designed he was agreeably surprised to find her as cheerful as of
old
this trolly was for long the wonder of those who saw it  on a
threewheeled stand a cone of cushioned basketwork itself
strengthened by iron stays had been set upright  into this wicker
receptacle sabina who had strong arms presently learnt to swing
herself and once in place the cushions supported her in comfort the
front wheel of the trolly had a guiding handle and she was thus enabled
as long as the ground was flat to go where she would
i want to be on a level with other people she said so dont make
the stand too low  i cant bear to be down av to look up to everybody
as im speaking tom
the little contrivance when finished proved admirably suited to her
needs  the nurses proud of her as a case helped her over the first
difficulties and as the figure she cut did not trouble her she soon
learnt to swing herself in and out  before long she was able to steer
herself about the ward and mrs tom coming in one afternoon with eggs
for the patients and saffron cake for the nurses tea found her pushing
herself about as contentedly as a child
i shall be comin ome next week she said happily so leadville can
send in the cart for me
i shall be pretty and glad for ee to come ome again but why must e
send the old cart
why to bring this ome in  she put her hands to the sides of the
trolly and sat erect a smiling cheerful woman  her face though pale
from the long confinement had lost its lines was indeed showing a
tendency to overfullness and she looked older but she was herself
again  if i didnt i should av to lie down an i dont want to do
that  i want to sit up and see all there is to be seen  besides i want
for the people to see im able to get about again if i be a cripple
mrs tom perceived that sabina meant to celebrate her recovery by a
triumphal return  well my dear ill tell leadville to send in the
cart for ee
this ere thing do run so smooth as a die said sabina returning to
her happy absorption in the trolly youd never believe ow easy i can
get about in it and she began with her strong illnesswhitened
hands to turn the wheels
will it go uphill said the other after observing with interest the
paces of this new steed
sabinas face fell  lorrd bless me i never thought o that
owever will you manage  only the shelf on which wastrallshouse
yard and gardenstood was flat
i  sabina hesitated  the brightness had died cut of her face  i
dont know if leadville will carry out my wishes or no
well you can ardly expect un to
i dunt see why e shouldnt  tis my land why shouldnt e do as i
want forn to do
cos es so obstinate in is way as you are in yours
my dear life i baint obstinate  ow can ee say so  i only do same
as my father and granfer did im sure they wouldnt like for me to
alter it
no i dont spose they would said mrs tom still
sabina was troubled but not on account of isoldas mistaken view of her
character  that she had already forgotten  well ive got th old
george biddick im sure ell do what i want forn to do if leadville
wont
still that isnt like seein for yerself
i shall av to take the chance of that but she did not seem happy
about it  she mused with knit brow for some seconds then changed the
subject  isolda id like for mrs bate to put my bed up in the big
room
thisthe old justice roomoccupied one end of the house  for many years
it had been used as a storeroom but underneath dust and litter lay
evidence in painted panelling and marble mantelpiece of former state
tis a proper old lumbershop said mrs tom but that doesnt
matter
you see explained sabina i cant go overstairs
i wonder ow leadvillell like sleepin on the ground floor
well he must like it or lump it  she spoke with the confidence of
one whose marriage had been a success well get the room to rights for
yer
and isolda i dont want to keep on mrs bate nor i dont want her
jenifer nor her janey
owll ee manage then
i want some one of my own flesh and blood  i should love to av one of
your lil maids  why couldnt i av gray  weve always greed like
chickens
well i dont know im sure  mrs tom had been expecting this she
had even schemed for it  she had five daughters pretty maidens all of
them and gray was the eldest  what more suitable than that she should
fill a daughters place at wastralls  nevertheless it would not be wise
to jump at the offer  shes young to go from ome
wastralls is only next door and shell be all right with me
an as youve none of yer own agreed mrs tom grays the nearest
whatever sabinas intentions however she would not promise to make the
girl her heir  twill be for the maids good she said vaguely
ill see what tom got to say about it  gray was eighteen and with
richbell coming on could well be spared  no doubt mrs constantine
rosevear would think wastralls ought eventually to go to one of her
sons but in this world a hen scratched up what she could for her own
chicks
gray think more bout ome than richbell sabina said thoughtfully
shes not after the chaps so much
the mothers pride was touched  whenever she go up round the parish
theres always three or four pairs of eyes lookin at gray  she can
always av a chap if she like but she dont trouble whether she do or
no
is there any special young man do ee think
well now i dont care to say
sabinas curiosity was aroused  now isolda theres somethin gone on
since i come in ere  who is it
mrs rosevear had spent some of the happiest hours of her life
discussing her children with this trusty friend no stranger she said
smilingly
who then
one of your inds
the other opened her eyes  my dear life didnt she ought to be
lookin for some one better off
she dont think anything of money
they dont at that age we got to do that form who is it then
why jim rosevear the yardman
mrs byron knitted her brows in an endeavour to recall the young mans
face  jim rosevear  he come just before my accident  i cant think

                              chapter iv
a few days spent in trundling herself about the ward and mrs byron
was ready for the long journey over big hill and down to the sea
leadville who saw in her return the extinction of his last hope had
not the heart to come for her
pretty pickle i should look he said to mrs tom drivin missus ome
sittin up in that trolly showin erself off like that  better fit
she should av mr brentons covered cart and cover erself up  any
oned think shed want to ide er affliction

going  shell be quite proud for people to see er goin about with
er poor old stumps leavin out er laigs you knaw shes as strong as
ever
when he frowned byrons black brows came together in an ominous line
strong as ever he said thats different from what dr derek told
me  he give me no encouragement as shell make old bones
i wouldnt give much for that then  shell be like a barley weed
always dyin and never dead  she had been cleaning the house in
readiness for mrs byrons return and now her labours ended was
drinking a cup of tea with the master of it  they old rosevears was
longlivin and they do say shes more like old squire than either tom
or constantine be  oo be ee gwine send in for er
jim can go in for er there is two or three things wanted into
shoppethis was another hamlet in the widespread parishand e can
bring em ome
im sorry you baint goin  youre the one ought to fetch er
ive got a very poor eart for that sort of thing and thisll be worse
than hobbyhorse goin to traytor
iss nodded mrs tom  i bet everybodyll turn out to give sbina a
welcome ome  after all your ways baint like our ways
leadville could not let that pass  i might a bin born down east o
truro still i cant tell you whether i was or no  but i feel in my
bones an veins that im no foreigner  couldnt fancy this place as i
do if it wadnt so
tis your misfortune said mrs tom taking her cloak from the
doorpeg as you fancy it so  if you was one of we youd act
different
mrs byron had a bright day for her journey a day with but one cloud
the staff of the hospital had gathered to see her start and when on her
trolly and followed by her luggage and a certain long wooden box oddly
suggestive of a shortened coffin she rolled herself down the hall and
into the roadway they broke into a cheer the gallant bearing of this
mutilated creature had drawn from them an emotional response  the
beauty of it the poignancy touched them  men pressed forward to offer
their help and tears stood in the eyes of the women that was the
spirit this elemental courage this defiance of unhappy fate  yes
sabina was indeed true descendant of old squirehe to whom men for so
long had given their respect
in the road drawn up and waiting stood the farm wagon  jim rosevear
with a proper sense of the ceremonial nature of the occasion had
plaited the horses manes and tails with coloured worsteds  the brass
harness twinkled in the sun and the carthorses had been groomed until
their coats were nearly as bright sabina occupied with her trolly
which was showing a tendency to turn a little to the left was not
immediately aware that the driver was not her husband  not indeed until
the trolly had been lifted to its place on the floor of the wagon and
secured by ropes was she at liberty to look about
when she saw who was come for her she leaned forward in the cone
wheres the maister to she asked
jim who was getting ready to start looked over his shoulder  hes
gone fishin
fishin  she had thought he might have gone on business down one of
the many crooked streets of the little town business from which he
would return in time to drive her home
fishin for bass on the head
whatever tookn in the ead to do that today she said and dwelt for
a moment on the incomprehensible nature of man  strange that leadville
should not want to share her triumph the triumph of the woman who
belonged to him who was flesh of his flesh to share this triumph which
was in part his  she had been in excellent spirits but his absence
dashed them  it required the manifested goodwill of the people in the
streets to restore her equanimity
in spite of this drawback however her progress was in its way royal
throned in the wagon she passed slowly along the main road  placed thus
high and with trunk and head emerging from the wicker cone like an
amazing flower she was undoubtedly a queer figure but the people who
came running up the lanes and out of the houses along the route to give
her the blessing of their good wishes missed the queerness  they had
known her all the forty years of her life  she was part of the setting
in which they played their humble parts  a little prejudiced in her
favour through long association this display of primitive courage moved
them  they welcomed it as in keeping with the family tradition as
something worthy and they offered it the kind encouragement of hearty
handshakes and good words
i be pretty an glad to see yer come ome again maam  terrible
terrible accident you must av ad still you dont seem to make much
oft  mary elizabeths brought ee a few lilies
that trolly be a clever thought of yours mrs byron i never see
nothing like it before
i reckon youve ad a draggin time maam  wem all glad to av ee
back again
do ee take and drink up this cup of milk and eat a bit of yeller cake
or eell be faintin before ee come to trevorrick said a farmers
wife
if eed like a glass of wine now youve only to say the word and you
can av it interposed the landlord of the dolphin id be proud to
serve ee
i be come ome said sabina to her charioteer as they jogged on and
her voice had a contented ring she had forgotten the disappointment of
leadvilles absence  she was come back to her own people and her own
place and she was welcome
the young man lifted a smiling face and she remembered that this was the
pretty boy who was courting her niece  she looked at him with
interest  he was certainly goodlooking definitely so a tall slim
youth with a fine profile deeplyset darkblue eyes black hair and a
small tawny moustache  she wondered how the courtship was progressing
gray with cloudy hair about a windflower face would make a charming
bride sabinas thoughts ran nimbly forward  she saw the young couple
housed at wastralls rosevear working the farm under her direction and
the old cradle once more in use  the prospect promised her an autumn
happiness  wonderful indeed the way in which the wind is tempered to
the shorn
when the farm cart turned off the highway by st cadic mill sabina
found constantine rosevear and his wife waiting by the roadside  the
big florid man though he had wife and three grown sons had never been
able to forget that sabina was the woman he should have married  his
betsey was all right but about sabina lingered the glamour of romance
i been in terrible fear he told her simply and im avin holiday
today  if you dont mind ill walk down to wastralls with you  you
dont know ow glad i be to see ye ome again and lookin so well too
sabinas heart beat irregularly for a moment  if only leadville would
talk to her like this  she comforted herself with the thought that his
being undemonstrative did not mean he was unfeeling  words did not come
easily to him but still waters run deep
the cottagers about the smithy threw more flowers into the cart  might
be may day as sabina said with her happy smile  at hember tom
rosevear was waiting with four of his daughters  mothers down to
wastralls wi gray he said and the blooming girls the socalled
nieces raised their young voices in affectionate greeting  aunt
sbina had been the fairy godmother of the family always willing to
abet them in any piece of innocent fun  they were sincerely glad to
have her back
the drive had been long for one just out of hospital but the kindliness
of friends and neighbours had proved a stimulant  when the wagon turned
into the yard of wastralls however sabina was almost too tired to note
the changes that had been made  the absence of the honeysuckle caused
the porch to look bare the old sheepdog was no longer lying in the sun
but leadville had come back from the fishing and was ready to lift her
down  at sight of him the tired face brightened  im glad to come
ome again she said
the man had been standing idly by the door  having drawn nothing out of
the sea he had come back in a mood which was not uninfluenced by his
lack of success everything had gone wrong his hopes were dashed his
plans had miscarried and he searched the landscape in vain for any hope
of change  sabina was well again she had already asserted her will
with regard to the farm and before him lay a future as dreary as the
past
he lifted his eyes as the beflowered cortge rolled into the yard  he
had expected a sort of chair and the trolly with its basketwork cone
was an unpleasant surprise while the sight of his wife in brightly
coloured gown and pink sunbonnet swelling out of it like a monstrous
fruit completed his dismay  she was a figure of fun a queer oddity
repellent as something out of nature  the bravery that faced the
sunshine as simply as in the days of its strength did not appeal to him
he was only conscious of the deformity  his heart contracted emptied
itself of goodwill then slowly filled againbut not with kindliness
the business of unloading occupied the men for some minutes and mrs
rosevear taking the parcels handed them to her daughter
what a lovely lot o flowers  i should think every garden for miles
round will be bare
take care o that box cried sabina suddenly as they lifted out the
case that was suggestive of a coffin i value that
where be ee gwine put it auntie
in the cupboard in the big parlour
what av ee got in it
ah my dear ask me no questions and i tell ee no lies
ere ill take that said mrs tom intervening i know where it got
to be put  tis what you told me of sbina
mrs byron nodded  iss ive brought it back wi me  doctor said i
was maze to do it but i said i would an i av
a meal was ready on the kitchen table a piece of stout wood which had
weathered the use and elbowgrease of more than a century  this room
had been for three generations the gatheringplace of the family
innumerable savoury meals had been cooked on the slab range hams in a
succession longer than that of the kings of england had been lifted from
the rafter hooks and after the buffetings of winter and the scorch of
summer men had taken their ease on the bench while women made and
mended  old tales had been told and retold by deep voices tales of
witches of wreckers of people piskyledn and the sound of them
lingered in the dim corners  they were waiting for the new generation
which should utter once more the familiar words and keep alive the
traditions
i never thought i should ever be back ere any more said sabina
contentedly as she ran her trolly up to the table and by a contrivance
similar to that on a dentists chair reduced her height to a sitting
level it do seem good to be ome  everything look so natural
well twould be funny if it didnt said mrs rosevear helping the
meat
dont seem as if id been all that time away
i expect it do to leadville
his wife turned to him  what do ee think of my invention
i cant abide it said the man with the emphasis of sincere feeling
the others looked at him in surprise  ill always be thinking of what
you was he added hastily
sabinas face clouded but only for a moment  lets make the best of
things she said  im goin to forget about them times im goin to
live for the moment
im not one as forgets said leadville heavily
revived by food and rest sabina was soon impatient to begin a further
progress  she trundled herself into the linhay to inspect the milk and
butter then into the two seldomused rooms known as the big and little
parlour  beyond them lay the wide shallow stairs the door into the
front part of the house and the long justice room
mrs tom threw open the door of this and sabina pushing the trolly in
uttered an exclamation of pleasure the litter of agricultural
implements broken harness bags and boxes had been cleared away the
grates had been blacked and the panelled wall painted a shadowy grey
between the two fireplaces stood a large bed the posts of which were
carved with corn fruit and other emblems of fertility  on it lay a
patchwork quilt the work of sabinas grandmother  driftwood fires
flamed under the white marble mantelpieces and the coverlet shone with
the glistening silks of other days  the spacious room with its
whitehung bed and its white curtains smelt of the sea and sabina
turned and smiled at her husband
av you moved your clothes down she asked
not that i know of
well you better make aste an dot
looking past her into the beautiful room he thought dimly that it was
too large  i shent like it down ere he said and something ancestral
moved in him assuring him that the upper parts of a house the upper
branches were secure from the marauding enemy the terror by night
never sleeped on the groundfloor
laying a hand affectionately on his shoulder the woman looked into his
face with a touch of softening and appeal surely he would not leave her
to sleep there alone
to the man this light touch was illuminating  oh leaven go he
muttered
in the bedroom gray rosevear was moving deftly to and fro unpacking
sabinas clothes and laying them in the drawers of the tallboy  the
mans eyes followed her light figure at first unconsciously but before
long with a strange quickening of emotion  if it had been this girl who
was asking him he would have given up his eyrie with an eager
willingness  he did not understand himself  what was gray to him
his wifes voice when she spoke again seemed a whisper from far away
i cant go overstairs she said pleadingly
byron turned his eyes deliberately from grays wildflower grace to the
thick shortened figure in the trolly and his incipient repugnance grew
sleep with this deformity  he could not bring himself to it  to live
in the same house with her would be difficult at least he would shut
her out of his nights  already he knew instinctively what those nights
moonsilvered starset nights not of bitter brooding but of dreams
would be to him
i cant sleep ere
sabina sighed  the people had given her the froth of sweet words but
this was reality  well my dear i cant elp it she said
resignedly  i cant do much nowadays
ah now if eed only reckernize that
the touch of opposition was a spur  still theres a lot as i can do
this trolly now ll elp me a lot
he eyed it with distaste  oogly thing cant think why ee do want to
be runnin round like a toad on a redot shovel  seein ow you be
twould be more to your credit if you was to die down and be quiet
stead o goin about on an old thing like that  youll be the
laughingstock of the parish
nothin ud get done
oh fiddlesticks ow wont the things be done cant i dot for yer
for the moment gray was forgotten and he was back at the old gnawing
bitterness
whiles my eads above ground ill look after the place myself said
sabina who being tired was a little captious  she was disappointed
that her welcome home had been so commonplace  she had expected she
knew not what but something culminating
a pretty mess eell make of it muttered leadville and turning
about walked off with himself  when he and sabina differed which was
not oftentheir differences being fundamental trifles took the
subsidiary place so seldom granted themhe invariably ended the
discussion by going out of the house  with all the open from which to
choose it was easy for him to get away from a womans tiresomeness to
get back to his own quiet company and his thoughts
sabina looked after the husband whom she had long ago decided was
difficult but probably not more so than other men and her heart sank
she had so wanted leadville to rejoice with her over her recovery to be
proud of her  though she carried herself gallantly there were periods
when her poor heart acknowledged a weakness a lowness  she had longed
sometimes to stay it on a greater strength
wheres gray goin to sleep asked mrs rosevear who standing quietly
in the background had been a shrewd spectator
gray said she and a feeling seldom hitherto experienced awoke in
her  if she had been as young as gray softeyed as she would it have
made a difference
twill be a bit lonely for er upstairs said the mother thoughtfully
though of course leadvillell be near
but it was envy not jealousy that had been awakened in mrs byron
let her come in wi me  well av a little bed put up theres plenty
of room for er
when leadville came back and he must in time grow accustomed to the
idea of sleeping on the groundfloor a fresh arrangement could be made
meanwhile the maid would be company  sabina felt that the place was
peopled with the judges and judged of long ago and to her celtic mind
the shadows moved  in the dark hours it would be comforting to hear the
movements the breathing of some one still this side the grave
from an upper chamber they brought the small bedstead which when mrs
byron was a girl had been hers also a chest of drawers
wheres your trade to asked the mother
jims bringin it down  i believe hes out in the kitchen now  ill
go and see
as she went from the room mrs rosevear sank into the nearest chair
im glad youm back sbina  i bin so whisht without ee  not a soul
to speak to besides tom and you cant tell a man very much
no they dont understand  her thoughts wandered for a moment
leadville had been strange in his manner but of course it was only that
he did not understand
now youve seen jim continued mrs rosevear what do you think of
him
sabina roused herself  i call ee a proper chap she said smilingly
lovely curly air he as
yes confided the mother and grays as maze as a rattle about im
mrs toms confidences made sabina feel as if she had a share in the
others happy motherhood  they sat gossiping until the shadows began to
fill the valley jim was a long time on his way with grays boxbut to
every man and woman their hour
leadville on leaving the house had turned his face towards the cliff
beyond its dark wall was space and light  he took the little path that
led over the head passed the deep curves of what in prehistoric times
had been the earthworks of a stockaded hold and came out upon a broad
shelf of rock  the tide was in large green waves were rolling with a
break like gunfire into the caves below and facing him was one of
the strange sunsets often seen on that coast  the western sky was
scarlet and across the light was a trail of black clouds
a red sky at night is the shepherds delight muttered the man
flinging himself down above the booming uproar of the water  below the
shags were nesting on inaccessible ledges and a solitary seal was diving
through the crests of the green rollers  byron felt unusually
inexplicably cheerful  the glories of the sunset were in keeping with
his mood a mood as he realized of the incoming tide  on his shelf of
rock he lay in a happy dream  hitherto he had loved nothing but a few
acres of land he had hungered after fields and rocks had dragged out a
dark existence of craving and disappointment now his tormented spirit
was at peace  the wide expanse of heaven changed from scarlet to
poppyred the raven clouds grew more numerous and leadville looked on
with happy eyes  in his breast was a ferment like the unresting
ferment of the sea but neither cold nor lifeless  a wind was blowing
steadily from the west but he did not feel it for he was warm  his
spirit with its capacity for intense feeling had crossed a boundary
line beyond which was neither heat nor cold hunger nor thirst  he had
loved wastralls now he was in the power of a force stronger than that
love of a force the strongest in the world
                               the book
                               chapter v
mrs byron wheeling her trolly through the houses and courts of
wastralls along the garden paths and down the neglected drive found
that her creation had a feeling for rises in the ground that was almost
uncanny thus far shalt thou go said the trolly and jim rosevear
spent many a halfhour levelling surfaces which mrs byron had hitherto
believed to be as flat as the yard pond  on the whole she got about as
much as she had expected to and far more than her husband or even the
hinds had believed possible
the latter had served her well partly because she being a good master
it was difficult for them to do otherwise but also because being
raised above them a woman and unfamiliar she was in some dim way that
golden helen of all male dreams  for her part she understood them as
she understood the animals on the farm their idiosyncrasies their
capacity  she worked them as she worked her horses as kindly with as
much consideration but without feeling that they were nearer to her in
the scale of creation
on her return to wastralls she found that her long absence and
leadvilles slack rule hard work one day off shooting the next had
demoralized the little band they gave their employer a hearty welcome
vicariously proud of one who though desperately injured had refused
to give up the struggle which is life but it soon became evident that
they believed her accident and subsequent mutilation had changed her
into something weak and strange  her orders were questioned
unconsciously the men were testing the power that for so long had kept
them subservient
george said she to biddick one bright june morning youd better
cut that ay in cross parks today
i think i should leave it a day or two longer missis i blieve were
goin to av some rain returned the old fellow who at the moment had
a job more to his liking
sabinas voice rang out  never mind about that you get the men and
av it done at once  itll be done before the rain come then
she had a sense of weather so keen that she had been known to predict it
for months even seasons ahead and biddick looked at her uneasily
when some days later he came for his weeks money she spoke to him
sharply
if youm too old for yer work better jack it up and ill hire a
younger man
i thought missis as we was in for a lot of rain
im missis and ill av things done my way
as she once said dont meet fear halfway go all the way and youll
crush un in the egg
but although sabina asserted herself with promptitude and decision it
was not in the old effortless way  her health was far from
satisfactory  she held her own reduced her team to an obedience which
for them was happiness but paid for her victory in restless nights in
pain and weariness  she thought sometimes that it would be impossible
for her to carry on
i do ache so bad she told her faithful crony that i feel i shall
av to give up and be a bedlier
my dear life said mrs tom pursuing her old tactics tis just what
leadvilled like for ee to be
dyer think e would
iss im sure e would ed wait on yer and and foot
i should like to see un then
i cant fancy you being a bedlier said mrs tom comfortably  did
gray tell ee theres a piece of hedge down in the lil medder
no she didnt  sabina was interested  an i thinking to av the
sheep turned into the lower field ill send jim down this afternoon to
mendn  es a good boy
farmers son and got farmin ins veins
i like to see the way he wait on gray  i should be glad form to live
ere after theym married  the way hes goin hell do fine  biddicks
gettin old and jim shall be foreman and teel wastralls for me  he got
an eye for the stock and hes a goodworking lil feller oh iss grays
a lucky maid
mrs tom did not think the suggested arrangement would prove
satisfactory but the young couple were not yet married were not even
engaged and if sabina could not see what was going on it was not for
others to point it out to her
jimll be agreeable she said noncommittally tis all the same to
him whether he go to his auntie at gentle jane or whether he stay ere
all e think about is gray  ah my dear i should like for ee to get
as far as hember and see they two sittin together wi us tis so good
as a picture
sabina nodded  leadville was only sayin yesterday he never seen a
maid so fond of er ome as gray  soon ever er works done shes off
ome like a bird
i ope she dont leave ee too much by yerself
no no my dear if shed been my own daughter she couldnt do more for
me and she sighed feeling that if gray had been the child whose place
she filled leadville would have been able to rest his heart content
she could see that the pseudorelationship in which the young girl stood
to him was unsatisfactory and she understood though too vaguely to put
it into words that for people to share a home they should be bound by
blood or sex
well i must do so well as i can she added reverting to the main
topic of their wandering talk  tis live from day to day and though i
dont feel very special i must be surely stronger than i was
iss said mrs tom encouragingly i can see as each month make a
difference to ee
sabina might talk of becoming a bedlier but only the slightest spur
was required to nerve her to fresh effort and by living as she had
said from day to day and leaning on the young strength of gray she won
through the summer  indeed the glooms of autumn were brightened for her
by the conviction that she would live usefully and might live long
leadville on the other hand saw his last hope fading  dr derek had
declared that she could not stand the shock to her system that if she
survived it would be as an invalid sabina however had the will to live
and the trollya contrivance which leadville both detested and
contemnedcarried her from kitchen to linhay and from barn to byre  her
husband looked on with growing exasperation opposing to her goodwill a
sulky silence at mealtimes he sat with eyes fixed on his plate or
lifted them for a quick glance at gray  when he went out he took his
gun the gun that hung on thongs over the kitchen door and which as he
had inherited it from old leadville byron was the one possession he did
not owe his wife  when he came back it was to sit in old squires big
chair and spend his time cleaning and oiling it  whither he went
sabina did not know  she sighed over his withdrawal of himself his
dull hostility but did not lose heart  in the end leadville seeing
that the struggle was hopeless must return to her  what else could he
do  he too was middleaged and except for her was alone in the world
although mrs byron felt sure of the ultimate issue she had not missed
the import of those quick glances when leadville she and gray sat at
table together  he would answer when the girl spoke and if she were
likely to be making butter or plucking chickens would hang about and
offer his help  when he brought in fish or birds it was to gray that he
took them and in the evening laying the gun across his knees he would
lean forward and stare at her  the wife looked on not indulgently but
with her usual robust common sense  middleaged men were often
transiently attracted by young relativesnieces or cousinsbut the girls
went to homes of their own the old fellows forgot and no harm was done
in a bettermanaged world the generations would be sharply defined and
each would be sufficient unto itself  sabina could not wonder that
leadville should prefer the delicacy of tint the soft dewy eyes of the
maid to her own stale and faded charms  she looked at herself in the
glass at her white hair the loose skin of her neck the fixed colour
in her cheeks  she had been handsome and she had not cared  now that
wrinkles had come about her eyes she thought longingly of the pale
smooth lids between which she had so contentedly surveyed her world
the mood the regret were new to her an outcome of her illness and she
returned before long to the old comfortable indifference  if she were
in the forties so was leadville  his figure was heavy his face lined
and weatherbeaten  gray comparing him with jim rosevear could not fail
to mark the contrast
aunt sbina you been in the house all day the girl said one evening
as they sat at tea
well my dear returned mrs byron easily ive been busy i had the
baking to do and this afternoon ive cleaned out the rubbish your mammy
put in the staircupboard and after thatshe smiled and looked
hopefully at her husbandi mended yer uncles socks
leadville who was cutting himself a slice of ham threw the knife into
the dish with a clatter  why did she meddle with his clothes  hed
rather wear them all holes than have her mend them  your uncle too
he wasnt grays uncle he wasnt even her cousin no butand he
drifted out upon the wave that was for ever lapping about his feet
do you think you can spare me  i should like to go home after tea
pursued the girl
iss my dear i can spare yer
why cant you come too aunt sbina
me go up that hill  why you know trolly wont take the least rise in
the ground
well ill push behind
dont believe youm strong enough
why not uncle leadville push it then
byron returned from his dream to sweep a lowering glance over the little
platform of shivered wood  id like to see myself pushin that thing
twould do aunt sabina good to have a craik with mammy
as this was to him a matter of indifference he made no answer and gray
turned to mrs byron  anyhow auntie youll come as far as the gate
with me wont you
why of course i will  i did last night and the night before didnt
i said the other innocently from the yard gate the road was in sight
as far as hember
yes and i like for you to be there  its company till i get home
ill give you my company said leadville abruptly without you askin
me fort
gray turned a face from which all expression had been banished on the
speaker  i think you better stay with aunt sbina
oh she dont want me he answered a touch of pleading in his manner
iss leadville said the wife tranquilly im glad for ee to stay in
wi me  let the young ones go they dont want we old uns followin of
them up  weve ad our day
the man turned on her quickly  me old he cried with manifest
irritation  ill tell yer about old  i baint old
youm in yer prime but that seem old to a young maid
do i seem old to you gray demanded he and his eyes were both
pleading and threatening eyes so hungry that the girl had some ado to
give him an unmoved reply  not that she felt any sympathy with him in
what she looked on as a tiresome aberration but that under the quiet
surface she was a little stirred and a little afraid  youm older than
dad she said at last
im ten times the man your father is  he stretched his arms and
expanded his deep chest  he was desperately anxious to prove to her his
unabated virility while she timid and on the threshold of awakening
sensation would have avoided the thought of it  his strength present
with her and always desirous was a subtle menace to the young
happiness which her bosom shrined there isnt a feller for miles round
can wrestle me or box me  you know i can carry four hundredweight on my
shoulders where other chaps take two  i haint old
the girl moved by her longing to escape had risen and drawn nearer to
her aunt  here was at least protection protection from all but that
dim admission of her own heart that leadville byron was indeed all he
claimed to be and more  for he was not only strong he was persistent
he was forcible  dont make no difference to me she said in a voice
she tried to render careless whether youre old or not  and she
spoke the truth  it was not his age that mattered
when she came to wastralls she had been prepared to find leadville
devoted to his wifes interests and deeply thankful she had been spared
to him  by degrees it dawned on her simplicity that his thoughts were
otherwise busy that sabina was a matter of indifference to him or
worse that he was living a dream life of which she gray was the
centre  an unhappy little centre she had had her share of attention
from the young men of the scattered community a little sighing a soft
pursuit a hot word and the end  but leadville was a stranger and his
pursuit was not soft but fierce  he did not sigh but she could not be
in the room with him without feeling that his brawny chest his strong
arms were aching with the longing to lay hold of her  she could not
touch him accidentally without feeling the thrill of his desire  she
was enveloped by his thoughts and she struggled resenting this emotion
which threatened to overwhelm her and the bright prospects of her youth
for gray was in need not of a conflagration but of a little fire upon
the hearth
with the man matters were gradually coming to a head  he had not loved
the old couple who had adopted him he had been only mildly attracted by
his wife but he had in him a fund of passion which through the fallow
years had been growing in concentration and of which the fuse had at
length been lighted  his love for gray was as overwhelming to himself
as it might prove to its object  he had not known what a furnace was
smouldering at the heart of him and when the flame broke forth to
resist was impossible  he did not attempt it  on the contrary he gave
himself up to these new sensations that ran through him wave after
wave like a burning but not scarifying fire  his new passion pushed
wastralls for the time being into the background he could not contain
more than one absorbing emotion he had been the persistent passionate
lover of the land so but with more fever did he love gray  wonderful
as to him were these new feelings he found them almost too poignant
when she entered a room in which he sat his throat went dry he could
hardly speak and the brief contacts of skirt or hand proved unendurably
sweet he turned from these moments of a troubling ecstasy to the
languorous long intervals when she was absent and he recalling her
face could dwell on it and imagine the fulfilling tender fiery
wonderful of his every hope
during the first months that gray was living at wastralls byron spent
much of his time on dark head but in the end he woke to a desire for
more than dreams could give a desire which grew in intensity after the
manner of jack the giantkillers bean  he began to haunt the young
girls steps and her honest attempts to discourage him passed with him
for a sort of tantalizing encouragement  he could not believe that the
object of a feeling so intense could be unresponsive that these
troubling sensations were not mutual and when gray avoided him escaped
from him even when protected by sabina flouted him with a little
angry ruffling he smiled with the conviction that his hour was at hand
steady untiring pursuit is apt to demoralize the victim and while sabina
thought the summer heats had washed the colour out of grays cheek mrs
tom uneasy as a hen when hawks are hovering went to the root of the
matter
do ee like being to wastralls gray she asked that evening when
having left sabina stationed at the yard gate the girl had run up the
road to arrive breathless and panting
oh yes mammy i do dearly love aunt sbina
why was you runnin so just now
gray hesitated  very few girls confide such matters to a mothers ear
experience shall not teach  each generation will make its own mistakes
and gather its handful of treasures and keep its secrets  gray was
however very doubtful and unhappy and having no girl of her own age to
consult she turned to her mother
its uncle leadville  hes always wanting to come with me and i dont
wantn  i dunno she paused
iss said mrs tom quietly
i dunno as jimll be agreeable
my dear why dont you wear the ring that e give you
i dont know i dont like to  ishe smiled anxiously yet with a
glimmering of humouri dont believe uncle leadville would like to see
me wearin a ring
having said so much gray was willing to make further admissions  i
feel afraid of unde leadville hes always after me and his eyes seem to
be watching me as if they was coming out of his sockets  i cant sleep
by night mammy iim always thinking about him and she looked shyly
away unable in this moment of revelation to meet her mothers
understanding eye i dont want to im her voice sank im afraid
tis a shame said mrs tom warmly  she knew how compelling are
strength and intensity but thought it wisest not to let her knowledge
appear  the susceptibilities of young people are easily ruffled
i think its wicked of him mammy  she was righteously indignant that
he should be making life so difficult and auntie is so good to him
iss sighed the matron but mens so they cant help
theirselvespoor old villains  why dont you come ome with me for a
bit and leave richbell go down with your auntie
grays face brightened hopefully then she shook her head  i dont
think aunt sbina would like it
well ill talk to yer auntie about it an tell er what i think
dont you say nothing about what ive told you cried youth anxious
as to the discretion of gossiping middleage
you can trust me and gray looking into the kind shrewd face felt
that she might
you know she see uncle leadvilles tiresome but she dont think he mean
anything
poor sawl no she wouldnt of course bein is wife hell say one
thing to she an another thing to you
gray nodded  that was the way of it
and shell believe what e say
hed tell her i was making a fuss about nothing yes he would
theres jim comin up the road said mrs tom who was sitting by the
window i wonder e and leadville get on
they dont see but very little of each other  if i was to be with jim
when uncle leadville come i believe theyd fight and the fear of that
keeps me on pins and needles when im with jim  its all horrid
well dearie ill see what i can do with yer auntie twould be better
if you could say as you was engaged to jim but i suppose you cant
i darent mammy  her large eyes softly black filled with tears
courtingtime is april weather but gray felt that more showers than
sunshine were falling to her share  im frightened of uncle leadville
and his old gun  we often say well do things but we dont after all i
got an idea he would
mrs tom took from behind the door a purple knitted bonnet and a cloak
the evenings were dark and the wind from the sea cold  she did not stay
to take off her apron but went as she was in her dark gown and with her
kind face bright between the flaps of the woollen bonnet
sabina lonely because the husband who should have been sitting
opposite to her at the end of the day was gone out gave her a warmer
greeting than was her wont she was tired and the peace and
goodfellowship to which she was looking forward seemed long in coming
she also would be glad of a chat
                              chapter vi
sheve a whisht eart poor gray as said the mother in deprecation
of mrs byrons stout advice that the maid should wear her ring openly
and tell leadville to go hang
whatever is she fraid of
oh i dunno maids is like that sometimes
she neednt be afraid of leadville e ednt goin do nothing
i dont say e av so far was the cautious reply
the wife laughed  you dont think ive lived withn all these years
an dont know es all blow
but mrs tom knew just how much justification there was for grays
alarm  well you know grays easily frightened she said
thoughtfully  i dont believe shed come down the lane at night for
all the gold in tregols
well i never  whatever is there to be afraid of
you know she ad a bit of a shock one night
she didnt say a word about it to me then
well no i spose she didnt like to
whatever was it then
i dont think she ud like for me to say anything about it
mrs tom had successfully aroused her friends curiosity and sabina
clapped her arm impatiently  im sure gray wouldnt mind you tellin
me oft
no praps she wouldnt still tis a awkward thing to say to ee
never mind for that  i reckon i can listen to what you can say
well my dear  mrs tom hitched her chair nearer to the trolly and
lowered her voice  jim ad gone over to treketh to see his mother and
the maid was to home and she wouldnt leave er father see er back
ere said shed be all right by erself  an as she was comin along
something rustled in the edge  twas one of they dark nights and she
couldnt see but she thought twas a bullock
iss  sabinas mind by now ready for it leaped to the natural
conclusion  leadville was trying to meet gray on the quiet
and some one springed out and catched old of er and just about pulled
the clothes off er back they did was mrs toms startling end to the
story
my dear life  you dont mean to say so  this was worse than she had
feared presented her indeed with a new and surprising view of her
husband
i dunno owever she got away from im
isolda and the fixed colour of her cheeks was a dull red patch on the
pallor you dont mean to say that twas really im  you cant mean
twas
oh my dear dont e ask me
i cant ardly believe said the wife miserably that ed do such a
thing  es always been a goodlivin feller e dont drink and e
never seemed to be after the maidens  cant think she said
surrendering the point as proven whatever ail the man
the fact that leadville was capable of using violence to gain his ends
had sunk into mrs toms mind  she was like an old hen when a hawk is
in the blue  i dont want to keep gray ome she said uneasily but
if leadville worry the life out of er
mrs byron had rallied from her consternation  at the bottom of her
heart she preserved a little doubt the story was perhaps substantially
true true enough to show in which direction the wind was blowing but
gray being a timid maid the tale had not lost in the telling
tis a pack o tommyrot she said at last anger beginning to colour
her unhappy amazement a man of his years runnin after young maidens
but once grays married e wont think no more about it  tis
disgraceful of him and whats more tis madness form to think shes
goin to av anything to do wi an old man like e  isolda i do think
tis time gray was married
iss my dear so do i
wellwhy dont they
it mean a good bit o money to get married you know said mrs tom
who in spite of her alert mind was not capable of quick decisions
and one thing more marrying isnt horsejocking
why dont they put the banns in and get married on the quiet
the other went off on a side issue  you know she said uttering her
thoughts aloud leadvilles bound to know one day
if gray was to walk in one morning and say im married continued
mrs byron what could e do then  ed av to old is tongue
the thought of gray doing anything so bold brought a smile to the
mothers lips  im sure she wouldnt do that sbina
well praps she wouldnt  mrs byron had realized that her friend
in revealing the incident of the lane had meant to convey a warning
the aunt did not wish to have gray replaced by the handsome more noisy
richbell and yet  i feel i belong to speak to leadville about it
she said reluctantly  but i dont want forn to think im always
watchin im  the little doubt as to his having been as guilty as
isolda would have her think had grown  she could not believe his
jumping out of the hedge had been more than a trick a practical joke
gray in her alarm must have magnified it  these inexperienced girls
were as easily frightened as a sheep  a way out of the difficulty
occurred to her  my dear ow would it be if leonora was to come and
stay for a few days
mrs tom thought that sabina was only postponing the reckoning which in
the long run she would be bound to make but aloud she gave consent
well leonora can come for a bit and see ow they get on but shed av
to sleep ome  shed better come down early in the mornin for tis
breakfasttime when youm in bed that leadville torment gray
every month said sabina hopefully i feel i shall soon be able to
get up early in the mornins by spring im sure i shall be able to
i hope by that time please god said mrs tom getting up to go the
maid will be married
she felt it would be as well for gray to have the protection of a man
in love with her and constantly at her side and as she went uphill
between the november hedges she considered what she should tell her
husband tom was a peaceable and cautious man but his blood was hot
the wife wondered whether he would be willing for gray to be married
quietly  a good deal depended on the girl  since the time as a little
child that she had fallen into the pail of boiling pigs meal and they
had nearly lost her she had been her fathers pet  if he understood
that she was unhappy and that leadville was the cause he would be
certain to make himself unpleasant  mrs tom did not wish to stir up
strife
leonora when told she was to spend her days at auntie sabinas shook
back her curls and declared herself delighted  one of a big household
she knew the stint of comparatively narrow means and a change would be
welcome  before gray was out of her aunts room the following morning
impatient fingers were rattling at the handle of the porch and
leadville stealing down as usual in his stockinged feet heard with
surprise a sound of voices in the kitchen  he stared when leonora came
from the linhay carrying hogs pudding and a fryingpan
ive come to breakfast she said smiling up at him with bright and
friendly eyes and i be comin every morning  i like comin ere
aunt sbina says i shall be company for gray and i dearly love ogs
puddin uncle leadville dont you
leadvilles tortured spirit was in the gaze he turned from the busy
child to her sister  was he to lose the hour with gray which had been
the solace of lonely night and empty day the one hour out of the
twentyfour that was his  he did not answer leonora but looked his
anxious question  was gray at the bottom of this  but no she could
not be  it was a scheme of sabinas of mrs toms or simple accident
drawing old squires big elbowchair up to the table he took his
customary seat  leonora chattered of school of the little pigs that
had had to be killed because they had worms such dear little pigs all
black and gray served the breakfast  leadville sitting opposite to
her drank in her morning freshness and looked forward to the time when
this flower should be blooming for him
a voice called from the justice room and leonora jumped up  ill see
what auntie wants
no dear ill go
leave er go rumbled leadville in his compelling bass and she was off
on the wings of happy service  he stared resentfully after the flying
figure  whats she doin ere
grays heart was aflutter  i miss the children so
his eyes grew tender  you do want a nest of your own my bird  i can
see you in it a lil place away from ere
she shook her head repudiating the idea with courage born of her
sisters nearness  i dont want never to leave trevorrick and mammy
and any of them
youd av so much of your own things to think about he murmured his
mind full of the nest he would build for her you wouldnt av time to
think upon ome
before she could answer leonora was back  tis you auntie want
gray
suspicion flamed in leadvilles eye  if theyre schemin to come
between us he said angrily theyd better look out  dont you go
gray
but the girl running on light feet down the long dark passage was glad
to escape  when uncle leadville looked at her like that she had ever a
fluttered feeling that she must run away or something she knew not
what but something terrible would happen  instinct was warning her
instinct that is wiser even than experience and leadville might sit on
in the kitchen waiting and waiting but until he was gone gray would
not return
                             chapter vii
the year ran mildly down to christmas but the wind with its tang of
cold did not fling a rose into grays cheek or buffet her into keener
life and when again the friends met in council it was to discuss
changes which both saw to be necessary
jims taking the cart into stowe week before christmas said mrs
byron when they had talked the matter over to bring ome some coals
and flour  praps that dayll suit gray
well ill talk to er and see what she got to say
very well then friday before christmas
and youll av richbell till you see ow things turn out
iss  she growin to a fine maid  theym all pretty but richbells got
the best colour  tis lovely an i dont wonder the boys is maze about
er  still she sighed give me gray
we all know grays the favourite here smiled mrs tom sticking her
needles into the stocking she was knitting and looking round for her
cloak  well i think wem doing the best we can seein leadvilles so
teasy
hell settle down right enough now  tednt as if e was a young man
when e do realize es out of the running ell take it quiet and
well be all comfortable again
well my dear i hope we shall  it as been a draggin time for ee
since you was laid up
tis funny said sabina ow you think now thats over and done
with but tednt  i thought once im out of ospital ill soon put
things to rights but i avent done it yet
takes time my dear
iss and times life
leadville had become so remote and unapproachable that sabina did not
find an opportunity to tell him the wagon would be going into stowe the
friday before christmas and that gray would be taking fowls cream and
butter to the market  not even when the day dawned did he realize that
anything unusual was afoot  he had come down to breakfast stared with
sullen aversion at leonora as the cheerful child ran to and fro between
kitchen and linhay and sought in his uninventive mind for expedients
which should leave him alone with her sister for a blessed few minutes
he did this morning after morning sometimes successfully but
generally as gray wished to keep the child near her without its making
much difference  on this particular day leonora chattering of
christmas festivities the tree they were to have at the chapel on new
years eve the tea the following day was eventually seen off to school
and gray turning a deaf ear to leadvilles plea that she would linger
went candle in hand for the sun was still below the eastern hill to
sabinas room  her mind was brimful of the practicalities of the day in
stowe  she had no time for byron had forgotten even the fear with
which his hungry presence was wont to inspire her was only conscious of
the many things to be done before she could change her workaday raiment
for clothes befitting the occasion
to leadville all seemed as usual though gray was perhaps unusually full
of domestic business but as christmas was the following week that was
to be expected  he heard her low singing voice in the justice room as
she flitted about tidying the place putting what sabina needed ready
to her hand and he decided to smoke his morning pipe in the yard  he
enjoyed looking on critically while the men worked  he told himself
that if he had been master they would have done as much again  he had
said so to sabina more than once and she had smiled thinking that she
knew better
as he watched them that morning idly content with the fine weather and
with his heart momentarily at rest he called to mind that on the
previous day he had seen a seal sporting in the surf beyond morwen cove
the end of an atlantic gale had been lashing the cliffface and a
procession of monstrous waves had been rolling in out of the grey
distance  in that welter of farsounding sea the living atom had been
at play and byron detecting the springing shadow in the curl of a
wave the dark speck in the racing tide of the mad rip had reflected
that the last bottle of sealoil had been sold  remembering this he
had thought the opportunity good and returning to the kitchen had
lifted his gun from the leathern thong above the door  the room still
lay in obscurity the only light being that of the frugal bankedup
fire  long handling however had given the gunbutt a bright dark
polish which reflected the faint glow and leadvilles hand had gone out
instinctively  crossing the kitchen to the wallcupboard on the right
of the slab range he took out the ammunition of which he stood in need
some empty bottles not overclean stood on the top shelf bottles
which were to hold the fresh supply of sealoil a medicine for stock
with which he did a trade among the farmers of the neighbouring valleys
already treherne gaskis had sent once to ask for a pint  as byron
slipped the pouch into his pocket a sound broke the stillness which lay
like dust over the rooms
    when the wind is off the hill
    flows the water to the mill
sang a voice in the linhay and though westcountry birds sing sweetly
they cannot compare for music with westcountry maidens  this voice
though without much volume had a tender joyous note as of one singing
out of a full heart and leadville hardly recognized it as grays a
narrow gleam of candlelight edged the dark oblong of the door and
from beyond came the brisk slapsmack of a beater upon newly made
butter
as the man stood to listen a look human eager almost happy broke
like a shining over his swarthy face  the sealhunt was forgotten for
the voice singing of the rain had a thrill in it the thrill of a
lovecall and the mans wild heart was assured the call was for him
for a moment the habit of years reasserting itself he glanced at the
door on the other side of the kitchen  at the end of the long dark
passage his wife still lay abed or so he hoped  the swift glance had
been unintentional the drag of a chain from which he was about to free
himself he threw back his head the brooding night of his deepset eyes
quickened by emotion and laying the gun on the table among the
breakfast crocks pushed farther open the door of the linhay
this room at once the scullery larder and dairy of the house was high
and narrow with a sloping roof  a pump stood by the outer door and
the place was lighted from above but as the dawn had not broken gray
was buttermaking by the light of a candle  the living jewel of flame
illumined faintly the high and shadowy place was reflected from the
tiny surfaces of the wet butter and outlining grays figure of a young
and happy maid shone on her absorbed face  the butter had come
quickly she struck it with the heavy beater until the milk ran
soundingly into the pail below and as she worked she sang in that
voice of infinite allure
    when the wind is off the land
    it brings the weed on to the sand
for some time leadville aware that his selfcontrol was limited had
been trying to get gray to himself  like a wisp of blossomy tamarisk
swaying in the bright upper air however she remained tantalizingly out
of reach  he spent himself in the attempt to lay hands on her to force
her to hear his suit but sabinas presence was for ever being thrust
between him and his objective until between fury with his wife and
baulked desire the man was in a dangerous mood  his highly strung
temperament prevented his being able to seize opportunity by the
forelock but so often had he met with disappointment grasping shadows
in place of a woman that when he realized gray was alone and ignorant
of his proximity he obeyed for once a natural prompting  stepping
quickly across the linhay he threw his arms round the busy girl and
sought her lips
to his almost incredulous joy gray did not offer any resistance  he
had come up behind had taken her strongly in his arms and the soft
young body yielded as if his coming had been in answer to her own
unexpressed desire  though the month was december spring was in the
air and with an unmistakable murmur of content gray abandoned herself
he bent to hers a transfigured face and then but not till then did she
realize she was in leadville byrons arms
her body stiffened suddenly and uttering a cry of horror she began to
struggle  you she cried and made a frantic effort to escape  so
surprised was he by this change of front that with his mood in the
balance between love and rage he let her go
my little umuntz he cried dont ee play with me  a moment before
she had yielded herself her voice had been liquid with invitation he
had heard in it the mating note  now she stared at him from a safe
distance with a spark in her soft eye
if you dont leave me alone she said angrily i shall go home and
never put foot inside this door no more whiles youre here
byron stood with his head bent  he too was angry he felt defrauded
only a moment since she had lain in his embrace thrilled by his touch
a warm and palpitating woman  now she spoke as if her heart were
virgin
dont ee play with me he said again  i couldnt bear it ive ad
as much as i can stand  ee knaw i love ee
ii donti dont want to
dont want to  dont want to know that night after night i cant sleep
for thinking of ee  he struck his chest with a strong bluntfingered
hand heres your place love and my armll ache till i old ee
again
hot colour dyed her face  to think that she should have lain in his
arms  on that day too of all the days in the year of all the days in
a lifetime  tis all a mistake
the dayll come when youll worship the ground i tread on
nonever
ill make ee love me  i loved ee from the first day you come ere
ive never wanted nobody but you and ive wanted ee ever since i did
see your andsome face about wastralls and heard you singin appy as a
greybird  wastralls an you they go together in my mind i love ee
gray and you know what that means to a man like me what cares for
nobody and nothing  im eaten up with the love of you  id do anything
to get ee  i must av ee and i will av ee  he came a step nearer
but she drew back
leave me alone leave me alone
leave ee alone  i want to be kissin of ee all the day
the girl was trembling  she leant one arm upon the stone slab behind
her and the shock of its coldness was a steadying influence  i baint
gwine let you kiss me id rather slap yer face for yer  what dyer
think then
he coaxed her tenderly  baint i worth avin then
i baint gwine av nothing to do with ee  i wouldnt ave ee for the
world  taking up one of the butter pats she began mechanically shaping
the mass
whats the matter with me that you wont av nothing to do with me
straightening himself he opened out unusually broad shoulders and the
candlelight revealed a face of black shadows and strong saliences  how
strong how ruthless how confident he looked  gray felt her old fear
returning she could not believe that this strange man would be held in
check by any of the received standards
youm married and old enough to be my father
she clinched the matter youm married to aunt sbina
he laughed contemptuously  ah but you would av me if i was a
widower a widower wi wastralls for my own
putting down the pat gray turned at that in a sudden ruffle of
indignation
take an old your tongue she commanded  im ashamed of ee to talk
like that
well he persisted only anxious for her to realize that he meant to
make her mistress of all he hoped for in lifewastralls  i may be
before long  i dont believe the missisll live very long
i hate that kind of talk
her anger a spark in the dark eye a flush on the soft cheek became
her and he stared admiringly  her wrath was like the peck of a captive
bird and whatever she might say from henceforth she would know that
his pursuing love was no light matter  i do love ee so he pleaded
his voice dropping to an intimate compelling whisper  i tremble when
you come into the room but i cant set ere and not touch ee i ave
to go out on cliff till ive walked it down  seems sometimes at night
as if you was near me and i put out my andah if you was there i
should die of joy  youm mine and ive waited so long  i cant bear
it  i cant eat or drink or sleep  im in a fever and i ache with
longing for ee till i feel as if i should go mad
gray caught her breath in a sob as a soft trundling sound came from the
next room  unable to speak she pointed shakily at the door
leadville also heard the sound a scrooping noise as of rubbertyred
wheels being turned about  sabina was in the kitchen could hear every
word would probably in another minute roll herself in at the linhay
door  his face grew savage and rage rose in a black flood about his
heart  was it to be always like this was this poor remnant of
humanity feeble distorted ageing always to come between him and
gray  his mind grew blurry with a wild spindrift of menace  green
withes or new ropes fools to think he could be bound by either law or
convention he whom only the lustreless black hair of one woman might
hold  love had come late but it had come in overwhelming force and he
would break every convention every law that stood in his way  laws
as he stood stricken dumb by his wifes nearness but on the edge of
passionate revolt he became conscious of a peculiar change in his
surroundings  silence fell a thick silence like a wall a silence that
shut out the cackle of a hen in the yard and the distant baaing that
came irregularly from the hillside  the man was alone behind this wall
of soundlessness shut away by it from the homely noises of the indoor
and the out  when it had lasted for a bewildering second it was
succeeded by a faint faroff sound  the sound came out of a red
distance and grew rapidly louder resolving itself at last into the
regular taptap of a hammer which is being used for knocking in nails
this hammering was to byron a familiar sound it had been heard by him
at other times of stress and strain at other moments when raging
passions seemed about to drive him over some dark verge  the sound was
arresting  it went as he well knew with flashes of vision during which
he would see a piece of light wood and the glint of brassheaded tacks
as the wood appeared out of the white mist which surrounded him byron
passed into another state of consciousness  his mind abruptly
disconnected was filled with a queer eagerness and curiosity  his
wife gray wastralls everything were momentarily forgotten  what was
it this knocking no carpenter was at work in the houses and courts
and the wood too a full curve narrowing to an angle was a curious
shape  he stared about him seeking an explanation and his eye fell on
the girl at her work
did you ear he said turning on her a face from which the tide of
emotion had ebbed
gray thankful for the respite which had followed her aunts entry had
seized the pats and with feverish industry was cutting pounds and half
pounds off the mass of butter
i heard aunt sbina in the kitchen she answered coldly
i wasnt speaking of er  i meant the knockin
what knocking
i didnt know as the mason was comin today to put up the new pigs
ouse
he isnt coming till after christmas
well im sure i eard some one ammerin in nails
she shook her head  i didnt hear it
the noise of dishes being piled together on the breakfast table caught
byrons attention  he glanced at gray and the sight of youth with a
blush on the hot cheek a suggestion of tears on the long lashes was to
him as the opening of a door  he came out of his preoccupation and the
knocking either died away or was forgotten forgotten too were his
rage and disappointment
whats she doin out o bed so early for
im going into stowe with the butter and theres a lot to do
oo yer gwine with asked byron instantly on the alert
with jim
you neednt go  he was reluctant to have her out of his reach even
for a morning  he wanted her at home under his eye  he was going to
renew his pleading as soon as the moment was auspicious  rosevear can
take that in
i want to go today
his mind examined the statement with that everready fear of the lover
who is uncertain of his standing  what you want to go for
shopping said she and with a smile that was faintly malicious
enumerated the items groceries liniment for her aunt pitchers cloam
pans
shopping  but what he saw was that fivemile drive over big hill into
stowe  he saw her beside jim driving away from wastralls from him
ill drive ee in
grays heart sank and she remained silent
would ee like me to
if she said no he would be all the more eager once im in stowe i
shall be that busy you wouldnt see anything of me
he laughed  id take care of that  all right then tis i asll drive
ee into stowe and not the lad  ill not trust rosevear to drive ee
ill do it myself  he looked back at her from the door his dark face
alight my god if i caught ee with one of they idid break his
neck
the door banged to behind him and gray putting down the printer laid
her head on her arms  if aunt sabina should not be able to prevent him
but aunt sabina was a tower of strength
                             chapter viii
in order that gray might start for the market in good time mrs byron
had swung herself out of bed that morning as soon as she had swallowed
her simple breakfast of tea and buttered split  but though she had
brush comb garments in fact all toilet necessaries at hand and could
therefore dress expeditiously she found when she reached the kitchen
that day was breaking a red sun having topped the southeasterly
slopes of brown willy and rowtor was smiling in at the manypaned
window and winning an answering brightness from surfaces of steel of
yellow glaze and of glass mrs byrons eye as she pushed the trolly
into the room took in the homely details  to the right of the range
yawned a cloam oven and before long jim rosevear would be bringing
faggots of tamarisk wood with which to fill it  before the fire in a
deep pan the dough was plumping under a linen cloth and nothing makes
a house so homely as dough on a low chair plumping in kitchen warmth
and stillness  as she gathered the breakfast crocks together
preparatory to cleansing them she smiled to herself wellpleased  her
plans were working smoothly and although the past year had been one of
change and discomfort she could believe that the disturbance like
yeast in flour would bring good results mrs byrons movements were
still quick and deft  she set the remains of the fry aside poured hot
water into the wooden tub for washing up and stood the knives blade
down in a pot  the trolly being of cane and shivered wood ran
lightly over the blue flags but as she turned from putting the refilled
kettle on the fire she heard voices in the linhay the deep bass murmur
that was her husbands and a clearer sound the voice of some one young
and troubled of some one angered but also afraid
the smile died off mrs byrons lips and for some minutes she stared
unseeingly at the steaming water in the round wooden bowl  so he was at
his tricks the old villain  she had taken the matter lightly as a
vagary a passing fancy but as the sound of his voice fell upon her
ears she experienced a doubt the first real doubt that she had known
in these tones there was a passion wholly new to her  it shook the
wifes heart with fear the fear of ultimate irremediable loss with
such fear that for the moment she went sick and faint and leaned
perilously forward in the cone of her trolly
in the linhay the voices dropped into silence and when they began
again they were pitched in a more commonplace key  sabina sitting by
the table stunned by a late realization of what had happened heard a
wellknown step a pause and the utterance in quick fierce tones of
some threatening phrase  upon that leadville came quickly into the
kitchen
sbina he said and she noticed with a fresh pang that his face wore a
warm and eager look a look of happy anticipation i want the money for
they veares
the years pigs had been made into hams and bacon and mrs byron
discussing the matter with old george had decided not to buy young
animalsveares or slipsuntil the new year  she could not understand
why leadville should want to restock the empty sties  what was it to do
with him
pigs she said noncommittally ull be cheaper after christmas
they wont go down again
i know they will  you can get goodsized slips after christmas for
less money than youll give for veares now
he thrust his hands into empty pockets and tried to think of another way
in which he could procure money how could he take gray into stowe if he
had none he wanted to give her pretty things to spend on her to
impress her but he could not ask the one woman for money to throw away
on the other  ah said he but i can go today and get them and
after christmas i shant be able to
only then did mrs byron remember the errand upon which gray was bound
the errand which was taking her into stowe  she smiled and a tinge of
malice crept into her thoughts
it baint often as youre so keen to do things for us she said and
i didnt know as youd time to spare
iss i can spend the day in buyin they veares for ee and welcome
theres things as i want moren veares  wi the wind off the land
therell be a pretty lot of oreweed in the bay  you might give a hand
to that
i been down and there ednt a bit in
she knew that he had not been farther than the yard that morning  i
dont say no to a fair offer she said her upper lip lifting a
little over the still white and regular teeth  they turmits want
bringin in from the willows field else the rabbits will eatn all
i eard biddick say as e was goin afterm today  he had a habit of
shifting his weight from one foot to the other as he stood and it gave
him an appearance of restlessness as if at any moment he might start
off on some errand  i dont want to bother with oreweed or turmits
im going into stowe and i thought you might like for me to get the
pigs  come leave me av some money
i dont want they veares  she rested her strong hands on the sides of
the cone and looked at him with understanding  he must be made to
realize that this was folly and that it must come to an end  an you
dont want to buy them  all you want is to go with gray
leadville as always when his subterfuges were detected fell back on
the truth
well he said  an sposin if i did
sabina was startled  had matters gone so far that he no longer had the
decency to deny his feelings isoldas goin wi gray she said with
a shrug of her plump shoulders
isolda he said and his disappointment bubbling up from the depths
showed as anger  among them they took good care of gray but if they
thought their scheming and underhauling would prevent his reaching her
he would very soon show them they were mistaken  fine thing you he
cried wrathfully to be jealous over a feller
mrs byron had grown stouter since her long illness she filled the
wicker cone to overflowing a big rosy woman with abundance of white
hair above a face the strength of which time had made plain  her
husbands thrust was shrewd so shrewd that she gave way before it
youm wishin me daid i spose she said bitterly and waited to hear
him deny the accusation
leadville shifted from one foot to the other but did not speak  people
say terrible things when they are angry but silence can be more
terrible than speech
i shent die any quicker cried poor mrs byron for you wishin of
it
for months the man had concealed his feelings behind downdropped lids
and avoidance but now the repugnance with which she filled him rose to
his eyes eyes no longer moody and dull but suddenly revealingly
alive hitherto the secrecy which was natural to him had seemed the only
possible plan now driven by jealousy by anger by a mounting hatred
he suddenly discarded it raising his lids he stared at sabina for some
seconds and his soul showed her its loathing and threatened her and
condemned her andlike a rabbit held by lanthorn lightshe stared back
the truth was riding nakedly through the street of life  it spoke with
a clear note of warning and sabinafor a momentboth saw and heard
                              chapter ix
youm lookin whisht this mornin missis whats the matter with ee
jim rosevear had brought two faggots of tamarisk wood for the cloam
oven  his shy glance taking in every corner of the now brightening
kitchen had assured him that gray was not present and putting that
main preoccupation momentarily aside he had leisure to note that mrs
byrons face was haggard that she looked older more worn than he had
thought  it followed that she must be ill and for illness he had always
a solicitous word
after that revealing look leadville had walked quietly past his wife out
of the house  his dark thoughts his secret hopes had risen to the
surface  he had held them in for months but in the end they had
escaped from him in a glance
his footsteps died away on the hard mud of the yard the warm silence
fell again over the kitchen and in the midst of it a modern lots
wife mrs byron sat strangely still  the steam died off the surface of
the water the sun crept a little farther into the room and the untidy
pile of breakfast crocks gave back a glint here and a dazzle there
mrs byron was undeniably shaken  her poor hands were trembling and now
and again a quiver passed over the rubicund cheeks  it was as if the
woman would have wept as if only a summer rain could have dissolved the
ice at her heart but as if the source of tears had for too long been
dry
at the sound of the yardmans voice she raised eyes which though
tearless were dim  jim seemed a long way off but kind and human  she
was old enough to be his mother and like a mother who has secret
sorrows she answered him
im down in the dumps today terrbly  avent got any eart for
nothing
can i do anything for ee missis
being the eldest of a long tail he was used to doing odd jobs for a
woman and at treketh his mother dependent now on the unsatisfactory
help of younger boys sent him daily a regretful thought  jim had been
so handy so goodnatured
rousing herself mrs byron looked about  you might light up the fire
in the cloam oven for me jim theres a good sawl
breaking a faggot apart he filled the oven with bushes and set a light
to them  the smoke curled up the black chimney and little flames ran
along the brittle wood when the earthenware sides were sparkling hot
the oven would be ready for the tins of bread the cakes and pasties
which were to feed the household during the ensuing week
anything else i can do for ee while ovens hettin
mrs byrons eyes were the brave frozen blue of the seafarer and
wistfulness was not possible to them nevertheless jim was conscious of
that quality in their gaze the son of a crossgrained father words
were not needed to tell him that the byrons had had a difference  he
moved deftly about emptying the cool water and replacing it with hot
setting out the array of loaf tins and filling a scuttle  he was glad
to be of use  it made him think of happy evenings with his mother made
him wonder which of the elder boys sidney or charley was carrying coal
and water for her and what hand they made of it
anything else missis
she had watched him unseeingly but with a growing sense of comfort
im in better eart now youve helped me so  she would have this
young man at hand to help her in all her future difficulties and the
thought was reassuring  tis near time for ee to be goin into stowe
grays all but ready
as if she had been called the girl opened the door of the linhay  at
sight of jim a sight by no means unexpected her paletinted face
bloomed like an opening rose
good mornin jim  youre late  if only he had come one little
halfhour sooner
he was looking spruce in clean shirt and new tie a fresh smoothskinned
youngster  well my dear he said awkwardly i ad a lot to do this
mornin before i could come away
jim ad to put is best bib and tucker on said mrs byron  her
interest in these opening lives helped her to push her anxieties into
the background  never one to nurse a grief she smiled at the boy and
girl glad to be looking at a morning face
id thought said gray and in her voice was a regret he could not
fathom youd be earlier so as to take the chickens and eggs
well to tell ee the truth the young man threw himself on her mercy
i went down in the orchard to see if i could find a few vilets for
yer  i want yer to look vitty today  he stepped back into the porch
returning with a little posy  in the west flowers bloom the year
round and these were scented violets
oh jim said the girl taking themand could say no more  the
violets were a charming thought but if he had only known what hung on
his keeping to the arrangement he had made with her the previous day to
come to the linhay after breakfast
your uncle wants to go in with yer said mrs byron making an effort
to speak of the matter with her customary cheerfulness but i baint
goin to letn go  she was rewarded by a grateful glance from gray a
glance which laid for all time the incipient doubts of a natural
jealousy now jim by the time youve tackled up lady grayll be
ready  my dear she turned to the girl standing dreamily by the
table the violets in her hand av you finished the butter
in the warm air of the kitchen the flowers were giving forth their
scent  yes and packed it said gray raising the posy to her face
it had been dearly bought
couldnt find your dress anywhere this mornin what av ee done with
it
aunt louisa carried it to mas and ma said id better come up there
and dress
mrs byron looked disappointed  praps tis best she said common
sense triumphing as was usual with her over the longing for a little
personal gratification still i should like to av seen the costume
well ill wear it down tomorrow for you to see
iss my dear do
the girl looked affectionately at the older woman conscious for a
moment of her disabilities and her still young heart  i wish you could
come auntie
you dont wish it moren i do  she shook her head but in her eyes
the old smile was relit  she had resigned herself and with her when a
decision was reached the natural thing was to turn from it to the next
item on the programme of life  now my dear you must make haste and
clear off she said beginning to roll up the sleeves of her blue
cotton gown  the day promised to be busy and it was high time the young
people were on their way  she did not even wait until gray was out of
the room before reaching down for the springing dough  the oven was
nearly ready but she was all behindhand  that would never do
the atmosphere which mrs byron diffused was so practical so reassuring
that it had soothed her young cousins natural distress  as the girl
walked quickly away to the room they shared though she could not
altogether forget the scene with leadville she remembered that she was
about to escape from his importunities and though an occasional
shudder still shook her she encouraged herself to think of other
happier things and in particular of the errand upon which she and jim
were bound  gray was bidding goodbye to wastralls at least for a
time and the green box she had brought with her had been packed ready
for him to fetch away for immediate necessities however she was taking
with her a brown leathern bag which had been given her by her aunt and
which bore the initials gr initials gray was never to change
in an otherwise empty drawer lay a little pile of garments of superfine
quality and workmanship and for these after cleansing herself from the
stains of buttermaking and household work the girl exchanged her
everyday clothes  jim had made her a moleskin cap and necklet and in
the latter she pinned the little bunch of violets
it dont seem hardly possible she said dreamily on her return to the
kitchen where mrs byron was kneading the dough
memory carried the older woman back to a like day in her own life
well my dear she said from the other side of times river youll
know all aboutn by tomorrow  she contemplated the blushing girl for
a moment then turned to practical matters  did you think about
bringin out the list for groceries
never thought nothing about it  she ran off returning with a
bluelined page torn from a penny account book
whatever you do dont ee forget yer uncles pipe
no man shall instruct deaf ears or open the eyes of the blind  already
sabinas optimism was reasserting itself  she had exaggerated the
import of her husbands look  leadville poor chap had been
disappointed and had shown it  no need for her to make the worst of a
bad bargain
christmas is a time of goodwill and christmas was coming  she had
noticed he was in need of a new pipe and who knew whether such an
offering might not prove a milestone on the difficult road to
reconciliation
no i wont forget said gray who saw the commission as yet another
instance of nobility exercised towards the entirely undeserving  she
kissed her aunt warmly  you are a darlin she said  i feel awful
to leave you to do all this work she glanced from the dough to the
breadtins i cant bear going
well my dear sabina felt the pleasantness of this young and partisan
affection tis only for a little while  richbell will do so well as
she can
richbellll never think to make your cocoa of a night or to get your
hotbottle and make you comfortable
please god ill av you back again soon  now you go on and be appy
and dont you think about me  i shall be all right  there she
glanced through the diamond panes of the window the mares being
tackled up make haste
a slight frost had hardened the mud of the yard and above st cadic mill
the december sun had risen into a sky of little faroff clouds  between
the shafts of the wagon stood lady the young mare glad to exchange the
warm dark stable for the adventure of the public road  jim rosevear in
wellbrushed clothes and with a tie that matched the blue of his eyes
was fastening the last buckle as gray came out with a basket of eggs
and butter in one hand and her bag in the other  a larger basket
containing poultry was already in place and beside it lay a piece of
broken mechanism which was to be left at the smithy  as the girlish
figure stepped out of the dark house leadville who with frowning brow
had been watching the preparations came forward gray had a momentary
qualm but saw with relief that he had not made any change in his dress
in old clothes and without a collar even leadville though he set many
conventions at defiance would not think of going to stowe
hullo said he what be yer gwine do wi that bag
im going to stay home tonight
ome  this is yer ome ere
well im going to stay to mammys for a change she spoke lightly
willing to placate him and hasten her escape
i think you ought to av ask me if you can stay ome or no  he had
stepped between her and the wagon and his eyes had the smouldering
light which she had learnt to dread
with her heart fluttering she controlled her voice to a pleasant
well what is there to hinder me
her docility appeased him  after all she was only going to the butter
market
well can i  can i stay to mammys asked the singing voice with its
rising inflexion on the last word
i spose you can he said reluctantly  you can go if youm a good
maid and bring me back something
ill bring you back something thatll surprise you promised gray her
eyes soft and smiling but an edge of malice under her tongue
he towered over her ardent and dominating  theres only one thing i
want and that you know
she knew and was both angered and afraid  in vain she tried to think of
leadville as wicked for her he was worse than that he was terrifying
she did not know what he might do whether there was any limit
jim having finished harnessing the mare came up on the other side of
the wagon  gray glancing aside from her tormentor saw his courageous
eyes and took heart of grace  she had a protector and this was the last
time the very last that she would be at leadvilles mercy
come now uncle leadville she said and her young voice carrying
across the wagon dissipated an incipient jealousy i want to be gone
he drew back as if he had received a blow and in a moment the girl was
climbing nimbly to her place on a bag of chaff which jim had placed
ready  as she turned a little anxious as to the effect of her words
but glad on any terms to have got away she was met by a black scowl of
wrath  mind i never ear yer call me that again
with a graceful swing jim sprang on to the rail of the wagon and the
mare fresh from her oats began to move  gray secure at last looked
down on byron with an air of innocent inquiry and the lad beside her
smiled for some time he had had a suspicion that the other was more
attentive to her than became a married man and this suspicion had
stimulated a wooing which might otherwise have seemed too tame
as the wagon wheels turned leadville perforce gave way but
unwillingly for in his heart was suspicion a fear of all men a
shaking terror lest one should have been before him  the memory of her
supple yielding form yet thrilled him with its promise  for a moment
she had abandoned herself and though she had drawn away at once the
yielding had betrayed her  gray was no longer a chrysalis of cool dim
life and unfolded wings emotion was quick in her she was ready for
full experiences the blue sunwarmed air and the flight  instinct
teaching leadville she was no unawakened maid was brought up short by
the word she had flung at him uncle  what did it mean  had some
younger man dared to approach her  had she listened listened because
he was the first and young love is sweet  was there some light fancy
that must be extinguished before she could be wholly his  surely not
surely she had meant to mark the gulf between herself and sabinas
husband to point out to him that he was married  the theory explained
her momentary yielding her quick withdrawal her words  he smiled to
himself  if gray imagined that because long ago he had gone through a
form of words with another woman they were to bind him now that for the
first time in his life he loved with passion she should learn that she
was mistaken  as soon as she returned to wastralls he would show her
in what estimation he held the worn unwelcome bond
from the low window of the kitchen mrs byron had watched the scene
jims handsome head had been bent over the mares shiny coat as he
thrust the tongues of the buckles through the brass  he moved easily
and well for life had not yet taken advantage of his strength and she
saw him as a proper lad  when gray came out mrs byron felt a motherly
pride in the little rounded figure the soft fair face between the furs
of cap and necklet  an sheve pinned they vilets on trust her for
that
leadvilles appearance cast a shadow on the scene in the bright winter
sunshine he loomed up a threatening unhappy figure the incarnation of
a desire which might not be gratified  the light fell on his uncovered
head with its thick black hair on his muscular figure growing heavy
with years but still a wonder for its strength on his eager face
sabina in a reaction from the blow she had received felt that the time
was come for her to assert herself  anxious not to drive him farther
away she had played a gentle selfobliterating part and she felt that in
doing so she had made a mistake  she would grasp her nettle more
firmly let him know that gray was bespoken  conscious as she went of
envy she began to push herself towards the porch  what a thing it was
to have an old body a body that had gone abroad and a young heart
jim and leadville hung about gray with the same hope  sabina for all
her vitality and strength had no longer anything to give she was old
and done while gray to them and every man was incarnate promise
the wagon was turning out of the gate as mrs byron reached her
husbands side and the offwheel rose over a stone  the body of the
cart swayed and lurched and gray with a little cry caught at jim
rosevears arm
byron swore fiercely  if anything appen to her ill wring his neck
you needn fear  hell take care of she
the man turned and stared at the distorted figure in the cone of
basketwork  he had not heard her come up but his mind was too deeply
occupied with other matters for him to be startled  why
because theym courtin
she had thought it would be difficult to tell him but the words sprang
out of her resentment at the way in which she struggling with
difficulties she who should have met with consideration from her
husband had been treated
courtin repeated leadville and his swarthy skin turned a dull grey
the wagon was rattling up the road at a good pace the cheery sound of
hoofs and wheels and voices growing fainter as it turned towards hember
the man stared after it and about him was the falling of dream castles
of builtup theories false hopes  he had heard the truth and could not
turn his back on it could not refuse it credence  he knew now that
grays response that morning had been to jim rosevear and not to
himself  the pieces of the puzzle fitted  he was momentarily stunned
by the revelation  only when he realized that they were driving away
together did he come to himself  the vision of their propinquity was
intolerable and he started to run towards the gate
i wont letn go with er
sabina raised her voice  baint a bit of good for ee to interfere
theym to ember by this time
from the gate he could see the wagon had been stopped and that tom
rosevear was lifting down his daughter the family had gathered in the
road and the younger girls were talking to jim doubtless giving him
christmas commissions  a little air of festivity pervaded the group an
air which as leadville did not understand it he found ominous  he
wanted to rush up the road and seize and carry gray off from among them
carry her away from trevorrick out of the complications of life there
and above everything carry her away from jim  for a desperate
situation desperate remedies  he did not mean to sit down under
misfortune to accept tamely the blows of destiny  all things comenot
to those who wait but to those who fight and he who cannot fight for
his mate is no man
theyve been courtin for months said sabina anybody but you would
have seen it but youre never ome  you cant expect to know things
when youm out mumpin around the cliffs like an old dog
gray had gone into the house the big bold house on the hillside with
her mother and leadville turned back from the yard gate
ill send un off neck and crop he cried ragingly he shall go
tonight  he shall never stay ere on the place another night  his
words came stammeringly like liquid out of a bottle that is too sharply
tilted ill sendn goin neck an crop out of this then we shall
see
iss my dear returned sabina bitterly then we shall see  theym
courtin and before long theyll be marriedthen we shall see and when
theym married theyll live ere along with we then we shall see
but the unhappy man unable to endure her words had rushed blindly
away
                              chapter x
beyond wastralls rose a line of black cliffs culminating in the high
ground of dark head and towards them leadville turned  no roads
crossed these solitudes sheep cropped the fine herbage seagulls built
on the inaccessible ledges tumuli and earthworks showed that man too
had once sheltered here  far inland an occasional grey homestead in
its nest of farmbuildings could be discerned while in clear weather
the daymark was visible on stepper point  otherwise the eye was given
only the wide spaces of sky and sea and earth
on the storm which had strewn the coast with wreckage had followed a
land wind and this had brought in the weed with which the
coastdwellers manure their sandy fields  the sea in big unquiet
rollers fell heavily against the walls and islands of rock  it was
dark with the slippery oreweed and when the tide went out the coves
and bays would be ankledeep in shining olivebrown masses  in that
treeless windswept land however the people look to the seaharvest for
more than weed  to the beaches drift beams that can be split into gate
shivers hatches which put together make a reasonable pigs house
chests and spars and miscellaneous wreckage from cottage and hamlet the
folks converge upon the coast and at any other time byron would have
stopped above the nearest sandy cove to shout down an offer for some of
the piles of wood  now he strode by unconscious of the tiny carts
being filled with planks and boxes of the little figures intent on
their grim work of salvage  the man was fleeing from the intolerable
revelation that had been thrust upon him  he was closing his ears his
mind his heart seeking to delay the inevitable moment when he must
give heed yet with him in the depths of his being was carrying that
from which he fled
so obsessed was he with the desire to get away to put space between him
and that terrible prophetic voice that he did not realize his solitudes
had been invaded  he pressed on crossing clifffaces and climbing
steeps the crags the wide prospect the seaunrest were familiar to
him this waif and foreigner who had come up out of the deep and could
claim no place as home no human being as of his blood  he was as safe
among the crags as if he had been born to wings  the people labouring
far below saw the grey figure on the heights and craned their necks to
watch his perilous progress and the salving of a good ships bones went
on more slowly because leadville byron on a ledge six inches wide and
cut away underneath a ledge of black and crumbling slate was risking a
possession dear to no one but himself
the man was coming to dark head as a hurt child rushes blindly to its
mother  hither had he fled after every difference with sabina and here
had he found a vastness a changelessness an impersonal peace upon
which he could rest his little and tortured soul  his trouble was
greater now  he was in the grip of powers which if he could not escape
from them might break him by climbing peaks on which cormorants had
nested in a confidence hitherto secure by ploughing through deep sands
and up the slippery shale by crazy leaps and a wild expenditure of
force he tried to exhaust himself  by so doing he might avoid not
only knowledge but the sinister possibilities of his nature
dark head is a narrow peninsula of rock which stands kneedeep in water
a green mane of turf ripples to the black edge and leadville scourged
across the waste came at last to a softness of thick untrodden grass
this was the worlds end and behind lay the amazing cruelty of life
the great spaces were clean and they were sweet the man strode to the
sloping edge but because he was not yet ready to surrender his atom of
consciousness drew back  for a moment he stood looking vacantly
across the breathing sea then turned and flung himself upon the bed the
ages had prepared  the grass windswept and deep yielded a little
closing about his heavy figure like the displaced water of a pool
on a rock below an oystercatcher chattered disapproval but the gulls
and shyer cormorants came back to their restingplaces  the man was
harmless and after the storm they must make the most of the sunshine
they stood about preening themselves in the red light and above the
southern hills but near them the sun made the halfcircle of the sky
in moments of overwhelming emotion byron when the strain grew too
intense had hitherto passed into another state of consciousness  the
sound of hammering had as it were opened a door beyond which was a
bewildering peace  forgetfulness had fallen on him like a garment and
when he came back it was always to begin afresh sabinas words
however though they roused him to a frenzy of feeling had not had the
usual effect  he had not been able to escape
drowned in an agony that was elemental he lay on the clifftop supine
and motionless sabinas bitter revelation had been like the pouring of
vitriol over his heart loving for the first time in his life loving
with the passion of a highly emotional temperament the hopelessness of
his love had been thrust suddenly upon him  a disappointment so
elemental so profound put him beside himself  his instinct was
somehow to escape the ultimate pangs  he had fled before the flood
fled from himself scrambled and sobbed himself across the cliffs until
he came to rest deep in the deep grass of the headland
his exhaustion was so great that for some time he lay supine as the
wreckage on the sands below  as the moments passed however
consciousness began to return and with it through the darkness of his
mind flitted unhappy thought a greyness here and there a vague
suspicion  by degrees sabinas face detached itself from the
background  he saw it resentful and defiant and tired as he was his
gorge rose  the woman was for ever in his road  she had withheld
wastralls from him now she would come between him and gray  he saw
again the strong lined face the unlovely trunk saw them with a dislike
which had for some time been growing in intensity  since her accident
sabina had been to him a deathshead a creature which without the
power to enjoy yet clung to its possessions which though its grave
was yawning persisted in dragging a repulsive mortality about the
earth  a person with any decency of feeling would have lain her down
under the turf and slept the good sleep but sabina was neither dead nor
alive that trolly  he cursed it for the hideous thing it was and for
the unseemly activity of which it was the symbol he would have liked to
break it in pieces  he would have enjoyed the wrecking and scattering
circumstances had put sabina in opposition to him and had given her the
upper hand but if it came to a struggle he did not fear the issue
sitting up on his bed of grass he stared out to sea and on the horizon
the ships went along and along far off blacknesses dim trails of
smoke  he did not see them was indeed unconscious of his material
surroundings but his mind was beginning to work  behind sabinas
denying face he sensed the opposition of grays mother hitherto he had
regarded mrs tom as a friendly circumstance but he knew she was shrewd
and in a small way ambitious  jim rosevear of treketh would be a
satisfactory match  he had the promise of a good farm and was a steady
chap  and gray  would she take her mothers penny shrewdness for
wisdom marry a young man for his youth do the commonplace thing
for the first time since the blow had fallen byron allowed himself to
think of gray driving away from him with jim rosevear  suffocating with
rage he fell forward again upon the grass
such passion as that of leadville byron is the creative force at its
human strongest and the man who feels it recognizes in it something of
the divine  he cannot doubt that he will be able to inspire in its
object an equal flame and he seeks with a persistence worthy of its
sacred object for his opportunity  byron had the most precious thing
in the world to offer gray and nothing not her mother not the
hampering circumstance of a wife not even her girlish preference for
another man would be allowed to stand in his way
noon found him by the yard gate of wastralls  he had drifted back
across the waste because the way was familiar to his wandering feet and
he reached the farm as the kitchen clock began to strike  the familiar
sound hoarse and creaking as the voice of an old person carried across
the sunshiny yard and the man stood to count the strokes  twelve
oclock  where had the morning gone  he rubbed his eyes like one
waking out of sleep and as he did so became aware that a horse had
been tethered to the staple and that beyond the horse was a gig  the
varnish of this threw off a hundred cheerful reflections while the
buckles and bosses of the harness were of a highly polished brass  the
glitter and hard cheeriness of the whole were like the sharp gleams of
frost on a sunshiny winter morning  byron recognized the gig as
belonging to dr derek of stowe  whenever other business brought him
into the parish the doctor was apt to drop in for a chat with his late
patient  he liked her but he had also a professional reason for
coming her recovery had surprised him for such vitality is unusual
and he meant to keep an eye on the case
the farmer hesitated for a moment  he was not in a mood for talk
nevertheless the force which had already set his feet upon a hidden road
drove him forward and he took his accustomed way across the now slushy
yard straight to the porch  clean blue flagstones ran by the
hedgegripe turning at right angles along the side of the house but
as byron had once contemptuously said they were all right for cats and
women he wasnt afraid of a little mud
as he opened the door the appetizing smell of new bread rushed out
sabina had been baking and on the sidetable stood a row of crusty
loaves flanked by lightly piled splits while behind was enough white
cake and saffron cake to carry the household over christmas
byron stood for a moment his bloodshot eyes scanning the place  the
kitchen being a dark room a newcomer required time to forget the sun
as his pupils widened however he perceived ensconced in old squires
big chair a little man rosygilled and greyhaired  this man was
eating with an air of pleasant enjoyment a thunderandlightning split
and beside him on a stool stood a cup of tea  though dr derek had
been out all night he looked as if fresh from his bath and no one could
have supposed that this snack of new bread was in place of the breakfast
he had missed  opposite him her unwieldy bulk seeming about to
overflow the wicker cone of the trolley sat mrs byron a quiet
somewhat distrait figure  the contrivance had been made when she was a
comparatively normal shape  since then she had grown stouter gone
abroad and a new and roomier cone was becoming imperative she looked
tired after her mornings breadmaking and her face had lost its jovial
look  over it a breath had passed dulling the gaiety wiping away even
content and the breath was one to which all of us unhappily can fit a
name
dr derek looked up at the farmers entrance  just come from
curvithick said he and thought id look in on my way home
curvithick farm the mistress of which had been cheerfully expecting her
thirteenth child lay on the other side of the main road at the head of
the valley  the land marched with that of constantine rosevear
maggie martin av got a bakers dozen now then said mrs byron but
she spoke without her usual interest in her neighbours concerns
shes done better than that and dr derek helped himself to another
split  shes got twins
twins  my dear sawl and body whatever they gwine do now with so many
childer
twelve last night and fourteen this morning  dr derek looked
pleased  he held that a declining birthrate meant the opportunity of
his countrys enemies and was himself the father of five sons and four
daughters he was wont to declare blandly that he lived in the west
because the women there had on the whole a sense of their duty to the
empire
boy and cheeld pursued mrs byron
yes one of each kind a pigeon pair  he beamed at her through round
glasses the rims of which had a yellow gleam and passed his cup for
more tea  your splitters are excellent mrs byronbut you he shook
his head what have you been doing with yourself
sabina glanced at her husband who after greeting the doctor had seated
himself heavily on the windowbench the family physician has slipped
gradually into the place of the family confessor and if byron had not
been present she might have taken dr derek to a small extent into her
confidence  as it was she acknowledged her state without offering to
explain it  i dont feel very special  i be all anyow today
not having seen her for some time dr derek did not suspect that her wan
looks and cheerless air were what a day had brought forth  remembering
the keen hearty crosscountry woman of former days and contrasting her
with this dulled stayathome he found support for his theory that the
amazing rally after her accident had been the last flicker of a strong
vitality  she had gone downhill since he saw her last
youve been doing more than you should and a glance at the array of
loaves emphasized his words that heart of yours wont stand much mrs
byron  a little extra strain you know and youll find yourself in
queer street
leadville who had been staring down at the gun which still lay across
the table turned his heavy eyes on the doctor  tis no good tellin
er to stop for she will carry on as long as she mind to  i tell er
ill do the outodoor work for er but er wont listen so tis so
well i leave it drop
the little bright doctor glanced from wife to husband and back again
with neat compact theories about everything he held that sabinas
childlessness was the key to the situation  heres a man ready and
willing to take the work off your shoulders  why not make use of him
hed save you all sorts of worries
i reckon he would and sabina covered bitterness with a smile  hed
never say nothing about em  hed keep em all to isself
considering retorted the doctor crisply that you have by no means
regained your strength surely that would be a good thing
sabina shook her head  he did not understand and she could not explain
id rather ride my own obbyarse she said vaguely
dont overtax your strength then or youll be sorry for it  after
all whether she should wear herself out quickly or rot by the chimney
corner was her affair
leadville withdrew his fascinated gaze from the gun didnt i ear you
say last time you was ere she ought to ave a operation
i did it wouldnt be a serious one a matter of a week or so in
hospital  what do you think mrs byron to have it done would make you
much more comfortable stronger too i fancy
but sabinas recollection of the days after her accident those days of
pain and discomfort when she had hung conscious and half consenting on
the edge of the void was still clear  she wondered why leadville
should be showing this sudden interest on her concerns  did he wish to
get her out of the way again so that he might be up to his tricks  or
did he think he still had a chance with gray  she could smile to
herself over his infatuation it would not be long now before he
realized its hopelessness
i dont like that old knife business she said  ill live as long as
i can and then i must die
this is hardly worth calling an operation
thank you doctor ill stay where im to
a wilful woman he said rising  well then i must send you a tonic
and byronll see that you take it
hes likely to she said
now come mrs byron cant have you saying things like that  the
person who is really interested in your getting better is your husband
you dont know what he was like when you were in hospital
i think said she with a little twitch of the lips as i can make a
guess  but thank ee all the same doctor
picking up his gun byron followed the doctor out of the house  the
farmer might prefer to strike a path for himself but dr derek had a
feline dislike of dirt and wet his patentleather boots small and
pointed twinkled in the sunshine as he stepped along the blue
flagstones and through his bright round glasses his steelblue eye
shot an inquiring gleam at the man padding heavily at his side
against that neat personality leadvilles big frame showed rough and
heavy  he was the hulking unshaven countryman powerful as a bear and
with a bears light but ungainly walk  he did not attempt to
accommodate his stride to the others city gait but lounged along
somewhere in his neighbourhood
the missis avent been erself lately byron volunteered as they came
up to the gate an i wish you could make her do as you say  praps
next time you come youll try and persuade er
with his plans not yet matured one way out of his difficulties was as
good as another  if sabina could be persuaded to return to the hospital
for a time he would only have to deal with mrs tom
the doctor climbed into the gig  tis no good byron  when she says
no theres no moving her
the farmers vague gaze was fixed on the glittering harness but his
heart sank  i should like to have everything done that can be done
he growled in his deep voice
i know my good fellow comforted the other well dont let her do
more than you can help and keep her diet as light as possible  not too
much pork you know and no heavy suppers
she wont be said by me returned byron
well well one does the best one can and theres no more to be said
wonderful case  never thought shed turn that first corner yet there
she is doing a days work  its a pity shes growing so stout  when i
think of what she was  with his small wellkept hands the polished
nails of which scattered tiny reflections of the light he made a
gesture of pity and regret  the strength of a man and now
byron stepped back from the gig  and now he said grimly as the cob
began to move now shes a proper wreck
                              chapter xi
an hour later byron came into the kitchen carrying a small dead seal
climbing down by a little treacherous path he had seen it lying at the
mouth of a cave and for some minutes had stood to watch it  by means of
an inner membrane it was clearing first one nostril of seawater and
then the other and he had shot it while it was still unaware of him
whats become o the furnace he asked  i told george to leavn by
the hedgegripe
sabina though a farmer preserved some feminine traits and in
particular a love of tidiness  she was as clean as a cat and to see her
yard churned up by the hoofs of the cattle and the farm implements at
the mercy of the weather troubled her  the rusty furnace an outdoor
stove used for farm purposes and in particular to try out sealoil
had been an eyesore and she had had it removed
tis out in the bullocks house
leadville damned er up in the eaps for interferin with is things
but he spoke not harshly so much as absentmindedly
ill av the place as ive a mind to returned sabina placidly  her
husband had often raged against the equable good nature which suffered
without malice as a mother surfers the unreasonableness of her child
now he only muttered vaguely as he set the gun in its thongs over the
door
wheres dick to
drayin oreweed  sabina who had manoeuvred the trolly close to the
fender had been nodding in the agreeable warmth  an indoor life had
made her susceptible to cold and this afternoon she felt tired and ill
the emotions rather than the work of the day had exhausted her and she
had thought to snatch a few minutes rest before mrs tom whom she was
expecting to call on the way back from stowe should arrive
youll catch afire one of these days if you keep on gruddlin so said
byron with a fathering wish  sabina could not follow his thought in
fact she mistook it for solicitude  it was long since he had shown any
interest in her welfare  could the doctors visit revealing that she
was in a poor way have brought her husband to a better mind  like the
rest of us she could not believe that it takes all sorts to make a world
and in the eyes of others saw consequently only the reflection of
herself she looked hopefully at leadville and at once he turned away
hanging his big head and balancing from one foot to the other  his mind
was stirring as the sand crawls under an army of ants  he felt the
movement was perhaps vaguely conscious of the direction in which he was
going but could not see the end not yet
a cart laden with glistening weed wet and olivebrown had come up from
the beach  as leadville lounged out of the porch he saw that dick
bennett was the driver the weed had been left by the receding tide
left ankledeep in every sandy bay strewn over the black rocks a
generous provision enough for every potatopatch in the parish  nor
did the glossy slippery weed constitute the whole of the seaharvest
manure for the fields wood for the kitchen fires and what that wood
had heldoranges and shelled walnuts crates and bags and boxeshad
floated in during the night  the sea had been good to the lonely
dwellers on her coasts and she had offered in her own gruesome
fashion a christmas gift
the furnace maister  i knaw where tis to  leave me empt up this and
ill get it for yer
when the stove red with rust had been reinstated in the shelter of the
hedge byron took up the limp body and began to prepare it
thats every bit of coal we got till jim bring ome some from stowe
said bennett as he poured a shovelful of round knobs which had been
salvaged from the sea on to the furze bushes and set them alight
theres plenty of wood there grunted the other so we must burn
that
i should think twas time jim ud be back  the hind was a little
mournful man with a grievance  he had seen jim drive off that morning
in his sunday suit with a pretty girl for company and he had felt that
he himself older in service should have been sent  but these young
chaps when they go an errand they take good care they dont come ome
very quick  course he added grudgingly e can spend the day in
stowe without any trouble
oh shut yer mouth cried the other savagely  the mans grumbling
chatter had obliged him to remember that jim rosevear was with gray
till then he had succeeded in keeping the thought of their proximity at
the back of his mind  it had been difficult but he had done it  dick
had made it no longer possible and the day in stowe unrolled itself
before his jealous eyesthe drive in a drive of five good cornish
miles the drive behind lady who though a good mare was slow the
stall in the market where rosevear would set up the trestles help the
girl arrange to the best advantage the eggs the poultry the pounds and
half pounds of butter the meeting after market on the quay where the
wagon being loaded with coal and flour they would leave lady by the
warehouse while they hurried from shop to shop she buying and he
carrying the parcels finally the long drive home in the windy dusk
leadville tortured himself with the thought of that drive of grays
softness and nearness of the little face between the fur of cap and
necklet the little smiling face
he had been skinning the seal  much as less powerful men skin a rabbit
he had been tearing the coat grey and damp from the smooth pale body
a stone wall five foot broad at the base and crowned with tamarisk
bushes is what in cornwall is called a hedge  it is at least a shelter
from the wind and dick bennett had been careful to set the furnace in a
lew corner  the furze bushes burnt with a crackle and above them the
seacoal smouldered slowly in large red lumps  the air in the yard was
fresh but still and through it a warm reek rose the smell of blood
it rose to byrons nostrils affecting him as it affects the children of
the wild rousing in him that primitive longforgotten but deathless
passion which claims survival as its right and battling before the
hosts that wait to be called across the threshold stakes its life
between his hands hung the limp body and he wrenched at the skin in a
growing fury of impatience  his blunt darkskinned fingers were foul
and as the sealskin slipped he noticed that a trickle of thickening
blood had run down his palm on to the wrist  he stared at this from
between narrowed eyelids for a second then stooping his big head
licked it away  the taste of it salt on his tongue further affected
an equilibrium already unstable and the beast which slumbers behind the
arras of our civilization which stirs with a faint growl at every
shaking of that decent cover that savage incalculable beast of the long
past awoke  the bloodlust rose in him  he forgot the presence of the
bullockman the time the place everything but a sudden overmastering
need  something he could not remember what had defied him and it was
of paramount necessity that this something should be done away with
destroyed ground into the earth  to rend and crush had become
obligatory the vindication of his claim to live  the poor body of the
seal was gone and in its place was an enemy who had been given into his
hands  he caught up the carcass seeing not it but all he hated all
he was burning to destroy and the dismemberment degenerated from honest
butchery into an orgy dick bennett stood aghast  in the masters eye
was a wildness which made the hind thankful he was even more
inconspicuous than small  for once his querulousness was hushed  the
old devil pulled and dragged and acked as though e was mad was his
description afterwards of the scene  e fetched is spite out on the
poor creature  it made me fairly sick to see im
bit by bit the crushed fragments of bloody flesh were cast into the
cauldron but as long as bone or sinew held together byron tore at the
body with unabated passion the last lump was flung in with the same
fury of effort as the first but as soon as his hands were empty the
mood passed  the sweat was on his forehead his knees were knocking
together and he was trembling but he seemed unconscious of his
condition  for some minutes he stood by the furnace staring vacantly
into the bubbling depths but by degrees his breath came more evenly and
the suavity of successful effort began to wash over his tortured mind
daunted by his masters incomprehensible ferocity the hind waited in
the background and behind him again the chickens picked and scratched
and on the lichened roof the pigeons balanced in the sun  byron was
watching the formation of a large iridescent bubble  his eye dwelt
languidly on the red and green transparence on the smaller bubbles
hurrying to its side but as the film burst and disappeared he pushed
the stirringstick into the labourers hand with a deep mind you dont
leaven burn and swung away  he was come fully to himself a weary
and a hungry self and he remembered that the dinner hour was long past
the outer door of the linhay opened on to a paved dryingyard and as he
passed through he stooped his head under a sagging cord with the
practical mans comment that a new prop was needed  trifles
commonplace and wholesome were distracting his mind  he felt cold
noticed that what little wind there was had gone round to the north
noticed too that above dark head the sky was flaming with a sunset of
good augury  the short december day being so near its close the linhay
was dark but the hungry man knew where to lay his hand on a rabbit
pasty  he had shot the rabbits and brought them into gray and now
gray waswhere  behind him lay the old house with its many chambers and
not one of them harboured her  for the first time he realized that
without gray wastralls was but an empty shell
in a row on the shelf stood the loaves and beside them on a big white
dish lay the pasties  sabina had added onion and bacon to make them
appetizing parsley to give flavour freshly dug potatoes to hold the
gravy and all was folded in a responsible crust  her pasties were
renowned but byron satisfying his hunger did not notice the quality
of the food  he was still obsessed by his vision of the empty house
the barren years when he had paced the friendly fields as a captive
paces his cage unable either to take action or to escape had done
their work  he had supported life on a meagre hope but he was older
now less patient had a shorter time left him in which to enjoy  the
young samson can afford to ask riddles and play tricks it is the ageing
man who grown desperate brings destruction upon the people standing
by the shelf eating hungrily but absentmindedly byron presently
became conscious of voices in the kitchen  for a moment his heart beat
in swift anticipation  was gray back  he stopped eating to listen but
the voice which had suggested that of the young girl was older and had
lost some of its westcountry music  he recognized it disappointedly as
that of the girls mother
filling himself a mug from the pitcher of milk that stood on the flags
byron drank  if mrs tom were in the kitchen the little party must have
returned from stowe and the thought was in a way reassuring  gray
would be at hember now and rosevear would have come on to wastralls with
the mare and cart  at least they were no longer together
byrons thoughts dwelt fleetingly on rosevear  should he go back find
the fellow and send him packing  he hated the sight of that womanishly
smooth face  some day he would send his fist crashing into it put the
weight of his shoulder into the blow  if he could fell a bullock it
would be childs play to spoil rosevears beauty to make him so as the
chaps own mother wouldnt recognize him  when gray saw what he made of
her fine sweetheart there would be no more hesitationleadville could
not believe it to be more than hesitation she would turn to the man who
had proved in primal fashion his right to her
in the kitchen the womens voices rose and fell lifting at the end in
the cornish way  phrases and half words reached the mans ears and
brought him to a distrustful consideration of them  these women with
their underhauling their scheming the way they held for each
otherwhat were they discussing  him and his affairs  he fell to
again on the pasty biting into its hard crust with unnecessary force
biting indeed into more than crust and meat
mrs tom having brought in the christmas groceries and stacked the tins
and parcels on the sidetable had settled down for a chat  the bond
between the women which like themselves was stout and workaday had
been embroidered by the years with a pattern of memories and what can
be pleasanter at the end of a winter day than to sit by a bright fire
with a friend who has been tried by time  sabina talked of her husband
of the farm of the future
ah said mrs rosevear cheerfully and now the time as come for ee
to make a fresh start  when leadville knaw about gray e will av to
rest is eart content
sabina stirred her tea in a meditative fashion  with a simple faith in
good and evil reward and punishment it was puzzling to her that she
who was a member and had gone to prayer meeting and chapel all right
and been a good livin woman should have had so much trouble i think
its a awful thing for e to be running after gray when e got a wife
ofs own she said  too bad i do call it
well there tis my dear i spose e cant elp it men are like
that baint they poor old dragons  best thing to do is to keep
temptation out ofs way
do ee think so  now id rather showm as e cant av what e wants
the more clearsighted woman did not dispute the matter  even if sabina
wanted gray and jim to live at wastralls the decision would not rest
with her  gray would not care so long as she was with jim but he
though goodnatured and easygoing knew his own mind not long since he
had been over to gentle jane where his aunt receiving him warmly had
been urgent that he should live with her  he had not given a definite
answer but mrs tom knew he was considering the matter
better for leadville if e ad something to take up is time she
said  es always mumpin around the cliffs like a wandering jew
the wifes happygolucky faith in leadvilles harmlessness did not
commend itself to mrs tom  she remembered the zest with which he had
torn up the honeysuckle the indifference he had shown as to whether
sabina lived or died his moroseness since her return  they might yet
have trouble with him
well tis is choice e could work if e like theres plenty to do
but es not that way inclined
    e as got fever of lurk
    two minds to eat and none to work
quoted mrs tom as she helped herself to a slice of yeastcake  if a
man got nothin else to think about e sure to get into mischief
cant you find something form to do  why dont yer letn go to town
for ee in an out and work a team sometimes
av yer forgotten the trick e served me when i was in the ospital
twouldnt do at all  es one o they sort if you given a inch ell
take a nail
well youm jobs comforter but all i can say is youre both gettin
upstairs and after a bit youll settle down all right again  of
course grayll stay ome now until we see whats to be done  the young
folks must please their own minds then they cant blame nobody
sabina agreed though with some reluctance  whatever be i to do
without er
you neednt trouble yerself about that  richbell shall come down in
the mornin and light yer fire and get the breakfast  iss and while i
think oft tom say you must sure to come up to hember to spend
christmas hell fetch yer isself  the constantines are comin and we
shall be all together and by then please god i ope leadvillell be
settled down
i should like that very much  her face brightened at the thought of
the welcoming faces and the cheer im sure tis good of ee to think
about it and ill bring up something with me  tis years since weve
spent christmas together
my dear tis moren ten years ago  now av you told leadville about
gray
i said ton theyre courtin anll be married very soon an i expect
theyll come ere to live
what did he say about it then
e give a nasty gruntlike e did still ell get over that
tomorrow ill telln of t but i dont feel i could bear any more
today
well tomorrowll do
as she spoke byron opened the linhay door  the dancing flames
illumined the lowbrowed room sufficiently for him to see the two women
seated one on each side of the hearth and with a short mutter of
greeting he walked over to the windowbench  who brought they
groceries back
i did said mrs tom
is gray come back then
gray  she idnt comin back  me and sbina ve made arrangements for
richbell to come in er place
he had suspected the women were plotting against him he had been
conscious of their intangible opposition and a spasm of hatred took him
by the throat  he shook in the grip of it  why
mrs tom was resolved that there should be no illblood between hember
and wastralls and her reply was noncommittal  she do dearly love er
aunt sbina but she want to be ome
shell soon be back ere asserted byron
shes very grateful for all your kindness but shed rather live ome
with me for a bit
i dont like changes and i wont av them
dear me said mrs tom placidly wont is a big word  she turned to
the figure in the wicker cone as if having disposed of one matter she
were ready for another shall i put they groceries in the cupboard for
ee sbina
leadville had risen from his seat  they had taken gray from him and
they meant to keep her away  would she be a consenting party to their
scheme  he feared she might yet if she only knew  mrs tom tranquil
occupied with household thoughts seemed to the angry man to possess a
tremendous terrifying power  she could make gray inaccessible and she
would
we want er ere and his harsh voice shook so that mrs tom aware of
him out of the corner of an eye could not but pity him
i knaw tis very good of ee to make so much fuss of her she
returned pushing back her chair but just now shed rather be ome
through the turmoil of his fears and hopes leadville heard his wifes
easy you can put they things away if you like isolda but leave out
the tin of bootpolish for i know we want one
they could talk of groceries and bootpolish  he was astounded at their
lack of understanding  a man might be suffering the pains of hell and
they would still be occupied with trifles  with an effort which set the
blood drumming in his ears he forced himself to sit down behind him in
the thickness of the wall was the bench and above it the manypaned
window with a geranium on the inner ledge  the kitchen table stood
against this bench and as leadville sank back he gripped the stout
edge putting into the clutch the passion or his disappointment his
revolt  the women moved about pouring sugar and currants into jars
filling the bin with flour folding up bags and paper  the murmur of
their casual talk filled the airtheir talk of the markets and the
shops of prices and of people  murmur of womens voices is the breeze
in the treetops murmur of mens the sea on the beaches the sea at
night  leadville heard as one a great way off hears a familiar sound
he heard and gradually the gale of his impatience ceased to blow  he
was no longer occupied with the soft movements of the women no longer
exasperated by their intangible opposition  he had turned from the
latter as from a thing of little moment and in the depths of his spirit
had found enlightenment
take gray from him would they
he understood at last that mrs rosevear and jim were not his chief
enemies  the person who stood between him and the realization of his
dreams was sabina  she had withheld wastralls now by merely living
she blocked his path to gray
                             chapter xii

leadville sitting engrossed in secret thought had had a withering
effect upon the womens talk  it lost spontaneity it grew spasmodic
and as soon as the last tin was on the shelf mrs tom said she must go
home
ill go out as far as the gate with yer sabina had answered eagerly
after the hot kitchen it would be pleasant to have a breath of air from
the sea pleasant also to finish their chat  the flags being level it
was an easy run but the gate marked the end of the journey from it the
ground fell away to the sandy commons covered with grey spiregrass
which had given the place its name  the wastralls had been bare blown
sand but the stiff spire held the ridges from shifting and on its heels
had come bright ladysfingers and silverweed coarse herbage and in
depressions the thick yellow moss sabina found it rested her after
the dark confinement the depressing influence of the house to look
across the commons  the sand was piled in fantastic bulwarks but
between these windformed bastions and ditches glimmered a white unrest
of tides
the short winters day was drawing to a close  the sun had sunk below
dark head and the black shadow of the cliff had fallen on wastralls
grey in the dip of the grey land it lay like a rock but unlike a rock
it was hollow and the many chambers were full of echoes from the past
above the eastern hills a vague brightness gave promise of the moon and
the women pausing by the eggcrowned gateposts looked up the road to
where hember windows were aglow  their thoughts had run before them and
they fancied they could hear faint sounds of voices and laughter
they will keep it up tonight said mrs tom and with a kiss bundled
off down the lane  she was returning full of pleasant anticipations to
a merry circlea circle which on her appearance would make her
affectionately welcome  with the five girls it was always mother
with tom too
she had not taken many steps before the contrast between what she was
leaving and that to which she was hastening brought her to a
standstill  her heart misgave her
sbina she called to the lonely figure motionless by the gate
sbina
well what is it
would you like for richbell to come down tonight
in the kitchen leadville could hear the highpitched question and reply
spoil er evenin  my dear life i wouldnt think of it  dont you
worry  i shall get on all right
i dont like to feel that you are all alone  she knew sabina would
not have welcomed a reference to her helplessness
now dont ee think about me go and enjoy yourself
mrs tom hesitated for a moment  at the few merrymakings of the
countryside sabina jovial and buxom had been a welcome guest but
since her accident the difficulty of getting about had kept her at
home mrs tom decided she must be persuaded to go out more that a pony
must be got for her and the trolly adapted  that leadville would be
violently opposed to such a proceeding that he would object to his
wifes making a laughingstock of herself did not weigh with mrs
tom
more than once that evening when the young people singing the old hymns
to the old tunes were gathered about the harmonium the good womans
thoughts returned to the friend of her youth  what a fine woman sabina
had been putting them all in the shade yet unaware of it and what happy
times they had had  she remembered childhoods days and how often she
had waited at the crossroads for sabina so that they might walk the
length of the way together  the fishsellers daughter would bring a
pasty for her school dinner and there being nine at home it was
generally more pastry than meat but sabina had supplemented it with red
apples and cold sausages and other delectable foods sabina had also
supplemented the others wardrobe perhaps even her prospects
mrs tom thinking of the lonely figure at the gate was glad her own
days were passed at hember in rooms that led out of each other and were
crowded with children wastralls silent and old depressed her  not
all the fires sabina lighted could warm its bones and do away with the
faint but pervading smell of mould  life that had been thinned to
ghostliness drifted through the passages and the rooms lay in a
brooding hush  she thought of the place with a dim prevision too dim
for her to grasp a prevision of calamity
somebody digging my grave she said and drew nearer to the fire
the wind which blew in gusts dropping now and again into a deceitful
lull sent a cold breath up the valley and sabina lingering by the
gate drew the shawl closer about her shoulders  the shadow that rested
on wastralls a shadow to which she was as a rule wholesomely
indifferent had grown a little grown till it included her though her
perceptive faculty was slight she was in no hurry to leave the clean
sanity the freshness of the night
above the black oblong of the mill the rim of the moon was showing
golden that wonderful westcountry moon which hangs a clear lamp of
light far above cloud and mist  the beams falling across the yard
across the ricks had not yet reached wastralls  the house stood
withdrawn below the hills and for the first time sabina felt her home
to be remote from the warm friendliness of the world  she saw it that
night approximately as it appeared to others a place cut off by its
situation  the valley being far from the main highway strangers were
unaware of it  the road through led to nothing but the teeth of the
devouring sea and as the hamlet of cottages was the most cheerful spot
in trevorrick so wastralls was the most lonely and the most lost
hember windows were always aglow  the sun found them by day and the
moon by night  they glowed from within from the fires of driftwood and
seacoal from lamps swinging under the dark rafters from the fires of
life  sabina reluctantly returning to the house could not but
contrast the light and music of hember its continual coming and going
with the dark desolation the stagnant peace of wastralls  never had it
been otherwise  her earliest recollections were of long hours when her
father being at the dolphin the servant would take advantage and be
walking out  the child given the run of the empty rooms and left to
her own devices had peopled the place with imaginary figures  even at
this distance of time she could recall their names and
attributestinkle minkle who was black and made of sugar creekuk and
clokuk the eiderdown men and tinkle farg who still more absurd had
been shy with a buffalo  naturally social she had liked to imagine a
face at every window children playing under the grubby elms of the
avenue and among the animals in the yard  she had looked forward to the
time when she should be grown up and married  one child is a
misfortune she had told her father at the ripe age of ten im going
to ave lots when i marry  im going to full the rooms
the sound of a harmonium came to her through the stillness but so faint
was it she could hardly distinguish the tune  at hember they were
singing the familiar hymns in which all could join  the sound drew the
listening woman  how often when weary of imaginary companions had she
run up the lane and joined her cousins at their play  hember had been a
bright spot in her life  all that she knew of sewing and housewifery
her aunt had taught her and tom had wanted to marry her yestom and
constantine  poor old constantine he had tried his best  but tom the
rascal tom had been looking two ways at once  she sighed the gusty
sigh of a stout middleaged woman who wishes the hot cake of youthful
joys with its plums and its citron and its spice was once more whole
in her hand
a puff of wind increasing the volume of sound enabled sabina to
recognize the hymn  she could almost see the happy group isolda
knitting in her chair by the range tom opposite to her and about the
harmonium the bright heads and smiling faces of the girls  ah if only
one of them had been born to herself  she who had been going to full
the rooms had had neither the full quiver nor the faithful mate she
had had as she realized at last nothing in all her life but hope and
from her time had stolen even that which she had
in the kitchen absorbed in brooding thought byron a thicker shadow in
the growing gloom was awaiting her return  her mind from wandering
far afield circled to the present to the slight repugnance she felt at
entering the house  she was not a nervy woman indeed in a
countryside peculiarly susceptible to the socalled supernatural had
been known to declare out at all times night and day and never see
nothing worse than myself  her unwillingness to go back an
unwillingness which in truth was but another of the warnings which had
been tolling like deathbells all the day seemed to her foolish
tis owin that weve been bad friends for so long she said  im
feelin awkward as tho ed been a stranger the sooner i take an go
in the better
the door of the glass porch stood wide in a yawn of blackness a
blackness so thick that mrs byron felt as if she were pushing her way
in against a resistance intangible and on the whole yielding but which
could yet be felt afraid of what might be lurking in the depths of that
gloom she forced herself to move noisily and making a greater effort
to break the silence
tis darker ere than tis in the yard she said thinking of the
moon and the pale flood it was pouring over meadow and common over the
nestling farms over every place but the dark corner in which her home
lay hid contrasting the black and silver of the night with this
brooding hush
she put her hand on the shelf to find the matches once the lamp was
lighted once its cheery beams had driven out the dark she would be
more at ease  in a hurry to finish her work gray however had
forgotten to fill the brass receptacle with oil and mrs byron was faced
with a domestic problem  to manoeuvre the trolly sufficiently close to
the wall would be difficult nevertheless it did not occur to her to ask
leadvilles help and he sitting motionless by the window did not offer
it
strange ow i feel i must keep on craikin she thought as at last
successful she trundled off to the linhay  tis just like leadville
ad now comed in and i must talk ton  i dunno when i felt so whisht
we avent got very much paraffin left she said aloud as she returned
with the lamp  jim didnt bring any i dare say we got enough for
tonight though we dont burn much
wheres jim to asked leadville suddenly
couldnt get a bit of coal said mrs byron hanging the lamp in its
bracket and trying to conceal the fact that his unexpected utterance had
jarred her unruly nerves  awken adnt a bit but the boat is
expected in tonight so jimll av to go in tomorrow and fetch it
wheres e to persisted leadville
sabina held that if no fuel were thrown upon a fire that fire must die
ow dyer think i knaw
is e to ember
well where else should e be seein
the mans deep chest lifted and fell  seein he interrupted
fiercely as tom wish form to be there seein as is wife wish it
isis wife stammered sabina
dont isolda wish it  you know she do but my lil bird dont wish it
i dont believe she do
the blood which had drained out of the womans face returned with a
rush  she opened her lips but found herself voiceless and gasping
dont say like that leadville she whispered at last  dont ee
dont ee say itnot to me
the man threw back his head and as if unable in any other way to
express his feelings broke into a laugh you he said  you
sabina turned the trolly handle pushing it blindly out of the room
she was running away as a man runs from licking climbing flames  she
could not yield could not knuckle under but she could retreat until
strong enough to resume the struggle  the tears were running down her
face as she turned into the linhay but they were tears forced from her
by pain  like the child in the story she could have said it is my
eyes thats cryin not me
for behind the wall of her tired and suffering body was her indomitable
spirit
                             chapter xiii
sabinas mental attitude towards events and persons was often one of
surprise and protest  it was now
what av i done that e should treat me like this she thought  her
rightdoing was the outstanding thing in her life and could not be
missed  it was like a bonfire on a hill  if the wages of sin were
death the reward of righteousness which she deserved should be love
and faith  laying claim to this reward her poor mind groped in a long
bewilderment  for love and faith had been withheld
leaning for support on the stone shelf gathering the dark and quiet and
coolness of the linhay into her soul her tears gradually dried up and
as gradually her personal feeling her bitterness and resentment gave
place  she had asserted a claim had protested as a wife against the
outrage of leadvilles words had protested as a child against that
flourishing of the wicked as a green baytree but the habit of her mind
was impersonal and very kind  dispirited sad almost despairing she
yet could not do other than return to it
poor chaps that worried e dunno what es sayin she told herself
her lack of children was an oversight she had done her best to remedy
she made for leadville the blind tender excuses of her maternal heart
i knaw e dont mean it  yell be all right in a day or twos time
always been a goodlivin feller and im sure e wouldnt urt a flea
i dont belong to mind a quivering nerve gave her the lie  but
i do i do mind she said piteously es all i got  no and tednt
that  tis i do loven
drawing water she bathed her eyes  the burst of emotion had left her
drained of strength but supper was yet to get  i did mean to fry for
is supper she said the word covering as many varieties of appetizing
food as can be cooked in a fryingpan but i dont think i will i feel
so tired and weary i think usll have to manage with what weve got
she glanced along the shelf that bit of cold meatll do  e do dearly
love a bit of fat pork
although her tears easing the strain on her nerves had left her less
apprehensive the kitchen still loomed disquieting  tis because i
made a fool of myself she said bracing herself for further effort
leadville was in his old place by the window  he neither moved nor
spoke seemed indeed too much absorbed in thought to be aware of her
sabina felt relieved  she told herself she had had enough of his
tantrums for one day let them have the meal in peace and get off to
bed  putting the meat on a clean dish she began to lay the cloth but
as she moved about a dim suspicion flitted through her mind that she
was being watched  she dismissed it hurriedly and went on with her
work but it returned  though leadville appeared lost in thought no
sooner did she turn her back than his heavy lids lifted and his eyes
followed her with a furtive question  she felt them on her felt in his
glance a quality which made her uneasy  what did he want to know  why
couldnt he put his question into words why should his following and
thoughtful glance remind her of the way a cat crouching watches a
bird  she was sure he was watching yet not quite sure  turning
sharply she fixed brave blue eyes on his face but immediately he looked
away  he was not watching her he was occupied with his own dark and
brooding fancies
the blank unconsciousness of his gaze was reassuring she had been
mistaken fanciful  how foolish of her well she was tired she could
not help it if she did fancy things  she had been through a lot that
day and it had shaken her  perhaps too the lamp had something to say to
her fancies  it was not burning well and while a good light cheered
and encouraged a jumping insufficient one bred more than shadows  mrs
byron went into the linhay for scalded cream for syrup and the
cocoajug but as she passed her husband she felt that if he did not
quite look at her she was yet the centre of his thoughts  and he was
looking  her back was towards him her unprotected back and his
glances were like arrows  the hair crisped on the womans head  what
did this furtive watching mean  this downdropping look which when
unobserved followed and considered  leadville was sitting back in the
corner his head resting against the wall and though his heavy features
wore the expression habitual to them his eyes were no longer filmed
with inward brooding  sabina wandering over the moors had once stooped
to look along a deserted mineshaft and in the darkness had seen two
round eyes eyes of green fire eyes which though distant had been full
of a wild menace  they had stared out at her threatening her advance
and so inimical were they that she had left the mineshaft unexplored
leadvilles eyes reminded her of the savage daunting thing from which
she had retreated  i wish e wouldnt watch me like that she said
lingering over her errand it makes me feel anyow i wish her
thoughts flew to hember hember which whenever she had been in a
difficulty hitherto had come to the rescuei wish id let richbell
come down
a candle stood on the furnace and by its light mrs byron searched the
upper shelf for a jug of which she stood in need  during her long
convalescence she had suffered from sleeplessness but as her health
improved so had her nights  she put the latter down however to the
fact that she had formed the habit of drinking a cup of hot cocoa as
soon as she was in bed  a warm drink at night a nourishing
nonstimulating drink which needed care in preparation was she had
felt more likely to bring a return to normal conditions than patient
waiting on the mysterious processes of nature  the cocoajug brown
highwaisted girdled by a gold line stood a little behind the other
pitchers  in her haste that morning gray had pushed it back and the
shelf being high her aunt had some difficulty in recovering it  the
effort to reach it distracted her mind and when she returned to the
kitchen she was thinking more of the healing effects of cocoa than of
the tiresome ways of husbands
on one side of the range hung a small square mirror such as can be
bought of any gipsy pedlar for a shilling and as she leaned forward to
put on the kettle she caught sight of her face  used to rubicund cheeks
below bright eyes she was surprised to see that though her colour was
fixed it had lost its warm tone and that her lips were a bluish grey
i bin frightened she told herself i knaw tis fulishness of me but
i cant elp it  pretty mawkin i be fancyin things like that  the
eyes in the mirror were strong and encouraging the grey lips smiled at
her here was a tried comrade who knew what she had to endure and who
sympathizedwho sympathized as no one else could  sabina was captain of
her soul and could rely on it for strength and for support yet with her
reviving courage came a hint of the old discomfort  on returning from
the linhay she had found byron staring at his knees  now that her back
was turned to him she feltand the feeling sent a quick shudder through
hershe felt that he was at his trick of watching  she felt it then
suddenly she knew for in the depths of the mirror was another face a
face which had fixed narrowing eyes on her and these eyes travelled
over her considering her asking a strange inhuman question
she swung the trolly round in an access of nervous fear but that
inimical glance had slipped away and leadville was once more staring
blankly at his knees mrs byron remained for a moment waiting but he
neither stirred nor looked  he had been on the verge of making the
discovery he sought and her sudden movement scattering his thoughts
had angered him  if she would go on with her work the thing that was
eluding him would creep back and this time he would grasp it  he sat
like one in a trance focusing his mind on a dimly seen spot a spot of
dreadful knowledge
sabina manoeuvred the car so that she no longer had her back turned to
the dark figure on the bench  to make the cocoa while in a sideways
position was awkward but the defenceless attitude had become
impossible she must know what was happening on the other side of the
room  profoundly disturbed she yet measured the spoonfuls of cocoa
with a steady hand  as gray would not share the beneficial draught that
night her aunt was mechanically careful to make only half the usual
quantity the lavish hand does not pile up a balance at the bank
as mrs byron set the jug of cocoa on the stove in order that it might
be kept hot till she was ready for it leadville broke the silence  he
did not speak but once more he laughed and this time his was the
satisfied laugh of a man who after long endeavour has found that of
which he is in search
his wife stared  ow you made me jump she said a little
breathlessly  a quality in the laugh a certain sinister satisfaction
had made her flesh creep  what was it that had pleased him that by his
secret watching he had discovered  she tried to shake off the
conviction of his strangeness  dunno whats come over me  i spose e
can laugh at is own thoughts but its a funny thing it makes me all
goosey flesh
conquering an inclination to go out of the room to leave leadville to
his secret satisfactions she rolled herself to the table  i should
think you was feeling so leary as a greyound by this time she said
and by speaking of the commonplace would have relieved the tension
the queerness of leadvilles behaviour might after all be due to hunger
for as far as she knew he had not had any food since morning
the man cleared his throat  theres no butter on the table he said
looking past her at something on the other side of the room
grays taken every bit to market  his habit being to eat without
comment what was set before him sabina felt a dim surprise that he
should have asked for butter
she avent  i see some on the shelf
to ask him to fetch it did not occur to her  turning the handle of the
little car she went back to the linhay it was possible that gray
thoughtful for others had put some aside
as the trolly disappeared behind the door it was as it a hand swept from
byrons features the mask which hitherto had shrouded his resolve
obscure unrecognized it had lain for many a day behind his everyday
thoughts  the general upheaval had thrust it forward until it shone
naked in a dreadful candour  so long had it been familiar that it came
tame to the mans seeking hand  he knew at last what he must do
sabina making the cocoa had shown it him
getting up from the bench and treading carefullyhe whose step was
always lighthe tiptoed over to the wall cupboard  it yawned before
him a darkness hollowed in the solid masonry and with unerring
certainty as if his hand had gone that way in dreams it fell on that
which it sought a little ribbed blue phial with an orange label the
last occasion on which he had used it had been when he adjudged shep to
be old and useless  the bottle was only a quarter full and he felt
sorry that he had wasted any of the precious contents on the dog  would
the quarter be sufficient for his purpose  for a moment he hung
uncertain but the passions which were riding him to destruction forced
him to take the risk  he heard sabina crossing the floor of the linhay
and the repugnance with which she inspired him rose like nausea in his
throat  he went blind with hatred the hatred so long repressed that
primitive hatred of the underdog  as one pressed for time he uncorked
the bottle and held it to the jug of cocoa  the colourless fluid
gurgled as it flowed over the blue rim and the sound striking through
the mans absorption woke in him the beginnings of fear  even now she
might be able to come between him and success this necessary
intolerablylongedfor success  he stared with wild eyes at the linhay
door  if she had heard if she came in and in her high brave way faced
him and accused him he was done  to use violence to sabina was not in
him  he could only work against her in secret get her at a
disadvantage strike from behind  if she found him out he would not
dare any more he would be beaten and it would break him  his spirit
acknowledged that there was a limit
he listened but sabina was still moving from shelf to shelf on her
fruitless errand  he grew conscious that the sweat was running into his
eyes  raising a hand a hand foul with seals blood to wipe it from
his forehead he left a brown smear in its place
the drops fell hissing on the redhot coals and out of his other hand
byron dropped that ominous blue phial into the fire  a splutter and
crackle of flame louder than any of the mans furtive movements spat
out at him  terrified he turned to the box beside the hearth a strong
old box which had come in from the sea and was now used to hold
driftwood  from it he snatched thick pieces and thin queershaped bits
of old dead ships of their gear and their furniture and piled them on
the telltale bottle  when mrs byron returned from her unsuccessful
search he was holding his trembling hands before the blaze and the
flames were leaping over the heap of searimed fuel
mercy cried she at the sight of what seemed to her careful mind a
waste of good wreck youll catch the chimbly afire  us dont want a
big fire tis near bedtime now
she rolled forward as if to remove a log but leadville stood his ground
leaven go  if i didnt want it i shouldnt ha put it there  im
cold
for a man who wore the same clothes winter and summer who had never
cared to possess an overcoat this was a curious assertion  sabina
observing that his hands shook began to think he must be on the verge
of an illness  if so it would account for the general strangeness of
his conduct
please yourself she said and rolled the trolly over to the table  i
couldnt find the butter anywhere but isolda has promised to send some
down in the morning wud yer like a bit o dripping  she placed a
small china dish heaped with pork dripping near her husbands plate
come on make aste she said suppers ready
with his back to her and with those darkly stained hands still spread to
the blaze he muttered that he could not eat
youll very soon be knocked up if you dont eat something she said
kindly  wont yer ave a bit o this pork
if i did i should bring me life up
concerned for his health she continued to press him will ee av a
drop of beer if i fetch it
i dont want anything
well couldnt ee drink a cup of my cocoa
for a moment the world heaved dizzily about the man  he stumbled
forward a space  of yourof your cocoai didnt he stammered his
spirit turning craven but sabinas innocent uncomprehending face
turned sideways from the table arrested him on the brink and he swung
off into a wild incoherent mutter which presently resolved itself into
oaths such as he had not used since his seafaring days  he could not
stop the words poured from him like steam out of a safetyvalve  even
sabina to whose commonsense point of view swearing was mere harmless
breath was taken aback  to surliness she was accustomed cursing of a
mild order was the male way of expressing gratitude for the gift of
speech but this turning in the wicker cone she looked at him
searchingly and this look puzzled and seeking to understand brought
him to his senses  he stammered choked over his words and flinging
himself into old squires redcushioned chair bade her leave him be
poor old sinner e dunno what to do by isself she thought
excusingly  like a bear wi a sore ead e is well i better leaven
be
she drew the pork towards her and cut it  she was reconsidering her
decision to wait till morning before telling her husband that gray was
definitely beyond his reach  if his queerness and irritability were due
to hope deferred it would be merciful to put him out of his misery to
give him the final blow  she glanced at the figure in the armchair
leadville was sitting forward his elbows on his knees his head with
its strongly growing black hair sunk between his hands  he looked
unapproachable and the saying about sleeping dogs occurred to her
if she were to make an effort were to tell him she would certainly
suffer for it  he would treat her to some sort of scene and she was
tired  she could not remember when she had felt so tired  her back
ached and her head ached she had even a whimsical feeling that her legs
ached
she would not tell him now  the news trembling on the tip of her tongue
should wait till strengthened by her nights rest she were able to
take his anger and disappointment for granted
she found that she was hungry  what a blessing there was always
tomorrow with a fence of sleep shutting off one day and its troubles
from the next  what she needed was a good supper and a long nights
rest  thank goodness richbell would be down before it was light she
sabina could lie abed until the pains had gone out of her bones
in the quiet room the only sounds were the slight movements of the
figure at the table the tinkle of a fork against china the crackle of
dry wood in the grate  once a tiny explosion a breaking of heated
glass was audible but at the same moment leadville rose with a loud
scrape of his chair
youm eatin like a adger he said in a tone of suppressed
irritability and taking down his gun began to clean it  the energy of
his movements was almost violent  by this oiling and rubbing he was
easing the strain on his nerves  mould and rust grow in that damp
climate like the giantkillers bean and leadville rubbed and polished
till the barrel was gleaming darkly in the dull light of the wall lamp
till it caught a red glint from the flaming driftwood
what be yer gwine to do with your gun asked sabina taking quiet note
of this outburst of energy any wild fowl down
at christmas stranger birds sootyplumaged webfooted
delicatefleshed came in large numbers to the north coast and all men
hind and farmer alike went out to get a duck for dinner
the relief of hearty movement seemed to have oiled leadvilles tongue
for staring down at the last specks of rust he said dreamily i used
to think as one day i should shet myself withn
whatever was ee gwine do that for  she had the practical persons
contempt for extravagant talk moreover she had listened to this threat
before had even expressed her opinion that there was cleaner ways o
dying  she began to stack plates and dishes on a tray
if you cant av what you wanted said he still speaking as if only
half conscious of what he said whats the good of livin
if you cant av what you want retorted sabina you should make the
best of a bad bargain
no he said simply i baint made that way
she shook her head over his childishness  youm a very covechous man
she said  if you wanted a farm so bad as that why didnt you rentn
the light of the fire was reflected in his dark eyes a spark in the
blackness  he had put the gun back over the door and was sitting
forward his gaze on the burning wood  i didnt want nothing but my
own he said with unalterable conviction  id a right to wastralls
and twas just your oogliness denyin me of it
sabina smiled  how foolish he was how unreasonable just a big child
did you marry me she inquired thinking to clinch the matter and her
voice was the voice of one who makes allowance for a boyish fancydid
you marry me or the land
for a moment he did not answer then the truth which he had lived for
twenty years forced its way out  i married ee for the land he said
quietly
but sabina had her memories  let him say what he would she could not
doubt his young sincerity
and now he added now i wish i adnt
ah that was itnow  she had been loved  she could recall the days
of courtship the first years of their union sweet words little tender
deeds the potpourri of roseleaves that a woman hoards  he had courted
her for more than the land and though he denied it he could not shake
her faith  the past was hers and because it was dead it would be
always hers
you wish that i was gone she said  he had loved her once now he
fancied that he loved gray  it was only a fancy and would pass  the
past was hers and the future would be but the present  sabina had
always lived in the present and it was the present which had betrayed
her
i wish we was never married i wish you he hesitated for a word i
wish you would let me go
she had been clearing the table  her hands worked in the familiar way
she collected cruet knives forks and put them in the appointed places
but without knowing that she had lifted a finger  you wish i would let
you go she said incredulously  you dont mean what you say
leadville  im sure you dont  youm vexed now youve ad things to
try you today and you dont know what youm sayin of youll be better
in the mornin  she had not been able to let his words pass without a
protest the protest of a still hopeful heart surely he would deny
them
i wish he affirmed heavily you would let me go
the difficult tears rose to her eyes and her chin trembled my dear
she said and her stable lawabiding spirit was behind the words you
knaw wem married  its a funny thing after all these years you want to
be let go
but he persisted  if i was to clear out of this
gogo away she stammered as if his previous words had been a
meaningless ejaculation  go right away  whatever for
i bin ere all these years and i avent been appy a man want a
little appiness ins life
oh leadville dont say such things  ive done my best to make you
appy and comfortable
you couldnt do it he said and added with finality you wasnt the
right one
the tears were running down her face her poor quivering face which to
his eyes looked so old so unattractive ive done my bestmy best
if i was to clear out of this he said returning to what occupied
his mind  why could she not believe him realize that for her own sake
she must let him go  even now it was not too late  he glanced at the
brown jug on the stovenot too late yet
no she cried no dont ee go away
one of us got to go then
but she had found the answer the word of power notnot till death us
do part she responded
aw he said and thats it  till death us do part and he repeated
the words as if they were the chorus of a song already sung the refrain
of a chant known long ago and until then forgotten  till death us do
part
he had spoken throughout as if hardly conscious of his words but now a
spurt of irritation irritation at her folly shook him  you and your
ways he cried harshly  tis you thats responsible  you drove me to
do things i wouldnt do
relieved by his return to this more ordinary mood sabinas courage rose
tis your own self that arnessed the arse she said with greater
confidence  ive ad nothing to do with it  my ands is clean
the mans inconsequent attention was caught by her last words  glancing
stupidly at his hands he saw to his surprise and swiftly growing
consternation that they were dark with blood  the minor events of the
afternoonthe slaughter of the seal its skinning the running out of
the oil had been forgotten  he could see no reason no reason but the
one for this significant stain mine ednt he cried shaking them as
if he would shake it off  cant think whatever this is
looks as tho you got blood on them
his first shuddering dismay changed to fear  he glanced at her
sidelong  ow av i got blood on my ands can yer tell me
no i cant  she also had forgotten the trifling incident of the
seal  but tis certainly blood
to a man in leadvilles confusion of mind a confusion shot with flashes
of clear thought the age of miracles was not past  that the dark
intention of his spirit should have been made supernaturally visible
did not seem impossible not even improbable
get outblood he cried furiously  tis only dirt  ill go and wash
them
hurrying into the linhay he began to pump water over his hands washing
and rewashing them till they were red with cold till not a speck of
the betraying colour remained  the flow of the water bright and
unbroken had a soothing effect on him  he watched it falling from the
round mouth of the pump on to the grating listened dreamily to it
running out by the conduit under the flags and with it his horror
drained away leaving him at peace as the flow thinned to a trickle
like a child at innocent but mischievous play he raised the green
handle and brought another rush  the winter rains had filled the well
and mrs byron though she wondered mildly what he might be doing was
too much occupied with her griefs to pay much attention
however stout a womans common sense it crumbles before such simplicity
as that of leadville  alleging a long unhappiness he had begged for
the freedom which should straighten out the tangle of his life  if i
was to clear out of this he had said
to accord it was not in her  if their marriage was a mistake as he
averred and she could not grant that it was the mistake once made must
be accepted  they must as she had said make the best of a bad
bargain  gray married and out of reach leadville would surely
remember that when he had wandered into trevorrick like some flying
creature into a garden she had been the one of all those rooted there
who opening her heart had given him shelter  she could not take
seriously that desire of his to spread his wings and lift himself once
more into the blue what was there for him now that he was no longer
young but the security of the garden the sheltering walls of that one
heart
sabina hungry for an old age of peace and affection turned in thought
to a couple well known in tregols the henwoods of curyarnon  married
after a long courtship and the father of boys and girls mr henwood had
yet had two sons by a woman of the village  though the scandal was open
the wife had chosen to ignore it and in the end he had gone back to
her  now an example of senile devotion they were tottering hand in
hand down the gradual hill  sabina envied them  like mrs henwood she
felt that she could wait and when the time came forgive
the kitchen was always tidy but some of the parcels that had been
brought from stowe still lay on the sidetable and rolling herself in
tired fashion across the room she began to sort them  cottons
needles a roll of flannel unbleached calico for the hams and a new
accountbook they were speedily drafted into drawers and workbox but
behind the parcel of drapery lay an object the purchase of which she
had forgotten  for a moment she looked at it in sadness and
uncertainty then with the faint dawnings of a smile  gray had
executed the commission with which she had been charged  she had bought
the pipe a good one with an amber mouthpiece and it lay before sabina
on the blue and red tablecloth leadville smoked by fits and starts
and for some days his foul and blackened pipe had lain untouched on
the mantelshelf  with the thought of the mans material welfare she put
the new pipe by the old  let him go go where  he had no trade no
money and he was getting up in years  her kind heart saw him drifting
on the tides of poverty saw him submerged and she shook her head  for
this reason and for every other she must not let him have the freedom
that he askedit was too late
for a moment the oppression that was clouding her mind lifted on a
sunset thought  she could imagine his surprise when he found the new
pipe by the old his pleasure and the word of thanks she would be
accorded  by then he would know gray was out of reach and though his
vanity might suffernot even now could the wife believe it was more than
vanitythe pipe smoked and smoking sweetly must remind him of the tried
companion who for so many years had looked after his creature comforts
and given him with one exception everything he asked
she must have patience
she was so tired that if she did not go to bed she felt she would sink
away through cone and trolly sink into nothingness  lifting the jug of
cocoa from the stove and carrying it with her she went out of the
kitchen and down the long passage to her room
good night she called
                             chapter xiv
sabinas voice not having been modified by the habit of rooms had a
resonant carrying note  good night she had said and the sound
travelling out to the linhay fell on leadvilles ears
through the skylight in the high sloping roof the moon was dimly
sketching shelves and barrels and the absorbed figure of the man  he
stood his eyes fixed on the swelling and diminishing flow of the water
his hand on the pump the belllike voice calling good night a good
night to new days and the following years broke the spell  the two
short sounds did not however reach his mind as a word with a certain
meaning  they were to him the beginning of a familiar sequence of
sound  tap tap tap the hammer was at work again  a puzzled look
came into his eyes and he drew his black brows together in the effort to
understand who was knocking innot nails no but largeheaded brass
tacks  he became aware in some inward manner which yet was convincing
of a polished surface of light wood on which were two curving rows of
round brass heads two complete rows  the shaped board with the rows of
cut clasps was oddly familiar  he had seen it before but where  he
struggled to retain the vision to see more but it broke into
innumerable yellow points specks of dancing light he shook his rough
head as if the lights were dazzling him and turning away began to dry
his hands  from time to time he had had glimpses of wood and even of
brass nails but never so clear a vision  he wondered whether now that
the rows were complete to the last round head the knocking would cease
this knocking which had haunted him for so long
in order to husband the lampoil sabina before going to bed had
lowered the wick but byron had a dislike of shadows and obscurity
before he turned up the light however a furtive glance assured him the
brown jug was gone from the stove
its disappearance though expected gave him a shock while he in the
linhay had been oddly forgetful of the event he had prepared the
moment had come and passed that moment so heavily charged with
possibilities the moment of the last chance  it was as if having laid
the train another had touched off the fuse  the matter had been taken
out of his hands and though startled he was conscious of relief  the
thing was done
old squires chair which stood during the day to the right of the
hearth had been pushed against the wall sabina tidying the room had
supposed that her husband would soon go to bed he however was no more
conscious of a desire for rest than if it had been morning replenishing
the fire he sat down but though the maker of the chair had shaped it
cunningly byron neither leaned back in it nor relaxed his limbs
the catch of the door opening into the house was weak and suddenly the
long passage that began at the kitchen and ended at the justiceroom
was filled with whispering sounds  a breeze wandering in had lost
itself in the darkness  it pulled at the handle until leadville
sitting forward his head sunk between his shoulders in the attitude of
a bird of prey his mind concentrated on the approaching and dreadful
and longedfor end looked up for him the breeze was winged with fear
he fancied that the handle moved  could sabina be coming back for
something she had forgotten  she had a fancy that she suffered from
cold feet that she must have a flagon of hot water in the bed  to
leadville this fancy had seemed part of her general unreasonableness
yer laigs are gone he had said irritably
as long as theyre above groundthey baint gone
anyow you cant av cold feet
i tell yer i cant sleep for em
well whats the good of a ot jar at the bottom of the bed when youm
to the top
i put the bottle she had said obstinately where i feel my feets
to  thats where i feel cold
he remembered to have seen on the linhay shelf the old hollands jar
which was used as a hotwater bottle was she returning to fetch it
was it her fingers that were moving the little brass doorknob  his
fear grew until it mastered him  he had done with sabina and she must
not come back  he could not stand it  if she swung in on that loathly
trolly and began to potter about heating water looking for the flagon
he felt that some containing wall would bulge and give and what was held
up by it fall into the open
i should av to tell her he said staring at the handle shouldnt
be able to keep it in  twould be out of me mouth before i knawed
on that coast a gale may be blowing great guns one moment and the next
drop into silence  the land wind which had piled cove and bay with the
welcome oreweed had died down during the day and out of the north had
come a flock of small white clouds  they trailed on their unknown
errand across the sky and behind them like a sheepdog ran a fitful
wind  it sang in the ears of the old house and leadville made aware of
it turned his eyes contemptuously from the spasmodically moving
doorknob  thats only the wind he muttered
the rocky shelf on which wastralls was built lying behind dark head and
lower than the ridges of the valley lay also below the wind  a
thickness on the turning earth it lay in an unnatural hush  on the
beaches the tides roared and thundered  above but divided from the
homestead by wide clean moonlighted space the winds shrieked a
warning but the house except for that one breath of disturbed and
whispering sound was very still it kept a vigil  byron motionless in
old squires chair knew that he too was waiting
a board in which were boltholes which had indeed been part of a ship
wrecked long ago creaked loudly startling the watcher  with whirring
note the old clock had told the hour once twice but he had not marked
it  he had been like one turned to stone  in him only one tract of
consciousness had burned with life and this glow fierce and steady
burned in the innermost place in the darkness and silence that are
beyond thought  recalled to the surface the man became conscious of
numb limbs and an aching back  he stretched himself a little and very
cautiously  he was not anxious to draw attention to himself with the
same caution he put another log on the sinking fire he had been
waiting for what he hardly knew but the dream the old secret dream to
which his clumsy hands had given form and substance was rising through
the blackness and the silence changing into a fact  as he leaned back
in the windsor chair he was being shown a picture a picture from
which if he could he would have turned his eyes  he was looking into
the big shadowy justiceroom at the end of the passage the room in
which sabina lay
he saw the grey walls the little old windows curtained with white
dimity and the fourposter which for so long had been the bed of
bridal and of birth the deathbed of a family  in it old squire had
lain him down to sleep and then to die  in it his childless descendant
was drawing her last breaths  her last breaths  byron saw them coming
slowly a mist on the cold air more slowly and then no mist  sabina
was about to die  die  he said the word softly to himself  his wife
the woman at whose side he had lived for so many years was about to
die  he shook his head over the word as something of which the meaning
escaped him which was portentous which stirred him in a dim elemental
way but which he could not grasp  sleep he could understand  sabina
asleep was something he had often seen  a healthy creature once she
had shut her eyes she did not stir till morning he was different
found it difficult to lose himself slept lightly as a cat and dreamed
daydreams and nightdreams he had lived in dreams but sabina
she was asleep now  she was sleeping dreamlessly and from this empty
sleep she would not rouse  daylight would broaden in the east the
farmyard stir with life and feet would come and go in the house  do
what they might however she would not waken  he frowned knitting his
brows over the tomorrow which was about to dawn the tomorrow in which
sabina had no part that she who was so vigorously alive should thus
have been wiped out that she should have gone not for a little time
but for ever was unthinkable and yet
a nerve vibrated with relief with a slow thick satisfaction gone was
she  in their long struggle then he was the victor  he had come into
the open fought for the woman that he loved the bit of land that was
his by rights  he had always had it in him to fight but not until
driven to extremities had he shown his mettle  at long last he had
proved that he and not sabina was the one who counted that
fundamentally he was the stronger
and yet
the shallows of his mind were alive with darting thoughts  the long
long contest had been declared in his favour the adversary was not so
much beaten as destroyed and yet on the heels of his rejoicing crept
little yapping doubts
the vision of the justiceroom of that quiet figure in the quiet
chamber was for him repellently interesting as long as he could
imagine the fine mist of her breath the rising and falling of her
breast he was only conscious of his approaching triumph  time
however brought a change for now sabina was more than quiet she was
still her blue eyes were frozen she rested in a peace deeper than that
of sleep and whereas the sleeper is harmless
though he did not yet understand his satisfaction began to dwindle  he
drew nearer to the hearth to the warm living fire  the wind still
shrieked a warning overhead but on the house especially the part beyond
the kitchen a hush had fallen  byron found the silence oppressive  if
a mouse had come out of the wainscot and flitted brighteyed about the
floor he would have welcomed it but the place was empty even of minute
and furtive life  the thick walls leaned together brooding over
stagnant space over the dust of dead hopes the smell and the suspicion
of mould of more than mould they shut the man in with his dry husk of
satisfaction bade him observe it shrivelling before a new growth a
growth at which he dared not look it seemed so closely to resemble
fear
yetfear
in the unhappy past he had borne himself stoutly on the assumption that
he was the stronger that he had only to rise and assert himself  that
very day he had put this contention to the proof and now sabina in her
new stillness was threateningwhat was she threatening
if he were to smoke a pipe he would be more at ease pipes were
associated in his mind with long dreams of gray when he had wandered
over the springy turf of the headland seen her hair in the brown weed
of the pools the curve of her brow in the gulls wing when he had sat
by the fire and his vision had been broken like water by the light
passing of her feet  smoking he might be able to banish the stark
figure in the great fourposter and the crowding thoughts connected with
it might be able to replace them with gray  he rose to fetch the
tobaccojar it stood among the bottles on the cupboard shelf and to get
it he must turn his back upon the door into the passage upon that door
behind which lay a something against which though he could put no name
to it he must be on his guard  for a moment he hung irresolute on one
foot then sank back in the chair  he could not go  though such a
brave fellow and so strong he did not dare
during his intermittent labours he had slaughtered as part of his work
every sort of farm creature  sheep pigs bullocks old and diseased
animals the wildfowl that came over trevorrick in the winter the
seals that haunted morwen cove  he had slaughtered as a duty the
creatures were to him food or refuse and he had killed them  he had
also killed sabina
he tried to think of her as so much dead flesh an old animal maimed
useless and perverse but though the distorted trunk of sabina might be
dead the dominant spirit with which he had been for so many years in
conflict that he had not killed  the vision of sabinas dead body and
frozen eyes began to fade  worse things were about than bodies and
glazed sightless eyes
his wife had shown her affection for him by a cheery liking for his
society by an occasional shy caress although she used round terms she
had been easytempered and if it had not been for wastralls that bone
of contention he would have had a good life with her  sharp with the
hinds direct of speech he had never seen her roused to wrath  she had
told him once it was not worth while being angry
i dont believe as you could not to say lose yer temper
oh couldnt i theres them that know but it would be fulish to lose
it for a trifle
from the respect with which the labourers treated her byron had
realized that her cheeriness must cover depths she had impressed the
men with a sense of power that had been limited comfortably by the
flesh
he found that he was trembling that it needed all his strength to
prevent his teeth from chattering  the fire had sunk to a heap of
glowing ash and the december night was cold  with wary eye upon the
door he piled the grate high with logs the last logs in the box
in the past he had often taken sly and secret advantage of sabinas
trust  with a word here a gesture there he had tried to undermine her
authority turn local feeling in his favour  he had not dared an open
break for that would have meant or he believed it would the severance
of their relations  at last however his furtive tentatives had been
laid aside and the accumulated unhappiness of the years had found vent
in one soulsatisfying dastard blow
in her blithe confidence sabina had shut her eyes to the small
disloyalties of the past  if she were aware of them she had in her
largehearted way forgiven  now in that grey and white room at the
end of the passage the parting of spirit from body must unroll before
her the sordid past  she must learn that after eating and drinking in
domestic trust the food she had prepared he had dropped poison in her
cup
once more he found that he was trembling  he glanced at the fire but
blue and purple flames were licking round the logs the dank air was
shot with an increasing warmth and in the centre of each little
windowpane was a star of gold light  he had shivered not because he
was cold not because the wind out of the north was mourning as it
fleeted with cloud and moonshine overhead but because he realized that
having slain the body he was afraid of the spirit he had released
byron had not lived in the west without absorbing the beliefs of the
countryside  he knew who in the hamlet had been piskieledn whose
best horse had been inexplicably found dead which bit of woodland was
haunted  he had listened to the little feet that patter behind the
wayfarer yet leave no prints on the soft sand and he had watched for the
white rabbit that leaps and gambols on the bit of clear road by the
graveyard the rabbit that can be neither shot nor snared  with other
of his neighbours he did not care to pass sombre lowlying treglyn
after dark  the little ghost of an inconvenient child was said to rise
out of the garden earth and byron at least never caught sight of the
housea lurking house set round with tamariskswithout remembering what
of crime and horror had happened there what still happened when the
moon was at the full
such a man was at the mercy of superstitious fear  the quietude in
which at first he had waited had been due to weariness to a reaction
from the intense emotion which had preceded his act  this expectant
calm however had gradually become shot with doubt  his mind had
wakened to a new aspect of the matter  attempting to wrest wastralls
from a hand of flesh and blood he found in its place the clasp of
spectral fingers
byron looking into the future saw a ghostly presence in the ancient
house saw it gliding on the old errands pervading the rooms and
passages  would others see it too would they perhaps perceive
without seeing he wondered whether gray
would that dim ghost avenge itself on him by trying to come between him
and gray by intruding on their tender ttette by filling the
maids mind with foul suspicion
no tie is so close as that of blood and the women were of one family
would gray be sensitive to that flitting shadow  behind the veils of
the flesh would spirit be able to communicate with spirit  would the
truth whispered in every corner of the house grow into a following
fate  in time when the maid had come to love him she would glory in
his having stopped at nothing to win her  but a first flicker is easily
extinguished
the hour was late and in his growing discomfort his growing fear
byron thought of his chill room at the top of the house  he went there
for sleep and sleep meant the laying by of dread it meant escape  he
glanced at the door which hung quivering now and again under the
uncertain onslaught of the wind between his lighted shelter and the
dark  he was thinking of another door the one that shut sabina into
the justiceroom  if ne tried to make for his burrow for that safe
place he knew of he must pass it  could he  his mind answered the
challenge with a quick defiance  could he  of course he could
he put his hands on the arms of the chair and sought to rise  he swayed
his body forward big head and broad deepchested bulk but under him
his limbs failed they hung leaden lifeless  not only had it become
impossible for him to pass that farther door which stood sentinel by the
foot of the stairs but even to move escape through the gates of sleep
no not by any gate
she to whom the injury had been done was become his judge  she knew
at last that she had been married for her inheritance endured as a man
endures the mole on his face and finally for the sake of another woman
pushed into the grave  events stripped of lifes concealing leafage
would be bare to her informed considering eye sabina had been wronged
from the first day of their meeting to the last  always a swift clear
creature he thought of her as running through the midnight passage
intent on vengeance merciless
the latch rattled suddenly increasing the mans dread he forgot the
fitful wind the faulty lock  his vivid imagination showed him
instead a hand upon the doorknob outlined for him in the night of the
passage a dim and bodiless greyness told him the frail barrier of wood
was all that stood between him and a just but awful vengeance  no
wonder that mere flesh and blood shrank cowering that to the guilty
creature it was as if his parts were falling away from him as if he
were sinking into the thin unprotected shell of himself
a gust of wind tore across the wide peace of the sky and a loose tile
slipped to fall crashing on the roof of the porch  the sharp smash of
glass let in the night let in the wind and the heavy roar of the sea
byron drowning in superstitious terror strained his ears to catch
among the many sounds that which should fulfil his dread anticipation
and as he waited as he listened the latch of the door slipped over the
catch
slowly the green door swayed to an impulse from the farther side  cold
air poured into the room from all the unwarmed chambers beyond the
kitchen from that great room at the end  the narrow strip of black
began to widen ominously and in byrons guilty breast it was as if his
heart had ceased to beat  between his lips his dry tongue made a
hoarse feeble sound neither a cry nor a groan but the utterance of a
man in his extremity  the door swung creaking on its hinges and the
flame in the illfed lamp leapt up and died  above the other sounds
above that distant roar and the creaks and murmurs of an old draughty
house rose a heavy stumbling the crash of a fall  the outer edge of
fear the limit of endurance had been passed and byron had fallen in a
swoon across the hearth
                              chapter xv
behind the hurrying clouds the moon had risen into a clear space of sky
and now hung low her chill yet faithful breast towards her mate  the
light fell on the yard of wastralls on the still pond in the corner and
the geese sleeping beside it on the irregular outline of the houses and
courts and on the windows of the farmstead
at one corner a little casement that looked towards the morning sun
was swinging open its white curtain flowing in the stream of air and
on the porch through the black aperture of a broken pane the light
poured over winternipped geraniums  it poured too through the
diamonds of the kitchen window and lay in bright squares on table and
floor  the illfed lamp expiring in the sudden draught from the porch
had tainted the air and time had drawn over the face of the fire a veil
of ash
what looked like a heap of rags had been flung across the desecrated
hearth  it lay beyond the square of moonlight and below the faint glow
of the smouldering logs and but for its density might have been a
companion shadow to those whispering in the corners of the wide low
room
with a clash of metal upon metal a door swung to failed to catch and
banged again  the huddle of clothes as if recalled to life by the
broken irritating sounds moved a little and presently dragged itself
with evident difficulty into a sitting posture  byron falling across
the fender had bruised himself against the steel edge and he came out
of nothingness into dull but growing discomfort  his shoulder having
struck the boss of the oven door pained him his head having hit the
stone floor ached  what had happened  how had he hurt himself  why
was he lying on the kitchen floor  his heavy head swung round till his
gaze was caught by the fitful movement of the door  he knitted his dark
brows but the memories connected with it escaped him  a current of air
was passing through some open window into wastralls and in obedience to
its impulse the door was swinging  the mans mind alive to the
practical went from window to window on the groundfloor until it
found the one of which the fastening was insecure  he settled on it
with a feeling of satisfaction and making a further effort dragged
himself to his feet
in spite of the low fire and the thin current of wintry air flowing in
from the passage the atmosphere of the kitchen was warm and pleasant
the moonlight made the few pieces of furniture the high glazed china
cupboard the press the tables dimly visible  byron his hand to an
aching back was conscious of the homely comfortable nature of his
surroundings
he had forgotten the extremity of terror out of which he had slipped
into a merciful unconsciousness but he was still confused still sore
and in the familiar aspect of the room he found a certain solace
this was his home his place his for as long as he should live  he had
a feeling that something had happened which made the place more
indubitably absolutely his than hitherto and balancing himself first
on one foot then on the other he stared about him heavily content
the thick walls the manypaned windows the plain familiar black of the
rafters and whitewash of the walls  his  his till the end of time he
smiled to himself and the smile on that haggard bloodstained face was
that of a child who after long waiting has been given the plaything it
desires
the arms of the big chair wooed him to comfort but out of the void
byron had brought the conviction that his work was not yet finished  in
a dull bemused way the way of a man conscious of little but physical
weariness he pondered the effort which was required of him  what was
it he had to do before he could slouch away to bed
his glance swung from side to side questioning the friendly faces of
the furniture pausing eventually on the still swinging door  that
door yes  he considered its dark oblong and shining handle  the round
brass knob bright in the general dimness a tiny moon against the
blackness of the door drew him yet deep in himself was a stiff
reluctance  he groped in the confusion of his mind for understanding
until suddenly like an icelandic geyser memory tore its way out
he remembered  theya vague they of several personalitieshad goaded
him to desperation  he saw himself crossing a room taking a bottle out
of the cupboard pouring the contents into a jug  one moment he had
been innocent of this tremendous act in the next it was accomplished
he stood amazed at this new vision of himself the doer of deeds  the
lack of hesitation the steadiness the decision surprised him  he had
not known of what he was capable and for a moment he was wholly
pleased
further recollections showed a falling off  he had become gradually
conscious of guilt he had grovelled in superstitious terror  guilt
he shook his head like a dog shaking drops of water from its coat  a
man may do what he can  his deeds are between him and his soul and the
fear of punishment is a survival from the times when he was subservient
to the will of another  whatever the quality of a mans deeds the
doing of them proves him  byron his back to the dying fire his dark
head rising above the mantelshelf drew himself up  he had been
humiliated and he resented it  living by faith he had long cherished
the difficult belief that of the two personalities his and sabinas
his was the stronger true he had wasted his energies in a daydream
while she ordered their lives but he had known that this must come to
an end and behold when the crucial moment arrived he had played a
mans part  if she were able to see the past in true perspective she
must acknowledge the provocation given must see that he had been
driven that no other course was open to him  a longer endurance on his
part would have been weakness and would have justified her in
withholding the land  she must at long last see how wrongly she had
acted
if on the contrary she were to resent his snatching from her that poor
fagend of life if she were incapable to seeing his point of view if
in unsaintly rancour she decided to haunt her old home he decided that
he would not care a spirit hand cannot strike nor a ghostly whisper
vex she might wander through wastralls wail in the keyholes and the
chimneys but it should make no difference  she would be but a fancy of
the dusk a shade flitting from room to room a presence  if gray
became conscious of it she would only voice a regret which had already
lost its poignancy  sabina could not interfere with their possession of
her house and property  she might walk but as he did not believe she
could divulge the secret of her death walk she might
moreover if she haunted wastralls it would only be to see come to pass
what she least desired  another would farm the land another take her
place indoors  for her to haunt them would only bring her additional
pain she not they would suffer  byron laughed hoarsely for by
killing her he had indeed avenged her treatment of him but in that
contented laughter was still a note of surprise  he had known that he
could act with decision yet was surprised to find that he had done so
a thin wave of selfgratulation flowed over his weary mind  he had
justified himself yethad healtogether
a man is not looked on as a foreigner by his neighbours without
knowing and resenting it  only by an assumption of superiority can he
equalize matters  for many years byron had been contemptuous of the
opinions held by the community  at last his contempt had found concrete
expression  he had dared and he knew that no man of that community no
rosevear brenton or old would dare as much  yes he had shown a
courage such as they if they knew of it must secretly envy and yet
he had not been altogether brave  though he had taken life he had been
abjectly afraid  unable to recapture the ecstasy of that anguish he
looked back in shame and doubt  unseemly terror had given shape to a
black nothing and that nothing had been stronger than he before he
could be at peace with himself he must rise above this humiliation
prove it to have been momentary a lapse
stiffening himself he gazed at the door which had now swung wide
uncovering the black mouth of the passage what a fool he had been to
think that sabina had come in search of him  and even if she had
afraid of a dead woman  he set his teeth yet felt his heart leaping and
the blood singing in his ears  afraid  he would showhimselfthat
nothing neither apparition nor invisible presence could daunt him
let sabina have her will she was only sabina  he grasped eagerly at
the new thought  only sabina  not some unknown unimaginable terror
but the tame convenient sabina with whom he had lived in domestic
intimacy for so long how could he have fancied that by dying she had
become invested with horrific power  he cursed his folly and the words
that came to his tongue were bigsounding foreign words that he had
already uttered once that night words which had come to him out of the
days when he had sailed with strange men in strange waters  the curses
were echoed back to him out of the passage and for a moment the sound
once more stirred his blood with the cold finger of fear  this time he
only swore more loudly and the old words evoking the atmosphere of
daredevilry with which he had been once familiar gave him courage
memories that lay at the back of his mind memories of lands where human
life is of less importance than that of a sheep of dangers and
adventures recurred to him  his voice was no longer a hoarse threat
it filled the kitchen with a round full sound dominating the seen and
the unseen stiffening him until he knew there was nothing he would not
dare  he would even walk down the passage between the kitchen and the
justiceroom and open that green door at the end
those roistering nights in south american cities had been a reaction
from the pent life on shipboard had been spiced with hot dangers mad
loves and sudden death but this last adventure was one on which no man
would willingly embark  byron with his heart cold and middle age in
his limbs would go as a man goes on direful errand he would go because
he must prove his courage his right to take sabinas place to own
wastralls to play the lover this was his hour and if he avoided the
issue he must admit that thosehe said those but he meant one
onlywho had held him of no account were right byrons outer life had
for many years been eventless but his dreams had been a shifting drama
full of colour a play enacted for one spectator himself  now that
dissatisfied one was insisting on reality instead of dreams and in his
state of dullreaction from the terrors of the supernatural he was
willing  he saw however that what was to do should be done at once
the courage of flesh and blood is a poor thing at best and if he stayed
upon his going likely to run out at the fingertips
his hands as he took a candle from the linhay shelf and lighted it
were cold  drawing water he braced himself by drinking great gulps of
the icy fluid and thus invigorated returned to the kitchen with his
head up  nor indeed until he reached the door did he hesitate and
then it seemed to him that the room was a snug place and quite
peculiarly safe  in leaving it he was courting danger leaving himself
without a wall to set his back against
the candle flame leaping in a crosscurrent of air revealed the door at
the end of the passage and byron saw with relief that it was shut
this to his mind proved the hollowness of his late fears  a spirit
should be able to pass through the wood of a shut door to slip through
crack or keyhole but the contrary is maintained by those who claim to
know  doors they say may be burst open handles may turn without
visible agency but once the bolt is shot or the key turned the haunt
must remain on the other side  that closed green door proved to byron
that the disembodied sabina had not left her room that his terrors had
been without foundation  with his lips twisted in a contemptuous grin
he stepped into the passage
his nailed boots struck the stones with a clash that echoed up the
staircase  wastralls was so resoundingly empty that the brave sound was
heard whispering away in the attics whispering as do the monuments of
extinct families in the weekday quiet of a church  step by step for
the air seemed to him of the consistency of mud the man pushed his way
to left of him were doors doors without significance doors which
opened upon innocent and commonplace parlours  he passed these without
seeing them and came at last to the heavy door of the old justiceroom
this door had a strong lock and was of stout wood nevertheless it was
being shaken from within and for a moment byrons courage failed
remembering the draught in which his candle had flared however the
cold air which had poured into the kitchen he understood a wind was
tearing at the door a draught from some window which had been blown
open  he suspected the little gothic casement in the eastern wall the
wood of which he knew to be wormeaten and the fastening worn it
occurred to him that if for no other reason he must have come in to
close that window  as he pushed open the door the waiting wind swooped
on the candle flame and left him in darkness  a noise of banging and
howling assailed his ears but the countryman his superstitious fears
held at arms length for the nonce recognized it he had been right
the gothic window which a sunlover had set in the threefoot wall was
open and knocking against the plaster  byron forcing himself to walk
with deliberate steps crossed the room and shut it  at once the old
stillness fell over the place the silence that is more alarming than
any sound  byron his back to the window listened but the hush was
unbroken  nothing moved nothing even breathed  he relighted the
candle and a host of shadows darted away  the room which had been a
mere cavern of the winds showed an accustomed face the shining
features of old furniture the outline of a monumental bed  he looked
about anxious to establish a feeling of friendly relationship  these
objects giving service for houseroom had shared the place with him
they were older than he so old they seemed to him part of wastralls
the familiar shapes were pleasing to him he raised the candle but as
he did so became vaguely aware of change  the furniture wore a new
look  the faint life that dwelt behind its wooden surfaces seemed
suddenly to have grown less remote  he felt that the pieces were
watchful and no longer friendly  he had lived with them in a long peace
but on that night a pact had been broken  they knew and from being
household goods had changed to household gods the guardians of the
home  no longer fitting obscurely into their appointed places they had
an air of purpose  they seemed on the verge of movement  byron
startled by their covert hostility yet drew his brows together  pack
o nonsense for me to think like that he muttered and thereby sealed
their doom  when he brought gray home he would send this old stuff to
the dealer and buy new furniture light woods mirrors bamboo  in
spite of his stout heart however he stepped away rather hastily from
the tallboy  it appeared in the uncertain light to be leaning
treacherously forward to be about to fall and with its weight of
mahogany to crush whatever was within reach
the covert malignancy of these shining and familiar faces impressed
byron but a man can conquer the inanimate he can rend and smash and
burn at least he can if aware of hostility he were careful to strike
first
with an effort he steadied himself  before him vast and shadowy the
great bed of old squire stood out from the wall and byron turned
towards it with a tread that shook the ancient floor  sabina had taken
a housewifely pride in this bed  every spring it had been stripped of
curtains and valances of ceiling and headcloths and of padded
footcover  these when washed had been restretched backaching job to
retain that stiff spotlessness for a twelvemonth  sabina had never
omitted an iota of this ritual  as the bed had been handed down to her
so it should be kept  the spring cleansing and restretching were part
of the mysterious rhythm of life
beside the curtain stood that piece of mechanism which had enabled
sabina to move about the house and from which every night she swung
herself into bed  on the other side was a small table on which lay a
candlestick and the brown cocoajug
as he approached the bed the man forgot the dim hostility by which he
was surrounded in a practical doubt how if the poison had proved
insufficient and she should open her eyes those iceblue eyes and ask
what had brought him thither  for a moment he stood humbly at the foot
of her bed  he dared not look
the candlelight fell on a quiet face on closed eyes on shut lips
she had saidgood night
sabina lay on her back a squat figure occupying in that great bed but
a little space  the bright silk quilt had been folded neatly back over
the mahogany foot and her covering was as white as the hangings  it
swept in a generous curve over her breast this breast which no longer
rose and fell
the man ventured at last to look and his heart leapt with relief with
more than relief with a primitive and savage joy  in the long struggle
between them he had won
the rose had faded from sabinas cheek but her lips were curving as if
over a pleasant thought  she had taken with her into the dark the hope
that she and her husband might soon be reconciled that years of concord
lay before them and this sweet expectation had given her a look of
unfathomable peace  the serenity of her dead face was that of the blue
night the night that is beyond the clouds of earth  she was no longer
the successful farmer the stoutest heart in tregols but something
infinitely remote in dying she had proved that if life is transitory
and insignificant death hides behind closed lips an intriguing
mystery  byron vaunting the folly of a mad moment of a dark dream
interpretated in terms of earth became slowly conscious of it  drop by
drop the passion of his exultation fell  this was not the workaday
woman he had known the woman whose obstinacy and unreasonableness had
so angered him but a creature spiritually changed  he could not feel
that she would bear any resentment against the instrument of what was
undoubtedly a release  life had chained and prevented her now she was
free and he no longer counted with her in any way  she was afar off
human interests had dwindled to the humming of a hive and he whom she
had cherished was become one among many  the conviction of this was
not only humbling it brought a sense of loss the place where he had
been wont to sit at ease had been shut against him and the door locked
and bolted  he was outside and unimportant and forgotten
the last dregs of his excitement ran out leaving him with a sense of
emptiness  sabina was dead and death had raised a barrier between them
which should have given him a sense of security  but from such a one as
the woman folded in ineffable peace who lay before him was no need of
escape  this sabina was a development of the other the generous
largesouled creature for whom the mean and the sordid had no existence
byron had come to face sabina and prove himself the stronger but he
stood before her like a child that had lost its way  for some minutes
he waited in desolate silence his heart sinking his sense of
inexorable loss growing more poignant sabina was dead she had set out
upon a journey from which she was never to return and he was left  the
great chest heaved suddenly and a sob burst from him stumbling and
with the hardly wept tears of manhood rolling over his cheeks he turned
away  the door slammed behind him as he made for the shallow stairs
that led to his room  once in his refuge he flung himself on the bed
muffling his tempestuous weeping in the pillowas he had done when as
a boy he had fled the fatherly corrections of the elder leadville
on the morrow he would awaken to the old life of narrow interests and
lusts and scheming but that night he mourned with exceeding grief
mourned that golden bowl which had been his and which he had cast down
and broken  the bed shook under his sobs and the little hours before
the dawn scurried up dragging after them a new and reluctant day
byron was a weary man overwrought both in body and mind and by degrees
the noisy gulps the long shudders the groans grew less frequent  he
sank into broken sleep started from it with a catch of the breath and a
sudden desolate cry but fell back again  his slumbers deepened until
he lay quiescent his heavy frame thrown across the bed his arms
outstretched  at intervals a quiver passed over his body but he had
drifted out upon quiet seas and waspoor miserable wightat rest
                             chapter xvi
in the bright moonlight mrs tom stood at her garden gate to watch mrs
constantine rosevearor mrs conny as she was calledwalk up the road
a big strong woman was bessie rosevear but full of nervous fears and
she had professed herself unable to go back to the mill unless some one
put er ome  the revelry of the evening though sober and moderate
had carried the party into the small hours  tom had gone off to bed and
it fell therefore to one of the five maidens to accompany her aunt
aw poor sawl im pretty and sorry for er bein so nervous thought
mrs tom making kindly allowance one of er boys should av come down
to put er ome they are always rangin about in the evenings after the
maidens but anyow richbell was glad of a mouthful of fresh air
the breath of the night though tempered by the sea was cool and she
had thrown round her an old blue cloak lined with homecured skins
they crackled slightly as she leaned against the low stone wall
thinking the warm and wandering thoughts of motherhood
the voices of aunt and niece were blown back to her on that cool breath
bessie was a slatternly creature and her house the untidiest in the
parish but she had bred tall sons sons who as long as she fed them
well seemed indifferent to the discomfort of their home  mrs tom
listening contentedly to richbells voice with its clear laugh found
her thoughts straying from the handsome creature whose fortune was to
seek to that one of the brood whose choice was made  as the mother of
a long tail she was well pleased her eldest should be marrying so
early and so well  jims auntie would leave him what she had while
whatever happened to wastralls sbina would see they didnt want for
nothing while she was livin  the young couple would have every chance
of gettin on in the world and the mother who had been a fishsellers
daughter living from hand to mouth took stock of their future with a
grateful heart  she had done well for herself and gray with a
goodlivin ardworkin feller like jim might do even better  she
hoped the other maidens would follow their sisters example but with
the hope a doubt a doubt of richbell threaded itself darkly through
the loose gold of her meditations richbell the pretty madcap was just
the one to leap before she looked and of the lads who wanted her to
take the least promising  mrs tom shook her own still pretty head
the world would be a happier more comfortable place if parents had the
arranging of their childrens future at least in matrimony
from where she stood a stretch of bright water was visible  the sea
was calling in a hoarse undertone a sort of thunderous roar which yet
did not deaden other sounds and looking down mrs toms glance rested
on the courts and outhouses of wastralls  if sabina had her way gray
and her young husband would live there  again the wise woman shook her
head  leadville might prove a snake in the grass  sbina was a good
sort but she wasnt sensible  if she ad been she would av left the
farmin to er man  mrs tom was sorry for leadville mumpin round
like an ole dog and e wi the finest farm in the valley and just
longin to put is strength into the workin of it  a womans place was
in the house making the butter and feeding the fowls and no good ever
came of she takin on a mans work  twas bad for both of em and
worsen ever now shed lost her laigs poor sawl it must make the man
feel mad er oldin to the reins when e ought to av em  mrs tom
her time fully occupied with housewifely and maternal duties could see
the mistakes her neighbours were making and the proper remedy but as
she could not hope to alter circumstances which had made those mistakes
inevitable she preserved the indulgent kindliness of her attitude
the wind sweeping round by the gate made her fold herself more closely
in the blue cloak  she thought of gray in her new happiness and
shivered a little as if conscious of a creeping chill  her work was
pretty near done  one by one each little bird would spread its young
wings and fly away until in the end only the empty nest would remain
to her  she would have been glad if tom sleeping deeply had been at
hand with his comfortable well mother tired be ee  take and come on
in and talk to me a bit
the moonlight revealed the empty stretch of road the sharp shadows of
the hedges and at the top the rounded tower of the mill  a patch of
moving blackness could presently be descried  through the windy stir
came the light patter of running feet and in a minute richbell
breathless and gay almost fell into her mothers arms
now wildego where you gwine in such a hurry protested mrs tom
oh mammy i dunno  im so delighted i dunno what to do wi meself
av ee enjoyed yourself this evening then
ah i should think i had  with two lads glowering at each other
across the harmonium richbell had been entirely happy

of richbells ead of air bronze hair with warm lights  did i hear

sailor dependent for his prospects on an uncle who had other nephews

mrs tom was not to be turned from the point she was making  an
percys always after the maidens
richbell laughed  she knew her power over the lads
mrs tom understood the laugh  e baint always ome she said
answering its young complacency percys a sailor and they say sailors

but richbells selfconfidence was not to be shaken oh its only a
bit of chaff  why mammy i like a bit of chaff myself
yes but youll find my dear that whats good for the goose baint

another
but the girl was not one to take advice  i shall only be young once
she said and i shall travel me own road  you talk about me didnt
you have chaps after you  you havent got the first man you went with
have you
she had carried the war into the enemys country from sage maturity
mrs tom fell back a score of years fell back to the days when she too
must make her choice
did you now mammy insisted the girl
my dear mrs tom was groping for her mislaid dignity your father
was my first sweetheart
well then youth had caught a word here and a glance there enough
lime for her mortar well then he wasnt always your sweetheart
i was to plymouth in service and he was ere  we didnt care for
letterwritin
who was that chap in plymouth then
mrs tom gave way  oh a sailor like they all are eve done very
well for isself  es a captain now
mammy  out of two hints richbell had evolved a fact  twasnt that
man that left the impudent message for daddy last summer was it
take and old yer tongue do  but recollection had lighted mrs toms
eyes with laughter
well was it

why didnt you have him
because i liked your father best  remembering the lesson she had been
trying to inculcate she added more soberly e ad the promise of a
good farm
that had nothing to do with it said youth shrewdly you liked him
well i did  and she continued happily i eard e was goin wi
nina old and i came ome to see

i run right against them up to four turnins and i gived im a look

left her
there and then
iss mammy
we was married in a month from that day but come my dear tis
blowin up for a storm and we better go in now  you got to go down to
wastralls early tomorrow mornin
they glanced along the road and from hember standing boldly out from
the hillside it was as if wastralls lay in a hollow
why said richbell with suddenly awakened interest look mammy
some ones still up down there theres a light in the kitchen window
tis late too
the girl shivered and drew nearer to her mother  i expect its uncle
leadville cleaning that old gun of his i cant abide to see him rubbing
away at it  thats all he do all day long
poor old sawl thats all e av got to do
mammy her voice had lost its gaiety and selfconfidence she was a
young creature obscurely frightened i wish i wasnt going down
there
mrs tom spoke sharply  why  av gray been talkin to yer
no grays close as anything but what is it
oh my dear tis nothing but er fancy  there go along i baint
going to tell ee
i dont need for gray to tell me wastralls is a whisht old house for
young maidens
my dear said mrs tom reasonably youll be able to run ome any
time to see us and yer auntie is goin to give yer twenty pound good
money ednt it
iss well i know thats all right returned richbell soberly
sabinas openhandedness had put many a pleasure in her way
nevertheless instinct warned her against the place and she was mrs
toms own child
well why dont you like goin there
i dont feel i like she hesitated lowering her voice i dont feel
i like uncle leadville
theres no arm in im encouraged the mother although e do look
downy  anyow es nothing to do with you  youll be with yer auntie
iss  the girl could not put into words her feeling that leadville
being fundamentally different from the easygoing folk among whom she
had hitherto lived was vaguely alarming  well he never look yer
straight in the face
my dear thats the way ofn  e ednt goin to take no notice of
you
mammy  she put her young arms round her mothers neck so proving
herself the taller by a couple of inches i wish you would go down with
me tomorrow morningi dont feel i like goin by myself
who could resist richbell when richbell changed from gay defiance to
entreaty  not mrs tom  well ill go down with you  i shall be able
to see your auntie the same time  ill light up the fire before i go
and the kettlell be boiling by the time i get back  come my dear
she turned and walked up the trim path of seagravel edged with quartz
lets be goin in else we shant get up early in the mornin
december dawns are late and though as mrs tom had feared the tired
family slept until after cockcrow morning had not broken when she and
richbell hurried down between the tamarisks silvergrey with frost and
in at the yard gate of wastralls  george biddick crossing from the
shed to the stables nodded a greeting but otherwise the yard was
deserted
mrs tom called after him  pretty rough wind last night
iss he said with a gesture towards the roof  i see its blawed off
one of the tiles and broke a pane of glass
you wont be able to get it mended now till after christmas said mrs
tom sympathetically  she pressed her face against the window peering
in  no one up yet
well they didnt go to bed till late last night richbell reminded
her
dessay theyve overslept theirself  mrs tom took the door key from
under a stone where sabina had hidden it in readiness  during the
night with one of the rapid changes to which that coast is liable the
wind had dropped frost had stilled the thousand voices of the earth
and in the house doors hung without creak or movement and the chimneys
were hushed  as she crossed the threshold mrs tom shivered
tis a whisht old place she said and cold
her voice came back to her echoed from the passage cold
there always seems some one in the passage she said whimsically
some one who wants to talk and can only say what we do say
richbell tried the echo  mammy she said and mammy was whispered
back to her
mrs tom hung her cloak behind the door and turned upon the world a
business face  heres the matches she said taking them from the
mantelshelf and youll find a candle in the linhay there  now light
up the fire quick and make a cup of tea and ill run in and see if yer
aunties awake
exaggerating the companionable sound of her steps she went down the
passage  so dark was it that she guided herself with a hand to the
wall finding thus the stairs the turning that led into the other part
of the house and eventually the door of the justiceroom  at this she
knocked
receiving no answer she hesitated for a moment and then knocked again
shes sleepin well this mornin she told herself  i believe she
was fair beat yesterday with all that breadmakin and leadville so
teasy funny though at i cant make er ear
she rattled cheerfully at the handle and under her preoccupation with
sabina was the feeling that hember chambers were full of light and
sound and that presently she would return to them  never had she felt
so strongly the brooding oppression of the old house
sbina  sbina she called and pushed open the door  pretty time o
day this to be in sleepin and her voice dauntingly loud filled the
room  for a moment she stood to listen  another voice should have
answered her should have come to her reassuringly out of the gloom
how be gettin on sbina she faltered  from down the passage came
sounds of human nearness richbell was moving about in the kitchen and
the fact that the girl depended on her for direction stiffened the
others courage  pulling herself together she crossed the threshold
once in the room however and she was momentarily at a loss  as day
still lingered below the eastern hills to pull the dimity curtains
apart would not further matters  her hand went to the pocket of her
white apron and in a loud wouldbecheerful tone she went on talking
the while she struck a match  you always seem to be able to sleep
towards the mornin dont ee  iss and weve overslept ourself this
mornin well we couldnt expect any other after yesterday  twas a
lot to think about if not much to do  ive brought richbell down this
morning  she didnt care to come by erself so i told er id come with
er and while she was makin your cup of tea i thought id come and
av a little chat and tell yer ow we got on last night
she had been in the justiceroom many a time had sat gossiping with
sabina while she rested had listened to her complaints of the ache in
those legs which were no longer there but in spite of the familiarity
of the place as she reached for the candle her chatter ceased for very
fear if only the wick would catch but it was tallow thick and slow to
ignite  before the flame was more than a blue glimmer she was holding
it up and peering below it at the bed gazing with a premonition of what
she would find as she said afterwards i thought what i should see
nevertheless though instinct had warned her she was unprepared  oh
my dear sawl shes gone she cried and with confirmation her fear
passed
sbina  sbina she cried the tears starting speak to me  it
cant be true  laying her hand upon the brow she felt the unmistakable
chill of death owever on earth did it appen
the sounds of mrs toms grief reached richbell as she put a match to
the heap of tamarisk twigs with which she had filled the grate  she sat
back on her heels in amazed suspense  what ailed her mother  to hear
her give way openly to emotion was unknown to her sixteen years
trembling she ran out down the passage
whatever is the matter with you mammy
mrs tom was clinging to the green post at the foot of the stairs
leaning her face on its square top she was weeping for her friend  next
to husband and children sabina had been dearest  the bond had seemed
unbreakable a thing to trust in until for her too the evening should
darken into night
oh my dear your poor aunties gone
the girls eyes which had been merely questioning filled with terror
to discover that in the midst of life we are in death shakes the
confidence of youth  with a little cry she crept into her mothers arms
and her tears the easy tears of girlhood ran over her round checks and
mingled with those of the older woman
the needs of the occasion were grim and after the first burst of grief
mrs tom pulled herself together and wiping her eyes on her apron sent
a call up the wide stair a call which echoing through the empty
chambers and down the passages found byron in his heavy sleep a call
which brought him back to consciousness
leadville  leadville
who was crying in that lamentable voice  he sat up rubbing the sleep
out of inflamed eyes  who was calling to him so dolefully out of the
darkness of the lower rooms not sabina
what is it  im comin he answered in his rough bass but he did not
move  the shadow of grief rising from below had fallen on him and he
was reluctant  out of the torpor of exhaustion he had brought a bemused
mind and though disaster threatened he was not yet aware of the form
which it must take  sitting on the edge of the bed and staring at his
knees it dawned on him that he was still in his workaday clothes  this
surprised him and further stamped the morning as unusual
leadville  leadville cried the voice and he found its unhappiness
irritating  are ee dead up there too
dead  no  cant ee wait a minute man must dress
he had slept on the outside of the bed and though the yielding feathers
marked where he had lain the clothes were undisturbed  he knew though
without as yet understanding why that he must be careful  everything
must be as usual  hastily pulling the clothes from the bed he threw the
room into disorder
he had taken off his boots and his feet in their grey woollen wear fell
noiselessly on the drugget  upon the group at the foot of the stairs he
came unexpectedly and so coming waited for a moment in fear and
trembling mrs tom lifting her voice to send yet another summons
echoing aloft presently caught sight of him  in the justiceroom a dim
light showed  she did not speak but pointed over her shoulder
well he quavered aware of the dim light whatevers all this fuss
about
i dunno ow to tell yer returned mrs tom  tis awful thing  poor
sbinas gone
gone  his voice rang out full of incredulity and pushing past he
walked quickly into the bedroom what dyer mean
the mans concern if not his surprise was genuine sabinas death
assured he could think of her as a tried and loyal comrade dwell on
her many virtues mourn her as whatever her shortcomings she had
deserved memories kind and gay and casual crowded into his mind
though he might be glad that she was gone he would miss her  mrs tom
jealous for her friend and with the accumulated knowledge of years to
breed suspicion weighed his words and considered his manner bitterly
would she resent any failure on his part to render unto sabina the
conventional marks of grief  but leadville did more  he showed real
feeling a sorrow that was unmistakably sincere
she followed him into the dead womans presence and together they went
up to the bed  as the man stooping towards sabina gathered the
meaning of her immobility of her sculptured calm his voice rang out in
a cry of grief and longing a cry which lightened mrs toms heart of
its suspicion
sbina  oh my dear speak to me  whatever shall i do whatever shall
i do without yer  he turned with an appeal to the others womanly
knowledge be yer sure shes gone  titch er ands and see whether
theym cold or not
mrs tom laid her hand on fingers already growing rigid  iss my dear
shes gone right enough im afraid
he covered his face breaking suddenly into gulping and ugly grief  the
last doubt that had harboured in mrs toms mind blew out to sea  after
all leadville wasnt a bad feller e ad is feelins
terrible job to be took away like this he gasped after a few minutes
and she all by erself too
aw poor sawl iss agreed mrs tom but shes lookin appy and
peaceful  i believe she must ave died in er sleep and didnt know
nothin about it
leadville looked at her anxiously and his heart was in the question
you dont think she suffered any pain do you
why look at er  you can see she didnt  if she ad suffered er
face ud av been quite drawn  but there she is lookin so peaceful as
a lamb  her tears flowed again we shall all miss her  she was a
good sawl
i dunno whatever i shall do without er
my dear life tis nothing but right you should feel it so
well nobody knew what a good wife shes been to me i adnt ad a
penny to bless myself when she married me but since then i avent
wanted for nothing  never an angry word between us
poor sawl too
twas ard on the missis losin er laigs but after that she never
complained  she made the best of everything
from the world beyond the justiceroom the world of living people and
the everyday came sounds of movement richbell left in the passage
had returned to the kitchen and once there had mechanically resumed
her work  come life come death breakfast must be prepared
come out now said mrs tom the odour of fry being wafted to her
nostrils and av a bit of breakfast leadville  im sure youll be
wantin it
the man shook his head  i dont feel i want any id rather go out on
the cliff by myself  tidnt like shes dead to me and i must get used
to it  he followed mrs tom out of the room but his eyes were so dim
he stumbled as he went
well shes dead right enough  ow it appened i dunno  she seemed
quite all right yesterday  she might av been a bit tired but what was
that  im afraid she looked at him thoughtfully im afraid as she
died suddint we shall av to av an inquest
byron was on his way to the porch but at the word inquest he stopped
and though mrs tom dismissed the thought indignantly her heart had
said to her e dont want no inquest
what do we want an inquest for after doctor been tendin er so long
did doctor say that she might die off quick like this
e was ere yesterday and seen er  leadville was trying to remember
i cant call to mind zactly what e said but e didnt give me a word
of encouragement
e knaw better than we do said mrs tom musingly did sbina seem
poorly after i went ome last night
leadville constrained himself to answer as if the elucidation of the
mystery were of as much moment to him as to her  i dont think i took
much notice of er but she wadnt very special  after you went she got
the supper and as soon as shed eat it went off to bed
mrs tom nodded with however an irrepressible doubt wonder what made
er go so early
i dunno im sure  he spoke without considering whether what he
asserted was in accordance with the facts  mrs toms questions were
irritating him they were like the buzz of flies on a hot day  i
didnt stay up very late  in fact we was both to bed by ten
mrs tom was careful not to look at him  she and richbell standing at
their gate in the small hours had seen a light in wastralls  if the
byrons were abed who then was up  perhaps sabina feeling unwell had
gone in search of a remedy  that was possible of course indeed quite
likely  not until later did mrs tom remember that the light had been
stationary  if sabina had been seeking medicine or a hotwater bottle
she would have been carrying a candle
well theres a lot of things to be done she said noncommittally
can you tend to em
he shook his heavy shoulders as if he would have shaken off something
unwelcome  he would like to have told her he had not slept much the
previous night but that was out of the question  oh well you must
leave me go out and think it over first he said making for the door
ill tell yer when i come back
death in a household particularly sudden death brings a rush of work
mrs tom realizing that the brunt of this must fall on her as the wife
of sabinas nearest relative was thankful to see that richbell had made
the tea and fried some bacon  she drew her chair to the table and sat
down sat down with the quick lamentable thought that here sabina would
never sit again  the thought flashed up into poignancy and passed  she
must not think of it now for there was work to be done
now my dear she said when they had eaten and the little
breathingspace between the knowledge of calamity and the girding up of
loins was at an end now my dear you must go ome  tis no place
for you ere
iss mammy  the lively selfassertive girl was become pliant to her
mothers hand
mrs tom made her dispositions  tis a pity that gray went to gentle
jane but leonora must run over and bring er backbetter be all
together now  after youve gived the children their breakfast rhoda
better run up to cottages and ask mrs bate to come down and set your
auntie forth and tell aunt louisa blewett to come down and bring er
machine with er to do the mournins  let loveday go to st cadic and
tell your aunt bessie to come down to elp us and now ill go and get
the room straight
is there anything else youd like for me to do  richbell spoke in
tones so subdued they hardly rose above a whisper
you can take my black things out of the box and ask your father to
bring em down and if theres anything else i want when e comes back
ell tell yer
arent you coming home  hember without mother would be unspeakably
dreary
the girls tone resigned yet unhappy touched mrs toms heart  for a
moment practical matters were put aside  now you mustnt go worryin
yerself she said her glance warm and motherly  yer aunties ad a
ard struggle so its a appy release shes gone  shes taken out of a
world of trouble
well mammy i cant help grievin protested the girl her tears
rising  it seems so sudden
twas one good thing she died off in her sleep and didnt know nothing
about it  its our loss but her gain
but mammy i think tis awful to be dead  makes me creep
dead  you mustnt think shes dead  i feel shes livin  shes up
there tellin them everything about we down ere  shes appy and busy
no more tears  sheve ad er share
the girl was only anxious to be comforted  well if thats whats
shes doing we didnt ought to grieve we ought to be glad shes gone
her little face lost its pinched expression and she moved more briskly
nevertheless when the breakfast dishes being cleared away she was free
to go she went as if glad to leave this house to which she had come so
unwillingly and which had at once proved itself the whisht place of
her imagination
as she went up the road she looked back once or twice and each time she
quickened her steps  the promise of dawn was brightening the east and
in the bay some big sootyplumaged birds could be dimly discerned their
webfeet set firmly on the very edge of the tide  a light was twinkling
in the many panes of wastralls kitchen tiny glimmers that affecting
only the one spot made the sombre outlines more darkly impressive  a
part of the haunted night what had happened there so lately gave it to
the young girls imagination an extra touch of gloom with a quick
shudder she set her face towards the lights of home
                             chapter xvii
leadville left the house with a hasty but heavy step he had slept but
little and his fall the previous evening had jarred and bruised him
carrying his head even more forward than was his wont he went along the
shaly path which led a little circuitously up dark head  at another
time he would have made the ascent without realizing he was not on level
ground but that morning he stubbed his feet against the grey rock and
stumbled over the cushions of seathrift  he was so tired so stiff
that he who had the surefootedness of the mountain sheep slipped on
the smoother surfaces and came near to falling  when at a turn in the
path a lew corner presented itself an angle of rock about a few hardy
plants he uttered a grunt of satisfaction  why should he go farther
here was a refuge from the questioning of the women a spot where he
could rest  the cliff wall rose between him and the north and when the
southerly sun rose its first beams would fall on that high but
sheltered rock  he flung himself down and as he lay on the tussocks of
colourless grass seemed in his weatherworn clothes as much a bit of
natural waste as the oreweed drying on the rocks below
the day was mild one of those we owe to what we are told is not the
gulf stream but something which has a similar effect  in the growing
light the sea shone dimly a pale expanse of quiet water  on the mans
harassed mind the peace of the scene had as ever a soothing effect
his glance roved over the treeless country the rare farmsteads with
each a group of grey outbuildings the cornish moors and the far range
of rounded hills  what he saw was dear to him as it was familiar
those wellknown slopes swelling softly till they reached rowtor and
brown willy sinking to the abrupt black rocks that edged the sea
byron seemed to himself a part of that on which he looked  wastralls
had made ham  he was as he had said in his youth a clod of wastralls
earth dust which at the appointed time would fertilize the land to a
fresh harvest  to be of it and at the last to go back to it was what
he had asked of life  he had been obsessed by one large and simple idea
and in his extreme weariness he returned to it looking across the
land he loved lifting his eyes to the good sun  he was outwearied and
he longed for warmth and comfort  the shelter of his corner promised
forgetfulness  the land lay green about him the sea sang its
thunderous lullaby and sleep was in the soft touch of the air the thin
warmth of the december sun pillowing his shaggy head upon his arm the
man drifted from the manifold irritations the aches and pains of life
into that state which doth so mysteriously resemble death
for at least two hours leadville warmed through by sunbeams and the
seascented air lay deeply asleep when he stirred the red was in his
cheek and his eyes were clear  he looked about him and remembered  he
had killed sabina and now must bear himself so that none should know or
even suspect  it would he thought be easy enough  she had been a
good wife to him and as she was actually dead he might show without
tempting providence a natural grief  his walk as he went down the hill
was brisk and purposeful  to the dead their hour a sob and a black
coat when they were underground it would be the turn of the living
from the future opening before him leadville turned his eyes sabina
should have her due
before rhoda full of the importance of her message reached cottages
its inhabitants were agog  a little bird had carried the news of mrs
byrons death and those whom it least concerned were discussing it mrs
bate who lived in the end cottage of the hamlet a tiny tworoomed
place had for many years been stripper or as some call the woman who
prepares the dead for their last journey nurse to the community  as
soon as a death occurred she was sent for and her duty it was not only
to strip the clothes from the corpse and array it in fine linen but to
receive the many visitors and conduct them in turn to the
deathchamber  on the day of the funeral her position was one of some
importance  she was the undertakers right hand indeed the
responsibility for the smooth working of the arrangements rested on her
rather than on him
when the news reached mrs bate therefore that mrs byron of wastralls
had died during the night she knew that she would be wanted  though
the possessor of a handsome jolly face she was given to timid fears and
after raking out her fire she went across to mrs blewett the
seamstress better known as aunt louisa to have one of these
resolved
mrs rosevear sure to be there she said anxiously and she could set
mrs byron forth if her liked but she wouldnt do anybody out of a job
would she
aunt louisa slim and in spite of the wear and tear of life still
graceful was fitting the cover to her machine she bin poor erself
she said encouragingly  the two old bodies had lived in the same parish
for seventy years and as nextdoor neighbours for thirty  she knew
that fanny bate in spite of her large wellcovered frame and square
face found it difficult to stand alone
i wouldnt miss doing this said mrs bate her old blue eyes still
anxious for all the golden sovereigns in trevorrick  when judgment
day come there wont be many from ere but what will look up and thank
me for settin em forth
if you set em forth said aunt louisa remembering the many shrouds
her fingers had fashioned ive made the things for m
iss but ive nursed and tended them as well as set them forth she
would not admit the others claim to a share in the work of preparing
the neighbourhood for burial  and i think of their souls too poor
things tis better to look after their souls than their bodies tis an
awful thing to die not being prepared to meet god  i sing hymns till
theym happy and not afraid to die  i ope tis all right with poor
mrs byrons soul she paused a little troubled by sabinas eminent
unpreparedness but she was always a goodlivin woman and god is
merciful to the last
aunt louisa turned her quiet grey eyes on the other woman and in them
was a suggestion from which mrs bate shrank in pretended ignorance
must av died pretty and suddent said the seamstress
well i think she has been ailing for some time she avent been vitty
since her accident  louisa was so forthy but it didnt pay to say
all you thought she herself daring enough before the event knew that
a still tongue make a wise ead
mrs bate cried a voice from the road where old hawken rather
staggery about the feet was making shift to carry an armful of fodder
to his donkey  rhodas comin up the lane  i believe she want you
thank you mr awken said the old woman modestly but theres
moren mell be wanted at wastralls
youre the stripper baint you and youll be wanted first  iss
first and last
the child a sensible as well as pretty little girl of ten came quickly
from the direction of the sea  she was shocked to think that kind
auntie sbina was dead she was also impressed with the importance of
her errand seeing mrs bate at aunt louisas door she ran to her
across the little green  mammy says please will you come down to
wastralls at once and will aunt louisa come too and bring her machine
ill be prettily glad to do anything for mrs byron and your mammy
responded the latter a little anxiously but i cant carr the
machine my dear
old hawken who had lingered curious to hear what passed seized the
opportunity  if you will wait a minute he volunteered ill put the
ole dunkey in and drave ee down
well tis brave and kind of ee mr awken
time like this everybody must do all they can to elp and as mrs
bate saw her neighbour drive off in the donkeycart she regretted that
laying out the dead did not necessitate the transport of large and heavy
parcels but it was like louisa so it was she got the best of
everything and always had since she was born wrong side of the blanket
and everybody allowed it was the right
meanwhile mrs tom her heart heavier than it had been for many a year
had set sabinas room in order and removed the evidences of humble use
she took up the cocoajug looked into it then carried it away and put
it on the upper shelf in the linhay  with the certainty of knowledge
she went to the bottom drawer of the tallboy for the clothes in which
mrs bate was to set her forthno need to stream up anything sbina
ad er clothes ready stockings nightcap and all  as mrs tom hung
them over the back of a chair a belated tear ran down her cheek and she
glanced from their smooth white folds to the still figure on the bed  a
lifetime of friendship  she caught her breath in a sob but because she
had so much to do tried to check her grief  yet when a little later
tom brought the black dress for which she had asked he found her
sitting on the floor her head against the chair and her tears falling
unheeded on the hem of her friends shroud
why mother dear he cried with a quick rush of tenderness  i
shouldnt take on like that  you know weve all got to die sometime
she put out her arms to him like a forlorn and sorrowful child  i
cant elp feeling of it  you know we was schoolgirls together
well well my dear shes gone  im pretty and sorry but still shes
better off  we av got each other still and we need to be thankful
fort
mrs tom clung to him  i knaw  ive got a lot to be thankful for
ive got you and the childern but today i cant elp thinkin about
er  what appy times weve ad together
i knaw my dear  he held her close closer than was his wont in
prosperous times and with her head on that middleaged shoulder mrs
tom wept till the rush of grief was spent
when the women whom she had summoned made their appearance however
though redeyed she had herself in hand  she and mrs con rosevear
being the nearest relatives the family only too well aware of the
latters slatternly ways would look to mrs tom for direction and she
was ready for them  experience had instructed her in the routine to be
followed and before long mrs bate with a bowl of hot water with
flannel soap and scissors had shut herself into the justiceroom mrs
con with the bustling help of a sisterinlaw mrs william brenton of
cumean was turning out the big parlour and aunt louisa like an
embodied shadow was slipping from room to room in search of mourning
apparel  mrs byron had stores of black material in the piece and made
up and to the old woman was deputed the congenial work of looking for
it  her sewing machine had been given pride of place on the sidetable
in the kitchen and already the other was growing dark with the first
results of her search with crape black ribbon cottons buttons etc
a heterogeneous assortment  when leadville returned from dark head the
work of preparation was so far forward that the women calling a halt
had gathered for a midmorning cup of tea
when life has passed the adventurous stageif it ever doesit turns to
the doings of others for its spice and in that homely room about
which were scattered so many black garments that the place looked as if
draped for some funereal occasion the five women discussed the dead
tis very good of ee aunt louisa to come at once to elp wi the
blacks when i knaw you be always slagged wi work said mrs tom with
the usual sweet civility of the cornishwoman
well my dear returned mrs blewett at a time like this anybody ud
do anything  id go on me ands and knees for mrs byron  ive knawed
er ever since she was a child and ave always done er sewin for er
why some time back i made the clothes to set er forth with  but i
thought she was worth a hundred dead ones  never thought as i should
live to make up er mournins
shes lookin so natural now said mrs bate who had brought from the
deathchamber the nightcap which had been put in readiness  the lacy
frills of it were limp with the seadamp and mrs tom had offered to
iron and goffer it  she was glad to do for her friend this last of many
kindnesses
aw poor soul shes at rest now  gone out of a world of trouble
shes best off where shes to said aunt louisa in tones of
conventional grief
i wonder began mrs william brenton who being in trevorrick on a
weekend visit to her sisterinlaw had accompanied her and was
delighted to find herself in the midst of such interesting occurrences
living at polscore and that only since her marriage for she was a
woman from upcountry she was not deeply versed in local gossip  she
endeavoured to remedy this by asking questions but as she was not noted
for discretion her gleanings were apt to be scanty  i wonder if
sheve left any will
neither mrs tom nor mrs constantine looked up the latter felt that
after leadvilles death the farm should come to one of her tall sons to
freathy ern or tremain while mrs tom was sure that her girls being
mrs byrons favourites had the prior claim
you ought to know if anybody do said aunt louisa snipping the thread
of a finished hem and turning her grey eyes on mrs tom  the neat
precise old woman gave a general impression in colourless face smooth
scanty braids and capable hands of greyness  she was like water
overhung by trees a limpid stillness in which shadows moved
well said mrs tom carefully i dont know sbina was very close
wi money matters  she never let on to any one what she intend doin
aunt louisas clear eyes moved thoughtfully from face to face  with the
exception of mrs tom she was far and away the cleverest woman in
trevorrick and she applied her witsas do all of us from scholar to
alehouse gossipto gathering stores of useless information never
eard tell of any will she said beginning to tack the seams of a
skirt for little rhoda and i never knawed of any lawyer comin ere to
do anything about a will
what you dont knaw my dear said  mrs bate tactless but admiring
is good for sore eyes and in this statement she voiced so
conclusively the opinions of all present that the hopes of both mrs con
and mrs tom sank  if there were no will leadville would inherit and
there was no reason he should leave it to a rosevear in all probability
he would marry again and rear a family mrs tom thought fleetingly of
his infatuation for gray and what might have been
goodness said mrs brenton cheerfully  therell be pretty ole
capers if everythings left to mr byron ell be turnin the place
upside down  ell be tellin us all ow to farm  continuous croppin
e call it but my maister say better leave things as they be and not
make work when theres no need for it  e dont believe in these
newfangled ways
i think said mrs con uneasily ell teel all those new things es
craikin about and i wonder what old squire would say if is ead was
above the earth
some do say is eads up now  mrs toms smile was faint a twitch
of the lips a recognition of mrs cons tremulous outlook  i think if
leadville was to start is sugarbeet and terbacker teelin e ud av a
ot time wi old squire
mrs byron began aunt louisa and stopped to rethread her needle
she spoke as if her mouth were full of pins  use had made her able to
speak through a bristling chevaux de frise while age made her forget
whether the pins were there or not  mrs byron is the livin image of
old squire as i remembern  she glanced at his elbowchair wide and
built with a cunning hand  pushed against the wall its red cushions
were hidden under billows of black material but this drapery only made
its outlines the more regal  none of those who looked but thought of
the man for whom it had been made as still dimly occupying it  more
than one had a glimpse of silver hair above a masterful face and caught
the faint sound of an imperious voice  i seedn when e was in is
coffin continued louisa recalling further a mountainous bulk  i
warnt higher than the table when e died but i can remember mother
takin me in
e was a great big man wasnt e asked mrs brenton
a lickin great feller aunt louisa basted as she talked and the other
women most of them younger by a generation listened with interest
with the exception of mrs brenton they knew why the old womans mother
had been anxious to imprint the features of freathy rosevear on her
childs plastic memory  when he was dead continued aunt louisa who
in her neatness her precision was as unlike her sire as any child
might be they couldnt get his coffin overstairs  they had to take it
up in pieces and putn together ins bedroom and then they couldnt
getn out  they ad to take out the big winder in the end of the ouse
and sliden down over the boords  i can remember as if twere
yesterday  e was so eavy they had the bier out from stowe to carrn
for twas moren the bearers could manage
and sbina was like im said mrs con curiously she had heard the
tale of old squires funeral before but that his granddaughter resembled
him so closely was new to her
the spit of n  e was a great big redfaced feller with flamin air
which was always stickin up on end and is voice it was like it was
going to wake the dead
i wonder at your mother takin you to see im an old dead man  it
dont ardly seem the thing do it said mrs brenton looking round at
the others but finding them to her surprise dull and unresponsive
she wanted for me to remember what e was like said the old woman
placidly and mrs bate who had received the nightcap from mrs tom and
was absentmindedly smoothing the strings smiled to herself a little
wistfully  she was old now but she had been a handsome maid  if only
she had been alive when old squire was in his prime
i shouldnt think said mrs con putting down her empty cup and
leaning both elbows comfortably on the table that sbinas coffin
would cost so much now without laigs  twill be all that the shorter
and twont be so cavy for the men to carry  i should think one set of
bearers d do
surely urged mrs brenton theyll make it the right size  twill
look funny to av a dumpy coffin
ere betsy you can tack this seam said mrs tom who seeing no
reason for any one to be idle was apportioning the sewing  this done
she spoke with authority  they must make sbinas coffin the right
length for when er laigs was cut off she wouldnt av them throwed
away  when im buried up she say ill av me laigs with me
anybody cant rise up on the last day without laigs
the others showed surprise  very thoughtful of er im sure said
mrs brenton
no said aunt louisa in her pinmuted voice twouldnt be decent to
go before er maker wiout laigs  but i didnt know she ad em
wherevers she kept em to
well she got em in a box salted away  she brought em ome from the
orspital and theym in the lil parlour in the cupboard  i think wed
better getn out against mr enwood come to measure er
shell make a vitty corpse after all said mrs con who had been
haunted by the thought of that legless body and who would now be able to
think of her cousin as made whole by the restoration of the carefully
preserved limbs  her person large and soft the person of a big eater
and small doer heaved in a gusty sigh of satisfaction nights ive
lied thinkin when she die thered av to be something put in the coffin
to keep er from boompin up and down
mrs bate got up  ill just put on er cap and then you can all come
in and see er  shes the fines body ive set forth for many a day
some fat body too she be some andsome body fat as butter
before the others could take advantage of this invitation which with
the exception of mrs con they were naturally eager to do leadvilles
step was heard on the linhay flags and he at once became the centre of
interest the corpse could wait but this was their first glimpse of the
bereaved  curiosity was veiled by industry and politeness and like the
fates they snipped and stitched
fresh from his sleep in the sunshine and ready to do his part he
paused on his way in to break his fast  as he ate the whirr of the
sewingmachine caught his ear and at once some of his briskness passed
well mrs tom im come back he cried pulling open the little door
to him the room always dark seemed full of soberly clad women and
between them he made out masses of black material which overflowing
chairs and tables lay in discreet heaps on the clean blue floor  the
women glanced up with conventional murmurs and he perceived that for
the nonce it was they who were at home there and not he  what is
there for me to do
isolda put down the childs frock on which she was at work  i think
you better go into stowe and see mr henwood and telln to come out and
measure er for er coffin
leadville viewed the task set him with disfavour i cant abide that
job
it baint a bit of good for ee to talk like that my dear said mrs
tom as to a fractious child you know its got to be done  as well
av it done first as last
i know that  traffic in the gruesome ceremonial of death was
repugnant to him and he would have liked to take a broom and sweep these
women and their blacks out of wastralls to clear the place of them and
have it once more sweet and clean  still tis ard lines on a poor
feller
of course it be but there it cant be elped  i dont want to bother
you moren i can elp but still theres things as must be seen to
he stood before her balancing first on one foot then on the other
well he said
theres the funeral and what about the food
tednt a bit of good for ee to ask me  you must do zactly as you
like  you knaw best better than i do
i thought she pursued bent on getting his assent to the arrangements
she considered should be made about avin a am and a couple of
chicken and a piece of beef and then i thought wed better ave a couple
of tarts and white cake and yeller cake and tea  that will be enough
iss he said longing to get away well you know what to do
and youll av to go and see doctor to get a certificate before you go
down to mr enwood  as e was ere yesterday e may not want an
inqueststill you never know
well ill seen
what day be yer thinkin to av the funeral
leadville was anxious to have it as soon as possible but knew that this
desire was not one to which he could give utterance  i cant abear to
think of t he said conscious of his audience  i feel as if im
waitin for er to come in  tidnt like shes dead to me
the women glanced at him kindly  they were sorry for him a poor
forlorn creature a widow man  im afraid said mrs tom
regretfully we shall av to bury er up pretty quick  mrs bate think
she oughtnt to be kep longern monday
monday cried the man and for a moment lifted his heavy lids and
stared at her  you dont mean it why its now saturday
well my dear she died on a full stomach and you know you cant keep
her very long  still i should be the last to urry er into er grave
well see what mr enwood say
mrs con glad of a moments respite from the sewing had been watching
the speakers  what av ee got on yer face there she asked peering
with shortsighted eyes at a brown smear on the mans forehead the
smear his sealblooded hand had made the previous evening when wiping
away the drops of his fear
e avent washed yet interposed mrs tom and turned back to byron
ive put yer black clothes upstairs on yer bed and theres plenty of
ot water you can av
look like youve got blood there persisted mrs con av you cut
yerself
byron swung over to the little mirror by the range across his forehead
lay a broad smear dark brown in hue  though he recognized it instantly
as blood his forgetfulness of the unimportant past prevented his being
able to account for it and superstitious dread swooped on him out of a
clear sky
i dunno what that is he stammered already shaken out of his
reasonableness and with a vague recollection of a similar episode on the
previous evening  it do look like blood  owever did it get there
dont ee worry leadville soothed mrs tom and who knows whether her
words were accidental or chosen theres no mark o cain on ee lorrd
be praised
mark o cain he muttered and mrs tom saw leap into his eyes a
questioning terror
i expect youve scratched yourself somewhere she said easily
taken go and wash it off  pouring hot water into a dipper she
offered it to him and leadville treading delicately among the heaps of
black material went out  he had brought from dark head a clear
simplicity of purpose but now his mind was like a ruffled pool  mark
o cain he muttered to himself as he went upstairs  what do they
knaw about it  its all tommyrot they cant knaw anything tis only
what theym surmisin  cant trust they women their tongues is always
waggin  theyll ferret out the last rat thats in the mow
as he put his hands into the dipper he noticed they were trembling and
with this his caution began to reassert itself  the women must not be
allowed to suspect that there was anything concealed  if i dont take
care he admonished himself i shall find meself in a box pretty
feller me to take so much notice o they  ive done moren theyll
ever bear to think on and ere im all twitchy because of their silly
talk
after washing his face he examined it in the toiletglass for any sign
of a hurt but the skin was unbroken
i avent cut meself he said perplexedly and suddenly the episode of
the seal occurred to him  he laughed aloud  mark o cain indeed  and
me what dont believe in they old ideas  iss theym too fanciful for
our day o livin  he shook his heavy shoulders  i mus pull meself
together  i must remember only thing thats appened is that ive lost
the missuspoor sawl
in the room below the women had returned to their work of makin up the
mournins
e seem rather cut up about it not like e belong to be commented
aunt louisa
well what can ee expect said mrs brenton only lostin is wife
this mornin  cant expect form to be bright and cheerful
i dont expect anything said the old woman still you cant elp
noticin things
                            chapter xviii
as leadville on his black stallion turned the corner below church town
he met the wastralls wagon coming back from stowe with a load of coal
and oil  the sight of the teamster leading his horse as it zigzagged
across the sharp ascent brought the other a sudden tingling realization
of power  yesterday rosevear had been a hind on his wifes farm and
byron though ostensibly blusteringly master had not been able to
dismiss him now opportunity spruce and debonair was walking towards
him up the wide curve of the road
reining in his horsea gift from sabina who liked him to be well
mountedhe waited till jim this proper jumpthecountry was abreast
of him
the missus is gone  he was not thinking of sabina but of the
alteration in their relative position
jims face had been as cheerful as his thoughts though in workaday
clothes he wore them with a holiday air and had adorned his cap with the
iridescent wingfeather of a drake  he was in pairing mood and had seen
in stowe a lickin great wardrobe that he would like for gray if
shed a mind tot  his nestbuilding thoughts were scattered by
byrons untimely news and his face lengthened  gone he repeated e
dont say so  poor sawl  im awful sorry  was it a fit or what was
it
byron impatient to assert himself ignored the question sitting his
horse with a touch of swagger he said truculently ill leave yer know
im maister now
jim believed that he had a reason to dislike the speaker and none
whatever to avoid a quarrel  better bad blood between them than that
byron under the cloak of kinship should be able to come worrying gray
iss he said accepting the challenge missus is ardly cold but
still i spose you think youm maister now
in byrons fierce eyes was the longing to begin the inevitable fight
the youth blithe and with his handsome face upturned was incarnate
provocation  one hearty blow and byron saw the contour of that
admirable nose for ever changed
when you finish up tonight you can come in he growled and ill pay
you your wages  i dont want you ere on the place any longer
jim did not seem impressed  i can clear now if you like  it would
serve the ole hunks right if he were left with the horse and wagon on
his hands
an if yer dont want to av yer bones broken continued the other
pausing on a darkling thought that the sea did not always give up its
dead youll clear out of this part altogether
in jims eyes was a little dancing light  shent clear out for the
likes of you
well now you take this for a warning  if you dont youll wish you
ad
well see about that and being of those whose spirits rise at the
prospect of a fight he smiled  well see who is the best man of the
two me or you
a grimmer smile was on byrons face  knowing his strength he could look
forward past the irritating unpropitious moment to the happy hour when
they should come to grips  oo dyer thinks afraid of you yer banty
cock he cried contemptuously and prepared to ride on
if you was as big as a church and tower i aint afraid cried the
youth after him  as the affair seemed to be hanging fire he tried a
rousing word  an if im in yer way i shall stay where im to
byron flashed him a look full of sinister possibilities the look of one
who had taken into consideration that cliffs are sheer and nights dark
ill see about that then
the prospect of a fight was dwindling into nothingness theres
people said jim on a last hope ud rather see me than you
any more of your cheek young sprat and ill wring your neck
but he had realized the countryside would cry shame if he were seen
brawling in public while his wife lay dead at home  they would not be
blinded to the reason and such knowledge might breed suspicion  he must
wait  grinding his heel into the stallions side he started at a
gallop leaving jim disappointed but smiling for with him too it was
a case of gay go the gordons
a little annoyance was enough to upset byron for hours in a fume of
exasperation and bitter feeling he now urged his horse to a speed which
drew on him the attention of other wayfarers
if e ride that rate e must be goin after a doctor i should think
mans missis was goin to strawfirst child too said a man from
little petherick to whom leadville was a stranger
thiccy fellers mr byron to wastralls corrected his companion and
i know theres no chick nor child there nor any comin  e do always
ride as if old nick was after un  ell break is neck one of these
odd days
the short interview with rosevear had been unsatisfactory in more ways
than one for the youths last words had planted a thorn  not only had
he smiled at byrons threats but his smile had been of a quality which
made the others blood run cold  behind it lay assurance a knowledge
he might not divulge but which like a hidden weapon was for use at
need  the others jealousy temporarily in abeyance stirred and he
sought a reason other than the simple love of fighting inherent in the
male for jims smile  not many cared to try conclusions with the
strongest man in the parish  byron had browbeaten the few who crossed
his path but jim was game  what had happened to give him confidence
how were matters between him and gray  that drive into stowe  the
farmer ground his teeth at the thought of it  was she promised and did
rosevear feel sure of her  a fool for his pains  such promises were of
cobweb stuff  she might promisehis little umuntzfor she did not know
but the end would be the same
the black stallion was damp with sweat when byron pulled up at dr
dereks freshly painted gatewhich in its brightness its specklessness
was the outward and visible sign of the doctors tastes  a pathway
gravelled with small white stones and edged with scarlet tiles led
directly to a creamcoloured house the wide windows of which were
brilliantly clean but uncurtained  on the door a highly polished
knocker twinkled above a discreetly closed brass letterflap  dr derek
was just returned from his morning round and though the midday meal was
on the table his constant curiosity with regard to mrs byron would
not allow him to keep her husband waiting  the farmer was therefore
shown at once into the consultingroom
the little doctor round and rosy was seated before a table of light
polished wood  byron as he went up the room gathered an impression of
bright glass and metal surfaces in a welllighted sunshiny place  so
bright was everything the glass cupboards full of silver implements
the polished woods the glazed bookcases that the man used to low
tones within doors blinked  the high lights of innumerable small
objects the sharply defined pattern of carpet and upholstered chair
confused him and for a moment he stood tonguetied  at last the
difficult words came
ive bad news for ee sir
if that wellregulated organ which dr derek called his heart ever
varied in its beat this was one of the occasions  he had been convinced
that with such injuries as had been inflicted by her accident mrs byron
could not recover and by doing so she had proved him mistaken  was it
possible that after all
sorry to hear it byron  the missus isnt worse i hope
the man breathed heavily  im sorry to tell ee sir shes gone
dr derek sat back in his cane elbowchair  it was a sign with him of
elation but his face was decorously long dear dear you dont say so
how did it happen
byron twisted his hat in his hands  in the meticulously clean room he
showed clumsy weatherbrowned and out of place  she wasnt like
herself all day yesterday he volunteered after a pause during which
dr derek waiting and knowing he must wait had occupied himself with a
retrospect  no woman could survive such injuries  if it had been one
leg or if the head had not been hurt  her partial recovery had been the
effort of a healthy organism a fine effort but foredoomed  the event
had justified his prognosis  she went to bed early continued byron
dragging out his words as if they were creatures with a will opposed to
his she thought if she did she might be better by the mornin
did she take her food
she was eatin like a adger last night  i couldnt elp noticing it
i thought twas a poor sign
what did she have for supper
byron recalled not the articles of food but the look of the table
well i believe as she ad a piece of cold pork
ah said the doctor and behind his goldrimmed glasses his eyes
gleamed with the satisfaction of the investigator who has run a fact to
earth  and i said she was to be careful about her food  if you
remember i recommended a light diet
byron without understanding it had noted the satisfaction  iss
doctor but er mind was runnin on pork  he did not know what a light
diet was nor that fat pork when indulged in freely and late at night
was unwholesome
a hearty meal mused the doctor and a heart suffering from
overstrain  wellwhat happened
since er accident sheve been sleepin downstairs and i never eard
nothin of er till mrs rosevear come over early this mornin and found
er dead in bed  he shook his head  it frightened all the lot of
us
the doctor turning to a brass dish picked up an agate penholder
very sad byron very sad but im afraid only what was to be
expected
it was the countrymans turn to experience surprise the doctor had
taken sabinas death as a matter of course  very satisfactory but on
what grounds  you dont say so sir he began cautiously  id no
idea
if people in a weak state of health will eat pork late at night in
other words give their stomach more work than it is capable of doing
explained dr derek and behind his twinkling spectacles his cold and
keen eyes emitted a friendly gleam the heart is apt to stop work its
not a bad death byron  she didnt suffer
im pretty and thankful to hear that sir  we was rather afraid poor
sawl there by erself might av ad a ard death
you can put that fear out of your mind  in all probability she passed
in her sleep just he snapped his fingerssnuffed out  now lets
see do you want me to come over
so far matters had gone better than byron had dared to hope but now
his heart sank  if dr derek were to see sabina he might realizebyron
accredited him with miraculous powerson what a fairy superstructure his
diagnosis was built  well sir he said just as you like  if you
think you ought to come do so  i shouldnt like for people to talk
after she were buried up and say we didnt do what we ought to ave
done but shes dead and stiff
you dont make a point of it then
i want you to zactly please yerself sir
humph  the doctor considered  i saw her yesterday and im pretty
busy  yes yes it isnt necessary  his gold nib in its cool agate
holder began to run in smooth flowing style over a sheet of partly
printed paper  show that to the undertaker he said passing the
certificate to byron
thank you doctor and for all the trouble youve took of er  he
placed the paper carefully in his pocketbook and prepared to go  seems
rather hard that after all you couldnt pull er through
in dr dereks bosom the professional man was often at war with the
scientific  the fact is byron he said honestly i didnt expect to
save her  ive never thought she would live so long  his experienced
glance dwelt fleetingly on the others face  you look pretty seedy
yourself  if you dont take care we shall have you on the sick list
well sir twas awful sudden twas  i dont feel to believe shes
really gone  im like im in a dream  but in his hidden mind he was
wondering why the man who saw so much could not pierce to the little
more
must have been a terrible shock to you  when is the funeral to be
monday i believe sir
walking i suppose
the man looked surprised  what else would we av sir
no of course i was forgetting  well ill try to come to it  i had
the greatest possible respect for your wife as a farmer  she should
have been a man
tis great respect youre payin her sir
the doctor smiled enigmatically  thats as may be he said and
indeed for him to say a woman resembled a man was the reverse of
complimentary  in his experience the sterile female frequently
approximated to the male in type and habits and he thought such
approximation a sign of degeneracy  he had been interested from a
scientific point of view in mrs byron  she had led a mans life and
she was childless  was the latter a consequence or had the
childlessness determined her way of life  he could find arguments in
support of both theories
byron had brought to the interview a mind filled with misgiving  dr
derek had a reputation for ability and the other had hardly ventured to
hope his tale would pass muster  he had told the truth because he dared
not do other and behold it had stood him in good stead that and the
fact that dr derek for the sake of his professional reputation had
not been altogether sorry to hear of mrs byrons death  as he rode at
a walking pace down the hilly street the farmer could congratulate
himself on the outcome
the streets of stowe like spokes of a wheel converge on the quay and
back from it but near at hand lie the huddle of warehouses shops and
inns which supply the needs of sailormen  the quayside itself is at
low tide a sheer drop of many feet but the children play on its
unprotected verge and the drunken man rolls gaily home from the
waterside pubs and there is no tale of casualties  in one of the less
frequented streets opposite the farmers arms stood the undertakers
shop with in the window by way of advertisement a babys coffin and a
hollow mortuary urn  henwood the undertaker a little chattery man
fond of society and overfond of his glass was generally to be found on
his neighbours premises and when byron rode up was fetched therefrom
by the wife whose tongue was supposed to drive him thither  as dr
derek would have said however it was a moot point whether mrs
henwoods temper was the cause of his going or his going the cause of
her temper
he came in wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and the subject
of beer being to him the most congenial in the world opened the
proceedings by asking byron if he would have a glass  the latter
preoccupied and anxious had not known he was thirsty
i dont mind if i do av one he said with that increase of
cordiality which an offer of hospitality induces
wait a moment then  little henwood who was a man of girth rather
than height rolled himself down the shop  when he reached the door at
the end he opened the upper half and called to some one within
sandra would you mind running in for a jug of beer
a clatter of tin pans reached byrons ears then a voice the reverse of
amiable  do you think im going to run my foot in and out for youyer
walkin beerbarrl  fetch it yerself
tidnt fer me my dear twittered the little man
mr byron dont want beer when hes come for yer to make a coffin
tis for yerself i reckon and quench yer thirst in this world you can
but lorrd knows yer throat will be dry enough in the next
well av it your own way then my dear but mr byrons thirsty as a
gull  hes comed all the way from trevorrick  perhaps he added
disarmingly youll and me out a juga jug of water my dear
and ave you empt that water away and go after beer  do you think mr
henwood youve married a fool
i wish i ad i wish i ad muttered henwood and shaking a head on
which a rim of grey curls surrounded an unreverend tonsure he came
slowly back  dont you take no notice of er he said lifting the
mortuary urn out of the window
i dont said the other simply  ive ad enough of that
where theres a will theres a way said the little undertaker making
for the door and thiccy urn olds just about a pint  ill be back in
a jiffy
left to himself byron glanced down the shop  he felt curiously at home
in it and this was strange because he could not remember ever to have
been there before at the end was a shed lighted from above and
furnished with a carpenters bench trestles and some newly planed
boards  a sack of shavings stood in a corner and the air carried a
scent of wood  byron sniffed it appreciatively  it wakened in him a
dim memory a memory so elusive that try as he might he could not
capture it  the place was familiar the boards the smell of wood but
something was lacking some sound  as he stood puzzling over the
circumstance henwood returned with the brimming urn
setting it carefully on a small black stool or cricket he turned to the
window and lifting the lid of the babys coffin took from within two
rather smeary glasses  the lorrd elps them as elps emselves he
said cheerfully missus ud never think of looking in thiccy coffin and
many a drink ive ad fromn
the other drank in silent appreciation of the undertakers motherwit
he found it pleasant after the annoyances the secret fears and elations
of the morning to be in contact with this simple soul whose one idea
was beer and yet more beer
not much doing said henwood conversationally as he returned the
glasses to their hidingplace but whats my loss is other peoples
gain and after all though i do my duty by the dead the livin as
always been more to my taste  what can i do for you mr byron
i want for ee to come over to measure my wife for er coffin
my dear life you dont mean to say shes dead
iss the poor sawl she died off in her sleep last night and we want
for you to come and do the business
the little man considered his head on one side  you want er buried
decent i spose
so that sabina was hurried into the grave byron was indifferent as to
the furnishings of her journey but he knew better than to let this
appear  of course i doalthough i dont believe in wastin so much
money to be putn under the turf when it could be used for something
better  the missus used to think same as i do she was never one for
grandeur
well you got to study other peoples tongues you know
if it wasnt for that said the countryman with his grim smile youd
cut a poor shine i reckon  well what sort of wood be yer goin to put
in
ive a good piece of oak here seasoned wood what about that  i cut a
coffin for colonel pendarves out of it but theres enough for another
bargaining was second nature to these men and henwood in suggesting
what he knew would not be acceptable was only observing the rules of
the game
byron made the expected answer  oak ednt for the likes o we its
for the gentry folk  what other av you got
theres ellum  its good hard wood and lastin
dont matter ow long it last when tis once in under the earth
henwood led the way into the shed and pointed to some timber
why dont you av a polished pitch pine wi brass fittins  thiccy
stuff was only landed last week  he touched the wood with spatulate
hands the hands of the craftsman  next to his beer he loved a bit o
seasoned wood  you wouldnt wish for a handsomer coffin than that
uld make
pitch pine is more like it agreed the buyer  what would it cost
i dunno as i could tell ee to a pound or two  theres a lot o things
to consider  theres the linins and the fittins and then theres the
gloves for the bearers and their arf crowns  was you thinkin to av
one set of bearers or two
tis a brave way to church town and the missus was a big woman i
think we better av the two
sixteen halfcrowns is a good bit  thatll make two pound  you see
that tally up
well av it done decent but she wouldnt like no show nor fuss  i
know she wouldnt
well ave it plain as possible then  he made a note on the wood
itself and then stood thoughtful when would you like to av it
mrs rosevear said id better leave it to you
henwood tapped his teeth with the broad wood pencil weathers brave
and cold he said meditatively but if she died off sudden
she done er days work as usual and ate a good supper but doctor said
twas er eart  accident must av strained it  e didnt think shed
live so long as she av
she must er died on a full stomach so i should bury her up as soon as
we can  todays saturday but i can be ready by monday
we must av it that way
very well then tell mrs rosevear we shall leave the ouse at
arfpast one
as byron went out the little mans glance travelled beyond him on an
errand in no way connected with the business in hand  life was
terrible short and he must make the most of his time get down as many
cups o beer as he could before his journeymen were set to make that
coffin which must be put together without his help
the farmers arms beckoned and he went
                             chapter xix
that afternoon having snatched a moment from her work of setting
wastralls in the pious order which a death and consequent funeral
demand to run home mrs tom found hember kitchen deserted by all but
gray  the range was open and on a stool by the dull firea stool
usually appropriated by smut the old black and white catsat the young
girl  she was of course in black but the dress not having been worn
for some time was a little tight  the promise of grays frame was
womanly and as she sat huddled on the low stool she looked not only
unhappy but uncomfortable  the mother appraising the woebegone face
and uneasy figure saw that here also was work for her  aunt louisa
could alter the dress but it was for mrs tom to comfort this little
heart which in all its eighteen years had had no greater grief than the
loss of smuts frequent kittens
my dear she said and hung her purple knitted bonnet behind the door
thereby giving a pleasant air of permanency to her visit  wheres the
childern to
theym with dad
and richbell
gone up to shoppe for some black ribbon
she neednt have troubled to do that said mrs tom with a lack of
her usual perspicacity theres plenty down to wastralls
grays little tearblurred face showed a faint lightening as of a
thinning in the raincloud  i heard them telling she said
tentatively that art brenton is home
art said mrs tom severely  im an percy olmans a pretty pair
i should think the maid ud av somethin else to do stead of gaddin
round the lanes
gray knew her mothers opinion of richbells various admirers  i
wouldnt worry my head about her she said a touch of sympathy in her
voice  i dont believe she means to have any one of them  shes only
just amusing herself and when the time comes shell know better
lets ope she will  mrs tom had not found that young people showed
a greater wisdom than their forbears with regard to matrimony  please
god she wont do so silly as yer auntie did turn up er nose on all the
chaps round ere and marry a stranger that she dont know nothing tall
about
poor auntie after all  the tears welled up till grays dark eyes were
shining stars
mrs tom changed the subject  im pretty and glad youre back my
dear  ow did mrs andrew treat yer
oh she treated me as if i was one of er own but grays tones were
flat  with aunt sabina newly dead what did it matter how old mrs
andrew had treated her shed have liked for us to stop altogether
well said the mother but with a little knit of perplexity between
the brows you might do worsen that stilli wish gentle jane was a
little farther away from wastralls
gray had no difficulty in following the trend of her mothers thoughts
i dont think uncle leadville ud bother to come over there she said
adding as if struck by a fresh idea i suppose he knows
dunno whether he do or no  everythings been upside down today and
that reminds me she turned to the cupboard in the wall and took from
the top shelf a box of stationery  my dear if you avent got nothing
else to do i think youd better write some letters for me
gray rose from the stool  i shall be glad to have the job  her lip
quivered her whole soft face crumpled into childish lines  oh
mammy she said looking forlornly across the gulf of the generations
i do keep on thinking and thinking
middle age accepted the further burthen  iss i know you must be
mrs tom putting comforting arms about her drew the young head to rest
against her shoulder and at ease after what had seemed a long
loneliness gray sobbed out the thought that had been troubling her
tis the first night since aunties accident that sheve been left by
herself  the circumstances of this death seeming to reflect on her
conduct had added a poignancy to what would otherwise have been
endurable
we cant pick nor choose our hour said mrs tom gravely cos when
tis the lorrds time it must be ours whether wem ready or no
yes mammy but ive got the feeling that if i hadnt gone away it
wouldnt have happened
but mrs tom could comfort her daughter with the larger outlook that
proves our insignificance  we are less important than we feared  we
are of no importance at all  my dear you mustnt look at the black
side  her time was come and shed be sorry for you to grieve yerself
so  i knaw youve been like a daughter to er all these months and she
did dearly love yer but when it come to the end she wouldnt be wantin
you nor me  she had other things to think about
supposing she was suffrin mammy
she couldnt av suffered anything my dear and that youll say when
you see er face  tis lovely just like an angel  she must a passed
away in er sleep
mrs toms words turning mortal death into the visitation of god had
the effect she wished  gray forgetting the personal equation had a
quieting vision of powers at once superhuman and beneficent  the
unknown that was god and good had blossomed about her homely aunt and
through those dead eyes all might look for a little moment into the
beyond
youm a better and for writin letters than i be said mrs tom
returning after a time to the simple needs of the hour  and there is
people who must know that yer auntie is gone  she turned to the table
rummaging in the box of stationery  i always keep some mournin
letters in the bottom of this  ah ere tis and she extracted some
blackedged paper
gray with death at once simplified and exalted was able to follow her
lead  she had been to a school in stowe kept by two welsh ladies and
was passably instructed that is to say knew how to cast accounts and
phrase a simple letter  who must i write to mammy
well my dear theres the rosevears of st issy and st minver and
theres the trudgians to wadebridge and the jackas and sowdens and
trebilcocks  theym all relations you knaw  tell em your poor auntie
died in er sleep and the funerals goin to be she paused
remembering day and hour had been left for the undertaker to fix
well now you must leave a place for that and put it in after we know
she glanced about the kitchen which for hember looked cheerless being
indeed dusty and unswept  and when youve finished the writing you
better try and clean up a bit
whyyou arent goin back are you
yes i must for a bit but i shant be long  youll find theres
plenty for yer to do  time quickly goes when youre busy
she nodded briskly and refusing to be moved by her daughters
unwillingness set off down the lane  she had left the cleaning of
wastralls well begun  above stairs and below the rooms had to be
turned out scrubbed and set in order and no doubt this washing and
polishing though applied to an already clean house had its useful
side  it affected not only the walls and furniture but the emotions of
the workers and was a panacea for inconvenient feelings  grief expended
itself in hard conscientious rubbings and nerves were turned to the
benefit of their owners into elbowgrease  mrs tom having set every
one to work had thought she might slip away without being missed but
on her return heard her name being called about the house  the
undertaker had come to measure the body for its wooden dress and she was
required to bring him into the room where sabina her hands folded over
the bible on her chest lay sleeping mrs bate in her capacity of
stripper had already conducted thither a number of admiring visitors
but they had been without exception of her own sex  the old woman was
by no means shy nevertheless when henwood drove up behind a black
longtailed horse which seemed surprised at being required to move at
other than a walking pace she hurried in search of mrs tom
if you dont mind my dear she said with something as near a blush as
her old cheeks could show id rather for you to taken in
mrs tom agreed  i dont mind  ill do it if you want for me to
the other emphasized her feelings by a tap on mrs toms arm  the
truth is i was always a bit shy and i dont like tellin about they
laigs  laigs is laigs and i can ardly explain them to a man
which shows that mrs bate in spite of the illegitimacy of janey and
jenifer had a modest mind
why my dear life es used to laigs  been measurin bodies all is
lifetime  e wouldnt take any notice of em or you uther
well other bodies got laigs but this one avent got any  dont seem
hardly decent to talk about em
little henwood however when the matter of the legs was explained to
him behaved with propriety showing only a calm satisfaction that the
coffin he was about to make should be of the usual length and shape
he said nothing that could bring a blush to spinster cheeksif mrs bate
who in spite of the matronly title had never been married could be
called a spinsterbut demeaned himself with a practical common sense
which won him some tolerable opinions
the coffin will be ere tomorrow early ill bring it meself and put
er in
e knaw is business that one do said mrs tom as she watched him
drive off behind the surprisedlooking horse  got a good ead on his
shoulders
mrs william brenton however happened to be his wifes cousin  she
sniffed disparagingly  proper lil tubby  when sandra was ill e was
such a glutton e drinked up all the brandy that passon sent down for
er e did
iss said her sisterinlaw who if not gifted wi good looks was
easynatured but twas because she said she wouldnt drink that
ellbrew not even to please the passon  shes get better wiout it
iss and from that time she started to cheat the craws
undertakin said aunt louisa is a drinkin job never seem to got
enough work to full up a mans time and what can ee expect
expect cried mrs brenton virtuously  i expect form to av
selfrespect and not make pigs of theirself
then my dear you expect moren youll get  we do all knaw what men
is  if they baint out drinkin theyre out courtin somebodys lil
maid  she began to fold the dress she had been altering and as she
did so looked towards mrs tom  well now ive done that  is there
anything else i can do
no i think youve done enough tonight  the mistress of the
ceremonies knew better than to overtax her assistants  but i hope
youll try and come tomorrow as theres a good bit more to do yet
with a glance she included the other occupants of the room
oh my dear i baint goin to leave ee till its all finished now
what next said aunt louisa taking the pins from the crumples of her
old lips  i was goin to mrs martyn because she got two children now
where she only expected one but she must wait  im sure she wont
mind
iss my dear murmured mrs bate livin can wait but the dead must
be tended to
the little band left in a body almost thought mrs tom as if they
was afraid of meeting some of the little people  though she herself
had never seen so much as a jackintheboxas willothewisps are
called in the westshe knew that where death is other less familiar
even less desirable appearances may be gathered and she did not wonder
that the women clung to the companionship of the living  long after the
dusk had rendered the speakers invisible she could hear the rise and
fall of their voices a sudden shower dashed its raindrops into her face
and with a sigh she turned back into the kitchen
awful catchy weather she said she would give leadville his supper
light the candles in sabinas room and then she too would go home
a step in the porch made her look up and she found that jim rosevear
his days work done had followed her into the house
why jim  she noted the raindrops on his hair and coat and that for
some reason he was looking dissatisfied
eve give me my walkin ticket today said the young man and his
eyes on either side of that delicately bridged nose had the hard look
of a hawks so ive come for me wages
mrs toms brows went up but if she simulated surprise she did not
feel it  well i shouldnt trouble she comforted you could not
stop ere very well
that he did not dispute  but theres means and ways of doin a
thing
e dont mean all e say poor old villain
e mean this all right  he went to the heart of the matter  tisnt
best e come meddlin after gray no more or ill bash is oogly face
forn
oh i shouldnt go quarrellin  with im quietness is the best noise
lets ope ell be more sensible when e knows ow things is  she
looked kindly at the man and continued to drop balm  im sorry for the
poor chap twas nothing but natural e should want to work the farm
anybody would and now ell av is chance
fine and ell make of it said implacable youth
well thatll be is lookout  she headed him in another direction
what be yer thinkin to do
ill talk it over with gray tonight and if shes agreeable i think
ill take on aunt urslas offer
the fact that gentle jane was just over the ridge from trevorrick gave
mrs tom a sense of impending trouble theres no urry for that yet
she said thoughtfully and grays terribly upset over er aunties
death why dont ee take er up to plymouth for a week or two im sure
mv sister ellen would be pretty and glad to av yer
well i dunno but his face brightening at the suggestion lost its
hardness  ellen warnes husband was in process of evolving from a
carpenter into a builder and they were thriving hospitable folk  ill
see what gray got to say about it
as funerals on monday i think as you could go on the tuesday  she
looked as simple as a sheep but under the kind suggestion lay an
anxious hope that it might prove acceptable  in plymouth gray would be
out of leadvilles reach
i havent travelled very much  never been furthern bodmin said the
young man and already the note of holiday was in his voice
no gray avent nuther smiled the mother  im sure youll be
delighted  plymouth is a lickin great place nothin but streets and
ouses and bobbing up against people all day long  ah now as the
door of the porch was kicked open eres leadville comin  now my
dear i shouldnt say anything ton if i was you a still tongue make a
wise ead  eve had quite enough today to upsetn
byron coming out of the dark yard into the lamplit kitchen did not at
first perceive the second occupant of the room  he was in a good
humour for the men he had met in stowe had been more friendly than
usual and in the attitude of the wastralls hinds he had gauged a new
respect  the latter had come to him for orders and their manner had
been conciliatory  if in the past they had given unwilling service
from henceforth he was their employer and in their submission he
strangely enough saw himself justified
as he caught sight of rosevear however his brows came together in the
familiar line and mrs tom watching felt her heart sink  a brawl in
the house where his wife lay dead but as yet uncoffined would be
unseemly and she cast about in her mind for means to prevent it
enwood av been ere she said thrusting the thought of sabina
between the men  you ought to leave the inds knaw as the funerals on
monday  i thought praps jim could go around and telln
leadville obliged to consider the suggestion tossed it aside on the
gale of his dislike  it is customary for the hinds belonging to a
farmnot only the men working there at the moment but all who have done
so in the pastto carry the coffin of their employer from the home to
the graveyard  in payment of their services they receive a meal a pair
of gloves and half a crown and at a time when wages ranged between
eleven and fifteen shillings a week this custom was honoured with a
careful observance
old george can do that  e been ere longest longer than e av and
ell know oo to tell  the appeal to him for direction had however
the effect mrs tom had anticipated turning to the cupboard he took out
his cashbox and counted down the teamsters wages
thats right ednt it
the other glanced perfunctorily at the coins  no edn right
theres another week owing  you gave me no notice
byron looked up with a scowl  he wanted to deny that the extra payment
was customary to precipitate a quarrel but mrs tom looking on was
ready  she stepped up to the table
iss my dear she said in her sweet and placid tones tones which
denied the possibility of illfeeling on either side  that is the way
of it ere  you avent worked a farm and wouldnt know but ere we do
give a weeks notice or a weeks pay
the farmer turned towards her conscious of the need for caution yet
longing to persist
iss my dear she said again tis a weeks notice or a weeks pay
at length with a contemptuous flinging down of extra coins byron
completed the transaction  without a word jim swept up the money and
turned to go  as he swung out of the room his head up his nailed
hoots ringing on the flags leadville in a sudden access of irritation
flung after him a few hot words  and mind what ive told yer  you
pick yer bones off from ere
the young man pausing on the threshold looked back in his eye was a
defiant sparkle and his smile was blithe he would welcome trouble
ive told yer before i dont take no more notice of ee than that
and he snapped his fingers in derision
with a furious oath byron sprang forward but mrs tom was before him
from where she stood it was easy to push the door to and she did so
nimbly and with a will  by the time the raging farmer had opened it
again jim had disappeared into the mirk of the as yet moonless night
mrs tom at his back smiled her relief  for the moment the quarrel
hanging over them like a rainfilled cloud had been averted and if her
plan of land between were carried out they would not meet again for
some time
now my dear she said in kindly wise dont ee go takin no notice
ofn tis naught but a young chap and cockerils do craw loud  take and
set down by the fire now  im sure you must be tired
byron paid little heed to her but in the end her deft and quiet
movements as she laid the supper her familiar voice relating the small
events of the day talking of sabina and the respect shown her by the
neighbourhood had the desired effect  he threw himself into old
squires chair and pulling off his mudcaked boots stretched his feet
to the glow  the black garments upon which the women had been employed
were piled beside aunt louisas machine on the sidetable but otherwise
the place was as usual austerely tidy and yet comfortable the plain
dignified livingroom of a thriving farmer  byron tired after his day
at stowe glad to have taken the first step towards getting rid of
rosevear leaned back  he was happy in that this space between four
thick walls was now at last actually his
av yer thought it over said mrs tom breaking eggs into a pan and
proceeding to fry them oo youll av ere to stay wi yer  cos you
cant live by yerself and i shant be able to come always so i should
settle it up if i was you
what dyer mean
must av somebody to cook for yer and do the work
byron preoccupied had yet a feeling dim but friendly for mrs tom
her essential motherliness appealed to one whose reality was masculine
he recognized in her a deep knowledge which made subterfuges and
insincerity of no avail and if he had not hitherto spoken freely to
her it was because there had been no need of speech  mrs tom knew all
the things of which sabina had been so amazingly ignorant and now
sabina with what had seemed to him her wilful misinterpretation of
facts was gone  he saw no reason to conceal his immediate hope
i shall be aving a wife soon he said and in saying it showed that
although he might have gauged correctly mrs toms insight he had
altogether missed her attitude she turned sharply staring at him
accustomed to have her facts dressed in the clothing which obtained
among her neighbours his honesty repelled even alienated her to know
was one thing to admit your knowledge was another and in mrs toms
eyes byrons candour was shocking and indecent  she stopped him with a
hasty a wife  my dear yer poor wife aint ardly cold yet
but byrons perceptions had been dulled by the vividness of a secret
hope  iss he persisted unable to realize his companions point of
view but im gwine marry again
doan ee say that then implored mrs tom whose words were a loose
robe under which her thoughts could move at ease it dont sound
vitty
her earnestness penetrating the mist of his illusions reached the man
he looked up puzzled and anxious had he gone too far  had he said
anything to arouse suspicion  surely not nevertheless he would be
careful he would even affect a show of grief
i shall prettily miss sbina he began tractably and mrs tom nodded
if the words were uttered perfunctorily the phrasing was correct  i do
miss her he continued warming to the task  im grievin now  with
his feet stretched luxuriously his body niched in the comfort of the
big chair he looked woebegone indeed nobody knows what a day ive ad
and she only just gone  everybody i met stopped me and wanted to know a
parcel of questions and me keep on tellin till i was muddled up  i
didnt knaw no moren adam what i were tellin ofm  having offered
his oblation he relapsed into a pleading sincerity  not for years had
he spoken of his affairs but the change in them the hope of a belated
happiness had unlocked his lips  but still i cant live wi that and
soon im gwine marryno stranger to you
mrs tom put her annoyance into a shake of the fryingpan now my dear
feller she said haint a bit o good for ee to think anything about
that  tis so well to put it out of yer mind for ever  one thing i
dont want to knaw anything about it baint right as i should and
another thing i know she ednt for you  obliged to admit a knowledge
she would have denied she spoke with warning emphasis  she never did
think anything about yer nor never will
though byrons belief that his good star was in the ascendant was
unshakeable her conviction expressed so firmly troubled and irritated
him  he sprang out of the chair and in his stocking feet began to
walk up and down mrs tom as she took knives and forks from the
kitchen drawer looked at him uneasily  to her mind he suggested a
bull  he had the closecurled hair the thick body and the gaze
alternately fierce and brooding  he was like a bull too in his ways
rushing here rushing there a headstrong creature using force when
subtlety would have proved the better weapon  the uneasiness she felt
being for her child was like a smouldering fire a very little fanning
and it would burst into flame
you may say what you like  now that sabina was dead he could see no
reason for mrs tom to oppose his suit  with the freehold of wastralls
and his late wifes savings he would be the richest farmer in the
district shem too young to knaw her own mind  i can make her care
and i will  his face grew bleak with the intensity of his emotion
ill av er if i go through fire and water
only dread of what he might do a dread impersonal and foreboding could
have kept mrs tom to her purpose well she said rallying her
forces for after all poor soul she had only one womans share of
courage  tis as well to tell yer first as lastshes jim
rosevears
byron had paused in his uneasy walk  he heard but he was unable to
believe indeed he took this simple statement for a malicious invention
not for a moment did he credit it but he was wrath with mrs tom  if
for reasons he could not fathom she wanted gray to marry rosevear she
must be made to realize that she was dealing with some one who in this
matter would not stand any nonsense  his eye grew menacing  i dare
you to say such a thing to me he cried to me whats mad in love with
her
mrs tom put down the fryingpan  her fear for her child was
momentarily pushed aside by outraged affection after twenty years of
married life and before his dead wife had been carried out of the house
leadville could proclaim his love for another woman  true or not he
should not say it not to her  taking the purple bonnet from behind the
door she tied it on  leadville however was still too much obsessed by
passion to realize the effect he had produced indeed not until she was
walking out of the house did the breeze of her going reach him
whats the matter with yer he cried shaken out of his absorption
im done wi yer and im goin ome
goin ome  whatever be goin ome for
and whats more i ope i shall never come inside the door no more
what av i done
done she cried explosively
he looked at her in a bewilderment the genuineness of which angered her
the more
you talkin like that and poor sbina lying there im fairly ashamed
of yer  a dogd knaw better than that i dont knaw ow she ad so much
patience puttin up wi you all these years  thank eaven ive no
need to
he understood that she was annoyed on his late wifes account  to him
it was as if sabina had been dead a year and he marvelled that she
should still exert an influence over others
oh come now he said hurriedly i didnt mean to vex you but when
peoples dead and gone
twould serve yer right cried mrs tom still indignant if she
should haunt yer
haunt me stammered byron with a quick change of mood  she wouldnt
do that  you dont think shed do that do yer
you knaw best whether she should or no and she perceived without
understanding why that this random shot had hit the target
well why should she  the man relapsed into his ordinary manner  i
dont like that kind of talk  take an come in now like a good sawl and
take no more notice oft
though mrs tom yielded she preserved a certain stiffness of manner
the eggs were cold and leathery but she declined to fry others  tis
your own fault yer suppers spoilt  sbina was always studyin you but
youll av no one now to wait on you like she did i bet a crown
she looked over the suppertable to see that nothing had been forgotten
you av a cup o cocoa at night dont yer
again that baffling glimpse of something hidden cocoa said he
twas sbina that drinked the cocoa ii ate it
very well then ill get yer a cup o beer and as she drew it from a
cask in the linhay her glance rested for a moment on the highgirdled
brown jug the jug which sabina had always used for her cocoa  mrs tom
regarded it thoughtfully  many a time she had seen it standing on the
stove waiting till sabina should be ready to carry it to her room  it
was a part of the nightly ritual of locking up undressing
sleepwooing a part of the old order which with sabina had passed
away
in spite of his bulk byron was a moderate eater  the quality of his
food was as he said a matter of indifference and he swallowed the
leathery eggs as contentedly as if they had been worthy examples of mrs
toms skill
i think i should like to av a pipe he said as soon as his hunger was
appeased  i avent smoked much lately avent felt like it
crossing the room he put a hand on the high mantelshelf in search of his
pipe  the restlessness of the past months had ebbed leaving him at
peace  he craved the dreamy satisfaction of tobacco why whats this
eres a new pipe  owever did it get ere
mrs tom glancing up from her work of clearing the table saw that he
held in his hand the pipe with an amber mouthpiece which she had brought
from stowe
why thats the one poor sbina bought for yer
the unexpected was to byron the threatening and the presence of the pipe
disturbed his new serenity  his mind began to bubble with suspicion
with wild extravagant surmise  it did not occur to him that the
purchase of the pipe was a sign of sabinas persistently kindly thought
a survival from the disowned discredited past she did he muttered
turning on it a look of mingled fear and aversion  i didnt know that
you dont mean to say she put it there  it was as if she had crept
from her bed of death had stolen in shrouded but invisible and set the
mysterious pipe where his hand would chance on it
mrs tom observant and wondering filled the wooden washup bowl with
water and set it on the table  i dare say she did
did she put it there he hesitated calculating did she put it
there last night
last night when he was planning her death had she too had her thoughts
her plans  it was a disconcerting to a guilty man even an alarming
thought
it dont seem only last night it seem ages since said mrs tom
beginning to wash the cloam  we bought it into stowe and gived it to
sbina and what she did with it then i dunno  i spose she put it on
the chimleypiece
it fell from his fingers and hitting the steel fender broke in two
i wont av it he cried violently  his face was grey  he was
beside himself with superstitious dread sabina who should have been
dead still lived  the old belief in her as strong and incalculable
had revived he was like one expecting a blow and not knowing from what
quarter it would come  i wont av it i dont wantn  ow do i know
it might be poisoned
mrs tom continued tranquilly to cleanse plates and dishes but her mind
was busy  a pipe poisoned get away man youm mad  what do yer mean
why she bought it for a present for yer
byron looked from the pipe to mrs tom and a glimmer of common sense
returned  he broke into an uneasy laugh  dont know whats come over
me he said picking up the pieces  im all twitchy tonight  i
dunno what im sayin  im carried off
want a good nights rest said she comfortably thats whats the
matter with ee  i shall be finished in a minute then youll be able
to lock up after me and go away to bed
lock up after you
ill light the candles in sbinas roomtheyre thick an long and i
think theyll burn all the nightand then i must be goin ome
you baint goin ome tonight be yer  fear scarcely driven out
had returned
why of course i be  surely you baint afraid to stay ere
welltherell be no one in the ouse but me
why sbina wont urt ee  poor sawl shes gone past urtin
he would be left alone with this strange incalculable sabina who sprang
surprises on him from whom not even his most private belongings were
safe and who had been wronged  the shadow of past horrors the horrors
of the preceding night fell on him
i cant stay ere alone he said  i cant  no i cant
well my dear theres the children to see to and the ouse and
everything  besides theres no bed for me to sleep in if i do stay ere
and im tired as a dog
he was unable to offer a suggestion but his anxiety was written so
plainly on his face that mrs tom would not deny him  if he were afraid
to be left she must stay
ill see what tom got to say she began uncertainly and the trouble
died off leadvilles face  he looked about him and said in an excusing
tone
tis a whisht old house so it is
well now said mrs tom who after a little thought had seen how she
would manage ill be off ome and whiles im gone you bring the lil
bed from the top room and ill make it up when i come down
i want for ee to av a decent bed  he was for once considerate
search out a blanket or two for me and i shall be all right
her manner was matter of fact but more than once that evening leadville
had given her food for thought  why should he be so uneasy so
irritable and why oh why should he be frightened of the one creature
on earth who had held him dear  when ive time said mrs tom to
herself as she went up the road ill ponder it in my mind
                              chapter xx
a death in the family brings to some members of it unwelcome holiday
tom rosevear though not particularly fond of his cousin would not have
thought it decent to do more work than was necessary on the day poor
sbina ad gone ome and when he had shot a wild duck or two
counted the seventythree redbrown bullocks of his herd and arranged
for the death of a nineteenscore pig he found time hang heavy on his
hands  without his wife tom was like a whiphandle without a lash
once or twice during the afternoon he put his head in at the door but
finding only gray went off again  he was as dissatisfied as a dog with
a sore toe and though when evening darkened he sat down with the
children and took his tea he ate without relish the room which gray
ashamed of previous slackness had set in order was homelike and snug
but in his thoughts tom found vague fault with it  the old sofa was
shabby and the oilcloth worn the place too was small too small for so
large a family  when the meal was over he fetched the last number of
the cornishman from the parlour table and set himself unhappily to
read the paragraphs that bore on matters agricultural and it seemed to
himthe lack of one being the lack of allthat even the cornishman was
dull
the hum of goodnatured clack of bubbling irrepressible life that note
which is peculiarly the note of a growing family and which was
characteristic of hember had sunk to the merest suggestion of a sound
the younger girls having stayed away from school showed by an
inclination to bicker that they missed their regular routine of work
gray absorbed in her own affairs was silent while richbell who had
been trimming a hat and found her mothers fingers were needed to give
the smartening touch sat staring at the unsatisfactory result of her
industry  as the evening wore on one by one the children slipped
cheerlessly away to bed  gray who had lighted a fire in the parlour
went to sit there with her sweetheart and upon the usually pleasant
kitchen settled an unsatisfactory hush
tis time mammy was home said richbell as the rain of a sudden shower
beat on the window and went singing on across the shelterless land
tom who had been nodding over the newspaper looked at his feet  if i
adnt took off me boots id go down and fetch er  he was a man of
medium height who spoke slowly fetching up his words like water from a
well fetching them too with considerable creaking of the machinery
in appearance he was spare and hard with a viking moustache and close
dark hair which fitted to his skull like a cap  his wisdom being only
of the heart he was likely to remain in that state of life to which it
had pleased god to call him  his wife could rely on him for counsels of
moderation she could rely also on an affection which like homebrewed
was good from the froth to the dregs
i can hear steps cried richbell her discontented face brightening
and as she spoke mrs tom the raindrops shining on the wool of her
bonnet her cheeks flushed by the quick walk uphill came in  oh
mammy said the girl in tones that were themselves a welcome we
thought you was lost
tom laid aside the cornishman  just thinking you was piskylaidn
he said with the smile on which she had rested her heart content for
many a year  so glad was she of it after the discomfort the hinted
mystery of the evening that as she passed his chair she pressed her
cheek for a moment against his  he responded by catching and pulling
her down upon his knee
take and sit down ere a minute he said in his most cheerful tone
mrs tom was a busy creature strong to work and to manage and it was
not often that her spirit flagged that she showed the need of a stay
now tell us all what you bin doing
from the room beyond gray and jim their lovedreams shattered by the
sound of an arrival came to round out the circle  they had been
sitting in the firelight discussing the projected journey to plymouth
and the disagreeable ways of uncle leadville  it did not surprise them
to find mrs tom throned on her jims knee for they believed in the
permanency of sweethearting  what were twenty years
in the home atmospherethe atmosphere created by her returnmrs tom was
able to dismiss the dim but ugly suspicions leadvilles manner had
engendered and take a simple more prosaic view of his state  the man
was as he had said carried off and the strangeness of his looks and
words were due in all probability to the shock he had received  he had
not loved sabina but to lose her thus suddenly had unnerved him  let
him have a good nights rest and he would be his usual brusque and
sombre self  she turned from the thought of him to give her attentive
hearers a recital of the days events they would like to know who had
called and what had been said would like to take part at second hand in
the stir caused by sabinas death  tom had a further interest  his
mind had grasp  unable to originate he could adapt and improve and he
was anxious to hear what arrangements were being made for the funeral
i think said mrs tom at last and there was a question perhaps
even a glint of unkindly hope in her tone i think leadville poor old
chap want for me to sleep down there tonight for company  what dyer
think about it tom
rumblingly out of the depths came his considered fiat  i dont see
why you cant
noo
the maidens ere he glanced at his pretty daughters the maidens
ere are big enough to look after the childer and me  i dont think i
should care to be left by meself if i was in is place
i dont spose you would  and with the ghost of a sigh she got up
well tomorrow i shall make arrangements with mrs bate  might ave
done it today but i forgot  now ill go  tis no good putting off
the evil hour still you do all seem pretty and comfortable in here
never had the little room the close quarters seemed so attractive and
tom too looking round found his discontent had evaporated  it was a
jolly snug little place so it was
he went with her to the door and they found that between scudding
clouds the moon was showing a bright face  the lane lay white between
the stone hedges with their crown of tamarisk and at its foot the
trevorrick river ran with faint occasional sparkle across the sands
mrs tom had warmed her heart at the domestic fire what was one night
away  she could look back at tom standing on the doorstep and send
him an affectionate good night  after all in keeping leadville
company she was doing what sabina would have wished
when she reached wastralls she found an empty kitchen  leadville
following her directions had brought down a small bed set it in the
angle of the wall between table and linhay door and that done had
gone to his own  the lamp was burning brightly the fire glowed red
between the bars the cushions of old squires chair the cloth on the
sidetable made notes of cheerful colour and the room darkraftered
whitewashed had an encouraging homeliness of aspect  a pang of loss
stabbed mrs tom for this had been her friends homehad been  only
yesterday those brave blue eyes of hers had rested contentedly on
objects made familiar by a lifetime of careful use  sabina to mrs
tom was not dead  she had gone away exchanged this known and
comfortable world for things new and strange  the other was bound to
believe the change was for the better but after all a change is a
change  she wished the veil that now hung between herself and sabina
were not so thick so deadening she wished with a sad heart that she
might have been permitted to draw it aside  there must be much sabina
would like to tell her
the candles in the justiceroom were burning steadily before arranging
the pile of pillows and blankets leadville had left ready mrs tom
stole down the passage and went in  she must say good night to sabina
this sabina who could not hear  she looked to see that no draught was
filtering through blind and curtain to set the lights guttering then
turned to her friend but as her glance fell on the set cold face she
had a sense of disappointment sabina was so remote  no word of hers
could carry so far nor could the eager seeking of her spirit find this
other which for so long had been in touch with hers the figure in the
bed was not sabina  it was the cloak she had worn and taking off had
thrown away  it had been shaped to her uses it had been hers but that
was all
turning away she closed the door on it and went back to the kitchen
the ache of her loss realized in this quiet hour was a gnawing pain
but she had been at work from before dawn and her limbs were heavy
extinguishing the lamp she settled herself between the blankets  as
her eyes accustomed themselves to the change of light she saw that the
room was not in darkness  pale diamonds of moonlight lay on floor and
table filling the space with a soft greyness in which the few articles
of furniture the tables the big chair and the glazed cupboard loomed
darkly clear  in spite of grief mrs tom was too tired to be wakeful
her eyelids closed on the familiar objects which spoke so loudly of
sabina and she fell asleep
a little later but while the moon was still a mild radiance lighting
the low warm room she was rousedand being the mother of young children
she slept lightlyby a distant but regular sound the sound of
approaching steps  sick or sleepless or frightened little ones often
stole to her bedside and she awoke therefore not to fear but a kind
readiness  as she opened her eyes she realized that she was not in her
seascented upper chamber at hember but this did not alarm her  too
unselfconscious for small timidities her mind leaped to the surmise
that leadville having been twitchylike all day was worse  before
he thrust back the kitchen door she was considering which of the simple
remedies at her command would prove most beneficial
why leadville whatevers the matter she was beginning when
something about him some departure from the normal checked her words
and she perceived that though he had come into the room with head
thrust forward in everyday fashion his aspect was unusual his features
were set and his eyes had an inward look it was as if something behind
his eyes and not they themselves were looking out  he was staring
across the room and his glance had focused itself on the wall behind
mrs tom  she had thought he saw her but in a moment she realized her
mistake  he was not aware of her in fact was looking through her  to
him she was unsubstantial as the seamist nay as the warm air of the
kitchen  his was the illumination of a dream the objects he saw were
not the actual furnishings of the kitchen but the figments of a mind
asleep
mrs tom who had seen children walking in their sleep recognized the
look  it was as if an intelligence banished to some remote cell of
being had seized the opportunity of slumber to assert itself  the body
moved but unconsciously and as if under a spell  it obeyed but
clumsily and as if it had a difficulty in interpreting the wishes of
this new master
she was not alarmed but at a loss  the children walked when they had
eaten too many raw blackberries or had sat overlong at their lessons or
been frightened and leadville poor sawl too was only a big child
he had had a shock and this was the result she wondered what she had
better do  a little maid could be led back to bed and tucked in again
and left but leadville  she decided to wait and see  perhaps in a
minute or two he would go of himself
meanwhile the sleepwalker after standing by the door for some moments
had crossed the room and seated himself on the windowbench  mrs tom
was tired and very drowsy  reassured as to his needs and purpose she
found it difficult to remain awake  her lids were closing her mind was
drifting from the contemplation of his dark and motionless figure and
she was nodding off again when the elbow on which she was leaning
slipped  jarred into wakefulness she glanced hastily at leadville  for
a moment she had been oblivious of him  she hoped to find that he had
gone quietly back to bed but no he was still sitting in the moonlight
to mrs tom it seemed either that the moonlight was particularly bright
or that she saw by it more clearly than usual for not only was byrons
figure clear and sharp but his features were darkly visible  she could
see that he was interested in something which was taking place on the
other side of the room that his eyes moved as if watching some one who
to mrs tom was invisible
old chap see something she thought and looking at the blank space
about the hearth felt her flesh creep of a folk who accept the
supernatural the unusual without doubt or question she took it for
granted that leadville in his sleepwalking condition would have powers
to which she could not pretend  that what he saw he had first created
did not occur to her  what moved about the hearth was she believed
actually there and she was intensely tremulously interested  who
could it be  sabina
she had at first supposed that unnerved by his wifes sudden and
unexpected death and with his selfcontrol relaxed by sleep he had not
been able to resist the inclination to wander restlessly about the
house  she had had to admit however that there was more in this
sleepwalking than mere shock and restlessness  byron was conscious in
a peculiar way conscious of things and events  he saw something and
this something or somebody was moving about as if engaged on a domestic
task  could sabina having put off mortality be here in the spirit
was her wraith haunting the rooms familiar to her viewlessly busy in
the old way  mrs tom strained her eyes in a pathetic attempt to catch
a glimpse of the dear longknown features and full figure but no
spectral greyness lightened the heavy obscurity of that part of the room
and nothing moved nothing that is that she could see  she turned back
presently to leadville and it seemed to her that either the moonlight
was brighter or she more observant for now his face had grown so clear
to her its very expression could be seen she looked at him and then
began hurriedly to hope she had been mistaken and that the unseen form
he was watching was not sabinas for if it were how should his gaze be
at once so furtive and so menacing  what did it mean
if at the suggestion of an unseen companion her flesh had crept what
was her state when in leadvilles eye she read a threat  under her the
little bed shook until she feared lest she might attract his attention
she did not know that to him she was the invisible occupant of the room
his subconscious mind was reconstructing a scene out of the past in
which she had no part and he was therefore entirely unaware of her for
some time he continued to follow the movements of the unseen person by
the fireplace and gradually his intent look changed to a smile a
smile of satisfaction he had learned what he would know and he was
smiling to himself over it smiling after such a fashion that the
watcher shrank back and back until she was against the wall  this was a
whisht old house and she was alone in it with a dead woman and with
this man
her thoughts hitherto vague as mist distilled a clear drop  a dead
woman and why dead
the question frightened her and for a moment she shut her eyes  if
only she could have shut the eyes of her mind for suspicion was one
thing actual knowledge another  but no a word was being whispered in
her unwilling ear and already although she refused to admit it she knew
what lay behind leadvilles terrifying smile
that time last night a light had been burning in the kitchen yet he had
told her he was in bed by ten  she had doubted then and during the
day had found a hundred reasons for continuing to doubt  if her mind
had swung uncertain anxious to think generously to discredit its own
acumen uncertainty was now over the blood was drumming in her ears
but suddenly above it rose the soft padding sound of a stockinged
foot mrs tom opened her eyes quickly and from that moment forgot
herself and her reluctance in an absorbed attention  for her the time
was come when what was still hidden would be made clear  leadville had
got up from his seat and was crossing the room  he went directly to the
wall cupboard opened the green door and took something from the shelf
there was no groping his hand fell at once on what was required and he
turned away with it to the range  as if expecting to find a vessel of
some kind on the top he passed his hand slowly across the cavernous
space  as it did not meet with an obstacle he paused and for a moment
stood balancing in his habitual way from one foot to the other mrs tom
saw that he was at a loss that the directing impulse was no longer
clear  in her curiosity her distress she had risen and followed him
and now stood by the table watching his face his face which though the
eyes were open was yet blind  on it trouble was depicted trouble and
anxiety  the onlooker had more than a suspicion of his purpose knew
indeed as well as if she had seen it what he held in his hand  had he
not cried out that the pipe sabina had bought for him was poisoned
she wondered what he had thought to find on the oventop what saucepan
kettle pan  she had no doubt as to what he would do but the actual
means
leadville swayed from side to side in a long uncertainty and it was
evident that his trouble grew  his face twitched those unseeing eyes
of his stared anxiously and at last in a voice hoarse and smothered
he uttered with immense effort two words
the  jug
startled by this desolate and abominable sound mrs tom shrank back
from him  the words had come from those depths in which was lurking the
guilty spirit of the man they had come in spite of the swaddling bands
of sleep they had come laden and heavy laden  he wanteda jug and her
thoughts flew to the jug that had stood on the table by sabinas bed
the brown highgirdled jug which after supper was always placed on the
oventop that the contents might be kept warm until she was ready to
drink them  mrs tom remembered his expression when she had offered to
brew cocoa for his suppertwas sbina that drinked the cocoa
byron had torn the veil from his deed  mrs tom knew what was kept in
the wall cupboard and where she knew upon what bottle his hand had
fallen  presently she would make sure but she already knew  the
measure meted to the old and damaged and useless of the farm animals had
been meted to sabina and the hand that poured the poison had been the
one which owed her everything
after that exclamation which seemed to have been torn from some remote
corner of his being leadvilles agitation began to pass  his
disappointment even his purpose was forgotten and for some time he
stood quietly by the range his face wearing a fixed but no longer an
intent look  the impulse that had driven him remorselessly which had
reconstructed for him the scene of the preceding night which had shown
that like zimri there was for him no peace was fading
the chill of the night had begun to invade the kitchen and the
sleepwalker seemed to be dully conscious of discomfort  he shivered
slightly stirred and then slowly heavily turned away  during the
last few minutes he had lost vitality grown older and it was a man
shouldering the full burthen of his years who went out of the kitchen
and up the shallow treads of the stair
                             chapter xxi
the day following sabinas death had been to byron as a tract of hilly
and dangerous country  he had traversed it as he believed without
more than an occasional stumble and at the days end had seen from the
mountaintops of sleep a vision of rich lands under the suns of fair
tomorrows a vision not altogether dispersed when he awoke  springing
out of bed he surveyed with eager hope the yellowing dawn  mrs tom
being in no mind to trouble herself about him he had been allowed to
sleep on and exhausted by the emotions by the mental gymnastics of the
previous day he had done so until the eastern horizon was afire  from
his upper window he looked up trevorrick river now decemberfull and
purring over a wide bed of slates and quartz  the day was mild and
still  a girl in a blue coat and carrying a can was crossing the
steppingstones and he recognized her as jenifer bate  the cloak hung
in straight lines about her swelling figure and on her head was a gooky
bonneta sort of winter sunbonnetwhich had belonged to her dead
mother  she had brought mrs bate down to wastralls and was returning
with milk for the people at cottages  she think weatherll be catchy
he said to himself with the joyous feeling that she was mistaken the
wind had dropped till not a breath stirred the beaded tamarisk but far
overhead clouds were drifting lazily from the north  as long as they
sailed the sky in that direction there would be no rain
below stairs the women were busy roasting chickens and otherwise
preparing for the morrow  sunday in the west is a time of rest from
labour of gathering in the chapels for friendly intercourse but death
with a high hand substitutes for local custom a universal law and not
one of mrs toms helpers had failed her  in a corner of the kitchen a
meal had been prepared for byron and he slipped quietly into the chair
set in readiness  for the first time since his wifes death he was
conscious of flavour in the food  breakfast was the good beginning of a
good day and he ate and drank with relish  his mind had been like the
sands at low water a place of quags and pools and unsuspected rocks but
now the tide of life had risen and he had forgotten what lay below
yesterday was wholly gone and before him lay long hourshours of
realization of happiness such as he had never before known  the women
moved quietly about and in the midst of that orderly bustle byron sat
speaking now and then in answer to some remark but always as if his mind
were preoccupied the meal ended he made perfunctory offer of his
services but was relieved to find the work had been so arranged that his
room was more desired by the women than his help
that ones glad to be gone out of it said mrs con as his heavy
figure passed the window on its way to the waste lands and all could
see that byron was no longer slouching along in the mooning and
indifferent manner to which they were accustomed
hem like parsons fool like everything thats good but dont want to
work fort remarked aunt louisa her big scissors going crusp crusp
through some black material that was spread over the table
mrs tom repeated in an indifferent voice the old tag
    se av got fever o lurk
    two minds to eat and none to work
she was looking ill and when the women commented on her appearance had
spoken of a sleepless night she was in fact oppressed by the horror of
her late experience  as she went about the tasks of the moment she was
as if in a cloud a cloud on which the scene of the previous night was
reflected now from one point of view now from another
unable to forget it she threw herself into the work with an energy which
aroused the admiration of the other women and made aunt louisa wonder
she dont work ome like that mumbled the old woman over her mouthful
of pins nor i dont believe tis cos she was so fond of sbina  that
one know moren we think she do and throughout the day which for mrs
tom was unbearably long a haunted miserable day aunt louisa kept a
thoughtful eye upon her
byron striding out of the yard struck across the wide spread of
shallow water and up the natural rock embankment which on that side of
trevorrick valley prevented the sea from overrunning the wastralls
the turf cropped closely by his bullocks clipping into the bright
yellow green of marsh breaking into grey spiregrass towards the west
stretched before him up the coast with his happy feet he meant to beat
the boundaries of the farm of the goodly acres which after a time of
waiting longer than that of jacob were his  a tamarisk hedge ran north
and south between the commonswhich a century ago had been arid sandand
hember fields  byron walking by this looked across the undulating
ground to the sandy ramparts on the seaedge piled by forgotten tides
they resembled in their tiny crests and hollows their unexpectedness
their general conformation the huddle of a mountain range  by them the
plain behind was protected from the worst rigours of the atlantic and
byron saw them as a useful factor in his plan for the development of the
commons  at present cattle pastured on the turf rabbits flickered
through the spiregrass and the wide space was quiet and at rest  it
lay peacefully under the eye of day and that which moved on its green
bosom moved as if time did not exist  but byron meant to alter this to
change the face of the dunes  he would tear up the turf which fitted to
the land as curling hair fits to a mans head and he would plant the
seaward side with a seaplant with asparagus  farther in he would
have strawberries  he knew they did well on the south coast on the
sandy strip beyond southampton and he planned a journey which should
enable him to observe the methods of other men which should teach him
how to turn the sand beneath his feet into gold  as he walked by a
clump of hawthorn and bramble he touched a rabbit gin and with a
sinister snap the teeth came together  byron pulled it out and reset
it  he meant to rid the land of its rabbits and it pleased him to mark
his intention but gins and guns were ridiculously inadequate his
trapping would be of a more efficacious kind  it should exterminate
returning to the house for a midday meal he once more made perfunctory
offer of his services
funeral being tomorrow said mrs tom and her glance gave him a
momentary quickly banished qualm of course theres things to be
arranged outofdoors as well as in  youll av to clear the yard to
make room for all the carts and tis a pity there haint time to give
front door a coat of paint  tis looking terrible grimy
i know the paints rubbed off but there ednt time to dot now said
byron and lest she should have other suggestions to make hurried
through his meal and went out  a glance round the yard showed that old
george was at work preparing the place for the influx expected on the
morrow an influx which would be welcome to byron when it came but the
thought of which was momentarily disturbing  sufficient unto the hour
the emotion thereof  this was the day of anticipation the day between
the end of the old order and the beginning of the new  he would not
have it broken in upon by claims from either side  shaking off thoughts
of yesterday and tomorrow as a man shakes raindrops from his coat
byron turned out of the yard  this time he went uphill  dark head lay
before him to the south and from its crest he could survey the good
lands that sloped from the ridgethe cornfields and the cider orchard
the meadows between which trevorrick river wound its way and above which
st cadic mill lifted a grey tower byrons heart sang to the rhythm of
his striding feet and his mind busied itself with schemes  if the hinds
would not work the land as he wished he would advertise for strangers
experienced men  he would find them cottages there were some on the
farm hindoo cottage hesselwood towan veals  the men would keep each
other in countenance  for all he was himself a foreigner he knew how
the country people would look on these strangers  but in the end when
he was reaping his fat harvests when one field was bringing in what
would cover the rent of a farm the folks about would change their note
he saw himself on the crest of the wave a man who had fought his way to
the top who had deserved what he had won  and how much more than the
material award would that winning be
from where he stood on the landward slope of dark head the slope that
was washed by the morning and the midday sun his glance fell naturally
on the square outstanding block of hember the cheery ugly house grey
but with its many bright windows set in white cement the house which
had some faroff look of a hive and about which was always the murmur of
life  a sunny garden sunk between stone walls between black windbent
firs ran down to the road and in it a girl was moving from patch to
patch of earth  his heart leapt for as her hair gave out no dazzle of
light beneath the sun he knew it must be gray  he would have known
without that indication without any his blood would have recognized
her in the dark  his little umuntz  the significant black gown gave
her an unfamiliar look but in his eager pleasure at the sight of her
he missed the difference missed too another difference that change
that comes to fruit when after hanging green upon the bough the sun
has warmed it to ripeness and a hand a desirous hand has gone out to
it  from time to time gray stooped over the garden beds  she was
picking the flowers that yet lingered in sheltered nooks the flowers of
the dying year and those that were burgeoning to greet the new  a
rosebud that would never open hung on the brier a few snowdrops had
pushed up from their bulbs  gray was binding her treasuretrove with a
long dark hair  flowers from hember garden should lie between sabinas
dead fingers and go down with her into the grave and as the girl moved
from one lew corner to another her tears fell on the old roots and on
the blossoms in her hand  leadville watching wondered what she was
about  his mind being wholly occupied with the future he had forgotten
that past for which sabina stood
until the flowers were gathered to the last bud he stood looking on and
in his eyes was a kindliness strange to them  gray moving hither and
thither on her loving task showed young and helpless  once she was
his once he had overcome her faint reluctanceand thinking of it his
face hardened with resolution  he would take any measure he esteemed
necessary to gain his end but once he had overcome the reluctance
which he must admit he would be good to her  he would live for herfor
her and wastralls  she should have no wishes that he would not gratify
she should be rich looked up to and beloved and what more could a
woman want  the thought of what he would do when gray was his and
wastralls his quickened his steps and he walked on in a warm content
walked until he even he felt a weariness in his bones  a scarlet sun
was setting in splendour over a milky sea as he made his way home  in
the kitchen mrs bate now installed as housekeeper had prepared a
meal  he ate of it in happy silence not missing mrs tom if anything
pleased to have only a servant in the room  the place with only the
old women present seemed more utterly his
for a little he sat on by the hearth his shirt open at the neck to the
agreeable warmth of the fire his eyes on the leaping blue and purple
flames  it had been a borrowed day it had been full of happy
anticipation of planning no longer vague  tomorrow would be even
better for with its dawning the countryside would gather to sabinas
funeral and all must recognize him as owner of the place  his heart
sang a wild measure of triumph he was no longer a man in the forties
moving with unimpaired strength yet with a growing stiffness but one
who had renewed his youth  that day had been the beginning  he was
dreaming great dreams passionate hot dreams the dreams of a man with
immense capacities for emotion  mrs bate shutting up for the night
broke in at long last on a vision of himself teaching a little sonhis
son and graysto ride the black stallion and getting up he stretched
himself with a laugh a laugh the old woman thought indecorous
youm for overstairs  well so be i
do i rake out the ashes maister she asked timidly
oh leaven be  he had no more use for petty economies than he had
for petty spite  the day of small things was at an end
to mrs tom the revelation of the previous night had been as the rolling
away of a mist from the face of a landscape already dimly familiar  its
horrific nature had banished sleep and darkened a natural grief but had
not startled her by its unexpectedness  subconsciously she had expected
something of the sort to happen  she did not dwell on sabinas stubborn
withholding of the land on her failure to understand the more emotional
more desperate nature of her husband  she accepted it as a fact
sabina had been like a person riding out to sea who had believed fondly
that she was only fording a river and with patience and management
must presently find her horses hoofs on the shingle of the opposite
bank  tragedy had been the outcome and this mrs tom with her sure
instinct for life had known would come to pass  not even the form it
had taken had seemed other than natural  a mans weapons are those to
his hand the things he has handled from his youth up not something
strange and foreign  byron had poisoned his wife as he had poisoned
old shep and many another usedup creature  with the means to hand the
only wonder was that he had not done it before he had been married
twenty years and every day must to him have been more unhappy and more
disappointing than the last  mrs tom was aware of the provocation he
had received but accepted it as a cause not an excuse because she saw
it with the imagination of the countrywoman who having never been to a
theatre is yet able to stage for her own pleasure the dramas being
enacted within her reach saw it with a deadly clarity from faint
beginnings to the culmination her moral sense was not the less
outraged  her attitude towards animals used for food had not affected
her belief that human life was sacred and byrons crime though easy to
understand was to her mind unpardonable
but mrs toms attitude was not one of mere condemnation that warm and
pitiful heart had agonized through the dark hours over her friends
fate over the snatching away of that fagend which was all sabina had
of life sabina who had been so trusting so simple  well she had not
known  she was saved that  she had carried her optimism with her her
fond belief that all would come right that discomforts were only of the
moment and that peace must follow peace and affection  good she would
have said must prevail  mrs tom reviewing that sunny faith that
placid acceptance of weather conditions both in life and with regard to
the land that wholesome jovial point of view felt her gorge rise
against the man who had lived with sabina without loving her who for
his own ends had done her to death
how had he dared  to that question mrs tom could fit the answer  with
sabina living he could not hope to win gray  not because of wastralls
had he been moved to do this thing  mrs tom accustomed to the facile
passions of the west shrank from contemplation of an emotion so
devastating  in a land where sexual lightness is looked on not as
sinful but inconvenient where the village lightolove lives to a
respected old age and the lovechild has as many chances of success in
life as he who bears his fathers name such a passion as that of byron
for gray is rare  mrs tom although she knew could hardly believe
she was thankful there could be nothing in it that gray had made her
choice yet with that thankfulness went the pricking of a further doubt
if byron had done so dire a deed in order to clear his path how would
he act when it was brought home to him that his deed was to make no
difference that the path was blocked for him beyond all clearing mrs
tom was angry for sabina but for gray she was afraid  would jim be
able to protect her  he was after all only a young chap  between her
anger and her fear she hung in sore trouble until the hour struck that
ushered in another workaday morning
mrs tom was glad to leave the blankets  she had tossed among them till
they seemed all hair and hardness and it was a relief to fold them away
and begin the labours of the day  great thomas the other hind so
called because he gave promise in limb and shoulder of unusual strength
came in with the milk  uncle george brought the tale of his
requisitions among the farmlabourers of the vicinity and by the time
the kitchen was ready and the sewingmachine in place mrs toms
helpers were beginning to arrive  never had their familiar faces been
so welcome to her  by companionable talk they were to banish the
haunting terror of the night and it seemed at first as if this might be
before long however mrs tom found that the effect on her mind of
leadvilles revelation was darker more insistent than she had believed
between her and the everyday talk came the sleepwalker and she saw
again leadvilles smile  at times during the morning she could so
great was the tension have cried out
that smile 
it had been a writing on the wall the interpretation of which was death
and though she carried this ghastly knowledge in her breast she must
behave as usual or aunt louisa  she knew instinctively it would be
aunt louisa always taking soundings who would guess perhaps even now

she glanced up suddenly and met that cool grey eye fixed on her
consideringly  yes aunt louisa was awake to every scent and sound
marvellous old creature she must be seventy yet age had not impaired
her faculties had not taken from her the power of scenting out a
mystery of satisfying her avid curiosity  the feeling that she was
already suspicious had a stimulating effect on mrs tom  she pulled
herself together and plunging into the work was successful for a time
in banishing a toopersistent memory
nevertheless when in the late afternoon the house was adjudged ready
for the morrow and the women all but mrs bate prepared to go mrs
toms relief was unspeakable  the dead woman lay in her coffin legs in
place the leaves had been fitted into the parlour table and the best
damask spread upon it  floors windows paint every corner was
meticulously clean and on the linhay shelves were stacked cold meats in
generous provision  everything must be as sabina would have wished and
it was in the minds of all that at this her funeral feast sabina was
still hostess  byrons claim to be owner had by them been tacitly
ignored  as long as sabina was above ground wastralls was hers and it
was from her dead and silent lips that they had taken their orders
driven by mrs toms example they had worked hard and as they went
together up the lane after the manner of tired bodies they spoke but
little  she herself unable to stave off any longer her troubled
thoughts walked quickly and as she turned in at her own gate bade
them a good night she had some ado to keep from being tremulous  she
was overwrought  she wanted to get back to tom to his affection and
his good counsel and her heart running before whispered that a
certain shoulder in an old coat was the one safe and comfortable pillow
for a tired head
as she crossed the threshold intent on pouring out her troubles and
finding heartease she heard the sound of voices  it being sunday
gray who played the harmonium at the little chapel had gone thither
but the other maidens uncertain what in the circumstances was expected
of them had not ventured to accompany her  they were gathered in the
kitchen where tom too was sitting  mrs tom controlling herself to a
last effort told them she was sure their auntie would not have wished
them to stay home from chapel on her account  better for them the sight
of kindly faces the familiar routine of the service than this brooding
quiet
an yer mournins is all made up ready  tis wonderful that they have
been done so smart  aunt louisa is the quickest and for er needle i
ever seen in my life
while with the dilatoriness natural to young people they fastened
strings and hooks tom from his seat on the old sofa asked her
concerning the funeral  a burial like a birth or a marriage was part
to him of the pageant of life and each part brought its particular and
pleasurable emotion
i expect the people from all aroundll be ere he said in measured
tones and to each syllable he gave its due volume of sound  he spoke
with effort but the sounds he produced were strong and full of
substance rough sounds and not in the least mellow but satisfying to
the ear as homemade bread is to the inner man youve provided a
plenty of food for them avent yer
plenty of everything i believe said his wife and there was a note in
her voice a note of tension which he recognized but did not
understand  what had upset her  was she still grieving or was she
overtired we shall av tea in the kitchen for the bearers and a table
laid in the big parlour for the mourners  now rhoda make haste or the
othersll be to church town before youm started
twill be a pretty grand sight pursued tom with so much people  i
bet twill be the finest funeral that av been for many a year
mrs tom saw the last loiterer on her way and returning sat down on
the cushioned stool which was generally occupied by smut  the old cat
thus dispossessed sprang into her lap and pushed its little pointed
face against her hand  but mrs tom put it down  no smutty i
avent got the eart to take yer up tonight
ah mother said tom fancying he had found the key to her haggard
looks im afraid youre missin poor sbina  tis a sad thing for
yer  i dont believe theres a day gone but youve seen one another
iss i do miss er and i shall miss er  but her acquiescence
lacking fullness showed him he had not reached the heart of the matter
well and what is it he asked and in his rough full tones and his
eyes was the kind comprehension of which she stood in need
tidnt er dyin im thinkin about tis ow she did die
er goin so suddint said tom cautiously
no nor tidnt that uther butwell it do look very funny and theres
things ive seen she paused gazing anxiously at her husband  old
chap surely done somethingbetween you and i
old chap av  toms face expressive as was natural to one who helped
out his words with gesture showed a deepening interest  you dont
mean it why do ee think so
thus encouraged she plunged into her tale and though she told it in
rambling fashion with discursions and superabundant detail it was
convincing  the interpretation isolda put on byrons sleepwalking was
one tom could accept  simple and primitive such a deed did not seem to
him impossible  it was wrong it was wicked but it might happen and
his wife told him that it had poor sabina and she had had no idea what
sort of a man she was marrying and what she was bringing on herself  a
black heart if ever there was one but what could you expect  tom was
visibly moved  he punctuated his wifes tale with exclamations of ruth
and horror but he did not feel it as deeply as emotionally as she
mrs tom thought of byron vindictively and with a personal animus  she
would have been glad to see him taken to gaol to have had him hanged
but to tom he was still what he had always beenan intruder the
willingness to eave alf a brick at his head had been there from the
beginning and tom was of those who wait and do not trouble but who if
the opportunity occurs will seize it
well do seem funny sure mother he said as his wife made an end
nothin scapes your eyes i knaw
but mrs tom wanted more than generalities  what should you do
if e done it twas tarrble wicked ofn
tarrble sure
but tis done now he said slowly  poor sbina cant be fetched
back
she caught at the suggestion  i only wish she could then  twould be
a great blow forn
iss twould and anyow if eve done what you think e av shell
surely hauntn
i dont believe ell care even if e is haunted  in her desire for
tangible punishment she showed a waning faith in other influences
no praps e wont  but e knaw eve done it and the lorrd knaw and
ell be brought to judgment
you think itll come to light some day she asked eagerly
i dunno about that gods ways baint our ways
well what should you do about it
he considered  i should old me tongue and say nothing about it if i
was you  cos ift got to policemans ears youd be ad up for your
words
his caution that of a lawignoring folk who manage their own affairs
and keep silence concerning them did not satisfy her
but if he did dot she persisted e ought to be punished
you knaw mother theres no proof so tednt no good to say anything
about it
well she said sharply theres thisbottles gone out of cupboard
whats become of it  i spose that wont be any proof  and leadville
seem to be very uneasy but that wont be any proof uther  and i feel
sure in me bones and veins e wanted for er to die but thats no
proof
tom was not to be moved  a still tongue said he make a wise ead
and anyway a craikin tongue do often mean a sore one
she gave up the attempt to influence him  i spose then i shall av
to rest me eart content but youve no idea ow desperate towards im i
feel  knowin too that e owes er everything for what was e
nothing but a comebychance  and for im to serve er like e av
i reckon es like one of they cuckoos  they do say cuckoo hiists the
other lil birds out o the nest
she was paying but scant attention  i dont feel i can bear to speak
im civil  tidnt she added mysteriously for what eve done but
for what eve tried to do  doctor e said she died of eart failure
and i spose doctor ought to know
tom could not follow his wifes flying thought  well he said in
those rough full tones which contained the very body of sound i dont
believe doctors knaw everything  if they did twould make a fine
newspaper nobody told dr derek about the cocoa  he thought she ad
er supper as usual and then died off suddint in er sleep
iss said mrs tom thoughtfully and passed a hand over smut who
accepting the fact that her mistress was too much engrossed in making
mouthnoisesthe main occupation of human beingsto pet her had climbed
quietly back into her lap and gone to sleep  issdoctor didnt know
anything about the cocoa
she herself knew more than any one but was disinclined to impart the
knowledge  after all it was not the act that damned a man but the
intention and she did not want tom to think leadville less guilty than
he seemed to her  she remained silent going back over their talk and
on the whole she found it comforting tom deprecating the idea of
human interference had given utterance to one pregnant sentence e
knaw eve done it and the lorrd knaw and ell be brought to judgment
iss the lorrd knaw she told herself and i can see as old chap
wont av everything is own way but i wanted moren that ii wanted
sbina to git er own back  she hushed her vindictive longings with a
commonsense reflection  well dont spose shed be any appier if
she did
                             chapter xxii
as the funeral procession was to leave wastralls at 130 pm by eleven
that morning the road from four turnings was black with farmers carts
with people from the hamlets of church town of shoppe and of cottages
with people who had come from the distant towns of st columb and
wadebridge  for three generations mrs byrons family had taken a
leading part in the affairs of the district the memory of man went back
to old squirea personality so pronounced that it had obliterated the
more shadowy figures of its ancestry  from old squire who had added
acre to acre to sabina byron the bold yet conservative farmer was but
a life and imagination had leaped it  like her grandfather she was an
outstanding figure a woman of whom the countryside had been half proud
half envious  the lamentable tragedy of her accident setting her apart
from struggling humanity had affected the popular opinion  successful
beyond the ordinary she had in a twinkling been reduced to helplessness
and before interest in herthe tenacious interest of the agricultural
mindhad had time to wane the last misfortune had overtaken her  the
people would follow her to her grave not only out of respect for the
rosevears but as a protest against fate which not content with the
inevitable the building up or the breaking down must introduce into
the affairs of man a harsh caprice
on ordinary occasions people approached wastralls by way of the yard but
this being one of ceremonial the visitors went past the blind wall at
the end and up the weedgrown avenue of grubby elms  the
doubleleaved door studded with iron heads stood hospitably open and
on the hearth a hearth which had not been modernized a pile of
seasoned wood was burning  on the stone chequers of the floor lay some
faded rugs the colours of which were yet bright enough to throw the
sombre figures of the mourners into relief  the dull oriental reds made
a strange setting for these men and women from whom work and time had
stolen the young comeliness and who in their harsh illfitting black
appeared so awkward and ill at ease  the proportions of the hall were
good but man who had dreamed it and set it up seemed unworthy of it a
poorer thing than that which he had made
beyond the entrance hall the parlours giving on the passage showed
also an inviting face  these rooms owing to the thickness of their
walls the smallness and eastern aspect of the manypaned casements
were gloomy they smelt not of the sea but its pervading damp and of
the mould which crept like leprosy over boot and book and furniture  in
both fires had been lighted but the smoke showed little liking for the
damp chimneys and in the grates the seacoal smouldered without flame
in the big parlour the best china silver and glass had been set out and
a meal laid and the gleam of polished surface the white glow of the
freshly laundered damask the colour of the plates and dishes made a
pleasant impression mrs tom and richbell rising early had helped to
carry from the linhay the food piled on its shelves  fowls were at one
end of the table beef and ham at the other and between stood mountains
of splits bowls of cornish cream junkets and cake and pastry  the
mourners as they came in would help themselves and plates with darkly
bright knives and shining forks were stacked in readiness  the little
parlour had as far as possible been denuded of furniture for the
mourners after they had eaten would form up there in couples ready
when the coffin should have been brought forth to follow it
tom rosevear had prophesied a large gathering and the event justified
him  the many who could call cousin with sabina byron came through
the deep winding lanes to take part in her funeral and besides these
personsliterally the mournerswere a number who did not go up to the
house but stood about on trevorrick sands waiting  though lacking the
right conferred by kinshipand in the west you are not invited to a
funeral you go if a relative as a matter of coursethey too would
follow her and see her committed earth to earth and so numerous were
they that it was said afterwards that the only person in tregols parish
who did not attend mrs byrons funeral was an old bedlier of the name
of hawken and she poor soul had been bedridden up in the teens of
years
byron had carried with him overstairs a mood of serenity and content
but when he awoke in the morning his mental weather had changed from set
fair to an uncertain condition of the mercury which expressed itself in
a heavy dull sensation at the pit of his stomach  waves of excitement
were flowing through him  this would be a great day  before a crowd of
witnessesand already they were leaving their distant homes crossing in
the ferry from rock coming by train from wadebridge driving in from
treremborne and trerumpford and treginnegarsabina would be finally
dispossessed of wastralls  he who for so long had taken second place
would come into his own  it was he who would receive them  they would
eat his bread follow him in the long procession acknowledge him as a
neighbour as a kinsman and above all as the owner of the farm  to
him sabinas funeral was a public ceremony  all men would see her laid
to rest or as he put it turned out all men would allow his right to
enter into possession
wastralls  the thought of it was like wine running warmly through his
body  wastralls his  his mind turned for a moment to the dreary waste
of the past he saw it stretching like the shifting sands of the
coastline to a grey horizon and with a shudder he came back  that
was over  thank god he had left those years behind them and all that
had to do with them  he acknowledged to himself as he drew on his
black clothes that hitherto he had made no attempt to stand well with
his neighbours they had had hearts at ease while he had been gnawing
his fingers in despite  it was his fault nay not his but the fault of
embittering circumstance that he had no friends but now that wastralls
was his all this would be changed
in spite of the warmth about his heart in spite of his happy
anticipations when at last he found himself in the hall ready to
receive the mourners his courage began to ebb  the adventure was too
crucial meant too much to him  the sensation at the pit of his stomach
which had been obliterated by those hot thrills of excitement returned
and in a more acute form  his feet grew cold and the occasion became an
ordeal he could have wished were over
the individuals converging by train by road by ferry on trevorrick
were each an unknown quantity and he found that he was afraid of them
and that as the moments passed he grew more and more afraid  as he
stood by the hearth listening for the sound of wheels which should
announce the first arrival his unstable nerves working on his body
gave him a sensation of actual physical sickness he turned to the
chimneypiece and leaned his elbows on it wondering how much longer he
would be able to stand there
not far from him her expressive face set in sober lines mrs tom
rosevear stood beside mrs con  their duty it was to receive the wives
of the mourners and pass them on to mrs bate who as stripper would
take them to pay the dead woman a last visit
i dont believe as youve been in to see poor sbina said mrs tom to
her companion  byrons presence was disturbing to her and she spoke
more by way of distracting her thoughts than because she thought betsy
would care to pay the customary visit  why dont you go now before the
rest come  therell be plenty to do directly
mrs cons stout body quivered a negative  my dear life i couldnt
bear to see er  i should be picturin of er everywhere if i did
dont ee be so silly encouraged the other  i dont believe theres
ardly any funeral in the parish but what ive seen them
mrs con sank her voice to a mysterious whisper av you never seed
anything after isolda
i never seed nothing worse then meself  more need to be afraid of the
livin than the dead
well my dear youm different to me  im that narvous if i was to see
a body i knaw i should ever after be fancying i seed its dead face
a cart drove up to the open door and the sowdens of trerumpford a
childless couple who even in that land of fat stockings were accounted
welltodo came towards byron  he had been for a moment in
conversation with the undertaker who the sixteen pairs of black gloves
for the bearers in a parcel under his arm was asking how soon it would
be convenient for him to screw down the coffin
mrs batell let you know said byron hastily and turned to shake old
sowden by the hand  pleased that this important farmer should be the
first to cross his threshold be showed it by his greeting but to beulah
sowden it made little difference how he was received he was a little
tight silent man with glassy eyes and an unresponsive manner
accepting byrons cordiality with his usual reserve he left his wife a
faded person in a gooky bonnet to offer their condolences  the sowdens
were come because sabina byrons mother had been cousin to beulah and
as soon as the civilities incumbent on them had been duly observed they
stood aside to make room for others  not a spark had byron been able to
strike from either  he glanced at them a little doubtfully as they went
down the room  was their reserve natural or assumed  they had uttered
the customary phrases in the customary way and their manner had been
sufficiently friendly if a trifle the least bit in the world
patronizing  it was difficult for him to grasp that to the sowdens and
their like the situation was in no way altered he though he had spent
his life among them must remain a foreigner  byrons they knew but he
was no byron only a waif of the sea who out of charity had been given
the name
in attending sabinas funeral they were certainly accepting her husband
as their host but they had the topsyturvy feeling that her death had
cancelled the connexion and that he rather than she had become the
late lamented  under the politeness of their words had lurked a
feeling that they were meeting him for the last time that it would not
be necessary to conceal much longer the faint hostility with which he
inspired them a fat inheritance had fallen to him an inheritance which
had belonged to men of their blood and which they begrudged  the
inheritance was land and they loved land loved it more than money or
any other possession  this man who so civilly bade them welcome was
one who pushing his way in by the gate of marriage had seized what was
more theirs than his  unable to dispossess him they were yet wholly
unable to reconcile themselves the sowdens had made way for the bennett
trudgians of wadebridge cockeyed father and a daughter so vivid that
though in black she made a rainbow impression they were followed by a
voluminous widow mrs andrew of gentle jane  she had called at hember
for gray and with gray had come jim rosevear  byron when his glance
fell on the three forgot his fancy that he was on trial as a new
neighbour  he shook hands with mrs andrew and he looked at gray and
as he looked instinct told him that in some subtle way the spirit
those soft contours shrined had expanded  he shook the thought away
this was gray and he had not seen her for a weary while but she was not
changed  how could she be his hand closed eagerly over hers and he
searched her face for a responsethe old response of answering blood
but her eyes were downcast resting as it happened on her own gloved
hand  it was as if that little hand were part of a mystery which had
all her attention
the intriguing thought persisted  gray secret and pale yet with a
suggestion of unfolding petals woke in byron a curiosity as intense as
it was anxious  what had happened to her  what experience in which he
had had no part was she cherishing behind that veil of civil words and
smiles  his jealousy never long quiescent woke
already however new arrivals were surging in over the threshold  the
moment was unpropitious and already gray had withdrawn her hand  he
could not hope for any words with her till the funeral was over  he
must rest his heart on the fact that at least she was there under his
roof and must remain till he was free to go to her
the hour was one of conflicting feelings as numerous as the stones in
trevorrick river which in summer is all stones and in winter brings
down yet more of them behind gray stood jim rosevear and byron turned
on him the old lowering scowl  there was a score to settle the dark
colour purpled in his swarthy cheek but though he clenched his fists
it was in order to keep the peace not break it  the insult conveyed by
jims accompanying gray in the sight of everybody could not be
immediately avenged
my ands is tied he thought and e knaws e can come ere today
wants a lesson that one do
the bearers are in the kitchen he said pitching his voice on a loud
note and pointing to the passage  if he could he would humiliate jim
show the countryside this was a labourer who had come to the wrong door
who had not come as a mourner but for his halfcrown his meal his pair
of black gloves
but in rosevear he had met his match  im ere as a mourner not a
bearer
iss my dear began mrs andrew in a softly flowing voice and launched
herself on a vague explanation in which the words rosevear of treketh
and dusha rosevear who you know married freathy rosevear and sister of
capn josiah rosevear of fraddon occurred  byron knew little about
the ramifications of his wifes family but remembering jim was a
rosevear came to the conclusion he must be some sort of cousin
mourner he said but less confidently well
for all his wrath he must go gently  if he insulted jim if he uttered
the words in his mind well relation or no get out of my sight he
would offend mrs andrew and who knew how many more
mrs tom having disengaged herself from the sowdens came to the
rescue  she had had no suspicion that jim would stand on his rights and
come to the funeral  these young people the folly of them
why gray my dear ive been expectin you this long time  im so
glad youre ere and placing herself between man and maid she walked
away with them
when they reached the big parlour however she turned on the young man
you ought not to ave come
in jims eye was a dancing light  why couldnt i come  i baint
afraid ofn
no she retorted but this ednt a time for stirrin up strife  you
knaw e wont touch yer today
ill give im the chance when theym all gone if e like
dont ee talk so fulish and she thought with satisfaction that the
young people would soon be on the road to plymouth out of harms way
you must think of gray now  you men are so pigeaded as a cock in a
fowls pen
gray who had fallen behind her mother came up
you can settle with uncle leadville when were back home she said
with a little air of matronly authority which sat sweetly on her young
face and which changed to a softer emotion the challenge in jims eyes
must i now he said bending over her
i dont want to go to plymouth with no black eyes then she answered
poutingly
ill leave old chap till after weve ad our his voice sank to a
murmur and he led her away up the room to a corner which the light from
the deepset windows hardly reached  for all the help that either would
be mrs tom might as well have been without them  she smiled the
realization of this to richbell and the two understanding that it
rested with them to make good the deficiency fell to work  the room
was filling quickly and they were needed to cut beef and ham fill cups
from the big oldfashioned teapots and hand plates  busy though she
was however mrs tom had a thought to spare for individual needs
constantine rosevear had entered in the wake of his three sons and was
sitting under the window staring into his hat  she thought he looked
far from well  the little network of red in his cheeks had a purplish
tinge and the light blue eyes had lost colour
es takin it ard she thought and went up to him
youll av a bit o dinner conny wont yer
he shook his head  twould choke me if i did
oh do ee try to eat a little bit  cons feelings towards his cousin
had always been for her an open book  after sabinas accident the
miller had ceased coming to wastralls and mrs tom had understood that
this was not due to indifference but oversensitiveness he could not
endure to see the woman whose strength and vitality he had all his life
admired reduced to helplessness
tis a long time said mrs tom sadly since you ad anything ter eat
in this ouse
he sighed  its been a very sad ouse since er accident
im sure twould be er wish for yer to av something
i knaw  she was very kind  many a piece of wellpaid work had come
to him through sabina but he was thinking of the woman herself  he was
not an introspective man  he could not have explained even to himself
why the death of a person whom he rarely saw should make so great a
difference  she was very kind he repeated heavily but i dont want
anything
his three tall sons were at the table helping themselves his wife
almost tidy for once in her new blacktrust betsy to have nothing put
away for an occasion like the presentwas talking to her brother mr
john brenton of st eval  they looked pleased with themselves and fate
but the big miller for all his comfortable girth and good broadcloth
was as one who had lost his grip
mrs tom obliged by her hospitable duties to leave him for a little
carved and served and talked with the thought of him foremost in her
mind  she was listening for a certain expected sound and though her
hearing was a little dulled she did not miss it  the bearers waiting
in the kitchen had been fed on simpler fare than that provided for the
mourners  they were ready now and the irregular tramp of feet along the
passage told her that they were coming to take up their burden  she
went back to con for she could no longer trust herself to speak the
back of her throat ached with the tears she was trying to restrain
sabina had been born in wastralls she had lived there all her days and
now she was to be carried out  con too felt the full poignancy of the
moment  his eye met mrs toms a little wildly and he pulled at his
neckcloth to loosen it  sabinas place would know her no more  she was
going and never would she come back to them  his heart was a wordless
protest he rose unsteadily and the two the man who loved her the
woman who had been her friend went into the hall
at a cornish funeral it is customary for the relatives to follow the
coffinwhich is carried on poles by eight bearersin a certain order
precedence is regulated by the degree of kinship and to a certain
extent by age with the exception of old folks who unable to walk so
far follow in their gigs and carts the mourners traverse the distance
from house to graveyard on foot  the arrangement of these couples with
due regard to their individual claims is a work requiring knowledge of
the family ramifications and in this tom rosevear shone
when his wife followed by con came out she found the work of assigning
their positions to the mourners was nearly finished  couples lined one
side of the hall and yet others were waiting in the little parlour  an
air of sombre readiness pervaded the gathering  henwood carrying the
black crickets on which the coffin was to stand hurried out of the
door  he planted them on a level space the space which had been used
for that purpose since death first recognized that wastralls had become
a human habitation  at a sign from her husband mrs tom went to the
head of the procession  as sabinas nearest relative it was her place
to walk with byron
the door of the justiceroom opened and the hinds in dark suits and
black ties came out  the poles which they held against their breasts
were slanted to allow for the narrowness of the opening and their faces
wore a look of purpose  they were anxious to get the varnished and
glittering coffin out of the room round corners and through the hall
without hitch or stumble and the task seemed to them bristling with
difficulties  they were thinking not of what this long brightly
decorated box contained but of the trust reposed in them
mrs tom pulled down her veil and for a moment leaned her weight on
constantine  to see sabina carried feet foremost over the threshold of
her home was too much for her powers of selfcontrol and behind the
veil her tears were flowing  con understanding but inarticulate
pressed her arm  they two were the real mourners of all that concourse
they alone would miss sabina out of their daily lives  as the coffin
was earned past a shiver ran through the mans large body  with sabina
gone he too was in sight of the end  a week ago the thought would
have troubled him but to it he was now indifferent so does life taking
one by one the things we value make us ready for its own putting off
the bearersand the sexton once bullockman at wastralls was of their
numberset the coffin down on the black crickets  behind them the queue
of mourners was receiving belated additions  leadville had taken his
place beside mrs tom her husband was behind him with betsy
constantine with gray
the day was calm with a tang of cold a day when the gulls gathered in
the newploughed fields and the sea being still the murmur of other
waters could be heard as the coffin was carried down the avenue under
the low windbent branches the sexton started a hymn  many present
being choir members it was taken up at once and a volume of tuneful
sound went before the procession up the lane
    sleep on beloved sleep and take thy rest
    lay down thy head upon thy saviours breast
    i love thee well but jesus loves thee best
      good night good night good night
mrs tom had walked in many a similar procession only that summer she
had followed a brother to the grave and now in obedience to henwoods
signal she moved forward after the bearers  she was at the moment too
much occupied with herself to realize that the long line was actually on
its way  once in the open air however and the chill freshness of the
morning had its usual effect and by the time the head of the black
serpent was pushing past st cadic she was sufficiently recovered to
spare glance and thoughtneither at all kindlyfor the man keeping step
with her
for byron the morning had been chequered  some of the mourners in
particular those from a distance had met him with an assumption of
friendliness  though a stranger he was now the owner of wastralls and
in that capacity they would meet him in the marketplace and on public
business  one or two of the wives expressed the hope that he would look
in when passing  he was not only a substantial farmer but a widower
and on the whole a man who filled the eye  even mrs tom embittered
and grudging could not deny that at the head of the procession he
looked well  by no means the tallest man present his heavy dignified
carriage made him appear bigger than he actually was  he walked too
with a certain arrogance  the men who followed him were mentally lesser
men and he was conscious of it  he was leading the way was for the
first time in his proper place the errand on which he was bound did not
occupy his attention  the coffin when it passed him in the hall had
roused in him a queer inexplicable emotion a fleeting sense of
association but not because of what it contained of sabina he scarcely
thought  she belonged to the past that past on which he had definitely
and thankfully turned his back  his face was towards the future his
mind was crowded with the brick and scaffolding of the edifice he hoped
to rear and he found in his breast such a consciousness of power that
he was fain to give it expression by joining in the hymn
i love thee well but jesus loves thee best he rumbled in his deep
voice and mrs tom hearing him stared  to her it was as if he were
uttering blasphemies
the shirkin old villain she thought indignantly walkin there as
e belong to walk  i dunno ow e dare actually singin in the hymn
too the twofaced dragon tis enough to bring a judgment on im so it
is
winding out of the valley between hedges which though it was december
were still green the procession came at last to hilltop  here the road
made a wide bend  the grey tower of the church was in sight and the
sexton in order to toll the bell took a short cut across the fields
mrs byron though a chapelgoer would be buried by the parson of the
parish laid beside old squire in the shadow of the church  to the
people this ritual which for them had lost its potency was still part
of the established order  the rector was appointed by powers outside
their knowledge and had his place  they neither welcomed nor objected
to him  he served his purpose
seen from above the churchyard must have looked like a shallow vessel
filling with ink  so numerous were the mourners that after crowding
the little old edifice to overflowing they poured down the paths and
over the grassy mounds  about the rosevear graves the couples and
groups had solidified into a mass  their faces like pink disks in a
dark setting were shadowed by their veils and their black headgear
they had turned towards the pit which had been digged and the minds of
all were occupied with thoughts not of the resurrection but of the
dampness and coldness of the bodys last restingplace  down in the
earth pressed down by a weight of mould and stones shut away for ever
from the fires and talk  during the night rain had fallen and the water
had not yet soaked away through the stiff clay of the grave  it lay
covering the bottom an inexpressibly dreary adjunct to the grey sides
and crumbling verge  the mourners hearts vibrated with pity for the
woman who had looked her last on friendly faces who was on her way to
lie rainwater below saturated clods above in the chill unfriendly
bosom of the earth  when the coffin was brought out and peace perfect
peace was raised they joined in with a sense of relief  it could not
be that the mrs byron whom they all knew was to lie there in the wet
and the dark  with an optimism as indestructible as logical as hers
had been they promised themselves and her not death but life
as the signal was given to lower the coffin into the grave out of the
clouded sky fell a quavering dazzle of sunlight omen to these heavy
anxious hearts of better times in store  it fell on the brass handles
the nameplate and the two curving rows of cut clasps scintillating
from the bright surfaces in a myriad tiny glints byron standing
between tom and constantine rosevear at the head of the grave noticed
it as did the others and to him it was not only sunshine falling
unexpectedly on a coffin but something personal to himself
he had gone mechanically through the service had glanced with disfavour
at the wreaths and harps and other floral sacrifices had even in his
heart made ribald comment on peace perfect peace with loved ones far
away  the mood of exultation in which he had left wastralls had
changed to one of slowly mounting irritation  this burying was after
all a tedious business the creak and strain of the ropes which
indicated that the coffin was being let down drew from him a sigh of
relief in another minute he would be able to turn his back on this
place of sepulture
the flash of sunlight however had caught his eye and had done more
than that  its transient gleam had linked the fleeting sense of
familiarity he had felt when the coffin had been carried past him out
of wastralls with other moments strung beadlike on the past  this was
the shape those the infinitesimal glimmers which he had seen in
visions  again and again he had heard the hammer at work seen the
glint of polished wood the curve of the cut clasps  the lid of
sabinas coffin  for years his dim familiar it was now actual and
present  he shivered as if a breath laden with the odours the dank
chill of the grave had risen from its depths  that hammeringbut it
was not he who had knocked in nail after nail
byron forgot in sudden curiosity that curiosity with which the vision
always inspired him where he was and what he was doing  he must find
out whether the lines had been completed to the last nail  something of
peculiar importance hung on this fact
con rosevear having moved a little was now between him and the grave
and in the dark oblong the coffin was sinking out of sight  a moment
more and it would be too late  with one of the movements which in a
man of his age and bulk were so surprisingly quick byron thrust the
other aside  the sun gleam had faded the shadows of the wintry
afternoon the shadows of the pit were closing over the coffin  byron
on the grassy verge leaned forward in a perilous attempt to see and to
the bystanders it seemed as if the man driven crazy by grief were
about to throw himself into the grave  an emotional race they were
prepared for such manifestations but even as they closed with
leadville to pull him back into safety they were conscious of
surprise of a new almost grudged respect  they had not thought him
fond of his wife
the sudden jerking of his arms under the clutch of wellmeaning but
mistaken fingers prevented byron from satisfying himself as to whether
the nails were all in place this matter of the last nail had on a
sudden assumed a terrible importance  if it had been hammered home he
would be delivered from the obsession of this coffin which for so long
he had seen in preparation  in the making of it he had had no partand
that was strange  yes all things considered it was very strange  he
had never been able to think of his vision as an illusion  it was real
and tangible but in some curious way out of reach  now he had chanced
upon it  chance  he had been walking towards it all the time  he must
know however whether the circles were complete whether that last
nail
he flung off the arresting hands and made a further effort to see but
those busy with the ropes were using greater dispatch and others were
thrusting themselves between the graveside and the man  his strength
not being as the strength of ten he was forced to desist panting and
wildeyed he stood debating with himself whether he would not make one
more effort when mrs tom calling to him from behind caught his
attention
come now she said thinking he must have been moved to this
exhibition of feeling by a late remorse sbinas gone and all the
cryin and grievin in the worldll never get er back
sbina he echoed and the eagerness faded from his face leaving it
curiously grey  i wanted to see
he had turned his back on the grave and she noticed that his manner was
preoccupied  i wanted to make sure was he scanned her face with
eyes which as she said afterwards should have warned her was the
nails all drived in
the nails repeated mrs tom wondering what he meant but anxious to
humour him  what be tellin about  of course they was drived in
did he think sabina had not been properly screwed down
drawing her out of the wondering group he bent to her ear  they never
was all drived in before he confided and looked at her inquiringly
he had failed to see but she yes she might have been more fortunate
well they are now i knaw
she spoke so confidently that he was convinced  tis a good job then
iss
if theym drived in to the last one i shall never ear that ammerin
again
no she said of course you wont
he gave her a sidelong considering glance  did you ear it
she was still thinking of the screws  no she said with a shiver of
distress  i wasnt near enough  ii was in the big parlour  but come
on now tis time for us to be goin ome  theyre fullin in the
grave
he turned for a last longing look  i should like to av seen for
myself he said grudgingly  he had forgotten why he was in the
churchyard by an open grave forgotten who lay in its depths forgotten
everything but the question as to whether the curving rows of cut clasps
were complete to the last nail  the stones and clods were being
shovelled on to the coffin obliterating for ever the trifling handiwork
of man surrendering what could not be withheld  with a sigh of
dissatisfaction leadville turned and walking out of the churchyard
took the homeward road
                            chapter xxiii
on the opposite side of the road through church town was a little
tavern the only one in the parish at which spirits could be obtained
by this drawn up and waiting were a number of conveyances and among
them the wastralls cart  uncle george more familiar than byron with
the routine of a funeral had driven to meet him  the farmer striding
by would have passed unseeing but the old man stepped into the road
i be come for ee maister
for a moment byron gazed at the figure confronting him as if it were
that of a stranger then the mists cleared he glanced round as if
awakening from a dream and climbing into the cart took the reins  the
experiences of the day the unwonted crowd the publicity the return of
the old obsession had been fatiguing and he was glad to ride  as he
jogged along letting lady go as she pleased his thoughts ran before
him and he saw the evening as a time of blessed peace  these gigs and
carts with which the road was thronged these blackclad people would
then be gone and he would have the place to himself  many of the
mourners had indeed turned in the direction of their distant homes
and when he reached towan lane yet others shouted a good night but a
goodly number were returning to wastralls
those on foot had horses to tackle up and men were waiting in the yard
to help them  when byron reached the gate he remembered that he had a
last duty to perform  he was tired of the people he wished they would
go home but he must not spoil the good impression he hoped he had made
youd better come in all of ee he said in a tone of wouldbe
heartiness and av a cup of tea
a few refused alleging the distance they had to go but others and
among them sabinas nearest relatives accepted the invitation
between the hedges the afternoon air had been stagnantly warm but a
seabreeze was sweeping through the leafless boughs of the elms and its
breath was cold  gray rosevear walking demurely at her fathers side
drew the open sides of her coat together and with her little gloved
hands began to fasten them she too wished the day over  for her it
had been a long dreariness shot with unpleasant imaginings  simple and
devoted caring for little but her home and the homecircle her aunts
death was the first trouble she had known  jim and her relationship to
him though they had unsealed a fount of deep emotion though they
possessed her to the exclusion of most other interests had not
influenced sabinas claim  the last rosebud the first snowdrops of
hember had been laid by the weeping girl in her aunts dead hand and
every year faithful affection would place a similar offering on the
mould that covered her  gray would not forget and when her children
came she would plant in their young memories the tradition of the
splendid woman  she herself was of those who build a fire on the
domestic altar who keep it burning for the warmth and comfort and
betterment of all who come within reach of its beams but who find no
historian
let in over the door of wastralls was a brown stone on this had been
cut a shield bearing the rosevear arms  the winds of over a hundred
years had breathed on this stone crumbling the edges smoothing the
sharp surfaces  the charges were now nearly obliterated and gray
glancing up as she walked towards the door felt a twinge of regret
wastralls more than either hember or st cadic was the rosevear home
and now it would belong to uncle leadville  she did not being so
tender a little soul actually grudge him the inheritance but she felt
sorry some arrangement could not have been made which would have left a
rosevear in possession jim of course if any relation was a very
distant one but there were her uncle cons boys  tremain the youngest
had thoughts of canada  it would have been better if he could have
remained at home and uncle leadville gone oh very much better
byron leading the way up the drive wondered whether mrs bate would
have the tea in readiness  he wanted to see the back of his guests to
be alone and it was with a feeling of annoyance that he caught sight of
an individual in parley at the open door  the stranger wore town
clothes and was a tall thin man with reddish hair  byron supposing him
to be a relative who by mischance of travelling had arrived too late
held out his hand  oo be you said he downright but friendly
mr criddle answered the stranger in a matteroffact tone of
messrs criddle and nancarrow of wadebridge
the name left byron unenlightened  the ground was thick with criddles
but he had never heard they were related to the rosevears  he began to
think the man must have come on business must be a traveller for
machinery or patent medicine or manures
weve ad rather a busy day he said determining to get rid of him as
soon as possible
so i understand returned mr criddle  the news only reached me this
morning or i should have been over earlier but there were arrangements
to be made before i could leave
behind byron the mourners had been dragging wearily up the slope  to
some of them however criddle of messrs criddle and nancarrow was a
familiar figure and his presence promising fresh developments on a day
which had been tame for lack of them proved stimulating bent backs
straightened and men quickened their steps those who recognized criddle
giving whispered information to those with whom they walked  byron
more mystified than ever spoke with a touch of impatience  well im
sorry but you must excuse me today
mr criddles smile was reflected on the faces about i have brought
the late mrs byrons will he explained
leadville could not have been more taken aback for years afraid lest
his wife might make a willnot inimical to him she loved him too well
for thatbut with provisions of which he might not altogether approve
he had kept a watch on her movements and more particularly on the
trend of her thoughts  once or twice sounding her he had said they
ought to put their wishes into writing but she had shaken her bright
head with time enough yet  he could have sworn he knew her simple
mind from end to end and that living from day to day she had not
troubled about the future
her will he cried bluffly incredulous  she never made none
while mrs byron was at the hospital she sent for me and had her will
drawn up
she was too ill to tend to any wills
at first yes
byrons incredulity was shaken  believing sabina too far on her way to
the next world to have a thought for this he had relaxed his watch
had she taken advantage of his absence  he hesitated and in smooth
tones the lawyer explained  when she was getting better she sent for
me made her will andhe tapped his pocketleft it in my care
the statement carried conviction  byron could not but admit that with
regard to this willmaking sabina had acted after her usual fashion
once she saw the necessity for action she lost no time and with her
eaten meat was soon forgotten  had her husband been at hand she would
as a matter of course have told him of her intentions  he cursed the
folly that had kept him away  i think she ought to have let me knaw
he said uneasily  in her weak state of health how was it likely she
would be able to frame a sensible will
mr criddle was in a hurry  the train service between wadebridge and
stowe was inadequate and unless he used dispatch he might lose the last
train  drawing from his pocket a long bluegrey paper he glanced at the
people waiting about  no doubt the relatives of the late mrs byron
will wish to hear the will read
on the document in plain black print was will of mrs sabina byron
and these words pregnant with unknown farreaching possibilities sent
a thrill through those present  of all who had attended the funeral
these were the privileged they were to have a firsthand knowledge of
the provisions of sabinas will and if there should be dramatic
developments they would be on the spot  leadville looking to them for
sympathy with him in his uneasiness saw on their faces only curiosity
and realized that they were indeed the relatives of the late mrs
byron
you better come in ere he said and led the way through the house
in the big parlour sabinas most cherished possessions porcelain
painted by a chinese hand which had long since lost its cunning lacquer
which has accompanied it overseas old georgian silver dark above fine
damask had been set out but byron ignored the invitation of the open
door  therell be more room out here in the kitchen he said
in placing themselves about the wide low room it was noticeable that
the mourners seated themselves in accordance with their standing and
expectations  byron with a sharp assumption of ownership placed old
squires chair at the head of the table and sat in it  tom and
constantine rosevear took the chairs on each side of him and mr criddle
sat at the end  between them were the substantial farmers who had
married rosevear connexions or were themselves cousins such men as old
sowden john jacka of forth dennis solomon old tom trebilcock  a
group of young people  cons three sons the hember girls and hilda
trudgian were clustered about the windowbench while the older women
veils up and cloaks unfastened sat by the fire
in the hush of strained attention the unfolding of the bluegrey paper
made a sharp whisper of sound  this is the last will and testament of
me sabina byron of wastralls tregols parish in the duchy of cornwall
the wife of leadville byron
after a few words of preamble came the first bequest i give devise
and bequeath to my dear husband the said leadville byron my property
in trust securities the income thereof to be paid to him during his
life and after his decease to be divided between the children then
living of my cousins thomas freathy rosevear of hember and sydney
constantine rosevear of st cadic in equal shares
the money on deposit at the bank and the balance standing in my name i
leave to the said leadville byron
as he gathered the sense of these provisions leadville nodded a
qualified approval  he and his wife having lived well within their
income it was only right he should be left the money he had helped to
save  he should he thought have been left the capital too but his
main concern was with the ready money lying at the bank he would need
it to initiate the changes of which for so long he had dreamed and
while one tract of his mind was attending closely to the reading
another beheld the vision of an accomplished hope the fields of
wastralls under intensive culture the motors carrying produce to truro
to plymouth and yet farther afield the steamers bearing it up the coast
to cardiff and other hungry towns a dock could be blasted out of morwen
cove a stone quay built and behind it a row of uptodate cottages
in a few years with his energy his ideas he would have amassed
capitalall the capital he needed
what money as she left then sir
when mr criddle moved his linen made a rustling sound which was
suggestive of withered leaves and this suggestion was carried further by
his dry appearance and wooden gesture  laying down the will he looked
over the top of his glasses at the inquirer and embarked on a statement
the late mr freathy rosevear mrs byrons grandfather invested money
in mines  for a time this investment was shaky and unsaleable but it
recovered and is now paying a good dividend  as you are already aware
her father did not leave her much beyond the house and land  since the
property has been in her hands it has increased in value and the savings
have been considerable altogether the income of about twelve thousand
pounds well invested will come to you
and the money in the bank
i inquired this morning  he consulted a notebook in which various
sets of figures were entered  ah yes here it is  the late mrs
byron had three hundred pounds on deposit and a balance of a hundred and
ninety pounds eighteen shillings and tenpence
again byron nodded but this time his satisfaction was unalloyed  though
his wife had always given him what he required he had not had any
considerable sums at his disposal and to find himself in possession of
nearly five hundred pounds to spend as he chose also a regular income
of about the same amount gave him a feeling of opulence  sabina
generous with her pence had been reserved as to the sum total of her
property  he had not guessed her savings to be so large
the lawyer read on  a few small legacies were left to relativesto mrs
isolda rosevear the linen in the big chest to constantine the horse
sabina had been wont to ride about her fields to the men who had been
in her employment ten years the sum of fifty pounds each to those more
newly come a pound for each year of their service  byron listened
without heeding  with hands thrust deeply into his trousers pockets
with head sunk between his shoulders he was awaiting the moment when
the landwastralls itselfshould be declared his and he could face this
concourse of alien faintly hostile people with the accomplished fact
what did it matter who had the big strawberry roan that was eating his
head off in the stable or what became of a few sheets and tablecloths
he cared for nothing but the land the five hundred acres which had been
his yet not his for so long  the will would set all doubt as to its
ownership at rest  sabina had after all been wise to set her wishes
down in black and white
the land house and hereditaments of wastralls began the lawyer in
his dry voice each word clipped of sound and the whole giving the
effect of a wellkept but withered hedge
in his big chair at the head of the table leadville stirred slightly
clenching his hands  at last
i will devise and bequeath the land house and hereditaments of
wastralls to my cousin gray rosevear
the upturned attentive faces about the table expressed for a moment
only intense surprise  leadville leaning forward made a husky
hesitating soundwhat
in his precise voice the lawyer reread the bequest and about his
words as the information sank into peoples minds rose a little
whisper of astonished comment
gray
did ee ever ear the like
somes born lucky
well gray now
a chair went over with a sudden crash and leadville was on his feet
before the slowerwitted men had realized his purpose he had crossed the
room snatched the will out of criddles hand and scattering the women
was at the fire  he meant to destroy it to press it down among the
logs to hold it until it was burned to ashes flinging it on the wood
he glanced round for the poker but the rosevears had begun to recover
from the stupefaction into which his reckless action had thrown them
tom had the lean strength of whipcord and con that of a bull  as they
closed with byron bearing him away from the fire mrs tom snatched up
the paper and pressing out the flame ran back with it out of harms
way
im afeared tis a good bit burned she said as she returned it to the
lawyer but that individual looked at her calmly over the tops of his
glasses
this is only a copy mrs rosevear  the will is in my safe at home
his voice carried and in spite of the general confusion men smiled to
themselves  cunning chaps these lawyers up to snuff  tom rosevear
wiping a heated face picked up old squires chair and put it back at
the head of the table  for the moment with devils tearing at his
heart byron stood in their midst then sullenly he resumed his seat
two heads could be knocked together but there were a dozen men in the
room  except for the relief to his feelings what would a fight
advantage him moreover as he had failed to burn the will as in fact
the will was not there to be burnt he must take other measures
sheve left the land to me he asserted violently
at the time he drew up the will mr criddle had pointed out to his
client that her husband might feel aggrieved at being passed over and
she had given him her reasons for leaving wastralls to a rosevear  he
had them in readiness
she made what she considered a proper provision for you mr byron
when she left you the money
provision  dont want none o that  tis the land i want
i understood from my client that you had never done any farming
never ad the chance
mr criddles sandy brows went up in expostulation mrs byron told me
you had been a sailor and that after her marriage with you she had
suggested your renting land but that you had refused  i understood her
to say she had even been willing to sink capital in buying some but you
impressed her as not wishing to take the responsibility
she told you so began byron and choked over the words  his tongue
was not glib he could not explain that he had been misrepresented and
this inability giving him a feeling of helplessness before this man of
words abated the violence of his mood  a damned lie he muttered a
damned lie
from the group of women about the hearth a voice cut into the
discussion  she thought said mrs tom moved by her secret knowledge
to a bitter word as shed maybe live as long as er usband
mr criddle accepted this contribution with a little bend of the head
she did  she said as much  she thought if she should predecease mr
byron he would by that time be too old to start farming on his own
account
byron brushed this aside as irrelevant  he was becoming gradually
conscious of meshes about his feetmeshes from which however he still
thought he could escape  but he said and he believed it she cant
leave the land to any one else whats ers is mine
the law gives women the right to dispose of their property returned
the lawyer patiently  his mind was divided between byron and the clock
a few minutes more and if he were not to miss the train he must start
on the drive back
you dont mean byron was aghast but incredulous that the law gives
er the right to leave the land away from me
it does
the missus could do as she liked with the land began the unhappy man
and there was such poignant anxiety in his tones that even mrs tom
angry and embittered felt a qualm of pity  poor old toad too he was
taking it hard
yes
sabina had had the power and she had used it used it simply and without
heartsearchings or artifice  the world was turning round with him but
he still had his hands on that which he had taken  in spite of will and
lawyer he would hold to it  he felt that nothing could relax his grip
that the land was his from now on until time should make him more
intimately a part of it yet something was slipping from himslipping
he looked from face to face along the sides of the table from con
heavy and ruminative to beulah sowden whose glassy eyes stared
unresponsive as ever and so to tom rosevear  the day was being driven
out by the shadow hosts of evening but the faces were still distinct
the unhappy man searched them with the old desperate who is on my
side who
what good said he in an urgent troubling voice what good would
wastralls be to graya young maid
being farmers all their prejudices their outlook would put them
against the will  they could not approve of land being left to a woman
anything else but not land  byron thought that with them to back him he
might force the lawyerfellow to see reason after all it was the men
of the community who made the law and if these would give it as their
opinion that the will was unjust was unnatural it might be upset
to a man those to whom he made his appeal were kind of heart  they
were sorry for byron  they would have been sorry for any one who stood
to lose a fair farm for any one whose hopes had been disappointed
they agreed too that it was a pity the land should have been left to a
maid  where they joined issue with byron was in the universal feeling
that the land belonged to rosevears  anything was better than that it
should go out of the family  they would not help him to get the will
upset  on the contrary
the failure of his appeal sent a gust of fury through byron  they would
see him wronged and not lift a hand to prevent it  what matter  he
would have it in spite of them  the lands mine he blazed and
brought his fist down on the table with a thump that jarred from every
loose surface a protesting sound and threatened to split the thick wood
tis mine and by itch or by crook ill av it  a mistakes been made
and he flung down the gage you do all knaw it as but well av it
put right
the other men looked to mr criddle for direction
im sorry the lawyer said in his unimpassioned way that you should
be disappointed but the intention was clear and the will is properly
executed  you will be only wasting time and money if you try to upset
it
byrons mind was moving quickly  the missus thought i should be old by
the time she was taken he argued  i baint old im so young as any
there isnt a man ere can put it across me
into this atmosphere already full of conflicting thought of
possibilities more ominous than any there suspected mrs tom threw a
barbed and poisoned phrase  sbina ad no thought of dyin and you
knaw leadville that she adnt
he turned at the words  the corner by the hearth was growing dark but
the firelight revealed a face here and another there  mrs tom was on
the outskirts of the group and in her accusing eyes and on her pale
features was a writing byron could and for all his unwillingness must
read  mrs tom was telling him that his secret was known to her and
that in the provisions of the will she recognized the truth of her toms
words that for which leadville had schemed and done evil that was
what to the upholding of righteousness he was to lose
but the man was not yet broken to the acceptance of his fate  mrs tom
might suspect she could not know  he turned to the lawyer with a
movement that suggested the flicking off of a troublesome fly
i dont believe he said that missus would leave it to gray  she
wouldnt do such a thing  how could she take wastralls from me when i
bin ere all me life youve made the will out wrong
as far as mr criddles experience went a last will and testament never
satisfied the survivors  it was unfortunate that mrs byrons should
have come into operation while her husband was still a comparatively
young man but after all he had the money and there were more farms
than those in trevorrick  to the poignant aspect of the matter he was
blind
mrs byron was quite clear on the point in fact though she did not
insist on it she told me she hoped that when miss gray married she
would not change her name  being rosevear land mrs byron felt that
wastralls should belong to a rosevear
the younger people grouped on and about the bench whispered among
themselves but byrons voice overrode their murmurs  i could call
myself rosevear he offered eagerly the names nothing
you avent a name of your own mr byron said con in his slow heavy
fashion and one names so well as another to you
iss agreed the other impatiently a mans the same whether e got
one name as another
those are the provisions of the will continued mr criddle ignoring
the suggestion  in his clipped voice he read to the end  gray was left
residuary legatee and thomas freathy rosevear and sydney constantine
rosevear were to be the executors  and lastly i revoke all former
wills made by me in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand
                             chapter xxiv
the lawyer pressed for time hurried over his farewells and going out
pulled the door to behind him  the faulty latch failing to hold the
door swung back to fall with a little jingling clash against the post
and this irritating sound metallic and irregular alone broke the hush
of expectation that with mr criddles departure had fallen on the
room
his withdrawal freeing this large family from the observation of a
stranger took from the members of it any selfconsciousness they may
have felt and enabled them to give their whole attention to what was
passing to centre it in fact on byron on this man who like a widow
was not to inherit the property but to be pensioned off with an annuity
the women about the hearth the young people on the windowbench the
men at the table all were wondering what byron would say and do
whether indeed he quite understood
he sat before them with his broad shoulders hunched and a hand over his
eyes withdrawn and though one of a crowd solitary  behind him rose
the polished back of the old chair  he had placed it at the head of the
table he had sat in it to emphasize the fact of his ownership and there
were those present who thought he had by so doing brought illluck on
himself  he had stretched covetous hands to what old squire had set
apart for his descendants and in his own way at his own time old
squire dead yet very much alive had taken action  in the disposition
of the property the people recognized his hand  sabina had been the
instrument of an older more imperious will  rosevear land was for
rosevears  those who had had it before this nameless wight came up out
of the sea should keep it  their grip was fixed on it their roots went
down to its rock foundations they were of it sprung from it the
living manifestations of it while hehe who would have taken it from
themhe was a foreigner  he had no right no part among them  as he
was come so would he go  the sea had spewed him up and in due time the
earth would swallow him and the memory of him would perish
the door banged at will the latch catching and slipping like a
nerveless hand  in the old chimneys of the old house the drear
december wind whined and entreated and first one person then another
began to stir and whisper
in their cramped quarters under the window the young people were
responding to the faint calls of everyday life conscious of tension of
a something in the atmosphere that threatened and insisted they glanced
anxiously at the door  its foolish rattling indecision suggested to
them that it was open that they had only to get up take a quick step
or two and it would provide a way of escape something perhaps an
appeal to their emotions more likely a dull discussion was pending and
they were impatient to breathe fresh air indulge in a little chaff and
sweethearting get back to the normal  the troubles of their seniors
the dark incomprehensible tragedy of byron were beyond their
understanding  they were glad when their mothers and aunts began to
move to speak in restrained tones to whisper of isoldas linen of
cons red roan and of the fifty pounds that would fall to
highshouldered george biddick the good old hind who had been on the
farm for so many years all the working years of a life  as they talked
they fastened cloaks and pulled down veils beginning as it were to move
and so setting an example the young folks would be glad to follow
the miller had been sitting solid and motionless at byrons right
hand  as the women began their tentative movements he rose drew a
deep breath of relief and drifted in mrs toms direction  she gave him
a pleasant word  the awse that sbina give you con ll av a good
ome with you
she knawed i liked prince the other said heavily his eyes had been
resting on his three sons and he now uttered a plain thought
pity gray wadnt a boy seems a pity for the farm to go to a maid
still sbina bin fair enough  tom was sbinas next of kin and in
choosing his eldest child to inherit wastralls she had acknowledged his
claim  con thinking of his hearty lads regretted while accepting
her decision
mrs tom did not take offence  iss she sighed voicing her one
grievance against fate i only wished i ad a boy
the young folk were frankly a little envious of grays good fortune and
jim rosevear who having taken to heart mrs toms mild scolding was
standing a little behind the st cadic men stooped to the girls ear
with a congratulatory word  her eyes as she answered him were full of
tears
dear auntie  i had no idea she was goin to give me the farm  i feel
i ought to have done more for her
my tender dear you done all you could do
upon this simple talk born of a general willingness to be
accommodating to live and let live broke an arresting voice  the
sense of disaster irremediable and dire was slowly closing down on
byron but until he had done his utmost to escape he would not admit
he was in straits
i been thinkin he said looking from tom rosevear to his cousin i
been thinkin if gray as wastralls praps she would like for me to stay
on an teel it for er ive wanted the farm all along  i think tis
very cruel to av it took away now but he did not attempt to disguise
his anxietyyou can make it right for me if you like
tom had joined constantine and into the bearing of the two though only
so lately made executors was crept a faint consciousness of their
position  they had been placed in authority and they were used to
wielding it they stood together listening gravely to the mans appeal
giving it as far as appearances went their consideration  in reality
they were wondering how to avoid a direct refusal  that byron should
have set his heart on wastralls seemed to them mere perversity  as well
cry for the moon
i dunno said tom evasively  he did not want to hurt the mans
feelings but he and con had been put in charge of the property and were
responsible to sabina for its administration  i dunno bout that  we
shall av to think it over  what do you say constantine
i think said his more direct coadjutor i think the best way is to
do as sbina wished
but byron was unable to take a wrappedup no for an answer  i was
er usband he pleaded and if he had addressed his words to the nether
stone in st cadic mill they would have had as much effect  i was er
usband and i think she meant for me to av it only there been a
mistake made in the will
mrs tom who had been standing behind the two men took a step forward
i know sbina trusted you in everything
he caught at the words turning eagerly triumphantly on the executors
therei knaw she did
in everything else pursued mrs tom steadily besides wastralls
besides wastralls he stammered
but that and there was a note in her voice a note of mingled grief
and satisfaction which only tom understood that she said you would
never av
byron threw up hishands in a wild gesture  my good god  she must av
been maze or she wouldnt av done it  surely you baint goin to let
er fulish fancies take it away from me
working adjacent farms sabinas cousins could not be blind to the fact
that she and her husband had been at odds as to the management of
wastralls  they were too as averse to the changes he would have
introduced as she could be  she had appointed them her executors they
would see her wishes were carried out  the disappointment to byron the
crumbling of his hope of something more intimate than hope did not
weigh with men intent on a plain duty
realizing that his appeal had as much effect on them as wind beating on
a boulder the other shifted his ground as reasonable beings they must
see he could be of use to them  im here and i knaw every hitch and
stitch of the place  wholl take it on and work it for gray  for
certain she cant  she dont know a mangold from a turmit  she cant
manage it by erself and er father cant do it  e got is own work to
do
the shadows had been encroaching and already it was growing difficult to
distinguish one pale disk among the many faces from another  as byron
paused there was a movement among the young people and jim rosevear
bearing himself modestly stepped up to the table
i reckon he said and the claim was put forward quietly and in a
matteroffact voice i reckon i got the right now to work the land
turning from the executors byron stared speechlessly and in
bewilderment at the young man  to him jim was a hind whom he had
lately dismissed and that he could be in any way concerned with
wastralls was impossible  byron felt much as if a strange dog had found
its way in at the door  you he said  what right av you to be
ere  didnt i tell yer other day to never put foot inside this ouse
again
now then now then interposed constantine big and authoritative as a
london policeman  those present felt he had the right to impose his
will on them that the ownership of wastralls had passed from the one
man to the other that never more would byron be in the position to
drive out even a dog  well av none of this no quarrellin ere
byron felt it too and his spirit revolted in a last frenzy of protest
he cursed jim with a bitter concentrated curse but there was acceptance
of his lot of the calamity which had overtaken him in the final
sullen letn clear out of this
to jim as to the others byron was merely an angry disappointed man
the shoes on the other foot he cried his spirits rising the ready
but provocative smile on his lips  come to that tis for you to go
not me
byron swept out an annihilating arm  this gadfly he would brush him
off silence him  cuss yer get out of me sight
but jim wheeling lightly appealed to the executors ive a right to
be ere
to byrons confused surprise tom nodded briefly and constantine with a
grunt of assent admitted the claim what right av yer got then  he
realized that jim must be settled with before they could get back to
the matter in handthe farming of wastralls  byron still nursed a
flicker of hope that he might be left as manager or bailiff that this
fate which was hovering would not be allowed to swoop
before jims light tongue could reel off the ready answer constantine
interposed  let gray speak said he probing among the shadows for
his niece  tis er land
iss come now gray said her father encouragingly tis for you to
say
never had gray disputed her fathers seldomimposed will and now though
so reluctant that it seemed to her her feet were leaden she came to
the table  her heart was beating fast  the publicity even this
modified publicity of the family was to one of her retiring nature
very unwelcome nevertheless she carried herself with a modest dignity
she had even a little air of confidence as if in her bosom was a store
of courage on which she could draw at will and this confidence in one
so timid so unassuming appeared as a grace  that day as with colour
in her cheeks and a steady light in her midnight eyes gray faced her
redoubtable relative she was at her finest and most desirable
uncle leadville she began simply and the man shrank with a gesture of
repudiation from the wounding title but all her life he had been
uncle to her and he would be so to the end  uncle leadville im
sorry if what aunt sbina done is against your wish but the land was
hers and she could do what she liked with it  you know it has always
belonged to her family and been worked in the way that we are used to
down here  im very sorry to go against you in anything but she
paused and her serious steady gaze shifted from the dark face watching
her as a condemned man watches the sinking sun the night before he is
shot to jims blithe countenance and as it shifted her eyes
softened filling with an expression no one in the room not even byron
himself could mistake but i think its only right my husband should
work the farm for me
my husband gray had said and when her voice ceased the words were
still echoing through the room they had fallen on byrons ears on his
passionate craving heart as fall words of doom against which there is no
appeal
your usband he ejaculated but not because he had any doubt  we walk
in twilight until light falls through a window and in that moment of
revelation it did not need grays further words to enlighten him
we was married last friday into stowe
to the hember and st cadic rosevears this was no news but mrs byrons
death on the night of the wedding the subsequent rush of work the
funeral had prevented it from being bruited abroad  the more distant
relatives looked at each other and at the young couple surprised yet
on the whole pleased  so gray sly puss had picked her man and
married him on the quiet  and who was he  rosevear of trekeths son
not much money there but mrs andrew of gentle jane was his auntie and
very fond of him  likely looking chap too  the maid had had her wits
about her when she chose him though as things had turned out she was
more of a catch than he  and sabina had probably known  she would be
glad the maid was wedding a rosevear even though it was one of a
different family  well well  they sent a sigh after vanished youth
and prepared themselves to utter the kind commonplaces of
congratulation  the connexion would be a satisfactory one  the young
people would live in the old home and the rosevear tradition be
maintained  the hearts of the elders accepting them as members of the
family blessed them to increase a long line of stout descendants  the
erratic genius the lucifer of a later day was to be driven out that
the old order might be continued world without end amen
instinctively though the words of congratulation were on their lips the
people waited for byron to take the initiative they did not know what
grays simple statement meant to him had no suspicion that a
dreamcastle had been tumbled about his ears the dream in which he had
shrined hope and desire  destroy these figments and you destroy the
purpose of a life and as a consequence the will to live  byrons
dream had not been only of gray though she had been at the heart of
itthe reddest hottest coal of the fire  he had dreamed too of his
strength that strength through which all else should be added unto him
and he was being gradually forced to see it as an illusion  some one
had been strong but not he some one had given and withheld had
ordained what he should have what he should go without but it was not
he he thrust at the young people a question which seemed to them
irrelevant
did er knaw  did sbina knaw
that was the crucial point the point by which his selfrespect must
stand or fall  had sabina done this thing or was it merely an
unforeseen event
twas aunt sabinas wish for us to be married then she made the
arrangements  gray was glad to make this known  she would not have
people think that she had married without the countenance of her family
and in particular of the aunt who had been so good to her  so much
had happened since the morning of her weddingday she was so different
a person from the shy and frightened girl who had driven out of
wastralls yard that she had almost forgotten the menace of byrons
love uncle leadville had been the ogre of her story but her marriage
had changed the ogre back into a man and she could speak frankly to him
of aunt sabinas part in what had been done  she was far from guessing
that her simple words would take from him a last delusion yet as she
spoke she saw his face change and she wondered
the people too were uneasily conscious that he had not taken the
announcement of his nieces marriage as they would have expected  what
was wrong  no whisper had ever linked her name with his moreover
sabina was but three days dead  they wondered over his grey strained
face his eyes which saw what was withheld from them and into their
wonder crept a tinge of apprehension
while they hesitated byron flung into the silenceas a bomb is flung
into a crowdhis bitter thought
i took er life and sheve served me out for it
a thrill ran through the listeners  with their celtic perception they
had been aware of halfseen forces and thoughts of shadows moving
remotely of a background from which unforeseen events might issue  not
for a moment did they believe byrons wild statement they only realized
he was in some way unknown to them and beyond their guessing a guilty
man and upon them began to press the feeling that a spirit was abroad
a spirit which like clouds swept up from the rim of the sea might be
winged with unknown and ruinous possibility
she knawed he said and in his voice was awe and an emotion more
poignant more personal  piercing the many veils he had found the
ultimate that ultimate which mercy hides  he understood at last that
he had been living in a world of illusions and that sabina kindly
tolerant had left him there  she had not taken them seriously had not
perhaps realized they were heady stuff which might give off the vapour
of death  from start to cruel finish she had preserved her careless
superiority and now when he thought her bested had turned in her grave
and laughed  by a word scribbled in haste at an odd moment she had
made a mock of his pretensions put him in his place  secret
humiliation is the black and bitter bread of which all shall eat but to
be set at naught before his fellows breaks a man  like a twig in er
ands i was and he snapped his big fingers like one snapping a stick
in two  from the beginning sabina had been the better man and his
revolt had been as hopeless as that of a child
a life for a life he muttered using a phrase with which he was
familiar twisting a little its plain meaning sabina was taking from
him not his life but the fullness thereof she was leaving him the
vessel but leaving it irreparably damaged like an old bucket through
the holes of which the grass may grow
byrons eye rose to the gun suspended over the door the feel of it
would be comforting  it was his only possession  sabinas money was
nothing to him let it go with the rest but the old gun
it seemed to him far away  between him and it rose like an insuperable
obstacle the faces of the relatives  he saw in these faces always the
eyes the eyes that had witnessed his humiliation  behind them were the
brains that knew him now for what he was a poor thing futile
impotent  if he could but reach the old gun he would take it and he
would go
what an intolerable burden were the eyes
mrs tom seeing byron glance at the gun hanging in its thongs over the
lintel misread his mind  she had been anxiously on the watch but by
degrees had lost her fear that he was dangerous  to himself perhaps
but no longer to others  grays marriage presented as an accomplished
fact had done its work  no longer a wild desire she was only a loss
among others but the sum total of these had been sufficient mrs tom
thought to bring home to the unhappy man his sin  conscious of guilt
he might be driven to a further recklessness might feel that for such
as he was only the one way out knowledge is responsibility and mrs
tom was moved by her sense of justice to intervene  byron should know
the truth that truth which she had kept even from tom which she had
hidden in a fold of her mind wrapping it up and putting it out of
sight
leadville she said leaning forward between her husband and his
cousin and speaking without any premonition of the event she was
precipitating rest yer eart content  she never drinked that cocoa
that you meant for er to
for a moment the burden of those intent eyes was lifted from byron  the
people turned towards mrs tom  what was she saying  what lay between
byron and the woman whom only that afternoon they had committed to the
earth  i took er life the man had said flinging their curiosity a
bone of fact  they were learning now that the bone had had meat on it
never drinked it  byron did not evince any surprise at mrs toms
knowledge did not feel any  he was only conscious of his overwhelming
need to escapeto escape from the eyes  his mind seized on this new
fact examining it with an anxious care  what was it to him would it
show him the way out
no twas that eavy supper  doctor said so and it was  i saved the
cocoa and tis out there in the jug
on finding the drink untouched when tidying the room on the morning of
sabinas death she had set it aside cocoa can be warmed up  putting
it on the linhay shelf she had not thought of it again until leadville
walking in his sleep had revealed the nature of the draught  even then
she had not thrown it away  it was evidence which might be needed
tis out there still and with a slight movement of the head she
indicated the linhay if she could convince byron that he was not guilty
of his wifes death she might lessen for him his sense of overwhelming
disaster wring the black drop out of his remorse
to the broken man only the irony of it came home and it came home so
overwhelmingly that in the bitterness of his spirit he laughed  he
had had a vision of sabina hanging the sword of fate over his head
hanging it on the thread of her life a thread which he in a moment of
amazing folly had cut  but nothing of the sort had happened  her
dying was no tragedy of stealthy murder but the scrapping by nature of a
wornout organism the memory of past emotion of grizzly fears of
things tremendous and dire and sinister passed before hima procession
of wraiths  they had had no foundation in fact they had risen out of
his mind preposterous things as preposterous as he  for what had he
done  nothing like a puppet a creature of wire and pasteboard he
had pranced and waved his arms  nevernot at the beginning not during
the long years of his servitude not even when he had tried to burst his
bonds had he been anything but impotent  he had loved wastrallsto no
purpose  he had loved gray and while he dreamed another had been at
the wooing even the crime he would have committed was fallen like a
spent arrow at his feet he had set out to prove himself the man of
blood and iron who would force his way through demon hosts and the
flaming swords of heaven to gain his ends he who was destined to fight
with shadows for a dream
sabinas death from heartweakness after hard work and a heavy supper
was fates last jest at his expense life had justified his wifes light
estimate of his powers and he who had believed himself able to control
circumstance had been proved harmless as a tame ranter in a booth
futile impotent  the tides of darkness were rising in the wide low
room were rising about the people hiding all but the watching eyes
leadville was conscious of coldness  a dark world and cold  had he
ever thought that he was young that he was strong that there was no
man in trevorrick who could put it across him  that must have been
long ago
what a thing was this impotence  like a brown shrivel in place of a
nutkernel it was rottenness but not dissolution  to live day after day
through interminable time and see the spread of the black mould to long
for that last mercy of the mould  life the pricking life of kisses
the ecstasy of the firstborn the content of ripening can become
leprous a thing to escape from at any cost  damnation  ay a threat
the threat of ignorance  no hell that any future life may hold can
equal what we know and if the gate be open
isolda rosevear had said i saved the cocoa tis out there still
and in the chambers of the mans distraught mind the words echoed
helpfully
sabina left the cocoa apurpose he said and saw the way clear  she
left it  for him too as for all living creatures was hope the hope
of deliverance  in sudden haste he turned and went out  delay had
been his curse but the need he was about to satisfy was so imperative
that he did not stay even to complete his sentence
on the linhay shelf apart from other cloam stood the brown
highgirdled jug  though the place was in darkness byrons hand went
out to it as unerringly as when he sought the blue phial in the wall
cupboard and as he lifted it down he heard with an eager thankfulness
the sound of liquid swishing against the earthenware
sabina knowing how much he could stand had made ready for him a way of
escape  she left it for me he said and with a sob of relief lifted
the brown jug to his lips
