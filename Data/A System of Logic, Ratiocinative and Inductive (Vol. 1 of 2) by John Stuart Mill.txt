preface to the first edition
this book makes no pretence of giving to the world a new theory of the
intellectual operations its claim to attention if it possess any is
grounded on the fact that it is an attempt not to supersede but to embody
and systematize the best ideas which have been either promulgated on its
subject by speculative writers or conformed to by accurate thinkers in
their scientific inquiries
to cement together the detached fragments of a subject never yet treated
as a whole to harmonize the true portions of discordant theories by
supplying the links of thought necessary to connect them and by
disentangling them from the errors with which they are always more or less
interwoven must necessarily require a considerable amount of original
speculation to other originality than this the present work lays no
claim in the existing state of the cultivation of the sciences there
would be a very strong presumption against any one who should imagine that
he had effected a revolution in the theory of the investigation of truth
or added any fundamentally new process to the practice of it the
improvement which remains to be effected in the methods of philosophizing
and the author believes that they have much need of improvement can only
consist in performing more systematically and accurately operations with
which at least in their elementary form the human intellect in some one
or other of its employments is already familiar
in the portion of the work which treats of ratiocination the author has
not deemed it necessary to enter into technical details which may be
obtained in so perfect a shape from the existing treatises on what is
termed the logic of the schools in the contempt entertained by many
modern philosophers for the syllogistic art it will be seen that he by no
means participates although the scientific theory on which its defence is
usually rested appears to him erroneous and the view which he has
suggested of the nature and functions of the syllogism may perhaps
afford the means of conciliating the principles of the art with as much as
is well grounded in the doctrines and objections of its assailants
the same abstinence from details could not be observed in the first book
on names and propositions because many useful principles and distinctions
which were contained in the old logic have been gradually omitted from
the writings of its later teachers and it appeared desirable both to
revive these and to reform and rationalize the philosophical foundation
on which they stood the earlier chapters of this preliminary book will
consequently appear to some readers needlessly elementary and
scholastic but those who know in what darkness the nature of our
knowledge and of the processes by which it is obtained is often involved
by a confused apprehension of the import of the different classes of words
and assertions will not regard these discussions as either frivolous or
irrelevant to the topics considered in the later books
on the subject of induction the task to be performed was that of
generalizing the modes of investigating truth and estimating evidence by
which so many important and recondite laws of nature have in the various
sciences been aggregated to the stock of human knowledge that this is
not a task free from difficulty may be presumed from the fact that even
at a very recent period eminent writers among whom it is sufficient to
name archbishop whately and the author of a celebrated article on bacon
in the edinburgh review have not scrupled to pronounce it
impossible1 the author has endeavoured to combat their theory in the
manner in which diogenes confuted the sceptical reasonings against the
possibility of motion remembering that diogenes argument would have been
equally conclusive though his individual perambulations might not have
extended beyond the circuit of his own tub
whatever may be the value of what the author has succeeded in effecting on
this branch of his subject it is a duty to acknowledge that for much of
it he has been indebted to several important treatises partly historical
and partly philosophical on the generalities and processes of physical
science which have been published within the last few years to these
treatises and to their authors he has endeavoured to do justice in the
body of the work but as with one of these writers dr whewell he has
occasion frequently to express differences of opinion it is more
particularly incumbent on him in this place to declare that without the
aid derived from the facts and ideas contained in that gentlemans
history of the inductive sciences the corresponding portion of this
work would probably not have been written
the concluding book is an attempt to contribute towards the solution of a
question which the decay of old opinions and the agitation that disturbs
european society to its inmost depths render as important in the present
day to the practical interests of human life as it must at all times be
to the completeness of our speculative knowledge viz whether moral and
social phenomena are really exceptions to the general certainty and
uniformity of the course of nature and how far the methods by which so
many of the laws of the physical world have been numbered among truths
irrevocably acquired and universally assented to can be made instrumental
to the formation of a similar body of received doctrine in moral and
political science
preface to the third edition
several criticisms of a more or less controversial character on this
work have appeared since the publication of the second edition and dr
whewell has lately published a reply to those parts of it in which some of
his opinions were controverted
i have carefully reconsidered all the points on which my conclusions have
been assailed but i have not to announce a change of opinion on any
matter of importance such minor oversights as have been detected either
by myself or by my critics i have in general silently corrected but it
is not to be inferred that i agree with the objections which have been
made to a passage in every instance in which i have altered or cancelled
it i have often done so merely that it might not remain a
stumblingblock when the amount of discussion necessary to place the
matter in its true light would have exceeded what was suitable to the
occasion
to several of the arguments which have been urged against me i have
thought it useful to reply with some degree of minuteness not from any
taste for controversy but because the opportunity was favourable for
placing my own conclusions and the grounds of them more clearly and
completely before the reader truth on these subjects is militant and
can only establish itself by means of conflict the most opposite opinions
can make a plausible show of evidence while each has the statement of its
own case and it is only possible to ascertain which of them is in the
right after hearing and comparing what each can say against the other
and what the other can urge in its defence
even the criticisms from which i most dissent have been of great service
to me by showing in what places the exposition most needed to be
improved or the arguments strengthened and i should have been well
pleased if the book had undergone a much greater amount of attack as in
that case i should probably have been enabled to improve it still more
than i believe i have now done
introduction
 1 there is as great diversity among authors in the modes which they
have adopted of defining logic as in their treatment of the details of
it this is what might naturally be expected on any subject on which
writers have availed themselves of the same language as a means of
delivering different ideas ethics and jurisprudence are liable to the
remark in common with logic almost every writer having taken a different
view of some of the particulars which these branches of knowledge are
usually understood to include each has so framed his definition as to
indicate beforehand his own peculiar tenets and sometimes to beg the
question in their favour
this diversity is not so much an evil to be complained of as an
inevitable and in some degree a proper result of the imperfect state of
those sciences it is not to be expected that there should be agreement
about the definition of a thing until there is agreement about the thing
itself to define a thing is to select from among the whole of its
properties those which shall be understood to be designated and declared
by its name and the properties must be well known to us before we can be
competent to determine which of them are fittest to be chosen for this
purpose accordingly in the case of so complex an aggregation of
particulars as are comprehended in anything which can be called a science
the definition we set out with is seldom that which a more extensive
knowledge of the subject shows to be the most appropriate until we know
the particulars themselves we cannot fix upon the most correct and
compact mode of circumscribing them by a general description it was not
till after an extensive and accurate acquaintance with the details of
chemical phenomena that it was found possible to frame a rational
definition of chemistry and the definition of the science of life and
organization is still a matter of dispute so long as the sciences are
imperfect the definitions must partake of their imperfections and if the
former are progressive the latter ought to be so too as much therefore
as is to be expected from a definition placed at the commencement of a
subject is that it should define the scope of our inquiries and the
definition which i am about to offer of the science of logic pretends to
nothing more than to be a statement of the question which i have put to
myself and which this book is an attempt to resolve the reader is at
liberty to object to it as a definition of logic but it is at all events
a correct definition of the subject of these volumes
 2 logic has often been called the art of reasoning a writer2 who has
done more than any other living person to restore this study to the rank
from which it had fallen in the estimation of the cultivated class in our
own country has adopted the above definition with an amendment he has
defined logic to be the science as well as the art of reasoning meaning
by the former term the analysis of the mental process which takes place
whenever we reason and by the latter the rules grounded on that
analysis for conducting the process correctly there can be no doubt as
to the propriety of the emendation a right understanding of the mental
process itself of the conditions it depends on and the steps of which it
consists is the only basis on which a system of rules fitted for the
direction of the process can possibly be founded art necessarily
presupposes knowledge art in any but its infant state presupposes
scientific knowledge and if every art does not bear the name of the
science on which it rests it is only because several sciences are often
necessary to form the groundwork of a single art such is the complication
of human affairs that to enable one thing to be done it is often
requisite to know the nature and properties of many things
logic then comprises the science of reasoning as well as an art
founded on that science but the word reasoning again like most other
scientific terms in popular use abounds in ambiguities in one of its
acceptations it means syllogizing or the mode of inference which may be
called with sufficient accuracy for the present purpose concluding from
generals to particulars in another of its senses to reason is simply to
infer any assertion from assertions already admitted and in this sense
induction is as much entitled to be called reasoning as the demonstrations
of geometry
writers on logic have generally preferred the former acceptation of the
term the latter and more extensive signification is that in which i mean
to use it i do this by virtue of the right i claim for every author to
give whatever provisional definition he pleases of his own subject but
sufficient reasons will i believe unfold themselves as we advance why
this should be not only the provisional but the final definition it
involves at all events no arbitrary change in the meaning of the word
for with the general usage of the english language the wider
signification i believe accords better than the more restricted one
 3 but reasoning even in the widest sense of which the word is
susceptible does not seem to comprehend all that is included either in
the best or even in the most current conception of the scope and
province of our science the employment of the word logic to denote the
theory of argumentation is derived from the aristotelian or as they are
commonly termed the scholastic logicians yet even with them in their
systematic treatises argumentation was the subject only of the third
part the two former treated of terms and of propositions under one or
other of which heads were also included definition and division
professedly indeed these previous topics were introduced only on account
of their connexion with reasoning and as a preparation for the doctrine
and rules of the syllogism yet they were treated with greater minuteness
and dwelt on at greater length than was required for that purpose alone
more recent writers on logic have generally understood the term as it was
employed by the able author of the port royal logic viz as equivalent to
the art of thinking nor is this acceptation confined to books and
scientific inquirers even in ordinary conversation the ideas connected
with the word logic include at least precision of language and accuracy
of classification and we perhaps oftener hear persons speak of a logical
arrangement or of expressions logically defined than of conclusions
logically deduced from premisses again a man is often called a great
logician or a man of powerful logic not for the accuracy of his
deductions but for the extent of his command over premisses because the
general propositions required for explaining a difficulty or refuting a
sophism copiously and promptly occur to him because in short his
knowledge besides being ample is well under his command for
argumentative use whether therefore we conform to the practice of those
who have made the subject their particular study or to that of popular
writers and common discourse the province of logic will include several
operations of the intellect not usually considered to fall within the
meaning of the terms reasoning and argumentation
these various operations might be brought within the compass of the
science and the additional advantage be obtained of a very simple
definition if by an extension of the term sanctioned by high
authorities we were to define logic as the science which treats of the
operations of the human understanding in the pursuit of truth for to this
ultimate end naming classification definition and all other operations
over which logic has ever claimed jurisdiction are essentially
subsidiary they may all be regarded as contrivances for enabling a person
to know the truths which are needful to him and to know them at the
precise moment at which they are needful other purposes indeed are also
served by these operations for instance that of imparting our knowledge
to others but viewed with regard to this purpose they have never been
considered as within the province of the logician the sole object of
logic is the guidance of ones own thoughts the communication of those
thoughts to others falls under the consideration of rhetoric in the large
sense in which that art was conceived by the ancients or of the still
more extensive art of education logic takes cognizance of our
intellectual operations only as they conduce to our own knowledge and to
our command over that knowledge for our own uses if there were but one
rational being in the universe that being might be a perfect logician
and the science and art of logic would be the same for that one person as
for the whole human race
 4 but if the definition which we formerly examined included too
little that which is now suggested has the opposite fault of including
too much
truths are known to us in two ways some are known directly and of
themselves some through the medium of other truths the former are the
subject of intuition or consciousness the latter of inference the
truths known by intuition are the original premisses from which all others
are inferred our assent to the conclusion being grounded on the truth of
the premisses we never could arrive at any knowledge by reasoning unless
something could be known antecedently to all reasoning
examples of truths known to us by immediate consciousness are our own
bodily sensations and mental feelings i know directly and of my own
knowledge that i was vexed yesterday or that i am hungry today
examples of truths which we know only by way of inference are occurrences
which took place while we were absent the events recorded in history or
the theorems of mathematics the two former we infer from the testimony
adduced or from the traces of those past occurrences which still exist
the latter from the premisses laid down in books of geometry under the
title of definitions and axioms whatever we are capable of knowing must
belong to the one class or to the other must be in the number of the
primitive data or of the conclusions which can be drawn from these
with the original data or ultimate premisses of our knowledge with their
number or nature the mode in which they are obtained or the tests by
which they may be distinguished logic in a direct way at least has in
the sense in which i conceive the science nothing to do these questions
are partly not a subject of science at all partly that of a very
different science
whatever is known to us by consciousness is known beyond possibility of
question what one sees or feels whether bodily or mentally one cannot
but be sure that one sees or feels no science is required for the purpose
of establishing such truths no rules of art can render our knowledge of
them more certain than it is in itself there is no logic for this portion
of our knowledge
but we may fancy that we see or feel what we in reality infer newton saw
the truth of many propositions of geometry without reading the
demonstrations but not we may be sure without their flashing through
his mind a truth or supposed truth which is really the result of a very
rapid inference may seem to be apprehended intuitively it has long been
agreed by thinkers of the most opposite schools that this mistake is
actually made in so familiar an instance as that of the eyesight there is
nothing of which we appear to ourselves to be more directly conscious
than the distance of an object from us yet it has long been ascertained
that what is perceived by the eye is at most nothing more than a
variously coloured surface that when we fancy we see distance all we
really see is certain variations of apparent size and degrees of
faintness of colour and that our estimate of the objects distance from
us is the result of a comparison made with so much rapidity that we are
unconscious of making it between the size and colour of the object as
they appear at the time and the size and colour of the same or of similar
objects as they appeared when close at hand or when their degree of
remoteness was known by other evidence the perception of distance by the
eye which seems so like intuition is thus in reality an inference
grounded on experience an inference too which we learn to make and
which we make with more and more correctness as our experience increases
though in familiar cases it takes place so rapidly as to appear exactly
on a par with those perceptions of sight which are really intuitive our
perceptions of colour3
of the science therefore which expounds the operations of the human
understanding in the pursuit of truth one essential part is the inquiry
what are the facts which are the objects of intuition or consciousness
and what are those which we merely infer but this inquiry has never been
considered a portion of logic its place is in another and a perfectly
distinct department of science to which the name metaphysics more
particularly belongs that portion of mental philosophy which attempts to
determine what part of the furniture of the mind belongs to it originally
and what part is constructed out of materials furnished to it from
without to this science appertain the great and much debated questions of
the existence of matter the existence of spirit and of a distinction
between it and matter the reality of time and space as things without
the mind and distinguishable from the objects which are said to exist
in them for in the present state of the discussion on these topics it
is almost universally allowed that the existence of matter or of spirit
of space or of time is in its nature unsusceptible of being proved and
that if anything is known of them it must be by immediate intuition to
the same science belong the inquiries into the nature of conception
perception memory and belief all of which are operations of the
understanding in the pursuit of truth but with which as phenomena of the
mind or with the possibility which may or may not exist of analysing any
of them into simpler phenomena the logician as such has no concern to
this science must also be referred the following and all analogous
questions to what extent our intellectual faculties and our emotions are
innateto what extent the result of association whether god and duty
are realities the existence of which is manifest to us  priori by the
constitution of our rational faculty or whether our ideas of them are
acquired notions the origin of which we are able to trace and explain
and the reality of the objects themselves a question not of consciousness
or intuition but of evidence and reasoning
the province of logic must be restricted to that portion of our knowledge
which consists of inferences from truths previously known whether those
antecedent data be general propositions or particular observations and
perceptions logic is not the science of belief but the science of proof
or evidence in so far as belief professes to be founded on proof the
office of logic is to supply a test for ascertaining whether or not the
belief is well grounded with the claims which any proposition has to
belief on the evidence of consciousness that is without evidence in the
proper sense of the word logic has nothing to do
 5 by far the greatest portion of our knowledge whether of general
truths or of particular facts being avowedly matter of inference nearly
the whole not only of science but of human conduct is amenable to the
authority of logic to draw inferences has been said to be the great
business of life every one has daily hourly and momentary need of
ascertaining facts which he has not directly observed not from any
general purpose of adding to his stock of knowledge but because the facts
themselves are of importance to his interests or to his occupations the
business of the magistrate of the military commander of the navigator
of the physician of the agriculturist is merely to judge of evidence
and to act accordingly they all have to ascertain certain facts in order
that they may afterwards apply certain rules either devised by
themselves or prescribed for their guidance by others and as they do
this well or ill so they discharge well or ill the duties of their
several callings it is the only occupation in which the mind never ceases
to be engaged and is the subject not of logic but of knowledge in
general
logic however is not the same thing with knowledge though the field of
logic is coextensive with the field of knowledge logic is the common
judge and arbiter of all particular investigations it does not undertake
to find evidence but to determine whether it has been found logic
neither observes nor invents nor discovers but judges it is no part of
the business of logic to inform the surgeon what appearances are found to
accompany a violent death this he must learn from his own experience and
observation or from that of others his predecessors in his peculiar
pursuit but logic sits in judgment on the sufficiency of that observation
and experience to justify his rules and on the sufficiency of his rules
to justify his conduct it does not give him proofs but teaches him what
makes them proofs and how he is to judge of them it does not teach that
any particular fact proves any other but points out to what conditions
all facts must conform in order that they may prove other facts to
decide whether any given fact fulfils these conditions or whether facts
can be found which fulfil them in a given case belongs exclusively to the
particular art or science or to our knowledge of the particular subject
it is in this sense that logic is what bacon so expressively called it
ars artium the science of science itself all science consists of data
and conclusions from those data of proofs and what they prove now logic
points out what relations must subsist between data and whatever can be
concluded from them between proof and everything which it can prove if
there be any such indispensable relations and if these can be precisely
determined every particular branch of science as well as every
individual in the guidance of his conduct is bound to conform to those
relations under the penalty of making false inferences of drawing
conclusions which are not grounded in the realities of things whatever
has at any time been concluded justly whatever knowledge has been
acquired otherwise than by immediate intuition depended on the observance
of the laws which it is the province of logic to investigate if the
conclusions are just and the knowledge real those laws whether known or
not have been observed
 6 we need not therefore seek any farther for a solution of the
question so often agitated respecting the utility of logic if a science
of logic exists or is capable of existing it must be useful if there be
rules to which every mind consciously or unconsciously conforms in every
instance in which it infers rightly there seems little necessity for
discussing whether a person is more likely to observe those rules when he
knows the rules than when he is unacquainted with them
a science may undoubtedly be brought to a certain not inconsiderable
stage of advancement without the application of any other logic to it
than what all persons who are said to have a sound understanding acquire
empirically in the course of their studies mankind judged of evidence
and often correctly before logic was a science or they never could have
made it one and they executed great mechanical works before they
understood the laws of mechanics but there are limits both to what
mechanicians can do without principles of mechanics and to what thinkers
can do without principles of logic a few individuals may by
extraordinary genius anticipate the results of science but the bulk of
mankind require either to understand the theory of what they are doing or
to have rules laid down for them by those who have understood the theory
in the progress of science from its easiest to its more difficult
problems each great step in advance has usually had either as its
precursor or as its accompaniment and necessary condition a
corresponding improvement in the notions and principles of logic received
among the most advanced thinkers and if several of the more difficult
sciences are still in so defective a state if not only so little is
proved but disputation has not terminated even about the little which
seemed to be so the reason perhaps is that mens logical notions have
not yet acquired the degree of extension or of accuracy requisite for
the estimation of the evidence proper to those particular departments of
knowledge
 7 logic then is the science of the operations of the understanding
which are subservient to the estimation of evidence both the process
itself of proceeding from known truths to unknown and all other
intellectual operations in so far as auxiliary to this it includes
therefore the operation of naming for language is an instrument of
thought as well as a means of communicating our thoughts it includes
also definition and classification for the use of these operations
putting all other minds than ones own out of consideration is to serve
not only for keeping our evidences and the conclusions from them permanent
and readily accessible in the memory but for so marshalling the facts
which we may at any time be engaged in investigating as to enable us to
perceive more clearly what evidence there is and to judge with fewer
chances of error whether it be sufficient these therefore are
operations specially instrumental to the estimation of evidence and as
such are within the province of logic there are other more elementary
processes concerned in all thinking such as conception memory and the
like but of these it is not necessary that logic should take any peculiar
cognizance since they have no special connexion with the problem of
evidence further than that like all other problems addressed to the
understanding it presupposes them
our object then will be to attempt a correct analysis of the
intellectual process called reasoning or inference and of such other
mental operations as are intended to facilitate this as well as on the
foundation of this analysis and pari  passu with it to bring
together or frame a set of rules or canons for testing the sufficiency of
any given evidence to prove any given proposition
with respect to the first part of this undertaking i do not attempt to
decompose the mental operations in question into their ultimate elements
it is enough if the analysis as far as it goes is correct and if it goes
far enough for the practical purposes of logic considered as an art the
separation of a complicated phenomenon into its component parts is not
like a connected and interdependent chain of proof if one link of an
argument breaks the whole drops to the ground but one step towards an
analysis holds good and has an independent value though we should never
be able to make a second the results of analytical chemistry are not the
less valuable though it should be discovered that all which we now call
simple substances are really compounds all other things are at any rate
compounded of those elements whether the elements themselves admit of
decomposition is an important inquiry but does not affect the certainty
of the science up to that point
i shall accordingly attempt to analyse the process of inference and the
processes subordinate to inference so far only as may be requisite for
ascertaining the difference between a correct and an incorrect performance
of those processes the reason for thus limiting our design is evident
it has been said by objectors to logic that we do not learn to use our
muscles by studying their anatomy the fact is not quite fairly stated
for if the action of any of our muscles were vitiated by local weakness
or other physical defect a knowledge of their anatomy might be very
necessary for effecting a cure but we should be justly liable to the
criticism involved in this objection were we in a treatise on logic to
carry the analysis of the reasoning process beyond the point at which any
inaccuracy which may have crept into it must become visible in learning
bodily exercises to carry on the same illustration we do and must
analyse the bodily motions so far as is necessary for distinguishing those
which ought to be performed from those which ought not to a similar
extent and no further it is necessary that the logician should analyse
the mental processes with which logic is concerned any ulterior and
minuter analysis must be left to metaphysics which in this as in other
parts of our mental nature decides what are ultimate facts and what are
resolvable into other facts and i believe it will be found that the
conclusions arrived at in this work have no necessary connexion with any
particular views respecting the ulterior analysis logic is common ground
on which the partisans of hartley and of reid of locke and of kant may
meet and join hands particular and detached opinions of all these
thinkers will no doubt occasionally be controverted since all of them
were logicians as well as metaphysicians but the field on which their
principal battles have been fought lies beyond the boundaries of our
science
it cannot indeed be pretended that logical principles can be altogether
irrelevant to those more abstruse discussions nor is it possible but that
the view we are led to take of the problem which logic proposes must have
a tendency favourable to the adoption of some one opinion on these
controverted subjects rather than another for metaphysics in
endeavouring to solve its own peculiar problem must employ means the
validity of which falls under the cognizance of logic it proceeds no
doubt as far as possible merely by a closer and more attentive
interrogation of our consciousness or more properly speaking of our
memory and so far is not amenable to logic but wherever this method is
insufficient to attain the end of its inquiries it must proceed like
other sciences by means of evidence now the moment this science begins
to draw inferences from evidence logic becomes the sovereign judge
whether its inferences are wellgrounded or what other inferences would
be so
this however constitutes no nearer or other relation between logic and
metaphysics than that which exists between logic and all the other
sciences and i can conscientiously affirm that no one proposition laid
down in this work has been adopted for the sake of establishing or with
any reference to its fitness for being employed in establishing
preconceived opinions in any department of knowledge or of inquiry on
which the speculative world is still undecided

 1 it is so much the established practice of writers on logic to
commence their treatises by a few general observations in most cases it
is true rather meagre on terms and their varieties that it will
perhaps scarcely be required from me in merely following the common
usage to be as particular in assigning my reasons as it is usually
expected that those should be who deviate from it
the practice indeed is recommended by considerations far too obvious to
require a formal justification logic is a portion of the art of thinking
language is evidently and by the admission of all philosophers one of
the principal instruments or helps of thought and any imperfection in the
instrument or in the mode of employing it is confessedly liable still
more than in almost any other art to confuse and impede the process and
destroy all ground of confidence in the result for a mind not previously
versed in the meaning and right use of the various kinds of words to
attempt the study of methods of philosophizing would be as if some one
should attempt to make himself an astronomical observer having never
learned to adjust the focal distance of his optical instruments so as to
see distinctly
since reasoning or inference the principal subject of logic is an
operation which usually takes place by means of words and in complicated
cases can take place in no other way those who have not a thorough
insight into the signification and purposes of words will be under
chances amounting almost to certainty of reasoning or inferring
incorrectly and logicians have generally felt that unless in the very
first stage they removed this fertile source of error unless they taught
their pupil to put away the glasses which distort the object and to use
those which are adapted to his purpose in such a manner as to assist not
perplex his vision he would not be in a condition to practise the
remaining part of their discipline with any prospect of advantage
therefore it is that an inquiry into language so far as is needful to
guard against the errors to which it gives rise has at all times been
deemed a necessary preliminary to the study of logic
but there is another reason of a still more fundamental nature why the
import of words should be the earliest subject of the logicians
consideration because without it he cannot examine into the import of
propositions now this is a subject which stands on the very threshold of
the science of logic
the object of logic as defined in the introductory chapter is to
ascertain how we come by that portion of our knowledge much the greatest
portion which is not intuitive and by what criterion we can in matters
not selfevident distinguish between things proved and things not proved
between what is worthy and what is unworthy of belief of the various
questions which present themselves to our inquiring faculties some
receive an answer from direct consciousness others if resolved at all
can only be resolved by means of evidence logic is concerned with these
last but before inquiring into the mode of resolving questions it is
necessary to inquire what are those which offer themselves what
questions are conceivable what inquiries are there to which mankind have
either obtained or been able to imagine it possible that they should
obtain an answer this point is best ascertained by a survey and analysis
of propositions
 2 the answer to every question which it is possible to frame is
contained in a proposition or assertion whatever can be an object of
belief or even of disbelief must when put into words assume the form
of a proposition all truth and all error lie in propositions what by a
convenient misapplication of an abstract term we call a truth means
simply a true proposition and errors are false propositions to know the
import of all possible propositions would be to know all questions which
can be raised all matters which are susceptible of being either believed
or disbelieved how many kinds of inquiries can be propounded how many
kinds of judgments can be made and how many kinds of propositions it is
possible to frame with a meaning are but different forms of one and the
same question since then the objects of all belief and of all inquiry
express themselves in propositions a sufficient scrutiny of propositions
and of their varieties will apprize us what questions mankind have
actually asked of themselves and what in the nature of answers to those
questions they have actually thought they had grounds to believe
now the first glance at a proposition shows that it is formed by putting
together two names a proposition according to the common simple
definition which is sufficient for our purpose is discourse in
which something is affirmed or denied of something thus in the
proposition gold is yellow the quality yellow is affirmed of the
substance gold in the proposition franklin was not born in england
the fact expressed by the words born in england is denied of the man
franklin
every proposition consists of three parts the subject the predicate and
the copula the predicate is the name denoting that which is affirmed or
denied the subject is the name denoting the person or thing which
something is affirmed or denied of the copula is the sign denoting that
there is an affirmation or denial and thereby enabling the hearer or
reader to distinguish a proposition from any other kind of discourse
thus in the proposition the earth is round the predicate is the word
round which denotes the quality affirmed or as the phrase is
predicated the earth words denoting the object which that quality is
affirmed of compose the subject the word is which serves as the
connecting mark between the subject and predicate to show that one of
them is affirmed of the other is called the copula
dismissing for the present the copula of which more will be said
hereafter every proposition then consists of at least two names brings
together two names in a particular manner this is already a first step
towards what we are in quest of it appears from this that for an act of
belief one object is not sufficient the simplest act of belief
supposes and has something to do with two objects two names to say
the least and since the names must be names of something two nameable
things a large class of thinkers would cut the matter short by saying
two ideas they would say that the subject and predicate are both of
them names of ideas the idea of gold for instance and the idea of
yellow and that what takes place or a part of what takes place in the
act of belief consists in bringing as it is often expressed one of
these ideas under the other but this we are not yet in a condition to
say whether such be the correct mode of describing the phenomenon is an
after consideration the result with which for the present we must be
contented is that in every act of belief two objects are in some
manner taken cognizance of that there can be no belief claimed or
question propounded which does not embrace two distinct either material
or intellectual subjects of thought each of them capable or not of being
conceived by itself but incapable of being believed by itself
i may say for instance the sun the word has a meaning and suggests
that meaning to the mind of any one who is listening to me but suppose i
ask him whether it is true whether he believes it he can give no
answer there is as yet nothing to believe or to disbelieve now
however let me make of all possible assertions respecting the sun the
one which involves the least of reference to any object besides itself
let me say the sun exists here at once is something which a person
can say he believes but here instead of only one we find two distinct
objects of conception the sun is one object existence is another let it
not be said that this second conception existence is involved in the
first for the sun may be conceived as no longer existing the sun does
not convey all the meaning that is conveyed by the sun exists my
father does not include all the meaning of my father exists for he may
be dead a round square does not include the meaning of a round square
exists for it does not and cannot exist when i say the sun my
father or a round square i call upon the hearer for no belief or
disbelief nor can either the one or the other be afforded me but if i
say the sun exists my father exists or a round square exists i
call for belief and should in the first of the three instances meet
with it in the second with belief or disbelief as the case might be in
the third with disbelief
 3 this first step in the analysis of the object of belief which
though so obvious will be found to be not unimportant is the only one
which we shall find it practicable to make without a preliminary survey of
language if we attempt to proceed further in the same path that is to
analyse any further the import of propositions we find forced upon us as
a subject of previous consideration the import of names for every
proposition consists of two names and every proposition affirms or denies
one of these names of the other now what we do what passes in our mind
when we affirm or deny two names of one another must depend on what they
are names of since it is with reference to that and not to the mere
names themselves that we make the affirmation or denial here therefore
we find a new reason why the signification of names and the relation
generally between names and the things signified by them must occupy the
preliminary stage of the inquiry we are engaged in
it may be objected that the meaning of names can guide us at most only to
the opinions possibly the foolish and groundless opinions which mankind
have formed concerning things and that as the object of philosophy is
truth not opinion the philosopher should dismiss words and look into
things themselves to ascertain what questions can be asked and answered
in regard to them this advice which no one has it in his power to
follow is in reality an exhortation to discard the whole fruits of the
labours of his predecessors and conduct himself as if he were the first
person who had ever turned an inquiring eye upon nature what does any
ones personal knowledge of things amount to after subtracting all which
he has acquired by means of the words of other people even after he has
learned as much as people usually do learn from others will the notions
of things contained in his individual mind afford as sufficient a basis
for a catalogue raisonn as the notions which are in the minds of all
mankind
in any enumeration and classification of things which does not set out
from their names no varieties of things will of course be comprehended
but those recognised by the particular inquirer and it will still remain
to be established by a subsequent examination of names that the
enumeration has omitted nothing which ought to have been included but if
we begin with names and use them as our clue to the things we bring at
once before us all the distinctions which have been recognised not by a
single inquirer but by all inquirers taken together it doubtless may
and i believe it will be found that mankind have multiplied the
varieties unnecessarily and have imagined distinctions among things where
there were only distinctions in the manner of naming them but we are not
entitled to assume this in the commencement we must begin by recognising
the distinctions made by ordinary language if some of these appear on a
close examination not to be fundamental the enumeration of the different
kinds of realities may be abridged accordingly but to impose upon the
facts in the first instance the yoke of a theory while the grounds of the
theory are reserved for discussion in a subsequent stage is not a course
which a logician can reasonably adopt
chapter ii of names
 1 a name says hobbes4 is a word taken at pleasure to serve for a
mark which may raise in our mind a thought like to some thought we had
before and which being pronounced to others may be to them a sign of
what thought the speaker had5 before in his mind this simple
definition of a name as a word or set of words serving the double
purpose of a mark to recall to ourselves the likeness of a former thought
and a sign to make it known to others appears unexceptionable names
indeed do much more than this but whatever else they do grows out of
and is the result of this as will appear in its proper place
are names more properly said to be the names of things or of our ideas of
things the first is the expression in common use the last is that of
some metaphysicians who conceived that in adopting it they were
introducing a highly important distinction the eminent thinker just
quoted seems to countenance the latter opinion but seeing he
continues names ordered in speech as is defined are signs of our
conceptions it is manifest they are not signs of the things themselves
for that the sound of this word stone should be the sign of a stone
cannot be understood in any sense but this that he that hears it collects
that he that pronounces it thinks of a stone
if it be merely meant that the conception alone and not the thing itself
is recalled by the name or imparted to the hearer this of course cannot
be denied nevertheless there seems good reason for adhering to the
common usage and calling the word sun the name of the sun and not the
name of our idea of the sun for names are not intended only to make the
hearer conceive what we conceive but also to inform him what we believe
now when i use a name for the purpose of expressing a belief it is a
belief concerning the thing itself not concerning my idea of it when i
say the sun is the cause of day i do not mean that my idea of the sun
causes or excites in me the idea of day or in other words that thinking
of the sun makes me think of day i mean that a certain physical fact
which is called the suns presence and which in the ultimate analysis
resolves itself into sensations not ideas causes another physical fact
which is called day it seems proper to consider a word as the name of
that which we intend to be understood by it when we use it of that which
any fact that we assert of it is to be understood of that in short
concerning which when we employ the word we intend to give information
names therefore shall always be spoken of in this work as the names of
things themselves and not merely of our ideas of things
but the question now arises of what things and to answer this it is
necessary to take into consideration the different kinds of names
 2 it is usual before examining the various classes into which names
are commonly divided to begin by distinguishing from names of every
description those words which are not names but only parts of names
among such are reckoned particles as of to truly often the
inflected cases of nouns substantive as me him johns6 and
even adjectives as large heavy these words do not express things of
which anything can be affirmed or denied we cannot say heavy fell or a
heavy fell truly or a truly was asserted of or an of was in the
room unless indeed we are speaking of the mere words themselves as
when we say truly is an english word or heavy is an adjective in that
case they are complete names viz names of those particular sounds or of
those particular collections of written characters this employment of a
word to denote the mere letters and syllables of which it is composed was
termed by the schoolmen the suppositio materialis of the word in any
other sense we cannot introduce one of these words into the subject of a
proposition unless in combination with other words as a heavy body
fell a truly important fact was asserted a member of parliament
was in the room
an adjective however is capable of standing by itself as the predicate
of a proposition as when we say snow is white and occasionally even as
the subject for we may say white is an agreeable colour the adjective
is often said to be so used by a grammatical ellipsis snow is white
instead of snow is a white object white is an agreeable colour instead
of a white colour or the colour white is agreeable the greeks and
romans were allowed by the rules of their language to employ this
ellipsis universally in the subject as well as in the predicate of a
proposition in english this cannot generally speaking be done we may
say the earth is round but we cannot say round is easily moved we must
say a round object this distinction however is rather grammatical than
logical since there is no difference of meaning between round and a
round object it is only custom which prescribes that on any given
occasion one shall be used and not the other we shall therefore without
scruple speak of adjectives as names whether in their own right or as
representative of the more circuitous forms of expression above
exemplified the other classes of subsidiary words have no title whatever
to be considered as names an adverb or an accusative case cannot under
any circumstances except when their mere letters and syllables are spoken
of figure as one of the terms of a proposition
words which are not capable of being used as names but only as parts of
names were called by some of the schoolmen syncategorematic terms from
 with and  to predicate because it was only with some
other word that they could be predicated a word which could be used
either as the subject or predicate of a proposition without being
accompanied by any other word was termed by the same authorities a
categorematic term a combination of one or more categorematic and one or
more syncategorematic words as a heavy body or a court of justice they
sometimes called a mixed term but this seems a needless multiplication
of technical expressions a mixed term is in the only useful sense of the
word categorematic it belongs to the class of what have been called
manyworded names
for as one word is frequently not a name but only part of a name so a
number of words often compose one single name and no more these words
the place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had destined for the
residence of the abyssinian princes form in the estimation of the
logician only one name one categorematic term a mode of determining
whether any set of words makes only one name or more than one is by
predicating something of it and observing whether by this predication
we make only one assertion or several thus when we say john nokes who
was the mayor of the town died yesterdayby this predication we make but
one assertion whence it appears that john nokes who was the mayor of
the town is no more than one name it is true that in this proposition
besides the assertion that john nokes died yesterday there is included
another assertion namely that john nokes was mayor of the town but this
last assertion was already made we did not make it by adding the
predicate died yesterday suppose however that the words had been
john nokes and the mayor of the town they would have formed two names
instead of one for when we say john nokes and the mayor of the town died
yesterday we make two assertions one that john nokes died yesterday
the other that the mayor of the town died yesterday
it being needless to illustrate at any greater length the subject of
manyworded names we proceed to the distinctions which have been
established among names not according to the words they are composed of
but according to their signification
 3 all names are names of something real or imaginary but all things
have not names appropriated to them individually for some individual
objects we require and consequently have separate distinguishing names
there is a name for every person and for every remarkable place other
objects of which we have not occasion to speak so frequently we do not
designate by a name of their own but when the necessity arises for naming
them we do so by putting together several words each of which by
itself might be and is used for an indefinite number of other objects as
when i say this stone this and stone being each of them names
that may be used of many other objects besides the particular one meant
although the only object of which they can both be used at the given
moment consistently with their signification may be the one of which i
wish to speak
were this the sole purpose for which names that are common to more things
than one could be employed if they only served by mutually limiting
each other to afford a designation for such individual objects as have no
names of their own they could only be ranked among contrivances for
economizing the use of language but it is evident that this is not their
sole function it is by their means that we are enabled to assert
general propositions to affirm or deny any predicate of an indefinite
number of things at once the distinction therefore between general
names and individual or singular names is fundamental and may be
considered as the first grand division of names
a general name is familiarly defined a name which is capable of being
truly affirmed in the same sense of each of an indefinite number of
things an individual or singular name is a name which is only capable of
being truly affirmed in the same sense of one thing
thus man is capable of being truly affirmed of john peter george
mary and other persons without assignable limit and it is affirmed of
all of them in the same sense for the word man expresses certain
qualities and when we predicate it of those persons we assert that they
all possess those qualities but john is only capable of being truly
affirmed of one single person at least in the same sense for although
there are many persons who bear that name it is not conferred upon them
to indicate any qualities or anything which belongs to them in common
and cannot be said to be affirmed of them in any sense at all
consequently not in the same sense the present queen of england is also
an individual name for that there never can be more than one person at a
time of whom it can be truly affirmed is implied in the meaning of the
words
it is not unusual by way of explaining what is meant by a general name
to say that it is the name of a class but this though a convenient
mode of expression for some purposes is objectionable as a definition
since it explains the clearer of two things by the more obscure it would
be more logical to reverse the proposition and turn it into a definition
of the word class a class is the indefinite multitude of individuals
denoted by a general name
it is necessary to distinguish general from collective names a
general name is one which can be predicated of each individual of a
multitude a collective name cannot be predicated of each separately but
only of all taken together the 76th regiment of foot which is a
collective name is not a general but an individual name for although it
can be predicated of a multitude of individual soldiers taken jointly it
cannot be predicated of them severally we may say jones is a soldier
and thompson is a soldier and smith is a soldier but we cannot say
jones is the 76th regiment and thompson is the 76th regiment and smith
is the 76th regiment we can only say jones and thompson and smith and
brown and so forth enumerating all the soldiers are the 76th
regiment
the 76th regiment is a collective name but not a general one a
regiment is both a collective and a general name general with respect to
all individual regiments of each of which separately it can be affirmed
collective with respect to the individual soldiers of whom any regiment
is composed
 4 the second general division of names is into concrete and
abstract a concrete name is a name which stands for a thing an
abstract name is a name which stands for an attribute of a thing thus
john the sea this table are names of things white also is a
name of a thing or rather of things whiteness again is the name of a
quality or attribute of those things man is a name of many things
humanity is a name of an attribute of those things old is a name of
things old age is a name of one of their attributes
i have used the words concrete and abstract in the sense annexed to them
by the schoolmen who notwithstanding the imperfections of their
philosophy were unrivalled in the construction of technical language and
whose definitions in logic at least though they never went more than a
little way into the subject have seldom i think been altered but to be
spoiled a practice however has grown up in more modern times which if
not introduced by locke has gained currency chiefly from his example of
applying the expression abstract name to all names which are the result
of abstraction or generalization and consequently to all general names
instead of confining it to the names of attributes the metaphysicians of
the condillac schoolwhose admiration of locke passing over the
profoundest speculations of that truly original genius usually fastens
with peculiar eagerness upon his weakest pointshave gone on imitating
him in this abuse of language until there is now some difficulty in
restoring the word to its original signification a more wanton alteration
in the meaning of a word is rarely to be met with for the expression
general name the exact equivalent of which exists in all languages i am
acquainted with was already available for the purpose to which abstract
has been misappropriated while the misappropriation leaves that important
class of words the names of attributes without any compact distinctive
appellation the old acceptation however has not gone so completely out
of use as to deprive those who still adhere to it of all chance of being
understood by abstract then i shall always mean the opposite of
concrete by an abstract name the name of an attribute by a concrete
name the name of an object
do abstract names belong to the class of general or to that of singular
names some of them are certainly general i mean those which are names
not of one single and definite attribute but of a class of attributes
such is the word colour which is a name common to whiteness redness
c such is even the word whiteness in respect of the different shades of
whiteness to which it is applied in common the word magnitude in respect
of the various degrees of magnitude and the various dimensions of space
the word weight in respect of the various degrees of weight such also is
the word attribute itself the common name of all particular attributes
but when only one attribute neither variable in degree nor in kind is
designated by the name as visibleness tangibleness equality
squareness milkwhiteness then the name can hardly be considered general
for though it denotes an attribute of many different objects the
attribute itself is always conceived as one not many the question is
however of no moment and perhaps the best way of deciding it would be to
consider these names as neither general nor individual but to place them
in a class apart
it may be objected to our definition of an abstract name that not only
the names which we have called abstract but adjectives which we have
placed in the concrete class are names of attributes that white for
example is as much the name of the colour as whiteness is but as
before remarked a word ought to be considered as the name of that which
we intend to be understood by it when we put it to its principal use that
is when we employ it in predication when we say snow is white milk is
white linen is white we do not mean it to be understood that snow or
linen or milk is a colour we mean that they are things having the
colour the reverse is the case with the word whiteness what we affirm to
be whiteness is not snow but the colour of snow whiteness therefore
is the name of the colour exclusively white is a name of all things
whatever having the colour a name not of the quality whiteness but of
every white object it is true this name was given to all those various
objects on account of the quality and we may therefore say without
impropriety that the quality forms part of its signification but a name
can only be said to stand for or to be a name of the things of which it
can be predicated we shall presently see that all names which can be said
to have any signification all names by applying which to an individual we
give any information respecting that individual may be said to imply an
attribute of some sort but they are not names of the attribute it has
its own proper abstract name
 5 this leads to the consideration of a third great division of names
into connotative and nonconnotative the latter sometimes but
improperly called absolute this is one of the most important
distinctions which we shall have occasion to point out and one of those
which go deepest into the nature of language
a nonconnotative term is one which signifies a subject only or an
attribute only a connotative term is one which denotes a subject and
implies an attribute by a subject is here meant anything which possesses
attributes thus john or london or england are names which signify a
subject only whiteness length virtue signify an attribute only none
of these names therefore are connotative but white long
virtuous are connotative the word white denotes all white things as
snow paper the foam of the sea c and implies or as it was termed by
the schoolmen connotes7 the attribute whiteness the word white is
not predicated of the attribute but of the subjects snow c but when
we predicate it of them we imply or connote that the attribute
whiteness belongs to them the same may be said of the other words above
cited virtuous for example is the name of a class which includes
socrates howard the man of ross and an undefined number of other
individuals past present and to come these individuals collectively
and severally can alone be said with propriety to be denoted by the word
of them alone can it properly be said to be a name but it is a name
applied to all of them in consequence of an attribute which they are
supposed to possess in common the attribute which has received the name
of virtue it is applied to all beings that are considered to possess this
attribute and to none which are not so considered
all concrete general names are connotative the word man for example
denotes peter jane john and an indefinite number of other individuals
of whom taken as a class it is the name but it is applied to them
because they possess and to signify that they possess certain
attributes these seem to be corporeity animal life rationality and a
certain external form which for distinction we call the human every
existing thing which possessed all these attributes would be called a
man and anything which possessed none of them or only one or two or
even three of them without the fourth would not be so called for
example if in the interior of africa there were to be discovered a race
of animals possessing reason equal to that of human beings but with the
form of an elephant they would not be called men swifts houyhnhms were
not so called or if such newlydiscovered beings possessed the form of
man without any vestige of reason it is probable that some other name
than that of man would be found for them how it happens that there can be
any doubt about the matter will appear hereafter the word man
therefore signifies all these attributes and all subjects which possess
these attributes but it can be predicated only of the subjects what we
call men are the subjects the individual stiles and nokes not the
qualities by which their humanity is constituted the name therefore is
said to signify the subjects directly the attributes indirectly it
denotes the subjects and implies or involves or indicates or as we
shall say henceforth connotes the attributes it is a connotative
name
connotative names have hence been also called denominative because the
subject which they denote is denominated by or receives a name from the
attribute which they connote snow and other objects receive the name
white because they possess the attribute which is called whiteness
james mary and others receive the name man because they possess the
attributes which are considered to constitute humanity the attribute or
attributes may therefore be said to denominate those objects or to give
them a common name8
it has been seen that all concrete general names are connotative even
abstract names though the names only of attributes may in some instances
be justly considered as connotative for attributes themselves may have
attributes ascribed to them and a word which denotes attributes may
connote an attribute of those attributes it is thus for example with
such a word as fault equivalent to bad or hurtful quality this
word is a name common to many attributes and connotes hurtfulness an
attribute of those various attributes when for example we say that
slowness in a horse is a fault we do not mean that the slow movement
the actual change of place of the slow horse is a thing to be avoided
but that the property or peculiarity of the horse from which it derives
that name the quality of being a slow mover is an undesirable
peculiarity
in regard to those concrete names which are not general but individual a
distinction must be made
proper names are not connotative they denote the individuals who are
called by them but they do not indicate or imply any attributes as
belonging to those individuals when we name a child by the name paul or
a dog by the name csar these names are simply marks used to enable those
individuals to be made subjects of discourse it may be said indeed that
we must have had some reason for giving them those names rather than any
others and this is true but the name once given becomes independent of
the reason a man may have been named john because that was the name of
his father a town may have been named dartmouth because it is situated
at the mouth of the dart but is no part of the signification of the word
john that the father of the person so called bore the same name nor even
of the word dartmouth to be situated at the mouth of the dart if sand
should choke up the mouth of the river or an earthquake change its
course and remove it to a distance from the town the name of the town
would not necessarily be changed that fact therefore can form no part
of the signification of the word for otherwise when the fact confessedly
ceased to be true no one would any longer think of applying the name
proper names are attached to the objects themselves and are not dependent
on the continuance of any attribute of the object
but there is another kind of names which although they are individual
names that is predicable only of one object are really connotative
for although we may give to an individual a name utterly unmeaning which
we call a proper namea word which answers the purpose of showing what
thing it is we are talking about but not of telling anything about it
yet a name peculiar to an individual is not necessarily of this
description it may be significant of some attribute or some union of
attributes which being possessed by no object but one determines the
name exclusively to that individual the sun is a name of this
description god when used by a monotheist is another these however
are scarcely examples of what we are now attempting to illustrate being
in strictness of language general and not individual names for however
they may be in fact predicable only of one object there is nothing in
the meaning of the words themselves which implies this and accordingly
when we are imagining and not affirming we may speak of many suns and
the majority of mankind have believed and still believe that there are
many gods but it is easy to produce words which are real instances of
connotative individual names it may be part of the meaning of the
connotative name itself that there exists but one individual possessing
the attribute which it connotes as for instance the only son of john
stiles the first emperor of rome or the attribute connoted may be a
connexion with some determinate event and the connexion may be of such a
kind as only one individual could have or may at least be such as only
one individual actually had and this may be implied in the form of the
expression the father of socrates is an example of the one kind since
socrates could not have had two fathers the author of the iliad the
murderer of henri quatre of the second for although it is conceivable
that more persons than one might have participated in the authorship of
the iliad or in the murder of henri quatre the employment of the article
the implies that in fact this was not the case what is here done by
the word the is done in other cases by the context thus csars
army is an individual name if it appears from the context that the army
meant is that which csar commanded in a particular battle the still more
general expressions the roman army or the christian army may be
individualized in a similar manner another case of frequent occurrence
has already been noticed it is the following the name being a
manyworded one may consist in the first place of a general name
capable therefore in itself of being affirmed of more things than one but
which is in the second place so limited by other words joined with it
that the entire expression can only be predicated of one object
consistently with the meaning of the general term this is exemplified in
such an instance as the following the present prime minister of
england prime minister of england is a general name the attributes
which it connotes may be possessed by an indefinite number of persons in
succession however not simultaneously since the meaning of the word
itself imports among other things that there can be only one such person
at a time this being the case and the application of the name being
afterwards limited by the word present to such individuals as possess
the attributes at one indivisible point of time it becomes applicable
only to one individual and as this appears from the meaning of the name
without any extrinsic proof it is strictly an individual name
from the preceding observations it will easily be collected that whenever
the names given to objects convey any information that is whenever they
have properly any meaning the meaning resides not in what they denote
but in what they connote the only names of objects which connote
nothing are proper names and these have strictly speaking no
signification
if like the robber in the arabian nights we make a mark with chalk on a
house to enable us to know it again the mark has a purpose but it has
not properly any meaning the chalk does not declare anything about the
house it does not mean this is such a persons house or this is a house
which contains booty the object of making the mark is merely distinction
i say to myself all these houses are so nearly alike that if i lose
sight of them i shall not again be able to distinguish that which i am now
looking at from any of the others i must therefore contrive to make the
appearance of this one house unlike that of the others that i may
hereafter know when i see the marknot indeed any attribute of the
housebut simply that it is the same house which i am now looking at
morgiana chalked all the other houses in a similar manner and defeated
the scheme how simply by obliterating the difference of appearance
between that house and the others the chalk was still there but it no
longer served the purpose of a distinctive mark
when we impose a proper name we perform an operation in some degree
analogous to what the robber intended in chalking the house we put a
mark not indeed upon the object itself but so to speak upon the idea
of the object a proper name is but an unmeaning mark which we connect in
our minds with the idea of the object in order that whenever the mark
meets our eyes or occurs to our thoughts we may think of that individual
object not being attached to the thing itself it does not like the
chalk enable us to distinguish the object when we see it but it enables
us to distinguish it when it is spoken of either in the records of our
own experience or in the discourse of others to know that what we find
asserted in any proposition of which it is the subject is asserted of the
individual thing with which we were previously acquainted
when we predicate of anything its proper name when we say pointing to a
man this is brown or smith or pointing to a city that it is york we do
not merely by so doing convey to the hearer any information about them
except that those are their names by enabling him to identify the
individuals we may connect them with information previously possessed by
him by saying this is york we may tell him that it contains the
minster but this is in virtue of what he has previously heard concerning
york not by anything implied in the name it is otherwise when objects
are spoken of by connotative names when we say the town is built of
marble we give the hearer what may be entirely new information and this
merely by the signification of the manyworded connotative name built of
marble such names are not signs of the mere objects invented because we
have occasion to think and speak of those objects individually but signs
which accompany an attribute a kind of livery in which the attribute
clothes all objects which are recognized as possessing it they are not
mere marks but more that is to say significant marks and the
connotation is what constitutes their significance
as a proper name is said to be the name of the one individual which it is
predicated of so as well from the importance of adhering to analogy as
for the other reasons formerly assigned a connotative name ought to be
considered a name of all the various individuals which it is predicable
of or in other words denotes and not of what it connotes but by
learning what things it is a name of we do not learn the meaning of the
name for to the same thing we may with equal propriety apply many
names not equivalent in meaning thus i call a certain man by the name
sophroniscus i call him by another name the father of socrates both
these are names of the same individual but their meaning is altogether
different they are applied to that individual for two different purposes
the one merely to distinguish him from other persons who are spoken of
the other to indicate a fact relating to him the fact that socrates was
his son i further apply to him these other expressions a man a greek
an athenian a sculptor an old man an honest man a brave man all these
are names of sophroniscus not indeed of him alone but of him and each of
an indefinite number of other human beings each of these names is applied
to sophroniscus for a different reason and by each whoever understands
its meaning is apprised of a distinct fact or number of facts concerning
him but those who knew nothing about the names except that they were
applicable to sophroniscus would be altogether ignorant of their meaning
it is even conceivable that i might know every single individual of whom a
given name could be with truth affirmed and yet could not be said to know
the meaning of the name a child knows who are its brothers and sisters
long before it has any definite conception of the nature of the facts
which are involved in the signification of those words
in some cases it is not easy to decide precisely how much a particular
word does or does not connote that is we do not exactly know the case
not having arisen what degree of difference in the object would occasion
a difference in the name thus it is clear that the word man besides
animal life and rationality connotes also a certain external form but it
would be impossible to say precisely what form that is to decide how
great a deviation from the form ordinarily found in the beings whom we are
accustomed to call men would suffice in a newlydiscovered race to make
us refuse them the name of man rationality also being a quality which
admits of degrees it has never been settled what is the lowest degree of
that quality which would entitle any creature to be considered a human
being in all such cases the meaning of the general name is so far
unsettled and vague mankind have not come to any positive agreement
about the matter when we come to treat of classification we shall have
occasion to show under what conditions this vagueness may exist without
practical inconvenience and cases will appear in which the ends of
language are better promoted by it than by complete precision in order
that in natural history for instance individuals or species of no very
marked character may be ranged with those more strongly characterized
individuals or species to which in all their properties taken together
they bear the nearest resemblance
but this partial uncertainty in the connotation of names can only be free
from mischief when guarded by strict precautions one of the chief
sources indeed of lax habits of thought is the custom of using
connotative terms without a distinctly ascertained connotation and with
no more precise notion of their meaning than can be loosely collected from
observing what objects they are used to denote it is in this manner that
we all acquire and inevitably so our first knowledge of our vernacular
language a child learns the meaning of the words man or white by
hearing them applied to a variety of individual objects and finding out
by a process of generalization and analysis of which he is but imperfectly
conscious what those different objects have in common in the case of
these two words the process is so easy as to require no assistance from
culture the objects called human beings and the objects called white
differing from all others by qualities of a peculiarly definite and
obvious character but in many other cases objects bear a general
resemblance to one another which leads to their being familiarly classed
together under a common name while without more analytic habits than the
generality of mankind possess it is not immediately apparent what are the
particular attributes upon the possession of which in common by them all
their general resemblance depends when this is the case people use the
name without any recognized connotation that is without any precise
meaning they talk and consequently think vaguely and remain contented
to attach only the same degree of significance to their own words which a
child three years old attaches to the words brother and sister the child
at least is seldom puzzled by the starting up of new individuals on whom
he is ignorant whether or not to confer the title because there is
usually an authority close at hand competent to solve all doubts but a
similar resource does not exist in the generality of cases and new
objects are continually presenting themselves to men women and children
which they are called upon to class proprio motu they accordingly do
this on no other principle than that of superficial similarity giving to
each new object the name of that familiar object the idea of which it
most readily recalls or which on a cursory inspection it seems to them
most to resemble as an unknown substance found in the ground will be
called according to its texture earth sand or a stone in this manner
names creep on from subject to subject until all traces of a common
meaning sometimes disappear and the word comes to denote a number of
things not only independently of any common attribute but which have
actually no attribute in common or none but what is shared by other
things to which the name is capriciously refused9 even scientific
writers have aided in this perversion of general language from its
purpose sometimes because like the vulgar they knew no better and
sometimes in deference to that aversion to admit new words which induces
mankind on all subjects not considered technical to attempt to make the
original small stock of names serve with but little augmentation to
express a constantly increasing number of objects and distinctions and
consequently to express them in a manner progressively more and more
imperfect
to what degree this loose mode of classing and denominating objects has
rendered the vocabulary of mental and moral philosophy unfit for the
purposes of accurate thinking is best known to whoever has most reflected
on the present condition of those branches of knowledge since however
the introduction of a new technical language as the vehicle of
speculations on subjects belonging to the domain of daily discussion is
extremely difficult to effect and would not be free from inconvenience
even if effected the problem for the philosopher and one of the most
difficult which he has to resolve is in retaining the existing
phraseology how best to alleviate its imperfections this can only be
accomplished by giving to every general concrete name which there is
frequent occasion to predicate a definite and fixed connotation in order
that it may be known what attributes when we call an object by that name
we really mean to predicate of the object and the question of most nicety
is how to give this fixed connotation to a name with the least possible
change in the objects which the name is habitually employed to denote
with the least possible disarrangement either by adding or subtraction
of the group of objects which in however imperfect a manner it serves to
circumscribe and hold together and with the least vitiation of the truth
of any propositions which are commonly received as true
this desirable purpose of giving a fixed connotation where it is wanting
is the end aimed at whenever any one attempts to give a definition of a
general name already in use every definition of a connotative name being
an attempt either merely to declare or to declare and analyse the
connotation of the name and the fact that no questions which have arisen
in the moral sciences have been subjects of keener controversy than the
definitions of almost all the leading expressions is a proof how great an
extent the evil to which we have adverted has attained
names with indeterminate connotation are not to be confounded with names
which have more than one connotation that is to say ambiguous words a
word may have several meanings but all of them fixed and recognised ones
as the word post for example or the word box the various senses of
which it would be endless to enumerate and the paucity of existing names
in comparison with the demand for them may often render it advisable and
even necessary to retain a name in this multiplicity of acceptations
distinguishing these so clearly as to prevent their being confounded with
one another such a word may be considered as two or more names
accidentally written and spoken alike10
 6 the fourth principal division of names is into positive and
negative positive as man tree good negative as notmany
nottree notgood to every positive concrete name a corresponding
negative one might be framed after giving a name to any one thing or to
any plurality of things we might create a second name which should be a
name of all things whatever except that particular thing or things these
negative names are employed whenever we have occasion to speak
collectively of all things other than some thing or class of things when
the positive name is connotative the corresponding negative name is
connotative likewise but in a peculiar way connoting not the presence
but the absence of an attribute thus notwhite denotes all things
whatever except white things and connotes the attribute of not possessing
whiteness for the nonpossession of any given attribute is also an
attribute and may receive a name as such and thus negative concrete
names may obtain negative abstract names to correspond to them
names which are positive in form are often negative in reality and others
are really positive though their form is negative the word
inconvenient for example does not express the mere absence of
convenience it expresses a positive attribute that of being the cause of
discomfort or annoyance so the word unpleasant notwithstanding its
negative form does not connote the mere absence of pleasantness but a
less degree of what is signified by the word painful which it is
hardly necessary to say is positive idle on the other hand is a word
which though positive in form expresses nothing but what would be
signified either by the phrase not working or by the phrase not
disposed to work and sober either by not drunk or by not drunken
there is a class of names called privative a privative name is
equivalent in its signification to a positive and a negative name taken
together being the name of something which has once had a particular
attribute or for some other reason might have been expected to have it
but which has it not such is the word blind which is not equivalent to
not seeing or to not capable of seeing for it would not except by a
poetical or rhetorical figure be applied to stocks and stones a thing is
not usually said to be blind unless the class to which it is most
familiarly referred or to which it is referred on the particular
occasion be chiefly composed of things which can see as in the case of a
blind man or a blind horse or unless it is supposed for any reason that
it ought to see as in saying of a man that he rushed blindly into an
abyss or of philosophers or the clergy that the greater part of them are
blind guides the names called privative therefore connote two things
the absence of certain attributes and the presence of others from which
the presence also of the former might naturally have been expected
 7 the fifth leading division of names is into relative and
absolute or let us rather say relative and nonrelative for the
word absolute is put upon much too hard duty in metaphysics not to be
willingly spared when its services can be dispensed with it resembles the
word civil in the language of jurisprudence which stands for the
opposite of criminal the opposite of ecclesiastical the opposite of
military the opposite of political in short the opposite of any
positive word which wants a negative
relative names are such as father son ruler subject like equal
unlike unequal longer shorter cause effect their characteristic
property is that they are always given in pairs every relative name
which is predicated of an object supposes another object or objects of
which we may predicate either that same name or another relative name
which is said to be the correlative of the former thus when we call
any person a son we suppose other persons who must be called parents
when we call any event a cause we suppose another event which is an
effect when we say of any distance that it is longer we suppose another
distance which is shorter when we say of any object that it is like we
mean that it is like some other object which is also said to be like the
first in this last case both objects receive the same name the relative
term is its own correlative
it is evident that these words when concrete are like other concrete
general names connotative they denote a subject and connote an
attribute and each of them has or might have a corresponding abstract
name to denote the attribute connoted by the concrete thus the concrete
like has its abstract likeness the concretes father and son have
or might have the abstracts paternity and filiety or filiation the
concrete name connotes an attribute and the abstract name which answers
to it denotes that attribute but of what nature is the attribute wherein
consists the peculiarity in the connotation of a relative name
the attribute signified by a relative name say some is a relation and
this they give if not as a sufficient explanation at least as the only
one attainable if they are asked what then is a relation they do not
profess to be able to tell it is generally regarded as something
peculiarly recondite and mysterious i cannot however perceive in what
respect it is more so than any other attribute indeed it appears to me
to be so in a somewhat less degree i conceive rather that it is by
examining into the signification of relative names or in other words
into the nature of the attribute which they connote that a clear insight
may best be obtained into the nature of all attributes of all that is
meant by an attribute
it is obvious in fact that if we take any two correlative names
father and son for instance although the objects denoted by the
names are different they both in a certain sense connote the same
thing they cannot indeed be said to connote the same attribute to be
a father is not the same thing as to be a son but when we call one man a
father another his son what we mean to affirm is a set of facts which
are exactly the same in both cases to predicate of a that he is the
father of b and of b that he is the son of a is to assert one and the
same fact in different words the two propositions are exactly equivalent
neither of them asserts more or asserts less than the other the paternity
of a and the filiety of b are not two facts but two modes of expressing
the same fact that fact when analysed consists of a series of physical
events or phenomena in which both a and b are parties concerned and from
which they both derive names what those names really connote is this
series of events that is the meaning and the whole meaning which either
of them is intended to convey the series of events may be said to
constitute the relation the schoolmen called it the foundation of the
relation fundamentum relationis
in this manner any fact or series of facts in which two different
objects are implicated and which is therefore predicable of both of them
may be either considered as constituting an attribute of the one or an
attribute of the other according as we consider it in the former or in
the latter aspect it is connoted by the one or the other of the two
correlative names father connotes the fact regarded as constituting an
attribute of a son connotes the same fact as constituting an attribute
of b it may evidently be regarded with equal propriety in either light
and all that appears necessary to account for the existence of relative
names is that whenever there is a fact in which two individuals are
concerned an attribute grounded on that fact may be ascribed to either of
these individuals
a name therefore is said to be relative when over and above the object
which it denotes it implies in its signification the existence of another
object also deriving a denomination from the same fact which is the
ground of the first name or to express the same meaning in other words
a name is relative when being the name of one thing its signification
cannot be explained but by mentioning another or we may state it
thuswhen the name cannot be employed in discourse so as to have a
meaning unless the name of some other thing than what it is itself the
name of be either expressed or understood these definitions are all at
bottom equivalent being modes of variously expressing this one
distinctive circumstancethat every other attribute of an object might
without any contradiction be conceived still to exist if all objects
besides that one were annihilated11 but those of its attributes which
are expressed by relative names would on that supposition be swept away
 8 names have been further distinguished into univocal and
quivocal these however are not two kinds of names but two different
modes of employing names a name is univocal or applied univocally with
respect to all things of which it can be predicated in the same sense
but it is quivocal or applied quivocally as respects those things of
which it is predicated in different senses it is scarcely necessary to
give instances of a fact so familiar as the double meaning of a word in
reality as has been already observed an quivocal or ambiguous word is
not one name but two names accidentally coinciding in sound file
standing for an iron instrument and file standing for a line of
soldiers have no more title to be considered one word because written
alike than grease and greece have because they are pronounced alike
they are one sound appropriated to form two different words
an intermediate case is that of a name used analogically or
metaphorically that is a name which is predicated of two things not
univocally or exactly in the same signification but in significations
somewhat similar and which being derived one from the other one of them
may be considered the primary and the other a secondary signification as
when we speak of a brilliant light and a brilliant achievement the word
is not applied in the same sense to the light and to the achievement but
having been applied to the light in its original sense that of brightness
to the eye it is transferred to the achievement in a derivative
signification supposed to be somewhat like the primitive one the word
however is just as properly two names instead of one in this case as in
that of the most perfect ambiguity and one of the commonest forms of
fallacious reasoning arising from ambiguity is that of arguing from a
metaphorical expression as if it were literal that is as if a word when
applied metaphorically were the same name as when taken in its original
sense which will be seen more particularly in its place
chapter iii of the things denoted by names
 1 looking back now to the commencement of our inquiry let us attempt
to measure how far it has advanced logic we found is the theory of
proof but proof supposes something provable which must be a proposition
or assertion since nothing but a proposition can be an object of belief
or therefore of proof a proposition is discourse which affirms or denies
something of some other thing this is one step there must it seems be
two things concerned in every act of belief but what are these things
they can be no other than those signified by the two names which being
joined together by a copula constitute the proposition if therefore we
knew what all names signify we should know everything which is capable
either of being made a subject of affirmation or denial or of being
itself affirmed or denied of a subject we have accordingly in the
preceding chapter reviewed the various kinds of names in order to
ascertain what is signified by each of them and we have now carried this
survey far enough to be able to take an account of its results and to
exhibit an enumeration of all the kinds of things which are capable of
being made predicates or of having anything predicated of them after
which to determine the import of predication that is of propositions
can be no arduous task
the necessity of an enumeration of existences as the basis of logic did
not escape the attention of the schoolmen and of their master aristotle
the most comprehensive if not the most sagacious of the ancient
philosophers the categories or predicamentsthe former a greek word the
latter its literal translation in the latin languagewere intended by him
and his followers as an enumeration of all things capable of being named
an enumeration by the summa genera ie the most extensive classes
into which things could be distributed which therefore were so many
highest predicates one or other of which was supposed capable of being
affirmed with truth of every nameable thing whatsoever the following are
the classes into which according to this school of philosophy things in
general might be reduced
       substantia
       quantitas
       qualitas
        relatio
       actio
       passio
       ubi
       quando
       situs
       habitus
the imperfections of this classification are too obvious to require and
its merits are not sufficient to reward a minute examination it is a
mere catalogue of the distinctions rudely marked out by the language of
familiar life with little or no attempt to penetrate by philosophic
analysis to the rationale even of those common distinctions such an
analysis however superficially conducted would have shown the
enumeration to be both redundant and defective some objects are omitted
and others repeated several times under different heads it is like a
division of animals into men quadrupeds horses asses and ponies that
for instance could not be a very comprehensive view of the nature of
relation which could exclude action passivity and local situation from
that category the same observation applies to the categories quando or
position in time and ubi or position in space while the distinction
between the latter and situs is merely verbal the incongruity of erecting
into a summum genus the class which forms the tenth category is
manifest on the other hand the enumeration takes no notice of anything
besides substances and attributes in what category are we to place
sensations or any other feelings and states of mind as hope joy fear
sound smell taste pain pleasure thought judgment conception and
the like probably all these would have been placed by the aristotelian
school in the categories of actio and passio and the relation of such
of them as are active to their objects and of such of them as are
passive to their causes would rightly be so placed but the things
themselves the feelings or states of mind wrongly feelings or states
of consciousness are assuredly to be counted among realities but they
cannot be reckoned either among substances or attributes
 2 before recommencing under better auspices the attempt made with
such imperfect success by the great founder of the science of logic we
must take notice of an unfortunate ambiguity in all the concrete names
which correspond to the most general of all abstract terms the word
existence when we have occasion for a name which shall be capable of
denoting whatever exists as contradistinguished from nonentity or
nothing there is hardly a word applicable to the purpose which is not
also and even more familiarly taken in a sense in which it denotes only
substances but substances are not all that exist attributes if such
things are to be spoken of must be said to exist feelings also exist
yet when we speak of an object or of a thing we are almost always
supposed to mean a substance there seems a kind of contradiction in using
such an expression as that one thing is merely an attribute of another
thing and the announcement of a classification of things would i
believe prepare most readers for an enumeration like those in natural
history beginning with the great divisions of animal vegetable and
mineral and subdividing them into classes and orders if rejecting the
word thing we endeavour to find another of a more general import or at
least more exclusively confined to that general import a word denoting
all that exists and connoting only simple existence no word might be
presumed fitter for such a purpose than being originally the present
participle of a verb which in one of its meanings is exactly equivalent to
the verb exist and therefore suitable even by its grammatical
formation to be the concrete of the abstract existence but this word
strange as the fact may appear is still more completely spoiled for the
purpose which it seemed expressly made for than the word thing being
is by custom exactly synonymous with substance except that it is free
from a slight taint of a second ambiguity being applied impartially to
matter and to mind while substance though originally and in strictness
applicable to both is apt to suggest in preference the idea of matter
attributes are never called beings nor are feelings a being is that
which excites feelings and which possesses attributes the soul is called
a being god and angels are called beings but if we were to say
extension colour wisdom virtue are beings we should perhaps be
suspected of thinking with some of the ancients that the cardinal virtues
are animals or at the least of holding with the platonic school the
doctrine of selfexistent ideas or with the followers of epicurus that of
sensible forms which detach themselves in every direction from bodies
and by coming in contact with our organs cause our perceptions we should
be supposed in short to believe that attributes are substances
in consequence of this perversion of the word being philosophers looking
about for something to supply its place laid their hands upon the word
entity a piece of barbarous latin invented by the schoolmen to be used
as an abstract name in which class its grammatical form would seem to
place it but being seized by logicians in distress to stop a leak in
their terminology it has ever since been used as a concrete name the
kindred word essence born at the same time and of the same parents
scarcely underwent a more complete transformation when from being the
abstract of the verb to be it came to denote something sufficiently
concrete to be enclosed in a glass bottle the word entity since it
settled down into a concrete name has retained its universality of
signification somewhat less impaired than any of the names before
mentioned yet the same gradual decay to which after a certain age all
the language of psychology seems liable has been at work even here if
you call virtue an entity you are indeed somewhat less strongly
suspected of believing it to be a substance than if you called it a
being but you are by no means free from the suspicion every word which
was originally intended to connote mere existence seems after a time to
enlarge its connotation to separate existence or existence freed from
the condition of belonging to a substance which condition being precisely
what constitutes an attribute attributes are gradually shut out and
along with them feelings which in ninetynine cases out of a hundred have
no other name than that of the attribute which is grounded on them
strange that when the greatest embarrassment felt by all who have any
considerable number of thoughts to express is to find a sufficient
variety of precise words fitted to express them there should be no
practice to which even scientific thinkers are more addicted than that of
taking valuable words to express ideas which are sufficiently expressed by
other words already appropriated to them
when it is impossible to obtain good tools the next best thing is to
understand thoroughly the defects of those we have i have therefore
warned the reader of the ambiguity of the very names which for want of
better i am necessitated to employ it must now be the writers endeavour
so to employ them as in no case to leave the meaning doubtful or obscure
no one of the above terms being altogether unambiguous i shall not
confine myself to any one but shall employ on each occasion the word
which seems least likely in the particular case to lead to
misunderstanding nor do i pretend to use either these or any other words
with a rigorous adherence to one single sense to do so would often leave
us without a word to express what is signified by a known word in some one
or other of its senses unless authors had an unlimited licence to coin
new words together with what it would be more difficult to assume
unlimited power of making their readers adopt them nor would it be wise
in a writer on a subject involving so much of abstraction to deny
himself the advantage derived from even an improper use of a term when
by means of it some familiar association is called up which brings the
meaning home to the mind as it were by a flash
the difficulty both to the writer and reader of the attempt which must be
made to use vague words so as to convey a precise meaning is not wholly a
matter of regret it is not unfitting that logical treatises should afford
an example of that to facilitate which is among the most important uses
of logic philosophical language will for a long time and popular
language still longer retain so much of vagueness and ambiguity that
logic would be of little value if it did not among its other advantages
exercise the understanding in doing its work neatly and correctly with
these imperfect tools
after this preamble it is time to proceed to our enumeration we shall
commence with feelings the simplest class of nameable things the term
feeling being of course understood in its most enlarged sense
i feelings or states of consciousness
 3 a feeling and a state of consciousness are in the language of
philosophy equivalent expressions everything is a feeling of which the
mind is conscious everything which it feels or in other words which
forms a part of its own sentient existence in popular language feeling is
not always synonymous with state of consciousness being often taken more
peculiarly for those states which are conceived as belonging to the
sensitive or to the emotional phasis of our nature and sometimes with
a still narrower restriction to the emotional alone as distinguished
from what are conceived as belonging to the percipient or to the
intellectual phasis but this is an admitted departure from correctness of
language just as by a popular perversion the exact converse of this the
word mind is withdrawn from its rightful generality of signification and
restricted to the intellect the still greater perversion by which feeling
is sometimes confined not only to bodily sensations but to the sensations
of a single sense that of touch needs not be more particularly adverted
to
feeling in the proper sense of the term is a genus of which sensation
emotion and thought are subordinate species under the word thought is
here to be included whatever we are internally conscious of when we are
said to think from the consciousness we have when we think of a red
colour without having it before our eyes to the most recondite thoughts
of a philosopher or poet be it remembered however that by a thought is
to be understood what passes in the mind itself and not any object
external to the mind which the person is commonly said to be thinking of
he may be thinking of the sun or of god but the sun and god are not
thoughts his mental image however of the sun and his idea of god are
thoughts states of his mind not of the objects themselves and so also
is his belief of the existence of the sun or of god or his disbelief if
the case be so even imaginary objects which are said to exist only in
our ideas are to be distinguished from our ideas of them i may think of
a hobgoblin as i may think of the loaf which was eaten yesterday or of
the flower which will bloom tomorrow but the hobgoblin which never
existed is not the same thing with my idea of a hobgoblin any more than
the loaf which once existed is the same thing with my idea of a loaf or
the flower which does not yet exist but which will exist is the same
with my idea of a flower they are all not thoughts but objects of
thought though at the present time all the objects are alike
nonexistent
in like manner a sensation is to be carefully distinguished from the
object which causes the sensation our sensation of white from a white
object nor is it less to be distinguished from the attribute whiteness
which we ascribe to the object in consequence of its exciting the
sensation unfortunately for clearness and due discrimination in
considering these subjects our sensations seldom receive separate names
we have a name for the objects which produce in us a certain sensation
the word white we have a name for the quality in those objects to
which we ascribe the sensation the name whiteness but when we speak of
the sensation itself as we have not occasion to do this often except in
our scientific speculations language which adapts itself for the most
part only to the common uses of life has provided us with no
singleworded or immediate designation we must employ a circumlocution
and say the sensation of white or the sensation of whiteness we must
denominate the sensation either from the object or from the attribute by
which it is excited yet the sensation though it never does might very
well be conceived to exist without anything whatever to excite it we
can conceive it as arising spontaneously in the mind but if it so arose
we should have no name to denote it which would not be a misnomer in the
case of our sensations of hearing we are better provided we have the word
sound and a whole vocabulary of words to denote the various kinds of
sounds for as we are often conscious of these sensations in the absence
of any perceptible object we can more easily conceive having them in
the absence of any object whatever we need only shut our eyes and listen
to music to have a conception of an universe with nothing in it except
sounds and ourselves hearing them and what is easily conceived
separately easily obtains a separate name but in general our names of
sensations denote indiscriminately the sensation and the attribute thus
colour stands for the sensations of white red c but also for the
quality in the coloured object we talk of the colours of things as among
their properties
 4 in the case of sensations another distinction has also to be kept in
view which is often confounded and never without mischievous
consequences this is the distinction between the sensation itself and
the state of the bodily organs which precedes the sensation and which
constitutes the physical agency by which it is produced one of the
sources of confusion on this subject is the division commonly made of
feelings into bodily and mental philosophically speaking there is no
foundation at all for this distinction even sensations are states of the
sentient mind not states of the body as distinguished from it what i am
conscious of when i see the colour blue is a feeling of blue colour
which is one thing the picture on my retina or the phenomenon of
hitherto mysterious nature which takes place in my optic nerve or in my
brain is another thing of which i am not at all conscious and which
scientific investigation alone could have apprised me of these are states
of my body but the sensation of blue which is the consequence of these
states of body is not a state of body that which perceives and is
conscious is called mind when sensations are called bodily feelings it
is only as being the class of feelings which are immediately occasioned by
bodily states whereas the other kinds of feelings thoughts for
instance or emotions are immediately excited not by anything acting upon
the bodily organs but by sensations or by previous thoughts this
however is a distinction not in our feelings but in the agency which
produces our feelings all of them when actually produced are states of
mind
besides the affection of our bodily organs from without and the sensation
thereby produced in our minds many writers admit a third link in the
chain of phenomena which they call a perception and which consists in
the recognition of an external object as the exciting cause of the
sensation this perception they say is an act of the mind proceeding
from its own spontaneous activity while in sensation the mind is passive
being merely acted upon by the outward object and according to some
metaphysicians it is by an act of the mind similar to perception except
in not being preceded by any sensation that the existence of god the
soul and other hyperphysical objects is recognised
these acts of what is termed perception whatever be the conclusion
ultimately come to respecting their nature must i conceive take their
place among the varieties of feelings or states of mind in so classing
them i have not the smallest intention of declaring or insinuating any
theory as to the law of mind in which these mental processes may be
supposed to originate or the conditions under which they may be
legitimate or the reverse far less do i mean as dr whewell seems to
suppose must be meant in an analogous case12 to indicate that as they
are merely states of mind it is superfluous to inquire into their
distinguishing peculiarities i abstain from the inquiry as irrelevant to
the science of logic in these socalled perceptions or direct
recognitions by the mind of objects whether physical or spiritual which
are external to itself i can see only cases of belief but of belief
which claims to be intuitive or independent of external evidence when a
stone lies before me i am conscious of certain sensations which i receive
from it but when i say that these sensations come to me from an external
object which i perceive the meaning of these words is that receiving
the sensations i intuitively believe that an external cause of those
sensations exists the laws of intuitive belief and the conditions under
which it is legitimate are a subject which as we have already so often
remarked belongs not to logic but to the science of the ultimate laws of
the human mind
to the same region of speculation belongs all that can be said respecting
the distinction which the german metaphysicians and their french and
english followers so elaborately draw between the acts of the mind and
its merely passive states between what it receives from and what it
gives to the crude materials of its experience i am aware that with
reference to the view which those writers take of the primary elements of
thought and knowledge this distinction is fundamental but for the
present purpose which is to examine not the original groundwork of our
knowledge but how we come by that portion of it which is not original
the difference between active and passive states of mind is of secondary
importance for us they all are states of mind they all are feelings by
which let it be said once more i mean to imply nothing of passivity but
simply that they are psychological facts facts which take place in the
mind and are to be carefully distinguished from the external or physical
facts with which they may be connected either as effects or as causes
 5 among active states of mind there is however one species which
merits particular attention because it forms a principal part of the
connotation of some important classes of names i mean volitions or
acts of the will when we speak of sentient beings by relative names a
large portion of the connotation of the name usually consists of the
actions of those beings actions past present and possible or probable
future take for instance the words sovereign and subject what meaning
do these words convey but that of innumerable actions done or to be done
by the sovereign and the subjects to or in regard to one another
reciprocally so with the words physician and patient leader and
follower tutor and pupil in many cases the words also connote actions
which would be done under certain contingencies by persons other than
those denoted as the words mortgagor and mortgagee obligor and obligee
and many other words expressive of legal relation which connote what a
court of justice would do to enforce the legal obligation if not
fulfilled there are also words which connote actions previously done by
persons other than those denoted either by the name itself or by its
correlative as the word brother from these instances it may be seen how
large a portion of the connotation of names consists of actions now what
is an action not one thing but a series of two things the state of mind
called a volition followed by an effect the volition or intention to
produce the effect is one thing the effect produced in consequence of
the intention is another thing the two together constitute the action i
form the purpose of instantly moving my arm that is a state of my mind
my arm not being tied or paralytic moves in obedience to my purpose
that is a physical fact consequent on a state of mind the intention
followed by the fact or if we prefer the expression the fact when
preceded and caused by the intention is called the action of moving my
arm
 6 of the first leading division of nameable things viz feelings or
states of consciousness we began by recognising three subdivisions
sensations thoughts and emotions the first two of these we have
illustrated at considerable length the third emotions not being
perplexed by similar ambiguities does not require similar
exemplification and finally we have found it necessary to add to these
three a fourth species commonly known by the name volitions without
seeking to prejudge the metaphysical question whether any mental state or
phenomenon can be found which is not included in one or other of these
four species it appears to me that the amount of illustration bestowed
upon these may so far as we are concerned suffice for the whole genus
we shall therefore proceed to the two remaining classes of nameable
things all things which are external to the mind being considered as
belonging either to the class of substances or to that of attributes
ii substances
logicians have endeavoured to define substance and attribute but their
definitions are not so much attempts to draw a distinction between the
things themselves as instructions what difference it is customary to make
in the grammatical structure of the sentence according as we are speaking
of substances or of attributes such definitions are rather lessons of
english or of greek latin or german than of mental philosophy an
attribute say the school logicians must be the attribute of something
colour for example must be the colour of something goodness must be
the goodness of something and if this something should cease to exist
or should cease to be connected with the attribute the existence of the
attribute would be at an end a substance on the contrary is
selfexistent in speaking about it we need not put of after its name
a stone is not the stone of anything the moon is not the moon of
anything but simply the moon unless indeed the name which we choose to
give to the substance be a relative name if so it must be followed
either by of or by some other particle implying as that preposition
does a reference to something else but then the other characteristic
peculiarity of an attribute would fail the something might be
destroyed and the substance might still subsist thus a father must be
the father of something and so far resembles an attribute in being
referred to something besides himself if there were no child there would
be no father but this when we look into the matter only means that we
should not call him father the man called father might still exist though
there were no child as he existed before there was a child and there
would be no contradiction in supposing him to exist although the whole
universe except himself were destroyed but destroy all white substances
and where would be the attribute whiteness whiteness without any white
thing is a contradiction in terms
this is the nearest approach to a solution of the difficulty that will be
found in the common treatises on logic it will scarcely be thought to be
a satisfactory one if an attribute is distinguished from a substance by
being the attribute of something it seems highly necessary to
understand what is meant by of a particle which needs explanation too
much itself to be placed in front of the explanation of anything else and
as for the selfexistence of substances it is very true that a substance
may be conceived to exist without any other substance but so also may an
attribute without any other attribute and we can no more imagine a
substance without attributes than we can imagine attributes without a
substance
metaphysicians however have probed the question deeper and given an
account of substance considerably more satisfactory than this substances
are usually distinguished as bodies or minds of each of these
philosophers have at length provided us with a definition which seems
unexceptionable
 7 a body according to the received doctrine of modern metaphysicians
may be defined the external cause to which we ascribe our sensations when
i see and touch a piece of gold i am conscious of a sensation of yellow
colour and sensations of hardness and weight and by varying the mode of
handling i may add to these sensations many others completely distinct
from them the sensations are all of which i am directly conscious but i
consider them as produced by something not only existing independently of
my will but external to my bodily organs and to my mind this external
something i call a body
it may be asked how come we to ascribe our sensations to any external
cause and is there sufficient ground for so ascribing them it is known
that there are metaphysicians who have raised a controversy on the point
maintaining that we are not warranted in referring our sensations to a
cause such as we understand by the word body or to any cause whatever
unless indeed a first cause though we have no concern here with this
controversy nor with the metaphysical niceties on which it turns one of
the best ways of showing what is meant by substance is to consider what
position it is necessary to take up in order to maintain its existence
against opponents
it is certain then that a part of our notion of a body consists of the
notion of a number of sensations of our own or of other sentient beings
habitually occurring simultaneously my conception of the table at which i
am writing is compounded of its visible form and size which are complex
sensations of sight its tangible form and size which are complex
sensations of our organs of touch and of our muscles its weight which is
also a sensation of touch and of the muscles its colour which is a
sensation of sight its hardness which is a sensation of the muscles its
composition which is another word for all the varieties of sensation
which we receive under various circumstances from the wood of which it is
made and so forth all or most of these various sensations frequently
are and as we learn by experience always might be experienced
simultaneously or in many different orders of succession at our own
choice and hence the thought of any one of them makes us think of the
others and the whole becomes mentally amalgamated into one mixed state of
consciousness which in the language of the school of locke and hartley
is termed a complex idea
now there are philosophers who have argued as follows if we take an
orange and conceive it to be divested of its natural colour without
acquiring any new one to lose its softness without becoming hard its
roundness without becoming square or pentagonal or of any other regular
or irregular figure whatever to be deprived of size of weight of taste
of smell to lose all its mechanical and all its chemical properties and
acquire no new ones to become in short invisible intangible
imperceptible not only by all our senses but by the senses of all other
sentient beings real or possible nothing say these thinkers would
remain for of what nature they ask could be the residuum and by what
token could it manifest its presence to the unreflecting its existence
seems to rest on the evidence of the senses but to the senses nothing is
apparent except the sensations we know indeed that these sensations are
bound together by some law they do not come together at random but
according to a systematic order which is part of the order established in
the universe when we experience one of these sensations we usually
experience the others also or know that we have it in our power to
experience them but a fixed law of connexion making the sensations occur
together does not say these philosophers necessarily require what is
called a substratum to support them the conception of a substratum is but
one of many possible forms in which that connexion presents itself to our
imagination a mode of as it were realizing the idea if there be such a
substratum suppose it this instant miraculously annihilated and let the
sensations continue to occur in the same order and how would the
substratum be missed by what signs should we be able to discover that its
existence had terminated should we not have as much reason to believe
that it still existed as we now have and if we should not then be
warranted in believing it how can we be so now a body therefore
according to these metaphysicians is not anything intrinsically different
from the sensations which the body is said to produce in us it is in
short a set of sensations joined together according to a fixed law
the controversies to which these speculations have given rise and the
doctrines which have been developed in the attempt to find a conclusive
answer to them have been fruitful of important consequences to the
science of mind the sensations it was answered which we are conscious
of and which we receive not at random but joined together in a certain
uniform manner imply not only a law or laws of connexion but a cause
external to our mind which cause by its own laws determines the laws
according to which the sensations are connected and experienced the
schoolmen used to call this external cause by the name we have already
employed a substratum and its attributes as they expressed
themselves inhered literally stuck in it to this substratum the
name matter is usually given in philosophical discussions it was soon
however acknowledged by all who reflected on the subject that the
existence of matter could not be proved by extrinsic evidence the answer
therefore now usually made to berkeley and his followers is that the
belief is intuitive that mankind in all ages have felt themselves
compelled by a necessity of their nature to refer their sensations to an
external cause that even those who deny it in theory yield to the
necessity in practice and both in speech thought and feeling do
equally with the vulgar acknowledge their sensations to be the effects of
something external to them this knowledge therefore it is affirmed is
as evidently intuitive as our knowledge of our sensations themselves is
intuitive and here the question merges in the fundamental problem of
metaphysics properly so called to which science we leave it
but although the extreme doctrine of the idealist metaphysicians that
objects are nothing but our sensations and the laws which connect them
has not been generally adopted by subsequent thinkers the point of most
real importance is one on which those metaphysicians are now very
generally considered to have made out their case viz that all we know
of objects is the sensations which they give us and the order of the
occurrence of those sensations kant himself on this point is as
explicit as berkeley or locke however firmly convinced that there exists
an universe of things in themselves totally distinct from the universe
of phenomena or of things as they appear to our senses and even when
bringing into use a technical expression noumenon to denote what the
thing is in itself as contrasted with the representation of it in our
minds he allows that this representation the matter of which he says
consists of our sensations though the form is given by the laws of the
mind itself is all we know of the object and that the real nature of the
thing is and by the constitution of our faculties ever must remain at
least in the present state of existence an impenetrable mystery to
us13 there is not the slightest reason for believing that what we call
the sensible qualities of the object are a type of anything inherent in
itself or bear any affinity to its own nature a cause does not as such
resemble its effects an east wind is not like the feeling of cold nor
heat like the steam of boiling water why then should matter resemble our
sensations why should the inmost nature of fire or water resemble the
impressions made by these objects upon our senses14 and if not on the
principle of resemblance on what other principle can the manner in which
objects affect us through our senses afford us any insight into the
inherent nature of those objects it may therefore safely be laid down as
a truth both obvious in itself and admitted by all whom it is at present
necessary to take into consideration that of the outward world we know
and can know absolutely nothing except the sensations which we experience
from it those however who still look upon ontology as a possible
science and think not only that bodies have an essential constitution of
their own lying deeper than our perceptions but that this essence or
nature is accessible to human investigation cannot expect to find their
refutation here the question depends on the nature and laws of intuitive
knowledge and is not within the province of logic
 8 body having now been defined the external cause and according to
the more reasonable opinion the hidden external cause to which we
refer our sensations it remains to frame a definition of mind nor after
the preceding observations will this be difficult for as our conception
of a body is that of an unknown exciting cause of sensations so our
conception of a mind is that of an unknown recipient or percipient of
them and not of them alone but of all our other feelings as body is the
mysterious something which excites the mind to feel so mind is the
mysterious something which feels and thinks it is unnecessary to give in
the case of mind as we gave in the case of matter a particular statement
of the sceptical system by which its existence as a thing in itself
distinct from the series of what are denominated its states is called in
question but it is necessary to remark that on the inmost nature of the
thinking principle as well as on the inmost nature of matter we are and
with our faculties must always remain entirely in the dark all which we
are aware of even in our own minds is in the words of mr mill a
certain thread of consciousness a series of feelings that is of
sensations thoughts emotions and volitions more or less numerous and
complicated there is a something i call myself or by another form of
expression my mind which i consider as distinct from these sensations
thoughts c a something which i conceive to be not the thoughts but
the being that has the thoughts and which i can conceive as existing for
ever in a state of quiescence without any thoughts at all but what this
being is although it is myself i have no knowledge other than the
series of its states of consciousness as bodies manifest themselves to me
only through the sensations of which i regard them as the causes so the
thinking principle or mind in my own nature makes itself known to me
only by the feelings of which it is conscious i know nothing about
myself save my capacities of feeling or being conscious including of
course thinking and willing and were i to learn anything new concerning
my own nature i cannot with my present faculties conceive this new
information to be anything else than that i have some additional
capacities as yet unknown to me of feeling thinking or willing
thus then as body is the unsentient cause to which we are naturally
prompted to refer a certain portion of our feelings so mind may be
described as the sentient subject in the german sense of the term of
all feelings that which has or feels them but of the nature of either
body or mind further than the feelings which the former excites and
which the latter experiences we do not according to the best existing
doctrine know anything and if anything logic has nothing to do with it
or with the manner in which the knowledge is acquired with this result we
may conclude this portion of our subject and pass to the third and only
remaining class or division of nameable things
iii attributes and first qualities
 9 from what has already been said of substance what is to be said of
attribute is easily deducible for if we know not and cannot know
anything of bodies but the sensations which they excite in us or others
those sensations must be all that we can at bottom mean by their
attributes and the distinction which we verbally make between the
properties of things and the sensations we receive from them must
originate in the convenience of discourse rather than in the nature of
what is denoted by the terms
attributes are usually distributed under the three heads of quality
quantity and relation we shall come to the two latter presently in the
first place we shall confine ourselves to the former
let us take then as our example one of what are termed the sensible
qualities of objects and let that example be whiteness when we ascribe
whiteness to any substance as for instance snow when we say that snow
has the quality whiteness what do we really assert simply that when
snow is present to our organs we have a particular sensation which we
are accustomed to call the sensation of white but how do i know that snow
is present obviously by the sensations which i derive from it and not
otherwise i infer that the object is present because it gives me a
certain assemblage or series of sensations and when i ascribe to it the
attribute whiteness my meaning is only that of the sensations composing
this group or series that which i call the sensation of white colour is
one
this is one view which may be taken of the subject but there is also
another and a different view it may be said that it is true we know
nothing of sensible objects except the sensations they excite in us that
the fact of our receiving from snow the particular sensation which is
called a sensation of white is the ground on which we ascribe to that
substance the quality whiteness the sole proof of its possessing that
quality but because one thing may be the sole evidence of the existence
of another thing it does not follow that the two are one and the same
the attribute whiteness it may be said is not the fact of our receiving
the sensation but something in the object itself a power inherent in
it something in virtue of which the object produces the sensation and
when we affirm that snow possesses the attribute whiteness we do not
merely assert that the presence of snow produces in us that sensation but
that it does so through and by reason of that power or quality
for the purposes of logic it is not of material importance which of these
opinions we adopt the full discussion of the subject belongs to the other
department of scientific inquiry so often alluded to under the name of
metaphysics but it may be said here that for the doctrine of the
existence of a peculiar species of entities called qualities i can see no
foundation except in a tendency of the human mind which is the cause of
many delusions i mean the disposition wherever we meet with two names
which are not precisely synonymous to suppose that they must be the names
of two different things whereas in reality they may be names of the same
thing viewed in two different lights which is as much as to say under
different suppositions as to surrounding circumstances because quality
and sensation cannot be put indiscriminately one for the other it is
supposed that they cannot both signify the same thing namely the
impression or feeling with which we are affected through our senses by the
presence of an object although there is at least no absurdity in
supposing that this identical impression or feeling may be called a
sensation when considered merely in itself and a quality when regarded as
emanating from any one of the numerous objects the presence of which to
our organs excites in our minds that among various other sensations or
feelings and if this be admissible as a supposition it rests with those
who contend for an entity per se called a quality to show that their
opinion is preferable or is anything in fact but a lingering remnant of
the scholastic doctrine of occult causes the very absurdity which molire
so happily ridiculed when he made one of his pedantic physicians account
for the fact that lopium endormit by the maxim parcequil a une vertu
soporifique
it is evident that when the physician stated that opium had une vertu
soporifique he did not account for but merely asserted over again the
fact that it endormit in like manner when we say that snow is white
because it has the quality of whiteness we are only reasserting in more
technical language the fact that it excites in us the sensation of white
if it be said that the sensation must have some cause i answer its cause
is the presence of the assemblage of phenomena which is termed the object
when we have asserted that as often as the object is present and our
organs in their normal state the sensation takes place we have stated
all that we know about the matter there is no need after assigning a
certain and intelligible cause to suppose an occult cause besides for
the purpose of enabling the real cause to produce its effect if i am
asked why does the presence of the object cause this sensation in me i
cannot tell i can only say that such is my nature and the nature of the
object that the fact forms a part of the constitution of things and to
this we must at last come even after interpolating the imaginary entity
whatever number of links the chain of causes and effects may consist of
how any one link produces the one which is next to it remains equally
inexplicable to us it is as easy to comprehend that the object should
produce the sensation directly and at once as that it should produce the
same sensation by the aid of something else called the power of
producing it
but as the difficulties which may be felt in adopting this view of the
subject cannot be removed without discussions transcending the bounds of
our science i content myself with a passing indication and shall for
the purposes of logic adopt a language compatible with either view of the
nature of qualities i shall saywhat at least admits of no disputethat
the quality of whiteness ascribed to the object snow is grounded on its
exciting in us the sensation of white and adopting the language already
used by the school logicians in the case of the kind of attributes called
relations i shall term the sensation of white the foundation of the
quality whiteness for logical purposes the sensation is the only
essential part of what is meant by the word the only part which we ever
can be concerned in proving when that is proved the quality is proved
if an object excites a sensation it has of course the power of exciting
it
iv relations
 10 the qualities of a body we have said are the attributes grounded
on the sensations which the presence of that particular body to our organs
excites in our minds but when we ascribe to any object the kind of
attribute called a relation the foundation of the attribute must be
something in which other objects are concerned besides itself and the
percipient
as there may with propriety be said to be a relation between any two
things to which two correlative names are or may be given we may expect
to discover what constitutes a relation in general if we enumerate the
principal cases in which mankind have imposed correlative names and
observe what these cases have in common
what then is the character which is possessed in common by states of
circumstances so heterogeneous and discordant as these one thing like
another one thing unlike another one thing near another one thing
far from another one thing before after along with another one
thing greater equal less than another one thing the cause of
another the effect of another one person the master servant
child parent debtor creditor sovereign subject
attorney client of another and so on
omitting for the present the case of resemblance a relation which
requires to be considered separately there seems to be one thing common
to all these cases and only one that in each of them there exists or
occurs or has existed or occurred or may be expected to exist or occur
some fact or phenomenon into which the two things which are said to be
related to each other both enter as parties concerned this fact or
phenomenon is what the aristotelian logicians called the fundamentum
relationis thus in the relation of greater and less between two
magnitudes the fundamentum relationis is the fact that one of the two
magnitudes could under certain conditions be included in without
entirely filling the space occupied by the other magnitude in the
relation of master and servant the fundamentum relationis is the fact
that the one has undertaken or is compelled to perform certain services
for the benefit and at the bidding of the other examples might be
indefinitely multiplied but it is already obvious that whenever two
things are said to be related there is some fact or series of facts
into which they both enter and that whenever any two things are involved
in some one fact or series of facts we may ascribe to those two things a
mutual relation grounded on the fact even if they have nothing in common
but what is common to all things that they are members of the universe
we call that a relation and denominate them fellowcreatures
fellowbeings or fellowdenizens of the universe but in proportion as
the fact into which the two objects enter as parts is of a more special
and peculiar or of a more complicated nature so also is the relation
grounded upon it and there are as many conceivable relations as there are
conceivable kinds of fact in which two things can be jointly concerned
in the same manner therefore as a quality is an attribute grounded on
the fact that a certain sensation or sensations are produced in us by the
object so an attribute grounded on some fact into which the object enters
jointly with another object is a relation between it and that other
object but the fact in the latter case consists of the very same kind of
elements as the fact in the former namely states of consciousness in
the case for example of any legal relation as debtor and creditor
principal and agent guardian and ward the fundamentum relationis
consists entirely of thoughts feelings and volitions actual or
contingent either of the persons themselves or of other persons
concerned in the same series of transactions as for instance the
intentions which would be formed by a judge in case a complaint were made
to his tribunal of the infringement of any of the legal obligations
imposed by the relation and the acts which the judge would perform in
consequence acts being as we have already seen another word for
intentions followed by an effect and that effect being but another word
for sensations or some other feelings occasioned either to oneself or to
somebody else there is no part of what the names expressive of the
relation imply that is not resolvable into states of consciousness
outward objects being no doubt supposed throughout as the causes by
which some of those states of consciousness are excited and minds as the
subjects by which all of them are experienced but neither the external
objects nor the minds making their existence known otherwise than by the
states of consciousness
cases of relation are not always so complicated as those to which we last
alluded the simplest of all cases of relation are those expressed by the
words antecedent and consequent and by the word simultaneous if we say
for instance that dawn preceded sunrise the fact in which the two
things dawn and sunrise were jointly concerned consisted only of the
two things themselves no third thing entered into the fact or phenomenon
at all unless indeed we choose to call the succession of the two
objects a third thing but their succession is not something added to the
things themselves it is something involved in them dawn and sunrise
announce themselves to our consciousness by two successive sensations our
consciousness of the succession of these sensations is not a third
sensation or feeling added to them we have not first the two feelings
and then a feeling of their succession to have two feelings at all
implies having them either successively or else simultaneously
sensations or other feelings being given succession and
simultaneousness are the two conditions to the alternative of which they
are subjected by the nature of our faculties and no one has been able or
needs expect to analyse the matter any farther
 11 in a somewhat similar position are two other sorts of relation
likeness and unlikeness i have two sensations we will suppose them to be
simple ones two sensations of white or one sensation of white and
another of black i call the first two sensations like the last two
unlike what is the fact or phenomenon constituting the fundamentum of
this relation the two sensations first and then what we call a feeling
of resemblance or of want of resemblance let us confine ourselves to the
former case resemblance is evidently a feeling a state of the
consciousness of the observer whether the feeling of the resemblance of
the two colours be a third state of consciousness which i have after
having the two sensations of colour or whether like the feeling of their
succession it is involved in the sensations themselves may be a matter
of discussion but in either case these feelings of resemblance and of
its opposite dissimilarity are parts of our nature and parts so far
from being capable of analysis that they are presupposed in every attempt
to analyse any of our other feelings likeness and unlikeness therefore
as well as antecedence sequence and simultaneousness must stand apart
among relations as things sui generis they are attributes grounded on
facts that is on states of consciousness but on states which are
peculiar unresolvable and inexplicable
but although likeness or unlikeness cannot be resolved into anything
else complex cases of likeness or unlikeness can be resolved into simpler
ones when we say of two things which consist of parts that they are like
one another the likeness of the wholes does admit of analysis it is
compounded of likenesses between the various parts respectively of how
vast a variety of resemblances of parts must that resemblance be composed
which induces us to say that a portrait or a landscape is like its
original if one person mimics another with any success of how many
simple likenesses must the general or complex likeness be compounded
likeness in a succession of bodily postures likeness in voice or in the
accents and intonations of the voice likeness in the choice of words and
in the thoughts or sentiments expressed whether by word countenance or
gesture
all likeness and unlikeness of which we have any cognizance resolve
themselves into likeness and unlikeness between states of our own or some
other mind when we say that one body is like another since we know
nothing of bodies but the sensations which they excite we mean really
that there is a resemblance between the sensations excited by the two
bodies or between some portion at least of these sensations if we say
that two attributes are like one another since we know nothing of
attributes except the sensations or states of feeling on which they are
grounded we mean really that those sensations or states of feeling
resemble each other we may also say that two relations are alike the
fact of resemblance between relations is sometimes called analogy
forming one of the numerous meanings of that word the relation in which
priam stood to hector namely that of father and son resembles the
relation in which philip stood to alexander resembles it so closely that
they are called the same relation the relation in which cromwell stood to
england resembles the relation in which napoleon stood to france though
not so closely as to be called the same relation the meaning in both
these instances must be that a resemblance existed between the facts
which constituted the fundamentum relationis
this resemblance may exist in all conceivable gradations from perfect
undistinguishableness to something extremely slight when we say that a
thought suggested to the mind of a person of genius is like a seed cast
into the ground because the former produces a multitude of other
thoughts and the latter a multitude of other seeds this is saying that
between the relation of an inventive mind to a thought contained in it
and the relation of a fertile soil to a seed contained in it there exists
a resemblance the real resemblance being in the two fundamenta
relationis in each of which there occurs a germ producing by its
development a multitude of other things similar to itself and as
whenever two objects are jointly concerned in a phenomenon this
constitutes a relation between those objects so if we suppose a second
pair of objects concerned in a second phenomenon the slightest
resemblance between the two phenomena is sufficient to admit of its being
said that the two relations resemble provided of course the points of
resemblance are found in those portions of the two phenomena respectively
which are connoted by the relative names
while speaking of resemblance it is necessary to take notice of an
ambiguity of language against which scarcely any one is sufficiently on
his guard resemblance when it exists in the highest degree of all
amounting to undistinguishableness is often called identity and the two
similar things are said to be the same i say often not always for we do
not say that two visible objects two persons for instance are the same
because they are so much alike that one might be mistaken for the other
but we constantly use this mode of expression when speaking of feelings
as when i say that the sight of any object gives me the same sensation
or emotion today that it did yesterday or the same which it gives to
some other person this is evidently an incorrect application of the word
same for the feeling which i had yesterday is gone never to return
what i have today is another feeling exactly like the former perhaps
but distinct from it and it is evident that two different persons cannot
be experiencing the same feeling in the sense in which we say that they
are both sitting at the same table by a similar ambiguity we say that
two persons are ill of the same disease that two persons hold the
same office not in the sense in which we say that they are engaged in
the same adventure or sailing in the same ship but in the sense that
they fill offices exactly similar though perhaps in distant places
great confusion of ideas is often produced and many fallacies engendered
in otherwise enlightened understandings by not being sufficiently alive
to the fact in itself not always to be avoided that they use the same
name to express ideas so different as those of identity and
undistinguishable resemblance among modern writers archbishop whately
stands almost alone in having drawn attention to this distinction and to
the ambiguity connected with it
several relations generally called by other names are really cases of
resemblance as for example equality which is but another word for the
exact resemblance commonly called identity considered as subsisting
between things in respect of their quantity and this example forms a
suitable transition to the third and last of the three heads under which
as already remarked attributes are commonly arranged
v quantity
 12 let us imagine two things between which there is no difference
that is no dissimilarity except in quantity alone for instance a
gallon of water and more than a gallon of water a gallon of water like
any other external object makes its presence known to us by a set of
sensations which it excites ten gallons of water are also an external
object making its presence known to us in a similar manner and as we do
not mistake ten gallons of water for a gallon of water it is plain that
the set of sensations is more or less different in the two cases in like
manner a gallon of water and a gallon of wine are two external objects
making their presence known by two sets of sensations which sensations
are different from each other in the first case however we say that the
difference is in quantity in the last there is a difference in quality
while the quantity of the water and of the wine is the same what is the
real distinction between the two cases it is not the province of logic to
analyse it nor to decide whether it is susceptible of analysis or not
for us the following considerations are sufficient it is evident that the
sensations i receive from the gallon of water and those i receive from
the gallon of wine are not the same that is not precisely alike
neither are they altogether unlike they are partly similar partly
dissimilar and that in which they resemble is precisely that in which
alone the gallon of water and the ten gallons do not resemble that in
which the gallon of water and the gallon of wine are like each other and
in which the gallon and the ten gallons of water are unlike each other is
called their quantity this likeness and unlikeness i do not pretend to
explain no more than any other kind of likeness or unlikeness but my
object is to show that when we say of two things that they differ in
quantity just as when we say that they differ in quality the assertion
is always grounded on a difference in the sensations which they excite
nobody i presume will say that to see or to lift or to drink ten
gallons of water does not include in itself a different set of sensations
from those of seeing lifting or drinking one gallon or that to see or
handle a foot rule and to see or handle a yardmeasure made exactly like
it are the same sensations i do not undertake to say what the difference
in the sensations is everybody knows and nobody can tell no more than
any one could tell what white is to a person who had never had the
sensation but the difference so far as cognizable by our faculties lies
in the sensations whatever difference we say there is in the things
themselves is in this as in all other cases grounded and grounded
exclusively on a difference in the sensations excited by them
vi attributes concluded
 13 thus then all the attributes of bodies which are classed under
quality or quantity are grounded on the sensations which we receive from
those bodies and may be defined the powers which the bodies have of
exciting those sensations and the same general explanation has been found
to apply to most of the attributes usually classed under the head of
relation they too are grounded on some fact or phenomenon into which
the related objects enter as parts that fact or phenomenon having no
meaning and no existence to us except the series of sensations or other
states of consciousness by which it makes itself known and the relation
being simply the power or capacity which the object possesses of taking
part along with the correlated object in the production of that series of
sensations or states of consciousness we have been obliged indeed to
recognise a somewhat different character in certain peculiar relations
those of succession and simultaneity of likeness and unlikeness these
not being grounded on any fact or phenomenon distinct from the related
objects themselves do not admit of the same kind of analysis but these
relations though not like other relations grounded on states of
consciousness are themselves states of consciousness resemblance is
nothing but our feeling of resemblance succession is nothing but our
feeling of succession or if this be disputed and we cannot without
transgressing the bounds of our science discuss it here at least our
knowledge of these relations and even our possibility of knowledge is
confined to those which subsist between sensations or other states of
consciousness for though we ascribe resemblance or succession or
simultaneity to objects and to attributes it is always in virtue of
resemblance or succession or simultaneity in the sensations or states of
consciousness which those objects excite and on which those attributes
are grounded
 14 in the preceding investigation we have for the sake of simplicity
considered bodies only and omitted minds but what we have said is
applicable mutatis mutandis to the latter the attributes of minds as
well as those of bodies are grounded on states of feeling or
consciousness but in the case of a mind we have to consider its own
states as well as those which it produces in other minds every attribute
of a mind consists either in being itself affected in a certain way or
affecting other minds in a certain way considered in itself we can
predicate nothing of it but the series of its own feelings when we say of
any mind that it is devout or superstitious or meditative or cheerful
we mean that the ideas emotions or volitions implied in those words
form a frequently recurring part of the series of feelings or states of
consciousness which fill up the sentient existence of that mind
in addition however to those attributes of a mind which are grounded on
its own states of feeling attributes may also be ascribed to it in the
same manner as to a body grounded on the feelings which it excites in
other minds a mind does not indeed like a body excite sensations but
it may excite thoughts or emotions the most important example of
attributes ascribed on this ground is the employment of terms expressive
of approbation or blame when for example we say of any character or
in other words of any mind that it is admirable we mean that the
contemplation of it excites the sentiment of admiration and indeed
somewhat more for the word implies that we not only feel admiration but
approve that sentiment in ourselves in some cases under the semblance of
a single attribute two are really predicated one of them a state of the
mind itself the other a state with which other minds are affected by
thinking of it as when we say of any one that he is generous the word
generosity expresses a certain state of mind but being a term of praise
it also expresses that this state of mind excites in us another mental
state called approbation the assertion made therefore is twofold and
of the following purport certain feelings form habitually a part of this
persons sentient existence and the idea of those feelings of his
excites the sentiment of approbation in ourselves or others
as we thus ascribe attributes to minds on the ground of ideas and
emotions so may we to bodies on similar grounds and not solely on the
ground of sensations as in speaking of the beauty of a statue since this
attribute is grounded on the peculiar feeling of pleasure which the statue
produces in our minds which is not a sensation but an emotion
vii general results
 15 our survey of the varieties of things which have been or which are
capable of being namedwhich have been or are capable of being either
predicated of other things or made themselves the subject of
predicationsis now concluded
our enumeration commenced with feelings these we scrupulously
distinguished from the objects which excite them and from the organs by
which they are or may be supposed to be conveyed feelings are of four
sorts sensations thoughts emotions and volitions what are called
perceptions are merely a particular case of belief and belief is a kind
of thought actions are merely volitions followed by an effect if there
be any other kind of mental state not included under these subdivisions
we did not think it necessary or proper in this place to discuss its
existence or the rank which ought to be assigned to it
after feelings we proceeded to substances these are either bodies or
minds without entering into the grounds of the metaphysical doubts which
have been raised concerning the existence of matter and mind as objective
realities we stated as sufficient for us the conclusion in which the best
thinkers are now very generally agreed that all we can know of matter is
the sensations which it gives us and the order of occurrence of those
sensations and that while the substance body is the unknown cause of our
sensations the substance mind is the unknown recipient
the only remaining class of nameable things is attributes and these are
of three kinds quality relation and quantity qualities like
substances are known to us no otherwise than by the sensations or other
states of consciousness which they excite and while in compliance with
common usage we have continued to speak of them as a distinct class of
things we showed that in predicating them no one means to predicate
anything but those sensations or states of consciousness on which they
may be said to be grounded and by which alone they can be defined or
described relations except the simple cases of likeness and unlikeness
succession and simultaneity are similarly grounded on some fact or
phenomenon that is on some series of sensations or states of
consciousness more or less complicated the third species of attribute
quantity is also manifestly grounded on something in our sensations or
states of feeling since there is an indubitable difference in the
sensations excited by a larger and a smaller bulk or by a greater or a
less degree of intensity in any object of sense or of consciousness all
attributes therefore are to us nothing but either our sensations and
other states of feeling or something inextricably involved therein and
to this even the peculiar and simple relations just adverted to are not
exceptions those peculiar relations however are so important and even
if they might in strictness be classed among states of consciousness are
so fundamentally distinct from any other of those states that it would be
a vain subtlety to confound them under that common head and it is
necessary that they should be classed apart
as the result therefore of our analysis we obtain the following as an
enumeration and classification of all nameable things
1st feelings or states of consciousness
2nd the minds which experience those feelings
3rd the bodies or external objects which excite certain of those
feelings together with the powers or properties whereby they excite them
these being included rather in compliance with common opinion and because
their existence is taken for granted in the common language from which i
cannot prudently deviate than because the recognition of such powers or
properties as real existences appears to me warranted by a sound
philosophy
4th and last the successions and coexistences the likenesses and
unlikenesses between feelings or states of consciousness those
relations when considered as subsisting between other things exist in
reality only between the states of consciousness which those things if
bodies excite if minds either excite or experience
this until a better can be suggested may serve as a substitute for the
abortive classification of existences termed the categories of aristotle
the practical application of it will appear when we commence the inquiry
into the import of propositions in other words when we inquire what it
is which the mind actually believes when it gives what is called its
assent to a proposition
these four classes comprising if the classification be correct all
nameable things these or some of them must of course compose the
signification of all names and of these or some of them is made up
whatever we call a fact
for distinctions sake every fact which is solely composed of feelings or
states of consciousness considered as such is often called a
psychological or subjective fact while every fact which is composed
either wholly or in part of something different from these that is of
substances and attributes is called an objective fact we may say then
that every objective fact is grounded on a corresponding subjective one
and has no meaning to us apart from the subjective fact which
corresponds to it except as a name for the unknown and inscrutable
process by which that subjective or psychological fact is brought to pass
chapter iv of propositions
 1 in treating of propositions as already in treating of names some
considerations of a comparatively elementary nature respecting their form
and varieties must be premised before entering upon that analysis of the
import conveyed by them which is the real subject and purpose of this
preliminary book
a proposition we have before said is a portion of discourse in which a
predicate is affirmed or denied of a subject a predicate and a subject
are all that is necessarily required to make up a proposition but as we
cannot conclude from merely seeing two names put together that they are a
predicate and a subject that is that one of them is intended to be
affirmed or denied of the other it is necessary that there should be some
mode or form of indicating that such is the intention some sign to
distinguish a predication from any other kind of discourse this is
sometimes done by a slight alteration of one of the words called an
inflection as when we say fire burns the change of the second word
from burn to burns showing that we mean to affirm the predicate burn
of the subject fire but this function is more commonly fulfilled by the
word is when an affirmation is intended is not when a negation or
by some other part of the verb to be the word which thus serves the
purpose of a sign of predication is called as we formerly observed the
copula it is important that there should be no indistinctness in our
conception of the nature and office of the copula for confused notions
respecting it are among the causes which have spread mysticism over the
field of logic and perverted its speculations into logomachies
it is apt to be supposed that the copula is something more than a mere
sign of predication that it also signifies existence in the
proposition socrates is just it may seem to be implied not only that the
quality just can be affirmed of socrates but moreover that socrates
is that is to say exists this however only shows that there is an
ambiguity in the word is a word which not only performs the function of
the copula in affirmations but has also a meaning of its own in virtue
of which it may itself be made the predicate of a proposition that the
employment of it as a copula does not necessarily include the affirmation
of existence appears from such a proposition as this a centaur is a
fiction of the poets where it cannot possibly be implied that a centaur
exists since the proposition itself expressly asserts that the thing has
no real existence
many volumes might be filled with the frivolous speculations concerning
the nature of being    ens entitas essentia and the like
which have arisen from overlooking this double meaning of the words to
be from supposing that when it signifies to exist and when it
signifies to be some specified thing as to be a man to be
socrates to be seen or spoken of to be a phantom even to be a
nonentity it must still at bottom answer to the same idea and that a
meaning must be found for it which shall suit all these cases the fog
which rose from this narrow spot diffused itself at an early period over
the whole surface of metaphysics yet it becomes us not to triumph over
the great intellects of plato and aristotle because we are now able to
preserve ourselves from many errors into which they perhaps inevitably
fell the fireteazer of a modern steamengine produces by his exertions
far greater effects than milo of crotona could but he is not therefore a
stronger man the greeks seldom knew any language but their own this
rendered it far more difficult for them than it is for us to acquire a
readiness in detecting ambiguities one of the advantages of having
accurately studied a plurality of languages especially of those languages
which eminent thinkers have used as the vehicle of their thoughts is the
practical lesson we learn respecting the ambiguities of words by finding
that the same word in one language corresponds on different occasions to
different words in another when not thus exercised even the strongest
understandings find it difficult to believe that things which have a
common name have not in some respect or other a common nature and often
expend much labour not only unprofitably but mischievously as was
frequently done by the two philosophers just mentioned on vain attempts
to discover in what this common nature consists but the habit once
formed intellects much inferior are capable of detecting even ambiguities
which are common to many languages and it is surprising that the one now
under consideration though it exists in the modern languages as well as
in the ancient should have been overlooked by almost all authors the
quantity of futile speculation which had been caused by a misapprehension
of the nature of the copula was hinted at by hobbes but mr mill15
was i believe the first who distinctly characterized the ambiguity and
pointed out how many errors in the received systems of philosophy it has
had to answer for it has indeed misled the moderns scarcely less than the
ancients though their mistakes because our understandings are not yet so
completely emancipated from their influence do not appear equally
irrational
we shall now briefly review the principal distinctions which exist among
propositions and the technical terms most commonly in use to express
those distinctions
 2 a proposition being a portion of discourse in which something is
affirmed or denied of something the first division of propositions is
into affirmative and negative an affirmative proposition is that in which
the predicate is affirmed of the subject as csar is dead a negative
proposition is that in which the predicate is denied of the subject as
csar is not dead the copula in this last species of proposition
consists of the words is not which are the sign of negation is being
the sign of affirmation
some logicians among whom may be mentioned hobbes state this distinction
differently they recognise only one form of copula is and attach the
negative sign to the predicate csar is dead and csar is not dead
according to these writers are propositions agreeing not in the subject
and predicate but in the subject only they do not consider dead but
not dead to be the predicate of the second proposition and they
accordingly define a negative proposition to be one in which the predicate
is a negative name the point though not of much practical moment
deserves notice as an example not unfrequent in logic where by means of
an apparent simplification but which is merely verbal matters are made
more complex than before the notion of these writers was that they could
get rid of the distinction between affirming and denying by treating
every case of denying as the affirming of a negative name but what is
meant by a negative name a name expressive of the absence of an
attribute so that when we affirm a negative name what we are really
predicating is absence and not presence we are asserting not that
anything is but that something is not to express which operation no
word seems so proper as the word denying the fundamental distinction is
between a fact and the nonexistence of that fact between seeing
something and not seeing it between csars being dead and his not being
dead and if this were a merely verbal distinction the generalization
which brings both within the same form of assertion would be a real
simplification the distinction however being real and in the facts it
is the generalization confounding the distinction that is merely verbal
and tends to obscure the subject by treating the difference between two
kinds of truth as if it were only a difference between two kinds of words
to put things together and to put them or keep them asunder will remain
different operations whatever tricks we may play with language
a remark of a similar nature may be applied to most of those distinctions
among propositions which are said to have reference to their modality
as difference of tense or time the sun did rise the sun is rising
the sun will rise these differences like that between affirmation and
negation might be glossed over by considering the incident of time as a
mere modification of the predicate thus the sun is an object having
risen the sun is an object now rising the sun is an object to rise
hereafter but the simplification would be merely verbal past present
and future do not constitute so many different kinds of rising they are
the designations belonging to the event asserted to the suns rising
today they affect not the predicate but the applicability of the
predicate to the particular subject that which we affirm to be past
present or future is not what the subject signifies nor what the
predicate signifies but specifically and expressly what the predication
signifies what is expressed only by the proposition as such and not by
either or both of the terms therefore the circumstance of time is
properly considered as attaching to the copula which is the sign of
predication and not to the predicate if the same cannot be said of such
modifications as these csar may be dead csar is perhaps dead it
is possible that csar is dead it is only because these fall altogether
under another head being properly assertions not of anything relating to
the fact itself but of the state of our own mind in regard to it namely
our absence of disbelief of it thus csar may be dead means i am not
sure that csar is alive
 3 the next division of propositions is into simple and complex a
simple proposition is that in which one predicate is affirmed or denied of
one subject a complex proposition is that in which there is more than one
predicate or more than one subject or both
at first sight this division has the air of an absurdity a solemn
distinction of things into one and more than one as if we were to divide
horses into single horses and teams of horses and it is true that what is
called a complex proposition is often not a proposition at all but
several propositions held together by a conjunction such for example
is this csar is dead and brutus is alive or even this csar is dead
but brutus is alive there are here two distinct assertions and we
might as well call a street a complex house as these two propositions a
complex proposition it is true that the syncategorematic words and and
but have a meaning but that meaning is so far from making the two
propositions one that it adds a third proposition to them all particles
are abbreviations and generally abbreviations of propositions a kind of
shorthand whereby that which to be expressed fully would have required
a proposition or a series of propositions is suggested to the mind at
once thus the words csar is dead and brutus is alive are equivalent to
these csar is dead brutus is alive it is desired that the two
preceding propositions should be thought of together if the words were
csar is dead but brutus is alive the sense would be equivalent to the
same three propositions together with a fourth between the two preceding
propositions there exists a contrast viz either between the two facts
themselves or between the feelings with which it is desired that they
should be regarded
in the instances cited the two propositions are kept visibly distinct
each subject having its separate predicate and each predicate its
separate subject for brevity however and to avoid repetition the
propositions are often blended together as in this peter and james
preached at jerusalem and in galilee which contains four propositions
peter preached at jerusalem peter preached in galilee james preached at
jerusalem james preached in galilee
we have seen that when the two or more propositions comprised in what is
called a complex proposition are stated absolutely and not under any
condition or proviso it is not a proposition at all but a plurality of
propositions since what it expresses is not a single assertion but
several assertions which if true when joined are true also when
separated but there is a kind of proposition which though it contains a
plurality of subjects and of predicates and may be said in one sense of
the word to consist of several propositions contains but one assertion
and its truth does not at all imply that of the simple propositions which
compose it an example of this is when the simple propositions are
connected by the particle or as either a is b or c is d or by the
particle if as a is b if c is d in the former case the proposition
is called disjunctive in the latter conditional the name
hypothetical was originally common to both as has been well remarked by
archbishop whately and others the disjunctive form is resolvable into the
conditional every disjunctive proposition being equivalent to two or more
conditional ones either a is b or c is d means if a is not b c is
d and if c is not d a is b all hypothetical propositions therefore
though disjunctive in form are conditional in meaning and the words
hypothetical and conditional may be as indeed they generally are used
synonymously propositions in which the assertion is not dependent on a
condition are said in the language of logicians to be categorical
an hypothetical proposition is not like the pretended complex
propositions which we previously considered a mere aggregation of simple
propositions the simple propositions which form part of the words in
which it is couched form no part of the assertion which it conveys when
we say if the koran comes from god mahomet is the prophet of god we do
not intend to affirm either that the koran does come from god or that
mahomet is really his prophet neither of these simple propositions may be
true and yet the truth of the hypothetical proposition may be
indisputable what is asserted is not the truth of either of the
propositions but the inferribility of the one from the other what then
is the subject and what the predicate of the hypothetical proposition
the koran is not the subject of it nor is mahomet for nothing is
affirmed or denied either of the koran or of mahomet the real subject of
the predication is the entire proposition mahomet is the prophet of
god and the affirmation is that this is a legitimate inference from the
proposition the koran comes from god the subject and predicate
therefore of an hypothetical proposition are names of propositions the
subject is some one proposition the predicate is a general relative name
applicable to propositions of this forman inference from so and so a
fresh instance is here afforded of the remark that all particles are
abbreviations since if a is b c is d is found to be an abbreviation
of the following the proposition c is d is a legitimate inference from
the proposition a is b
the distinction therefore between hypothetical and categorical
propositions is not so great as it at first appears in the conditional
as well as in the categorical form one predicate is affirmed of one
subject and no more but a conditional proposition is a proposition
concerning a proposition the subject of the assertion is itself an
assertion nor is this a property peculiar to hypothetical propositions
there are other classes of assertions concerning propositions like other
things a proposition has attributes which may be predicated of it the
attribute predicated of it in an hypothetical proposition is that of
being an inference from a certain other proposition but this is only one
of many attributes that might be predicated we may say that the whole is
greater than its part is an axiom in mathematics that the holy ghost
proceeds from the father alone is a tenet of the greek church the
doctrine of the divine right of kings was renounced by parliament at the
revolution the infallibility of the pope has no countenance from
scripture in all these cases the subject of the predication is an entire
proposition that which these different predicates are affirmed of is
the proposition the whole is greater than its part the
proposition the holy ghost proceeds from the father alone the
proposition kings have a divine right the proposition the pope is
infallible
seeing then that there is much less difference between hypothetical
propositions and any others than one might be led to imagine from their
form we should be at a loss to account for the conspicuous position which
they have been selected to fill in treatises on logic if we did not
remember that what they predicate of a proposition namely its being an
inference from something else is precisely that one of its attributes
with which most of all a logician is concerned
 4 the next of the common divisions of propositions is into universal
particular indefinite and singular a distinction founded on the degree
of generality in which the name which is the subject of the proposition
is to be understood the following are examples
all men are mortal                      universal
some men are mortal                     particular
man is mortal                           indefinite
julius csar is mortal                  singular
the proposition is singular when the subject is an individual name the
individual name needs not be a proper name the founder of christianity
was crucified is as much a singular proposition as christ was
crucified
when the name which is the subject of the proposition is a general name
we may intend to affirm or deny the predicate either of all the things
that the subject denotes or only of some when the predicate is affirmed
or denied of all and each of the things denoted by the subject the
proposition is universal when of some nonassignable portion of them
only it is particular thus all men are mortal every man is mortal are
universal propositions no man is immortal is also an universal
proposition since the predicate immortal is denied of each and every
individual denoted by the term man the negative proposition being exactly
equivalent to the following every man is notimmortal but some men are
wise some men are not wise are particular propositions the predicate
wise being in the one case affirmed and in the other denied not of each
and every individual denoted by the term man but only of each and every
one of some portion of those individuals without specifying what portion
for if this were specified the proposition would be changed either into a
singular proposition or into an universal proposition with a different
subject as for instance all properly instructed men are wise there
are other forms of particular propositions as most men are
imperfectly educated it being immaterial how large a portion of the
subject the predicate is asserted of as long as it is left uncertain how
that portion is to be distinguished from the rest
when the form of the expression does not clearly show whether the general
name which is the subject of the proposition is meant to stand for all the
individuals denoted by it or only for some of them the proposition is
commonly called indefinite but this as archbishop whately observes is a
solecism of the same nature as that committed by some grammarians when in
their list of genders they enumerate the doubtful gender the speaker
must mean to assert the proposition either as an universal or as a
particular proposition though he has failed to declare which and it
often happens that though the words do not show which of the two he
intends the context or the custom of speech supplies the deficiency
thus when it is affirmed that man is mortal nobody doubts that the
assertion is intended of all human beings and the word indicative of
universality is commonly omitted only because the meaning is evident
without it in the proposition wine is good it is understood with
equal readiness though for somewhat different reasons that the assertion
is not intended to be universal but particular
when a general name stands for each and every individual which it is a
name of or in other words which it denotes it is said by logicians to
be distributed or taken distributively thus in the proposition all
men are mortal the subject man is distributed because mortality is
affirmed of each and every man the predicate mortal is not distributed
because the only mortals who are spoken of in the proposition are those
who happen to be men while the word may for aught that appears and in
fact does comprehend within it an indefinite number of objects besides
men in the proposition some men are mortal both the predicate and the
subject are undistributed in the following no men have wings both the
predicate and the subject are distributed not only is the attribute of
having wings denied of the entire class man but that class is severed and
cast out from the whole of the class winged and not merely from some part
of that class
this phraseology which is of great service in stating and demonstrating
the rules of the syllogism enables us to express very concisely the
definitions of an universal and a particular proposition an universal
proposition is that of which the subject is distributed a particular
proposition is that of which the subject is undistributed
there are many more distinctions among propositions than those we have
here stated some of them of considerable importance but for explaining
and illustrating these more suitable opportunities will occur in the
sequel
chapter v of the import of propositions
 1 an inquiry into the nature of propositions must have one of two
objects to analyse the state of mind called belief or to analyse what is
believed all language recognises a difference between a doctrine or
opinion and the act of entertaining the opinion between assent and what
is assented to
logic according to the conception here formed of it has no concern with
the nature of the act of judging or believing the consideration of that
act as a phenomenon of the mind belongs to another science
philosophers however from descartes downwards and especially from the
era of leibnitz and locke have by no means observed this distinction and
would have treated with great disrespect any attempt to analyse the import
of propositions unless founded on an analysis of the act of judgment a
proposition they would have said is but the expression in words of a
judgment the thing expressed not the mere verbal expression is the
important matter when the mind assents to a proposition it judges let
us find out what the mind does when it judges and we shall know what
propositions mean and not otherwise
conformably to these views almost all the writers on logic in the last
two centuries whether english german or french have made their theory
of propositions from one end to the other a theory of judgments they
considered a proposition or a judgment for they used the two words
indiscriminately to consist in affirming or denying one idea of
another to judge was to put two ideas together or to bring one idea
under another or to compare two ideas or to perceive the agreement or
disagreement between two ideas and the whole doctrine of propositions
together with the theory of reasoning always necessarily founded on the
theory of propositions was stated as if ideas or conceptions or
whatever other term the writer preferred as a name for mental
representations generally constituted essentially the subject matter and
substance of those operations
it is of course true that in any case of judgment as for instance when
we judge that gold is yellow a process takes place in our minds of which
some one or other of these theories is a partially correct account we
must have the idea of gold and the idea of yellow and these two ideas
must be brought together in our mind but in the first place it is
evident that this is only a part of what takes place for we may put two
ideas together without any act of belief as when we merely imagine
something such as a golden mountain or when we actually disbelieve for
in order even to disbelieve that mahomet was an apostle of god we must
put the idea of mahomet and that of an apostle of god together to
determine what it is that happens in the case of assent or dissent besides
putting two ideas together is one of the most intricate of metaphysical
problems but whatever the solution may be we may venture to assert that
it can have nothing whatever to do with the import of propositions for
this reason that propositions except where the mind itself is the
subject treated of are not assertions respecting our ideas of things but
assertions respecting the things themselves in order to believe that gold
is yellow i must indeed have the idea of gold and the idea of yellow
and something having reference to those ideas must take place in my mind
but my belief has not reference to the ideas it has reference to the
things what i believe is a fact relating to the outward thing gold and
to the impression made by that outward thing upon the human organs not a
fact relating to my conception of gold which would be a fact in my mental
history not a fact of external nature it is true that in order to
believe this fact in external nature another fact must take place in my
mind a process must be performed upon my ideas but so it must in
everything else that i do i cannot dig the ground unless i have the idea
of the ground and of a spade and of all the other things i am operating
upon and unless i put those ideas together16 but it would be a very
ridiculous description of digging the ground to say that it is putting one
idea into another digging is an operation which is performed upon the
things themselves although it cannot be performed unless i have in my
mind the ideas of them and so in like manner believing is an act which
has for its subject the facts themselves although a previous mental
conception of the facts is an indispensable condition when i say that
fire causes heat do i mean that my idea of fire causes my idea of heat
no i mean that the natural phenomenon fire causes the natural
phenomenon heat when i mean to assert anything respecting the ideas i
give them their proper name i call them ideas as when i say that a
childs idea of a battle is unlike the reality or that the ideas
entertained of the deity have a great effect on the characters of mankind
the notion that what is of primary importance to the logician in a
proposition is the relation between the two ideas corresponding to the
subject and predicate instead of the relation between the two
phenomena which they respectively express seems to me one of the most
fatal errors ever introduced into the philosophy of logic and the
principal cause why the theory of the science has made such inconsiderable
progress during the last two centuries the treatises on logic and on the
branches of mental philosophy connected with logic which have been
produced since the intrusion of this cardinal error though sometimes
written by men of extraordinary abilities and attainments almost always
tacitly imply a theory that the investigation of truth consists in
contemplating and handling our ideas or conceptions of things instead of
the things themselves a doctrine tantamount to the assertion that the
only mode of acquiring knowledge of nature is to study it at second hand
as represented in our own minds meanwhile inquiries into every kind of
natural phenomena were incessantly establishing great and fruitful truths
on the most important subjects by processes upon which these views of the
nature of judgment and reasoning threw no light and in which they
afforded no assistance whatever no wonder that those who knew by
practical experience how truths are come at should deem a science futile
which consisted chiefly of such speculations what has been done for the
advancement of logic since these doctrines came into vogue has been done
not by professed logicians but by discoverers in the other sciences in
whose methods of investigation many principles of logic not previously
thought of have successively come forth into light but who have
generally committed the error of supposing that nothing whatever was known
of the art of philosophizing by the old logicians because their modern
interpreters have written to so little purpose respecting it
we have to inquire then on the present occasion not into judgment but
judgments not into the act of believing but into the thing believed
what is the immediate object of belief in a proposition what is the
matter of fact signified by it what is it to which when i assert the
proposition i give my assent and call upon others to give theirs what
is that which is expressed by the form of discourse called a proposition
and the conformity of which to fact constitutes the truth of the
proposition
 2 one of the clearest and most consecutive thinkers whom this country
or the world has produced i mean hobbes has given the following answer
to this question in every proposition says he what is signified is the
belief of the speaker that the predicate is a name of the same thing of
which the subject is a name and if it really is so the proposition is
true thus the proposition all men are living beings he would say is
true because living being is a name of everything of which man is a
name all men are six feet high is not true because six feet high is
not a name of everything though it is of some things of which man is a
name
what is stated in this theory as the definition of a true proposition
must be allowed to be a property which all true propositions possess the
subject and predicate being both of them names of things if they were
names of quite different things the one name could not consistently with
its signification be predicated of the other if it be true that some men
are coppercoloured it must be trueand the proposition does really
assertthat among the individuals denoted by the name man there are some
who are also among those denoted by the name coppercoloured if it be
true that all oxen ruminate it must be true that all the individuals
denoted by the name ox are also among those denoted by the name
ruminating and whoever asserts that all oxen ruminate undoubtedly does
assert that this relation subsists between the two names
the assertion therefore which according to hobbes is the only one made
in any proposition really is made in every proposition and his analysis
has consequently one of the requisites for being the true one we may go a
step farther it is the only analysis that is rigorously true of all
propositions without exception what he gives as the meaning of
propositions is part of the meaning of all propositions and the whole
meaning of some this however only shows what an extremely minute
fragment of meaning it is quite possible to include within the logical
formula of a proposition it does not show that no proposition means more
to warrant us in putting together two words with a copula between them it
is really enough that the thing or things denoted by one of the names
should be capable without violation of usage of being called by the
other name also if then this be all the meaning necessarily implied in
the form of discourse called a proposition why do i object to it as the
scientific definition of what a proposition means because though the
mere collocation which makes the proposition a proposition conveys no
more than this scanty amount of meaning that same collocation combined
with other circumstances that form combined with other matter does
convey more and much more
the only propositions of which hobbes principle is a sufficient account
are that limited and unimportant class in which both the predicate and the
subject are proper names for as has already been remarked proper names
have strictly no meaning they are mere marks for individual objects and
when a proper name is predicated of another proper name all the
signification conveyed is that both the names are marks for the same
object but this is precisely what hobbes produces as a theory of
predication in general his doctrine is a full explanation of such
predications as these hyde was clarendon or tully is cicero it
exhausts the meaning of those propositions but it is a sadly inadequate
theory of any others that it should ever have been thought of as such
can be accounted for only by the fact that hobbes in common with the
other nominalists bestowed little or no attention upon the connotation
of words and sought for their meaning exclusively in what they denote
as if all names had been what none but proper names really are marks put
upon individuals and as if there were no difference between a proper and
a general name except that the first denotes only one individual and the
last a greater number
it has been seen however that the meaning of all names except proper
names and that portion of the class of abstract names which are not
connotative resides in the connotation when therefore we are analysing
the meaning of any proposition in which the predicate and the subject or
either of them are connotative names it is to the connotation of those
terms that we must exclusively look and not to what they denote or in
the language of hobbes language so far correct are names of
in asserting that the truth of a proposition depends on the conformity of
import between its terms as for instance that the proposition socrates
is wise is a true proposition because socrates and wise are names
applicable to or as he expresses it names of the same person it is
very remarkable that so powerful a thinker should not have asked himself
the question but how came they to be names of the same person surely not
because such was the intention of those who invented the words when
mankind fixed the meaning of the word wise they were not thinking of
socrates nor when his parents gave him the name socrates were they
thinking of wisdom the names happen to fit the same person because of a
certain fact which fact was not known nor in being when the names
were invented if we want to know what the fact is we shall find the clue
to it in the connotation of the names
a bird or a stone a man or a wise man means simply an object having
such and such attributes the real meaning of the word man is those
attributes and not john jane and the remainder of the individuals the
word mortal in like manner connotes a certain attribute or attributes
and when we say all men are mortal the meaning of the proposition is
that all beings which possess the one set of attributes possess also the
other if in our experience the attributes connoted by man are always
accompanied by the attribute connoted by mortal it will follow as a
consequence that the class man will be wholly included in the class
mortal and that mortal will be a name of all things of which man is
a name but why those objects are brought under the name by possessing
the attributes connoted by it but their possession of the attributes is
the real condition on which the truth of the proposition depends not
their being called by the name connotative names do not precede but
follow the attributes which they connote if one attribute happens to be
always found in conjunction with another attribute the concrete names
which answer to those attributes will of course be predicable of the same
subjects and may be said in hobbes language in the propriety of which
on this occasion i fully concur to be two names for the same things but
the possibility of a concurrent application of the two names is a mere
consequence of the conjunction between the two attributes and was in
most cases never thought of when the names were invented and their
signification fixed that the diamond is combustible was a proposition
certainly not dreamt of when the words diamond and combustible first
received their meaning and could not have been discovered by the most
ingenious and refined analysis of the signification of those words it was
found out by a very different process namely by exerting the senses and
learning from them that the attribute of combustibility existed in all
those diamonds upon which the experiment was tried the number and
character of the experiments being such that what was true of those
individuals might be concluded to be true of all substances called by the
name that is of all substances possessing the attributes which the name
connotes the assertion therefore when analysed is that wherever we
find certain attributes there will be found a certain other attribute
which is not a question of the signification of names but of laws of
nature the order existing among phenomena
 3 although hobbes theory of predication has not in the terms in which
he stated it met with a very favourable reception from subsequent
thinkers a theory virtually identical with it and not by any means so
perspicuously expressed may almost be said to have taken the rank of an
established opinion the most generally received notion of predication
decidedly is that it consists in referring something to a class ie
either placing an individual under a class or placing one class under
another class thus the proposition man is mortal asserts according to
this view of it that the class man is included in the class mortal
plato is a philosopher asserts that the individual plato is one of
those who compose the class philosopher if the proposition is negative
then instead of placing something in a class it is said to exclude
something from a class thus if the following be the proposition the
elephant is not carnivorous what is asserted according to this theory
is that the elephant is excluded from the class carnivorous or is not
numbered among the things comprising that class there is no real
difference except in language between this theory of predication and the
theory of hobbes for a class is absolutely nothing but an indefinite
number of individuals denoted by a general name the name given to them in
common is what makes them a class to refer anything to a class
therefore is to look upon it as one of the things which are to be called
by that common name to exclude it from a class is to say that the common
name is not applicable to it
how widely these views of predication have prevailed is evident from
this that they are the basis of the celebrated dictum de omni et nullo
when the syllogism is resolved by all who treat of it into an inference
that what is true of a class is true of all things whatever that belong to
the class and when this is laid down by almost all professed logicians as
the ultimate principle to which all reasoning owes its validity it is
clear that in the general estimation of logicians the propositions of
which reasonings are composed can be the expression of nothing but the
process of dividing things into classes and referring everything to its
proper class
this theory appears to me a signal example of a logical error very often
committed in logic that of   or explaining a thing by
something which presupposes it when i say that snow is white i may and
ought to be thinking of snow as a class because i am asserting a
proposition as true of all snow but i am certainly not thinking of white
objects as a class i am thinking of no white object whatever except snow
but only of that and of the sensation of white which it gives me when
indeed i have judged or assented to the propositions that snow is
white and that several other things also are white i gradually begin to
think of white objects as a class including snow and those other things
but this is a conception which followed not preceded those judgments
and therefore cannot be given as an explanation of them instead of
explaining the effect by the cause this doctrine explains the cause by
the effect and is i conceive founded on a latent misconception of the
nature of classification
there is a sort of language very generally prevalent in these discussions
which seems to suppose that classification is an arrangement and grouping
of definite and known individuals that when names were imposed mankind
took into consideration all the individual objects in the universe made
them up into parcels or lists and gave to the objects of each list a
common name repeating this operation toties quoties until they had
invented all the general names of which language consists which having
been once done if a question subsequently arises whether a certain
general name can be truly predicated of a certain particular object we
have only as it were to read the roll of the objects upon which that
name was conferred and see whether the object about which the question
arises is to be found among them the framers of language it would seem
to be supposed have predetermined all the objects that are to compose
each class and we have only to refer to the record of an antecedent
decision
so absurd a doctrine will be owned by nobody when thus nakedly stated but
if the commonly received explanations of classification and naming do not
imply this theory it requires to be shown how they admit of being
reconciled with any other
general names are not marks put upon definite objects classes are not
made by drawing a line round a given number of assignable individuals the
objects which compose any given class are perpetually fluctuating we may
frame a class without knowing the individuals or even any of the
individuals of which it will be composed we may do so while believing
that no such individuals exist if by the meaning of a general name are
to be understood the things which it is the name of no general name
except by accident has a fixed meaning at all or ever long retains the
same meaning the only mode in which any general name has a definite
meaning is by being a name of an indefinite variety of things namely of
all things known or unknown past present or future which possess
certain definite attributes when by studying not the meaning of words
but the phenomena of nature we discover that these attributes are
possessed by some object not previously known to possess them as when
chemists found that the diamond was combustible we include this new
object in the class but it did not already belong to the class we place
the individual in the class because the proposition is true the
proposition is not true because the object is placed in the class
it will appear hereafter in treating of reasoning how much the theory of
that intellectual process has been vitiated by the influence of these
erroneous notions and by the habit which they exemplify of assimilating
all the operations of the human understanding which have truth for their
object to processes of mere classification and naming unfortunately the
minds which have been entangled in this net are precisely those which have
escaped the other cardinal error commented upon in the beginning of the
present chapter since the revolution which dislodged aristotle from the
schools logicians may almost be divided into those who have looked upon
reasoning as essentially an affair of ideas and those who have looked
upon it as essentially an affair of names
although however hobbes theory of predication according to the
wellknown remark of leibnitz and the avowal of hobbes himself17
renders truth and falsity completely arbitrary with no standard but the
will of men it must not be concluded that either hobbes or any of the
other thinkers who have in the main agreed with him did in fact consider
the distinction between truth and error as less real or attached less
importance to it than other people to suppose that they did so would
argue total unacquaintance with their other speculations but this shows
how little hold their doctrine possessed over their own minds no person
at bottom ever imagined that there was nothing more in truth than
propriety of expression than using language in conformity to a previous
convention when the inquiry was brought down from generals to a
particular case it has always been acknowledged that there is a
distinction between verbal and real questions that some false
propositions are uttered from ignorance of the meaning of words but that
in others the source of the error is a misapprehension of things that a
person who has not the use of language at all may form propositions
mentally and that they may be untrue that is he may believe as matters
of fact what are not really so this last admission cannot be made in
stronger terms than it is by hobbes himself18 though he will not allow
such erroneous belief to be called falsity but only error and he has
himself laid down in other places doctrines in which the true theory of
predication is by implication contained he distinctly says that general
names are given to things on account of their attributes and that
abstract names are the names of those attributes abstract is that which
in any subject denotes the cause of the concrete name and these causes
of names are the same with the causes of our conceptions namely some
power of action or affection of the thing conceived which some call the
manner by which anything works upon our senses but by most men they are
called accidents19 it is strange that having gone so far he should
not have gone one step farther and seen that what he calls the cause of
the concrete name is in reality the meaning of it and that when we
predicate of any subject a name which is given because of an attribute
or as he calls it an accident our object is not to affirm the name
but by means of the name to affirm the attribute
 4 let the predicate be as we have said a connotative term and to
take the simplest case first let the subject be a proper name the
summit of chimborazo is white the word white connotes an attribute which
is possessed by the individual object designated by the words summit of
chimborazo which attribute consists in the physical fact of its
exciting in human beings the sensation which we call a sensation of white
it will be admitted that by asserting the proposition we wish to
communicate information of that physical fact and are not thinking of the
names except as the necessary means of making that communication the
meaning of the proposition therefore is that the individual thing
denoted by the subject has the attributes connoted by the predicate
if we now suppose the subject also to be a connotative name the meaning
expressed by the proposition has advanced a step farther in complication
let us first suppose the proposition to be universal as well as
affirmative all men are mortal in this case as in the last what the
proposition asserts or expresses a belief of is of course that the
objects denoted by the subject man possess the attributes connoted by
the predicate mortal but the characteristic of this case is that the
objects are no longer individually designated they are pointed out only
by some of their attributes they are the objects called men that is
possessing the attributes connoted by the name man and the only thing
known of them may be those attributes indeed as the proposition is
general and the objects denoted by the subject are therefore indefinite
in number most of them are not known individually at all the assertion
therefore is not as before that the attributes which the predicate
connotes are possessed by any given individual or by any number of
individuals previously known as john thomas c but that those
attributes are possessed by each and every individual possessing certain
other attributes that whatever has the attributes connoted by the
subject has also those connoted by the predicate that the latter set of
attributes constantly accompany the former set whatever has the
attributes of man has the attribute of mortality mortality constantly
accompanies the attributes of man
if it be remembered that every attribute is grounded on some fact or
phenomenon either of outward sense or of inward consciousness and that
to possess an attribute is another phrase for being the cause of or
forming part of the fact or phenomenon upon which the attribute is
grounded we may add one more step to complete the analysis the
proposition which asserts that one attribute always accompanies another
attribute really asserts thereby no other thing than this that one
phenomenon always accompanies another phenomenon insomuch that where we
find the one we have assurance of the existence of the other thus in
the proposition all men are mortal the word man connotes the attributes
which we ascribe to a certain kind of living creatures on the ground of
certain phenomena which they exhibit and which are partly physical
phenomena namely the impressions made on our senses by their bodily form
and structure and partly mental phenomena namely the sentient and
intellectual life which they have of their own all this is understood
when we utter the word man by any one to whom the meaning of the word is
known now when we say man is mortal we mean that wherever these
various physical and mental phenomena are all found there we have
assurance that the other physical and mental phenomenon called death
will not fail to take place the proposition does not affirm when for
the connotation of the word mortal goes no farther than to the
occurrence of the phenomenon at some time or other leaving the precise
time undecided
 5 we have already proceeded far enough not only to demonstrate the
error of hobbes but to ascertain the real import of by far the most
numerous class of propositions the object of belief in a proposition
when it asserts anything more than the meaning of words is generally as
in the cases which we have examined either the coexistence or the
sequence of two phenomena at the very commencement of our inquiry we
found that every act of belief implied two things we have now ascertained
what in the most frequent case these two things are namely two
phenomena in other words two states of consciousness and what it is
which the proposition affirms or denies to subsist between them namely
either succession or coexistence and this case includes innumerable
instances which no one previous to reflection would think of referring
to it take the following example a generous person is worthy of honour
who would expect to recognize here a case of coexistence between
phenomena but so it is the attribute which causes a person to be termed
generous is ascribed to him on the ground of states of his mind and
particulars of his conduct both are phenomena the former are facts of
internal consciousness the latter so far as distinct from the former
are physical facts or perceptions of the senses worthy of honour admits
of a similar analysis honour as here used means a state of approving
and admiring emotion followed on occasion by corresponding outward acts
worthy of honour connotes all this together with our approval of the
act of showing honour all these are phenomena states of internal
consciousness accompanied or followed by physical facts when we say a
generous person is worthy of honour we affirm coexistence between the two
complicated phenomena connoted by the two terms respectively we affirm
that wherever and whenever the inward feelings and outward facts implied
in the word generosity have place then and there the existence and
manifestation of an inward feeling honour would be followed in our minds
by another inward feeling approval
after the analysis in a former chapter of the import of names many
examples are not needed to illustrate the import of propositions when
there is any obscurity or difficulty it does not lie in the meaning of
the proposition but in the meaning of the names which compose it in the
very complicated connotation of many words the immense multitude and
prolonged series of facts which often constitute the phenomenon connoted
by a name but where it is seen what the phenomenon is there is seldom
any difficulty in seeing that the assertion conveyed by the proposition
is the coexistence of one such phenomenon with another or the succession
of one such phenomenon to another their conjunction in short so that
where the one is found we may calculate on finding both
this however though the most common is not the only meaning which
propositions are ever intended to convey in the first place sequences
and coexistences are not only asserted respecting phenomena we make
propositions also respecting those hidden causes of phenomena which are
named substances and attributes a substance however being to us nothing
but either that which causes or that which is conscious of phenomena
and the same being true mutatis mutandis of attributes no assertion
can be made at least with a meaning concerning these unknown and
unknowable entities except in virtue of the phenomena by which alone they
manifest themselves to our faculties when we say socrates was
cotemporary with the peloponnesian war the foundation of this assertion
as of all assertions concerning substances is an assertion concerning the
phenomena which they exhibitnamely that the series of facts by which
socrates manifested himself to mankind and the series of mental states
which constituted his sentient existence went on simultaneously with the
series of facts known by the name of the peloponnesian war still the
proposition does not assert that alone it asserts that the thing in
itself the noumenon socrates was existing and doing or experiencing
those various facts during the same time coexistence and sequence
therefore may be affirmed or denied not only between phenomena but
between noumena or between a noumenon and phenomena and both of noumena
and of phenomena we may affirm simple existence but what is a noumenon
an unknown cause in affirming therefore the existence of a noumenon we
affirm causation here therefore are two additional kinds of fact
capable of being asserted in a proposition besides the propositions which
assert sequence or coexistence there are some which assert simple
existence and others assert causation which subject to the explanations
which will follow in the third book must be considered provisionally as a
distinct and peculiar kind of assertion
 6 to these four kinds of matteroffact or assertion must be added a
fifth resemblance this was a species of attribute which we found it
impossible to analyse for which no fundamentum distinct from the
objects themselves could be assigned besides propositions which assert a
sequence or coexistence between two phenomena there are therefore also
propositions which assert resemblance between them as this colour is
like that colourthe heat of today is equal to the heat of yesterday
it is true that such an assertion might with some plausibility be brought
within the description of an affirmation of sequence by considering it as
an assertion that the simultaneous contemplation of the two colours is
followed by a specific feeling termed the feeling of resemblance but
there would be nothing gained by encumbering ourselves especially in this
place with a generalization which may be looked upon as strained logic
does not undertake to analyse mental facts into their ultimate elements
resemblance between two phenomena is more intelligible in itself than any
explanation could make it and under any classification must remain
specifically distinct from the ordinary cases of sequence and coexistence
it is sometimes said that all propositions whatever of which the
predicate is a general name do in point of fact affirm or deny
resemblance all such propositions affirm that a thing belongs to a class
but things being classed together according to their resemblance
everything is of course classed with the things which it is supposed to
resemble most and thence it may be said when we affirm that gold is a
metal or that socrates is a man the affirmation intended is that gold
resembles other metals and socrates other men more nearly than they
resemble the objects contained in any other of the classes coordinate
with these
there is some slight degree of foundation for this remark but no more
than a slight degree the arrangement of things into classes such as the
class metal or the class man is grounded indeed on a resemblance
among the things which are placed in the same class but not on a mere
general resemblance the resemblance it is grounded on consists in the
possession by all those things of certain common peculiarities and those
peculiarities it is which the terms connote and which the propositions
consequently assert not the resemblance for though when i say gold is a
metal i say by implication that if there be any other metals it must
resemble them yet if there were no other metals i might still assert the
proposition with the same meaning as at present namely that gold has the
various properties implied in the word metal just as it might be said
christians are men even if there were no men who were not christians
propositions therefore in which objects are referred to a class because
they possess the attributes constituting the class are so far from
asserting nothing but resemblance that they do not properly speaking
assert resemblance at all
but we remarked some time ago and the reasons of the remark will be more
fully entered into in a subsequent book20 that there is sometimes a
convenience in extending the boundaries of a class so as to include things
which possess in a very inferior degree if in any some of the
characteristic properties of the classprovided they resemble that class
more than any other insomuch that the general propositions which are true
of the class will be nearer to being true of those things than any other
equally general propositions as for instance there are substances
called metals which have very few of the properties by which metals are
commonly recognised and almost every great family of plants or animals
has a few anomalous genera or species on its borders which are admitted
into it by a sort of courtesy and concerning which it has been matter of
discussion to what family they properly belonged now when the classname
is predicated of any object of this description we do by so predicating
it affirm resemblance and nothing more and in order to be scrupulously
correct it ought to be said that in every case in which we predicate a
general name we affirm not absolutely that the object possesses the
properties designated by the name but that it either possesses those
properties or if it does not at any rate resembles the things which do
so more than it resembles any other things in most cases however it is
unnecessary to suppose any such alternative the latter of the two grounds
being very seldom that on which the assertion is made and when it is
there is generally some slight difference in the form of the expression
as this species or genus is considered or may be ranked as
belonging to such and such a family we should hardly say positively that
it does belong to it unless it possessed unequivocally the properties of
which the classname is scientifically significant
there is still another exceptional case in which though the predicate is
a name of a class yet in predicating it we affirm nothing but
resemblance the class being founded not on resemblance in any given
particular but on general unanalysable resemblance the classes in
question are those into which our simple sensations or other simple
feelings are divided sensations of white for instance are classed
together not because we can take them to pieces and say they are alike
in this and not alike in that but because we feel them to be alike
altogether though in different degrees when therefore i say the
colour i saw yesterday was a white colour or the sensation i feel is one
of tightness in both cases the attribute i affirm of the colour or of the
other sensation is mere resemblancesimple likeness to sensations which
i have had before and which have had those names bestowed upon them the
names of feelings like other concrete general names are connotative but
they connote a mere resemblance when predicated of any individual
feeling the information they convey is that of its likeness to the other
feelings which we have been accustomed to call by the same name thus much
may suffice in illustration of the kind of propositions in which the
matteroffact asserted or denied is simple resemblance
existence coexistence sequence causation resemblance one or other of
these is asserted or denied in every proposition without exception this
fivefold division is an exhaustive classification of mattersoffact of
all things that can be believed or tendered for belief of all questions
that can be propounded and all answers that can be returned to them
instead of coexistence and sequence we shall sometimes say for greater
particularity order in place and order in time order in place being one
of the modes of coexistence not necessary to be more particularly
analysed here while the mere fact of coexistence or simultaneousness
may be classed together with sequence under the head of order in time
 7 in the foregoing inquiry into the import of propositions we have
thought it necessary to analyse directly those alone in which the terms
of the proposition or the predicate at least are concrete terms but in
doing so we have indirectly analysed those in which the terms are
abstract the distinction between an abstract term and its corresponding
concrete does not turn upon any difference in what they are appointed to
signify for the real signification of a concrete general name is as we
have so often said its connotation and what the concrete term connotes
forms the entire meaning of the abstract name since there is nothing in
the import of an abstract name which is not in the import of the
corresponding concrete it is natural to suppose that neither can there be
anything in the import of a proposition of which the terms are abstract
but what there is in some proposition which can be framed of concrete
terms
and this presumption a closer examination will confirm an abstract name
is the name of an attribute or combination of attributes the
corresponding concrete is a name given to things because of and in order
to express their possessing that attribute or that combination of
attributes when therefore we predicate of anything a concrete name the
attribute is what we in reality predicate of it but it has now been shown
that in all propositions of which the predicate is a concrete name what
is really predicated is one of five things existence coexistence
causation sequence or resemblance an attribute therefore is
necessarily either an existence a coexistence a causation a sequence
or a resemblance when a proposition consists of a subject and predicate
which are abstract terms it consists of terms which must necessarily
signify one or other of these things when we predicate of anything an
abstract name we affirm of the thing that it is one or other of these
five things that it is a case of existence or of coexistence or of
causation or of sequence or of resemblance
it is impossible to imagine any proposition expressed in abstract terms
which cannot be transformed into a precisely equivalent proposition in
which the terms are concrete namely either the concrete names which
connote the attributes themselves or the names of the fundamenta of
those attributes the facts or phenomena on which they are grounded to
illustrate the latter case let us take this proposition of which the
subject only is an abstract namethoughtlessness is dangerous
thoughtlessness is an attribute grounded on the facts which we call
thoughtless actions and the proposition is equivalent to this
thoughtless actions are dangerous in the next example the predicate as
well as the subject are abstract names whiteness is a colour or the
colour of snow is a whiteness these attributes being grounded on
sensations the equivalent propositions in the concrete would be the
sensation of white is one of the sensations called those of colourthe
sensation of sight caused by looking at snow is one of the sensations
called sensations of white in these propositions as we have before seen
the matteroffact asserted is a resemblance in the following examples
the concrete terms are those which directly correspond to the abstract
names connoting the attribute which these denote prudence is a virtue
this may be rendered all prudent persons in so far as prudent are
virtuous courage is deserving of honour thus all courageous persons
are deserving of honour in so far as they are courageous which is
equivalent to thisall courageous persons deserve an addition to the
honour or a diminution of the disgrace which would attach to them on
other grounds
in order to throw still further light upon the import of propositions of
which the terms are abstract we will subject one of the examples given
above to a minuter analysis the proposition we shall select is the
followingprudence is a virtue let us substitute for the word virtue
an equivalent but more definite expression such as a mental quality
beneficial to society or a mental quality pleasing to god or whatever
else we adopt as the definition of virtue what the proposition asserts is
a sequence accompanied with causation namely that benefit to society
or that the approval of god is consequent on and caused by prudence
here is a sequence but between what we understand the consequent of the
sequence but we have yet to analyse the antecedent prudence is an
attribute and in connexion with it two things besides itself are to be
considered prudent persons who are the subjects of the attribute and
prudential conduct which may be called the foundation of it now is
either of these the antecedent and first is it meant that the approval
of god or benefit to society is attendant upon all prudent persons
no except in so far as they are prudent for prudent persons who are
scoundrels can seldom on the whole be beneficial to society nor
acceptable to any good being is it upon prudential conduct then that
divine approbation and benefit to mankind are supposed to be invariably
consequent neither is this the assertion meant when it is said that
prudence is a virtue except with the same reservation as before and for
the same reason namely that prudential conduct although in so far as
it is prudential it is beneficial to society may yet by reason of some
other of its qualities be productive of an injury outweighing the
benefit and deserve a displeasure exceeding the approbation which would
be due to the prudence neither the substance therefore viz the
person nor the phenomenon the conduct is an antecedent on which the
other term of the sequence is universally consequent but the proposition
prudence is a virtue is an universal proposition what is it then
upon which the proposition affirms the effects in question to be
universally consequent upon that in the person and in the conduct
which causes them to be called prudent and which is equally in them when
the action though prudent is wicked namely a correct foresight of
consequences a just estimation of their importance to the object in view
and repression of any unreflecting impulse at variance with the deliberate
purpose these which are states of the persons mind are the real
antecedent in the sequence the real cause in the causation asserted by
the proposition but these are also the real ground or foundation of the
attribute prudence since wherever these states of mind exist we may
predicate prudence even before we know whether any conduct has followed
and in this manner every assertion respecting an attribute may be
transformed into an assertion exactly equivalent respecting the fact or
phenomenon which is the ground of the attribute and no case can be
assigned where that which is predicated of the fact or phenomenon does
not belong to one or other of the five species formerly enumerated it is
either simple existence or it is some sequence coexistence causation
or resemblance
and as these five are the only things which can be affirmed so are they
the only things which can be denied no horses are webfooted denies
that the attributes of a horse ever coexist with webfeet it is scarcely
necessary to apply the same analysis to particular affirmations and
negations some birds are webfooted affirms that with the attributes
connoted by bird the phenomenon webfeet is sometimes coexistent some
birds are not webfooted asserts that there are other instances in which
this coexistence does not have place any further explanation of a thing
which if the previous exposition has been assented to is so obvious may
here be spared
chapter vi of propositions merely verbal
 1 as a preparation for the inquiry which is the proper object of logic
namely in what manner propositions are to be proved we have found it
necessary to inquire what they contain which requires or is susceptible
of proof or which is the same thing what they assert in the course of
this preliminary investigation into the import of propositions we
examined the opinion of the conceptualists that a proposition is the
expression of a relation between two ideas and the doctrine of the
nominalists that it is the expression of an agreement or disagreement
between the meanings of two names we decided that as general theories
both of these are erroneous and that although propositions may be made
both respecting names and respecting ideas neither the one nor the other
are the subjectmatter of propositions considered generally we then
examined the different kinds of propositions and found that with the
exception of those which are merely verbal they assert five different
kinds of matters of fact namely existence order in place order in
time causation and resemblance that in every proposition one of these
five is either affirmed or denied of some fact or phenomenon or of some
object the unknown source of a fact or phenomenon
in distinguishing however the different kinds of matters of fact
asserted in propositions we reserved one class of propositions which do
not relate to any matter of fact in the proper sense of the term at all
but to the meaning of names since names and their signification are
entirely arbitrary such propositions are not strictly speaking
susceptible of truth or falsity but only of conformity or disconformity
to usage or convention and all the proof they are capable of is proof of
usage proof that the words have been employed by others in the
acceptation in which the speaker or writer desires to use them these
propositions occupy however a conspicuous place in philosophy and their
nature and characteristics are of as much importance in logic as those of
any of the other classes of propositions previously adverted to
if all propositions respecting the signification of words were as simple
and unimportant as those which served us for examples when examining
hobbes theory of predication viz those of which the subject and
predicate are proper names and which assert only that those names have
or that they have not been conventionally assigned to the same
individual there would be little to attract to such propositions the
attention of philosophers but the class of merely verbal propositions
embraces not only much more than these but much more than any
propositions which at first sight present themselves as verbal
comprehending a kind of assertions which have been regarded not only as
relating to things but as having actually a more intimate relation with
them than any other propositions whatever the student in philosophy will
perceive that i allude to the distinction on which so much stress was laid
by the schoolmen and which has been retained either under the same or
under other names by most metaphysicians to the present day viz between
what were called essential and what were called accidental
propositions and between essential and accidental properties or
attributes
 2 almost all metaphysicians prior to locke as well as many since his
time have made a great mystery of essential predication and of
predicates which were said to be of the essence of the subject the
essence of a thing they said was that without which the thing could
neither be nor be conceived to be thus rationality was of the essence
of man because without rationality man could not be conceived to exist
the different attributes which made up the essence of the thing were
called its essential properties and a proposition in which any of these
were predicated of it was called an essential proposition and was
considered to go deeper into the nature of the thing and to convey more
important information respecting it than any other proposition could do
all properties not of the essence of the thing were called its
accidents were supposed to have nothing at all or nothing comparatively
to do with its inmost nature and the propositions in which any of these
were predicated of it were called accidental propositions a connexion may
be traced between this distinction which originated with the schoolmen
and the well known dogmas of substanti secund or general substances
and substantial forms doctrines which under varieties of language
pervaded alike the aristotelian and the platonic schools and of which
more of the spirit has come down to modern times than might be conjectured
from the disuse of the phraseology the false views of the nature of
classification and generalization which prevailed among the schoolmen and
of which these dogmas were the technical expression afford the only
explanation which can be given of their having misunderstood the real
nature of those essences which held so conspicuous a place in their
philosophy they said truly that man cannot be conceived without
rationality but though man cannot a being may be conceived exactly
like a man in all points except that one quality and those others which
are the conditions or consequences of it all therefore which is really
true in the assertion that man cannot be conceived without rationality is
only that if he had not rationality he would not be reputed a man there
is no impossibility in conceiving the thing nor for aught we know in
its existing the impossibility is in the conventions of language which
will not allow the thing even if it exist to be called by the name which
is reserved for rational beings rationality in short is involved in the
meaning of the word man is one of the attributes connoted by the name
the essence of man simply means the whole of the attributes connoted by
the word and any one of those attributes taken singly is an essential
property of man
the doctrines which prevented the real meaning of essences from being
understood not having assumed so settled a shape in the time of aristotle
and his immediate followers as was afterwards given to them by the
realists of the middle ages we find a nearer approach to a rational view
of the subject in the writings of the ancient aristotelians than in their
more modern followers porphyry in his isagoge approached so near to
the true conception of essences that only one step remained to be taken
but this step so easy in appearance was reserved for the nominalists of
modern times by altering any property not of the essence of the thing
you merely according to porphyry made a difference in it you made it
 but by altering any property which was of its essence you made
it another thing 21 to a modern it is obvious that between the
change which only makes a thing different and the change which makes it
another thing the only distinction is that in the one case though
changed it is still called by the same name thus pound ice in a mortar
and being still called ice it is only made  melt it and it
becomes  another thing namely water now it is really the same
thing ie the same particles of matter in both cases and you cannot
so change anything that it shall cease to be the same thing in this sense
the identity which it can be deprived of is merely that of the name when
the thing ceases to be called ice it becomes another thing its
essence what constituted it ice is gone while as long as it continues
to be so called nothing is gone except some of its accidents but these
reflections so easy to us would have been difficult to persons who
thought as most of the aristotelians did that objects were made what
they were called that ice for instance was made ice not by the
possession of certain properties to which mankind have chosen to attach
that name but by participation in the nature of a certain general
substance called ice in general which substance together with all
the properties that belonged to it inhered in every individual piece of
ice as they did not consider these universal substances to be attached to
all general names but only to some they thought that an object borrowed
only a part of its properties from an universal substance and that the
rest belonged to it individually the former they called its essence and
the latter its accidents the scholastic doctrine of essences long
survived the theory on which it rested that of the existence of real
entities corresponding to general terms and it was reserved for locke at
the end of the seventeenth century to convince philosophers that the
supposed essences of classes were merely the signification of their names
nor among the signal services which his writings rendered to philosophy
was there one more needful or more valuable22
now as the most familiar of the general names by which an object is
designated usually connotes not one only but several attributes of the
object each of which attributes separately forms also the bond of union
of some class and the meaning of some general name we may predicate of a
name which connotes a variety of attributes another name which connotes
only one of these attributes or some smaller number of them than all in
such cases the universal affirmative proposition will be true since
whatever possesses the whole of any set of attributes must possess any
part of that same set a proposition of this sort however conveys no
information to any one who previously understood the whole meaning of the
terms the propositions every man is a corporeal being every man is a
living creature every man is rational convey no knowledge to any one who
was already aware of the entire meaning of the word man for the meaning
of the word includes all this and that every man has the attributes
connoted by all these predicates is already asserted when he is called a
man now of this nature are all the propositions which have been called
essential they are in fact identical propositions
it is true that a proposition which predicates any attribute even though
it be one implied in the name is in most cases understood to involve a
tacit assertion that there exists a thing corresponding to the name and
possessing the attributes connoted by it and this implied assertion may
convey information even to those who understood the meaning of the name
but all information of this sort conveyed by all the essential
propositions of which man can be made the subject is included in the
assertion men exist and this assumption of real existence is after all
only the result of an imperfection of language it arises from the
ambiguity of the copula which in addition to its proper office of a mark
to show that an assertion is made is also as we have formerly remarked
a concrete word connoting existence the actual existence of the subject
of the proposition is therefore only apparently not really implied in
the predication if an essential one we may say a ghost is a disembodied
spirit without believing in ghosts but an accidental or nonessential
affirmation does imply the real existence of the subject because in the
case of a nonexistent subject there is nothing for the proposition to
assert such a proposition as the ghost of a murdered person haunts the
couch of the murderer can only have a meaning if understood as implying a
belief in ghosts for since the signification of the word ghost implies
nothing of the kind the speaker either means nothing or means to assert
a thing which he wishes to be believed to have really taken place
it will be hereafter seen that when any important consequences seem to
follow as in mathematics from an essential proposition or in other
words from a proposition involved in the meaning of a name what they
really flow from is the tacit assumption of the real existence of the
object so named apart from this assumption of real existence the class
of propositions in which the predicate is of the essence of the subject
that is in which the predicate connotes the whole or part of what the
subject connotes but nothing besides answer no purpose but that of
unfolding the whole or some part of the meaning of the name to those who
did not previously know it accordingly the most useful and in
strictness the only useful kind of essential propositions are
definitions which to be complete should unfold the whole of what is
involved in the meaning of the word defined that is when it is a
connotative word the whole of what it connotes in defining a name
however it is not usual to specify its entire connotation but so much
only as is sufficient to mark out the objects usually denoted by it from
all other known objects and sometimes a merely accidental property not
involved in the meaning of the name answers this purpose equally well
the various kinds of definition which these distinctions give rise to and
the purposes to which they are respectively subservient will be minutely
considered in the proper place
 3 according to the above view of essential propositions no proposition
can be reckoned such which relates to an individual by name that is in
which the subject is a proper name individuals have no essences when the
schoolmen talked of the essence of an individual they did not mean the
properties implied in its name for the names of individuals imply no
properties they regarded as of the essence of an individual whatever was
of the essence of the species in which they were accustomed to place that
individual ie of the class to which it was most familiarly referred
and to which therefore they conceived that it by nature belonged thus
because the proposition man is a rational being was an essential
proposition they affirmed the same thing of the proposition julius csar
is a rational being this followed very naturally if genera and species
were to be considered as entities distinct from but inhering in the
individuals composing them if man was a substance inhering in each
individual man the essence of man whatever that might mean was
naturally supposed to accompany it to inhere in john thompson and to
form the common essence of thompson and julius csar it might then be
fairly said that rationality being of the essence of man was of the
essence also of thompson but if man altogether be only the individual men
and a name bestowed upon them in consequence of certain common properties
what becomes of john thompsons essence
a fundamental error is seldom expelled from philosophy by a single
victory it retreats slowly defends every inch of ground and often
retains a footing in some remote fastness after it has been driven from
the open country the essences of individuals were an unmeaning figment
arising from a misapprehension of the essences of classes yet even locke
when he extirpated the parent error could not shake himself free from
that which was its fruit he distinguished two sorts of essences real and
nominal his nominal essences were the essences of classes explained
nearly as we have now explained them nor is anything wanting to render
the third book of lockes essay a nearly unexceptionable treatise on the
connotation of names except to free its language from the assumption of
what are called abstract ideas which unfortunately is involved in the
phraseology although not necessarily connected with the thoughts
contained in that immortal third book23 but besides nominal essences
he admitted real essences or essences of individual objects which he
supposed to be the causes of the sensible properties of those objects we
know not said he what these are and this acknowledgment rendered the
fiction comparatively innocuous but if we did we could from them
alone demonstrate the sensible properties of the object as the
properties of the triangle are demonstrated from the definition of the
triangle i shall have occasion to revert to this theory in treating of
demonstration and of the conditions under which one property of a thing
admits of being demonstrated from another property it is enough here to
remark that according to this definition the real essence of an object
has in the progress of physics come to be conceived as nearly
equivalent in the case of bodies to their corpuscular structure what it
is now supposed to mean in the case of any other entities i would not
take upon myself to define
 4 an essential proposition then is one which is purely verbal which
asserts of a thing under a particular name only what is asserted of it in
the fact of calling it by that name and which therefore either gives no
information or gives it respecting the name not the thing
nonessential or accidental propositions on the contrary may be called
real propositions in opposition to verbal they predicate of a thing
some fact not involved in the signification of the name by which the
proposition speaks of it some attribute not connoted by that name such
are all propositions concerning things individually designated and all
general or particular propositions in which the predicate connotes any
attribute not connoted by the subject all these if true add to our
knowledge they convey information not already involved in the names
employed when i am told that all or even that some objects which have
certain qualities or which stand in certain relations have also certain
other qualities or stand in certain other relations i learn from this
proposition a new fact a fact not included in my knowledge of the meaning
of the words nor even of the existence of things answering to the
signification of those words it is this class of propositions only which
are in themselves instructive or from which any instructive propositions
can be inferred
nothing has probably contributed more to the opinion so commonly prevalent
of the futility of the school logic than the circumstance that almost all
the examples used in the common school books to illustrate the doctrine of
predication and of the syllogism consist of essential propositions they
were usually taken either from the branches or from the main trunk of the
predicamental tree which included nothing but what was of the essence
of the species omne corpus est substantia omne animal est corpus
omnis homo est corpus omnis homo est animal omnis homo est
rationalis and so forth it is far from wonderful that the syllogistic
art should have been thought to be of no use in assisting correct
reasoning when almost the only propositions which in the hands of its
professed teachers it was employed to prove were such as every one
assented to without proof the moment he comprehended the meaning of the
words and stood exactly on a level in point of evidence with the
premisses from which they were drawn i have therefore throughout this
work avoided the employment of essential propositions as examples except
where the nature of the principle to be illustrated specifically required
them
 5 with respect to propositions which do convey informationwhich assert
something of a thing under a name that does not already presuppose what
is about to be asserted there are two different aspects in which these
or rather such of them as are general propositions may be considered we
may either look at them as portions of speculative truth or as memoranda
for practical use according as we consider propositions in one or the
other of these lights their import may be conveniently expressed in one
or in the other of two formulas
according to the formula which we have hitherto employed and which is
best adapted to express the import of the proposition as a portion of our
theoretical knowledge all men are mortal means that the attributes of
man are always accompanied by the attribute mortality no men are gods
means that the attributes of man are never accompanied by the attributes
or at least never by all the attributes signified by the word god but
when the proposition is considered as a memorandum for practical use we
shall find a different mode of expressing the same meaning better adapted
to indicate the office which the proposition performs the practical use
of a proposition is to apprise or remind us what we have to expect in
any individual case which comes within the assertion contained in the
proposition in reference to this purpose the proposition all men are
mortal means that the attributes of man are evidence of are a mark
of mortality an indication by which the presence of that attribute is
made manifest no men are gods means that the attributes of man are a
mark or evidence that some or all of the attributes supposed to belong to
a god are not there that where the former are we need not expect to find
the latter
these two forms of expression are at bottom equivalent but the one points
the attention more directly to what a proposition means the latter to the
manner in which it is to be used
now it is to be observed that reasoning the subject to which we are next
to proceed is a process into which propositions enter not as ultimate
results but as means to the establishment of other propositions we may
expect therefore that the mode of exhibiting the import of a general
proposition which shows it in its application to practical use will best
express the function which propositions perform in reasoning and
accordingly in the theory of reasoning the mode of viewing the subject
which considers a proposition as asserting that one fact or phenomenon is
a mark or evidence of another fact or phenomenon will be found almost
indispensable for the purposes of that theory the best mode of defining
the import of a proposition is not the mode which shows most clearly what
it is in itself but that which most distinctly suggests the manner in
which it may be made available for advancing from it to other
propositions
chapter vii of the nature of classification and the five predicables
 1 in examining into the nature of general propositions we have
adverted much less than is usual with logicians to the ideas of a class
and classification ideas which since the realist doctrine of general
substances went out of vogue have formed the basis of almost every
attempt at a philosophical theory of general terms and general
propositions we have considered general names as having a meaning quite
independently of their being the names of classes that circumstance is in
truth accidental it being wholly immaterial to the signification of the
name whether there are many objects or only one to which it happens to be
applicable or whether there be any at all god is as much a general term
to the christian or the jew as to the polytheist and dragon hippogriff
chimera mermaid ghost are as much so as if real objects existed
corresponding to those names every name the signification of which is
constituted by attributes is potentially a name of an indefinite number
of objects but it needs not be actually the name of any and if of any
it may be the name of only one as soon as we employ a name to connote
attributes the things be they more or fewer which happen to possess
those attributes are constituted ipso facto a class but in
predicating the name we predicate only the attributes and the fact of
belonging to a class does not in ordinary cases come into view at all
although however predication does not presuppose classification and
although the theory of names and of propositions is not cleared up but
only encumbered by intruding the idea of classification into it there is
nevertheless a close connexion between classification and the employment
of general names by every general name which we introduce we create a
class if there be any things real or imaginary to compose it that is
any things corresponding to the signification of the name classes
therefore mostly owe their existence to general language but general
language also though that is not the most common case sometimes owes
its existence to classes a general which is as much as to say a
significant name is indeed mostly introduced because we have a
signification to express by it because we need a word by means of which
to predicate the attributes which it connotes but it is also true that a
name is sometimes introduced because we have found it convenient to create
a class because we have thought it useful for the regulation of our
mental operations that a certain group of objects should be thought of
together a naturalist for purposes connected with his particular
science sees reason to distribute the animal or vegetable creation into
certain groups rather than into any others and he requires a name to
bind as it were each of his groups together it must not however be
supposed that such names when introduced differ in any respect as to
their mode of signification from other connotative names the classes
which they denote are as much as any other classes constituted by
certain common attributes and their names are significant of those
attributes and of nothing else the names of cuviers classes and orders
plantigrades digitigrades c are as much the expression of
attributes as if those names had preceded instead of growing out of his
classification of animals the only peculiarity of the case is that the
convenience of classification was here the primary motive for introducing
the names while in other cases the name is introduced as a means of
predication and the formation of a class denoted by it is only an
indirect consequence
the principles which ought to regulate classification as a logical process
subservient to the investigation of truth cannot be discussed to any
purpose until a much later stage of our inquiry but of classification as
resulting from and implied in the fact of employing general language we
cannot forbear to treat here without leaving the theory of general names
and of their employment in predication mutilated and formless
 2 this portion of the theory of general language is the subject of what
is termed the doctrine of the predicables a set of distinctions handed
down from aristotle and his follower porphyry many of which have taken a
firm root in scientific and some of them even in popular phraseology
the predicables are a fivefold division of general names not grounded as
usual on a difference in their meaning that is in the attribute which
they connote but on a difference in the kind of class which they denote
we may predicate of a thing five different varieties of classname
a genus of the thing 
a species 
a differentia 
a proprium 
an accidens 
it is to be remarked of these distinctions that they express not what
the predicate is in its own meaning but what relation it bears to the
subject of which it happens on the particular occasion to be predicated
there are not some names which are exclusively genera and others which
are exclusively species or differenti but the same name is referred to
one or another predicable according to the subject of which it is
predicated on the particular occasion animal for instance is a genus
with respect to man or john a species with respect to substance or
being rectangular is one of the differenti of a geometrical square it
is merely one of the accidentia of the table at which i am writing the
words genus species c are therefore relative terms they are names
applied to certain predicates to express the relation between them and
some given subject a relation grounded as we shall see not on what the
predicate connotes but on the class which it denotes and on the place
which in some given classification that class occupies relatively to the
particular subject
 3 of these five names two genus and species are not only used by
naturalists in a technical acceptation not precisely agreeing with their
philosophical meaning but have also acquired a popular acceptation much
more general than either in this popular sense any two classes one of
which includes the whole of the other and more may be called a genus and
a species such for instance are animal and man man and mathematician
animal is a genus man and brute are its two species or we may divide it
into a greater number of species as man horse dog c biped or
twofooted animal may also be considered a genus of which man and bird
are two species taste is a genus of which sweet taste sour taste
salt taste c are species virtue is a genus justice prudence
courage fortitude generosity c are its species
the same class which is a genus with reference to the subclasses or
species included in it may be itself a species with reference to a more
comprehensive or as it is often called a superior genus man is a
species with reference to animal but a genus with reference to the
species mathematician animal is a genus divided into two species man
and brute but animal is also a species which with another species
vegetable makes up the genus organized being biped is a genus with
reference to man and bird but a species with respect to the superior
genus animal taste is a genus divided into species but also a species
of the genus sensation virtue a genus with reference to justice
temperance c is one of the species of the genus mental quality
in this popular sense the words genus and species have passed into common
discourse and it should be observed that in ordinary parlance not the
name of the class but the class itself is said to be the genus or
species not of course the class in the sense of each individual of that
class but the individuals collectively considered as an aggregate whole
the name by which the class is designated being then called not the genus
or species but the generic or specific name and this is an admissible
form of expression nor is it of any importance which of the two modes of
speaking we adopt provided the rest of our language is consistent with
it but if we call the class itself the genus we must not talk of
predicating the genus we predicate of man the name mortal and by
predicating the name we may be said in an intelligible sense to
predicate what the name expresses the attribute mortality but in no
allowable sense of the word predication do we predicate of man the class
mortal we predicate of him the fact of belonging to the class
by the aristotelian logicians the terms genus and species were used in a
more restricted sense they did not admit every class which could be
divided into other classes to be a genus or every class which could be
included in a larger class to be a species animal was by them considered
a genus and man and brute coordinate species under that genus biped
would not have been admitted to be a genus with reference to man but a
proprium or accidens only it was requisite according to their
theory that genus and species should be of the essence of the subject
animal was of the essence of man biped was not and in every
classification they considered some one class as the lowest or infima
species man for instance was a lowest species any further divisions
into which the class might be capable of being broken down as man into
white black and red man or into priest and layman they did not admit
to be species
it has been seen however in the preceding chapter that the distinction
between the essence of a class and the attributes or properties which are
not of its essencea distinction which has given occasion to so much
abstruse speculation and to which so mysterious a character was formerly
and by many writers is still attachedamounts to nothing more than the
difference between those attributes of the class which are and those
which are not involved in the signification of the classname as applied
to individuals the word essence we found has no meaning except in
connexion with the exploded tenets of the realists and what the schoolmen
chose to call the essence of an individual was simply the essence of the
class to which that individual was most familiarly referred
is there no difference then save this merely verbal one between the
classes which the schoolmen admitted to be genera or species and those to
which they refused the title is it an error to regard some of the
differences which exist among objects as differences in kind genere
or specie and others only as differences in the accidents were the
schoolmen right or wrong in giving to some of the classes into which
things may be divided the name of kinds and considering others as
secondary divisions grounded on differences of a comparatively
superficial nature examination will show that the aristotelians did mean
something by this distinction and something important but which being
but indistinctly conceived was inadequately expressed by the phraseology
of essences and by the various other modes of speech to which they had
recourse
 4 it is a fundamental principle in logic that the power of framing
classes is unlimited as long as there is any even the smallest
difference to found a distinction upon take any attribute whatever and
if some things have it and others have not we may ground on the
attribute a division of all things into two classes and we actually do
so the moment we create a name which connotes the attribute the number
of possible classes therefore is boundless and there are as many actual
classes either of real or of imaginary things as there are of general
names positive and negative together
but if we contemplate any one of the classes so formed such as the class
animal or plant or the class sulphur or phosphorus or the class white or
red and consider in what particulars the individuals included in the
class differ from those which do not come within it we find a very
remarkable diversity in this respect between some classes and others
there are some classes the things contained in which differ from other
things only in certain particulars which may be numbered while others
differ in more than can be numbered more even than we need ever expect to
know some classes have little or nothing in common to characterise them
by except precisely what is connoted by the name white things for
example are not distinguished by any common properties except whiteness
or if they are it is only by such as are in some way dependent on or
connected with whiteness but a hundred generations have not exhausted
the common properties of animals or of plants of sulphur or of
phosphorus nor do we suppose them to be exhaustible but proceed to new
observations and experiments in the full confidence of discovering new
properties which were by no means implied in those we previously knew
while if any one were to propose for investigation the common properties
of all things which are of the same colour the same shape or the same
specific gravity the absurdity would be palpable we have no ground to
believe that any such common properties exist except such as may be shown
to be involved in the supposition itself or to be derivable from it by
some law of causation it appears therefore that the properties on
which we ground our classes sometimes exhaust all that the class has in
common or contain it all by some mode of implication but in other
instances we make a selection of a few properties from among not only a
greater number but a number inexhaustible by us and to which as we know
no bounds they may so far as we are concerned be regarded as infinite
there is no impropriety in saying that of these two classifications the
one answers to a much more radical distinction in the things themselves
than the other does and if any one even chooses to say that the one
classification is made by nature the other by us for our convenience he
will be right provided he means no more than this where a certain
apparent difference between things although perhaps in itself of little
moment answers to we know not what number of other differences pervading
not only their known properties but properties yet undiscovered it is not
optional but imperative to recognise this difference as the foundation of
a specific distinction while on the contrary differences that are
merely finite and determinate like those designated by the words white
black or red may be disregarded if the purpose for which the
classification is made does not require attention to those particular
properties the differences however are made by nature in both cases
while the recognition of those differences as grounds of classification
and of naming is equally in both cases the act of man only in the one
case the ends of language and of classification would be subverted if no
notice were taken of the difference while in the other case the
necessity of taking notice of it depends on the importance or unimportance
of the particular qualities in which the difference happens to consist
now these classes distinguished by unknown multitudes of properties and
not solely by a few determinate ones are the only classes which by the
aristotelian logicians were considered as genera or species differences
which extended only to a certain property or properties and there
terminated they considered as differences only in the accidents of
things but where any class differed from other things by an infinite
series of differences known and unknown they considered the distinction
as one of kind and spoke of it as being an essential difference
which is also one of the usual meanings of that vague expression at the
present day
conceiving the schoolmen to have been justified in drawing a broad line of
separation between these two kinds of classes and of classdistinctions i
shall not only retain the division itself but continue to express it in
their language according to that language the proximate or lowest kind
to which any individual is referrible is called its species conformably
to this sir isaac newton would be said to be of the species man there
are indeed numerous subclasses included in the class man to which newton
also belongs as for example christian and englishman and
mathematician but these though distinct classes are not in our sense
of the term distinct kinds of men a christian for example differs from
other human beings but he differs only in the attribute which the word
expresses namely belief in christianity and whatever else that implies
either as involved in the fact itself or connected with it through some
law of cause and effect we should never think of inquiring what
properties unconnected with christianity either as cause or effect are
common to all christians and peculiar to them while in regard to all men
physiologists are perpetually carrying on such an inquiry nor is the
answer ever likely to be completed man therefore we may call a species
christian or mathematician we cannot
note here that it is by no means intended to imply that there may not be
different kinds or logical species of man the various races and
temperaments the two sexes and even the various ages maybe differences
of kind within our meaning of the term i do not say that they are so
for in the progress of physiology it may almost be said to be made out
that the differences which really exist between different races sexes
c follow as consequences under laws of nature from a small number of
primary differences which can be precisely determined and which as the
phrase is account for all the rest if this be so these are not
distinctions in kind no more than christian jew mussulman and pagan a
difference which also carries many consequences along with it and in this
way classes are often mistaken for real kinds which are afterwards proved
not to be so but if it turned out that the differences were not capable
of being thus accounted for then caucasian mongolian negro c would
be really different kinds of human beings and entitled to be ranked as
species by the logician though not by the naturalist for as already
noticed the word species is used in a very different signification in
logic and in natural history by the naturalist organized beings are
never said to be of different species if it is supposed that they could
possibly have descended from the same stock that however is a sense
artificially given to the word for the technical purposes of a particular
science to the logician if a negro and a white man differ in the same
manner however less in degree as a horse and a camel do that is if
their differences are inexhaustible and not referrible to any common
cause they are different species whether they are descended from common
ancestors or not but if their differences can all be traced to climate
and habits or to some one special difference in structure they are not
in the logicians view specifically distinct
when the infima species or proximate kind to which an individual
belongs has been ascertained the properties common to that kind include
necessarily the whole of the common properties of every other real kind to
which the individual can be referrible let the individual for example
be socrates and the proximate kind man animal or living creature is
also a real kind and includes socrates but since it likewise includes
man or in other words since all men are animals the properties common
to animals form a portion of the common properties of the subclass man
and if there be any class which includes socrates without including man
that class is not a real kind let the class for example be
flatnosed that being a class which includes socrates without
including all men to determine whether it is a real kind we must ask
ourselves this question have all flatnosed animals in addition to
whatever is implied in their flat noses any common properties other than
those which are common to all animals whatever if they had if a flat
nose were a mark or index to an indefinite number of other peculiarities
not deducible from the former by any ascertainable law then out of the
class man we might cut another class flatnosed man which according to
our definition would be a kind but if we could do this man would not
be as it was assumed to be the proximate kind therefore the properties
of the proximate kind do comprehend those whether known or unknown of
all other kinds to which the individual belongs which was the point we
undertook to prove and hence every other kind which is predicable of the
individual will be to the proximate kind in the relation of a genus
according to even the popular acceptation of the terms genus and species
that is it will be a larger class including it and more
we are now able to fix the logical meaning of these terms every class
which is a real kind that is which is distinguished from all other
classes by an indeterminate multitude of properties not derivable from one
another is either a genus or a species a kind which is not divisible
into other kinds cannot be a genus because it has no species under it
but it is itself a species both with reference to the individuals below
and to the genera above species prdicabilis and species subjicibilis
but every kind which admits of division into real kinds as animal into
quadruped bird c or quadruped into various species of quadrupeds is
a genus to all below it a species to all genera in which it is itself
included and here we may close this part of the discussion and pass to
the three remaining predicables differentia proprium and accidens
 5 to begin with differentia this word is correlative with the words
genus and species and as all admit it signifies the attribute which
distinguishes a given species from every other species of the same genus
this is so far clear but we may still ask which of the distinguishing
attributes it signifies for we have seen that every kind and a species
must be a kind is distinguished from other kinds not by any one
attribute but by an indefinite number man for instance is a species of
the genus animal rational or rationality for it is of no consequence
whether we use the concrete or the abstract form is generally assigned by
logicians as the differentia and doubtless this attribute serves the
purpose of distinction but it has also been remarked of man that he is a
cooking animal the only animal that dresses its food this therefore is
another of the attributes by which the species man is distinguished from
other species of the same genus would this attribute serve equally well
for a differentia the aristotelians say no having laid it down that the
differentia must like the genus and species be of the essence of the
subject
and here we lose even that vestige of a meaning grounded in the nature of
the things themselves which may be supposed to be attached to the word
essence when it is said that genus and species must be of the essence of
the thing there can be no doubt that when the schoolmen talked of the
essences of things as opposed to their accidents they had confusedly in
view the distinction between differences of kind and the differences
which are not of kind they meant to intimate that genera and species must
be kinds their notion of the essence of a thing was a vague notion of a
something which makes it what it is ie which makes it the kind of
thing that it iswhich causes it to have all that variety of properties
which distinguish its kind but when the matter came to be looked at more
closely nobody could discover what caused the thing to have all those
properties nor even that there was anything which caused it to have them
logicians however not liking to admit this and being unable to detect
what made the thing to be what it was satisfied themselves with what made
it to be what it was called of the innumerable properties known and
unknown that are common to the class man a portion only and of course a
very small portion are connoted by its name these few however will
naturally have been thus distinguished from the rest either for their
greater obviousness or for greater supposed importance these properties
then which were connoted by the name logicians seized upon and called
them the essence of the species and not stopping there they affirmed
them in the case of the infima species to be the essence of the
individual too for it was their maxim that the species contained the
whole essence of the thing metaphysics that fertile field of delusion
propagated by language does not afford a more signal instance of such
delusion on this account it was that rationality being connoted by the
name man was allowed to be a differentia of the class but the
peculiarity of cooking their food not being connoted was relegated to
the class of accidental properties
the distinction therefore between differentia proprium and accidens
is not founded in the nature of things but in the connotation of names
and we must seek it there if we wish to find what it is
from the fact that the genus includes the species in other words
denotes more than the species or is predicable of a greater number of
individuals it follows that the species must connote more than the genus
it must connote all the attributes which the genus connotes or there
would be nothing to prevent it from denoting individuals not included in
the genus and it must connote something besides otherwise it would
include the whole genus animal denotes all the individuals denoted by
man and many more man therefore must connote all that animal connotes
otherwise there might be men who are not animals and it must connote
something more than animal connotes otherwise all animals would be men
this surplus of connotationthis which the species connotes over and above
the connotation of the genusis the differentia or specific difference
or to state the same proposition in other words the differentia is that
which must be added to the connotation of the genus to complete the
connotation of the species
the word man for instance exclusively of what it connotes in common with
animal also connotes rationality and at least some approximation to that
external form which we all know but which as we have no name for it
considered in itself we are content to call the human the differentia
or specific difference therefore of man as referred to the genus
animal is that outward form and the possession of reason the
aristotelians said the possession of reason without the outward form
but if they adhered to this they would have been obliged to call the
houyhnhms men the question never arose and they were never called upon
to decide how such a case would have affected their notion of
essentiality however this may be they were satisfied with taking such a
portion of the differentia as sufficed to distinguish the species from all
other existing things although by so doing they might not exhaust the
connotation of the name
 6 and here to prevent the notion of differentia from being restricted
within too narrow limits it is necessary to remark that a species even
as referred to the same genus will not always have the same differentia
but a different one according to the principle and purpose which preside
over the particular classification for example a naturalist surveys the
various kinds of animals and looks out for the classification of them
most in accordance with the order in which for zoological purposes he
thinks it desirable that our ideas should arrange themselves with this
view he finds it advisable that one of his fundamental divisions should be
into warmblooded and coldblooded animals or into animals which breathe
with lungs and those which breathe with gills or into carnivorous and
frugivorous or graminivorous or into those which walk on the flat part
and those which walk on the extremity of the foot a distinction on which
some of cuviers families are founded in doing this the naturalist
creates so many new classes which are by no means those to which the
individual animal is familiarly and spontaneously referred nor should we
ever think of assigning to them so prominent a position in our arrangement
of the animal kingdom unless for a preconceived purpose of scientific
convenience and to the liberty of doing this there is no limit in the
examples we have given most of the classes are real kinds since each of
the peculiarities is an index to a multitude of properties belonging to
the class which it characterizes but even if the case were otherwiseif
the other properties of those classes could all be derived by any process
known to us from the one peculiarity on which the class is foundedeven
then if those derivative properties were of primary importance for the
purposes of the naturalist he would be warranted in founding his primary
divisions on them
if however practical convenience is a sufficient warrant for making the
main demarcations in our arrangement of objects run in lines not
coinciding with any distinction of kind and so creating genera and
species in the popular sense which are not genera or species in the
rigorous sense at all  fortiori must we be warranted when our genera
and species are real genera and species in marking the distinction
between them by those of their properties which considerations of
practical convenience most strongly recommend if we cut a species out of
a given genusthe species man for instance out of the genus animalwith
an intention on our part that the peculiarity by which we are to be guided
in the application of the name man should be rationality then rationality
is the differentia of the species man suppose however that being
naturalists we for the purposes of our particular study cut out of the
genus animal the same species man but with an intention that the
distinction between man and all other species of animal should be not
rationality but the possession of four incisors in each jaw tusks
solitary and erect posture it is evident that the word man when used
by us as naturalists no longer connotes rationality but connotes the
three other properties specified for that which we have expressly in view
when we impose a name assuredly forms part of the meaning of that name
we may therefore lay it down as a maxim that wherever there is a genus
and a species marked out from that genus by an assignable differentia the
name of the species must be connotative and must connote the differentia
but the connotation may be specialnot involved in the signification of
the term as ordinarily used but given to it when employed as a term of
art or science the word man in common use connotes rationality and a
certain form but does not connote the number or character of the teeth
in the linnan system it connotes the number of incisor and canine teeth
but does not connote rationality nor any particular form the word man
has therefore two different meanings although not commonly considered
as ambiguous because it happens in both cases to denote the same
individual objects but a case is conceivable in which the ambiguity would
become evident we have only to imagine that some new kind of animal were
discovered having linnuss three characteristics of humanity but not
rational or not of the human form in ordinary parlance these animals
would not be called men but in natural history they must still be called
so by those if any there be who adhere to the linnan classification
and the question would arise whether the word should continue to be used
in two senses or the classification be given up and the technical sense
of the term be abandoned along with it
words not otherwise connotative may in the mode just adverted to acquire
a special or technical connotation thus the word whiteness as we have so
often remarked connotes nothing it merely denotes the attribute
corresponding to a certain sensation but if we are making a
classification of colours and desire to justify or even merely to point
out the particular place assigned to whiteness in our arrangement we may
define it the colour produced by the mixture of all the simple rays and
this fact though by no means implied in the meaning of the word whiteness
as ordinarily used but only known by subsequent scientific investigation
is part of its meaning in the particular essay or treatise and becomes
the differentia of the species24
the differentia therefore of a species may be defined to be that part
of the connotation of the specific name whether ordinary or special and
technical which distinguishes the species in question from all other
species of the genus to which on the particular occasion we are referring
it
 7 having disposed of genus species and differentia we shall not find
much difficulty in attaining a clear conception of the distinction between
the other two predicables as well as between them and the first three
in the aristotelian phraseology genus and differentia are of the
essence of the subject by which as we have seen is really meant that
the properties signified by the genus and those signified by the
differentia form part of the connotation of the name denoting the
species proprium and accidens on the other hand form no part of the
essence but are predicated of the species only accidentally both are
accidents in the wider sense in which the accidents of a thing are
opposed to its essence though in the doctrine of the predicables
accidens is used for one sort of accident only proprium being another
sort proprium continue the schoolmen is predicated accidentally
indeed but necessarily or as they further explain it signifies an
attribute which is not indeed part of the essence but which flows from
or is a consequence of the essence and is therefore inseparably
attached to the species eg the various properties of a triangle
which though no part of its definition must necessarily be possessed by
whatever comes under that definition accidens on the contrary has no
connexion whatever with the essence but may come and go and the species
still remain what it was before if a species could exist without its
propria it must be capable of existing without that on which its propria
are necessarily consequent and therefore without its essence without
that which constitutes it a species but an accidens whether separable or
inseparable from the species in actual experience may be supposed
separated without the necessity of supposing any other alteration or at
least without supposing any of the essential properties of the species to
be altered since with them an accidens has no connexion
a proprium therefore of the species may be defined any attribute which
belongs to all the individuals included in the species and which
although not connoted by the specific name either ordinarily if the
classification we are considering be for ordinary purposes or specially
if it be for a special purpose yet follows from some attribute which the
name either ordinarily or specially connotes
one attribute may follow from another in two ways and there are
consequently two kinds of proprium it may follow as a conclusion follows
premisses or it may follow as an effect follows a cause thus the
attribute of having the opposite sides equal which is not one of those
connoted by the word parallelogram nevertheless follows from those
connoted by it namely from having the opposite sides straight lines and
parallel and the number of sides four the attribute therefore of
having the opposite sides equal is a proprium of the class parallelogram
and a proprium of the first kind which follows from the connoted
attributes by way of demonstration the attribute of being capable of
understanding language is a proprium of the species man since without
being connoted by the word it follows from an attribute which the word
does connote viz from the attribute of rationality but this is a
proprium of the second kind which follows by way of causation how it
is that one property of a thing follows or can be inferred from another
under what conditions this is possible and what is the exact meaning of
the phrase are among the questions which will occupy us in the two
succeeding books at present it needs only be said that whether a
proprium follows by demonstration or by causation it follows
necessarily that is to say it cannot but follow consistently with
some law which we regard as a part of the constitution either of our
thinking faculty or of the universe
 8 under the remaining predicable accidens are included all attributes
of a thing which are neither involved in the signification of the name
whether ordinarily or as a term of art nor have so far as we know any
necessary connexion with attributes which are so involved they are
commonly divided into separable and inseparable accidents inseparable
accidents are those whichalthough we know of no connexion between them
and the attributes constitutive of the species and although therefore
so far as we are aware they might be absent without making the name
inapplicable and the species a different speciesare yet never in fact
known to be absent a concise mode of expressing the same meaning is that
inseparable accidents are properties which are universal to the species
but not necessary to it thus blackness is an attribute of a crow and
as far as we know a universal one but if we were to discover a race of
white birds in other respects resembling crows we should not say these
are not crows we should say these are white crows crow therefore does
not connote blackness nor from any of the attributes which it does
connote whether as a word in popular use or as a term of art could
blackness be inferred not only therefore can we conceive a white crow
but we know of no reason why such an animal should not exist since
however none but black crows are known to exist blackness in the
present state of our knowledge ranks as an accident but an inseparable
accident of the species crow
separable accidents are those which are found in point of fact to be
sometimes absent from the species which are not only not necessary but
not even universal they are such as do not belong to every individual of
the species but only to some individuals or if to all not at all times
thus the colour of an european is one of the separable accidents of the
species man because it is not an attribute of all human creatures being
born is also speaking in the logical sense a separable accident of the
species man because although an attribute of all human beings it is so
only at one particular time a fortiori those attributes which are not
constant even in the same individual as to be in one or in another
place to be hot or cold sitting or walking must be ranked as separable
accidents
chapter viii of definition
 1 one necessary part of the theory of names and of propositions remains
to be treated of in this place the theory of definitions as being the
most important of the class of propositions which we have characterized as
purely verbal they have already received some notice in the chapter
preceding the last but their fuller treatment was at that time postponed
because definition is so closely connected with classification that
until the nature of the latter process is in some measure understood the
former cannot be discussed to much purpose
the simplest and most correct notion of a definition is a proposition
declaratory of the meaning of a word namely either the meaning which it
bears in common acceptation or that which the speaker or writer for the
particular purposes of his discourse intends to annex to it
the definition of a word being the proposition which enunciates its
meaning words which have no meaning are unsusceptible of definition
proper names therefore cannot be defined a proper name being a mere
mark put upon an individual and of which it is the characteristic
property to be destitute of meaning its meaning cannot of course be
declared though we may indicate by language as we might indicate still
more conveniently by pointing with the finger upon what individual that
particular mark has been or is intended to be put it is no definition
of john thomson to say he is the son of general thomson for the name
john thomson does not express this neither is it any definition of john
thomson to say he is the man now crossing the street these
propositions may serve to make known who is the particular man to whom the
name belongs but that may be done still more unambiguously by pointing to
him which however has not usually been esteemed one of the modes of
definition
in the case of connotative names the meaning as has been so often
observed is the connotation and the definition of a connotative name is
the proposition which declares its connotation this may be done either
directly or indirectly the direct mode would be by a proposition in this
form man or whatsover the word may be is a name connoting such and
such attributes or is a name which when predicated of anything
signifies the possession of such and such attributes by that thing or
thus man is everything which possesses such and such attributes man is
everything which possesses corporeity organization life rationality
and certain peculiarities of external form
this form of definition is the most precise and least equivocal of any
but it is not brief enough and is besides too technical and pedantic for
common discourse the more usual mode of declaring the connotation of a
name is to predicate of it another name or names of known signification
which connote the same aggregation of attributes this may be done either
by predicating of the name intended to be defined another connotative
name exactly synonymous as man is a human being which is not commonly
accounted a definition at all or by predicating two or more connotative
names which make up among them the whole connotation of the name to be
defined in this last case again we may either compose our definition of
as many connotative names as there are attributes each attribute being
connoted by one as man is a corporeal organized animated rational
being shaped so and so or we may employ names which connote several of
the attributes at once as man is a rational animal shaped so and so
the definition of a name according to this view of it is the sum total
of all the essential propositions which can be framed with that name for
their subject all propositions the truth of which is implied in the name
all those which we are made aware of by merely hearing the name are
included in the definition if complete and may be evolved from it
without the aid of any other premisses whether the definition expresses
them in two or three words or in a larger number it is therefore not
without reason that condillac and other writers have affirmed a definition
to be an analysis to resolve any complex whole into the elements of
which it is compounded is the meaning of analysis and this we do when we
replace one word which connotes a set of attributes collectively by two
or more which connote the same attributes singly or in smaller groups
 2 from this however the question naturally arises in what manner are
we to define a name which connotes only a single attribute for instance
white which connotes nothing but whiteness rational which connotes
nothing but the possession of reason it might seem that the meaning of
such names could only be declared in two ways by a synonymous term if
any such can be found or in the direct way already alluded to white is
a name connoting the attribute whiteness let us see however whether
the analysis of the meaning of the name that is the breaking down of
that meaning into several parts admits of being carried farther without
at present deciding this question as to the word white it is obvious
that in the case of rational some further explanation may be given of
its meaning than is contained in the proposition rational is that which
possesses the attribute of reason since the attribute reason itself
admits of being defined and here we must turn our attention to the
definitions of attributes or rather of the names of attributes that is
of abstract names
in regard to such names of attributes as are connotative and express
attributes of those attributes there is no difficulty like other
connotative names they are defined by declaring their connotation thus
the word fault may be defined a quality productive of evil or
inconvenience sometimes again the attribute to be defined is not one
attribute but an union of several we have only therefore to put
together the names of all the attributes taken separately and we obtain
the definition of the name which belongs to them all taken together a
definition which will correspond exactly to that of the corresponding
concrete name for as we define a concrete name by enumerating the
attributes which it connotes and as the attributes connoted by a concrete
name form the entire signification of the corresponding abstract one the
same enumeration will serve for the definition of both thus if the
definition of a human being be this a being corporeal animated
rational and shaped so and so the definition of humanity will be
corporeity and animal life combined with rationality and with such and
such a shape
when on the other hand the abstract name does not express a complication
of attributes but a single attribute we must remember that every
attribute is grounded on some fact or phenomenon from which and which
alone it derives its meaning to that fact or phenomenon called in a
former chapter the foundation of the attribute we must therefore have
recourse for its definition now the foundation of the attribute may be a
phenomenon of any degree of complexity consisting of many different
parts either coexistent or in succession to obtain a definition of the
attribute we must analyse the phenomenon into these parts eloquence for
example is the name of one attribute only but this attribute is grounded
on external effects of a complicated nature flowing from acts of the
person to whom we ascribe the attribute and by resolving this phenomenon
of causation into its two parts the cause and the effect we obtain a
definition of eloquence viz the power of influencing the feelings by
speech or writing
a name therefore whether concrete or abstract admits of definition
provided we are able to analyse that is to distinguish into parts the
attribute or set of attributes which constitute the meaning both of the
concrete name and of the corresponding abstract if a set of attributes
by enumerating them if a single attribute by dissecting the fact or
phenomenon whether of perception or of internal consciousness which is
the foundation of the attribute but further even when the fact is one
of our simple feelings or states of consciousness and therefore
unsusceptible of analysis the names both of the object and of the
attribute still admit of definition or rather would do so if all our
simple feelings had names whiteness may be defined the property or power
of exciting the sensation of white a white object may be defined an
object which excites the sensation of white the only names which are
unsusceptible of definition because their meaning is unsusceptible of
analysis are the names of the simple feelings themselves these are in
the same condition as proper names they are not indeed like proper
names unmeaning for the words sensation of white signify that the
sensation which i so denominate resembles other sensations which i
remember to have had before and to have called by that name but as we
have no words by which to recall those former sensations except the very
word which we seek to define or some other which being exactly
synonymous with it requires definition as much words cannot unfold the
signification of this class of names and we are obliged to make a direct
appeal to the personal experience of the individual whom we address
 3 having stated what seems to be the true idea of a definition we
proceed to examine some opinions of philosophers and some popular
conceptions on the subject which conflict more or less with that idea
the only adequate definition of a name is as already remarked one which
declares the facts and the whole of the facts which the name involves in
its signification but with most persons the object of a definition does
not embrace so much they look for nothing more in a definition than a
guide to the correct use of the terma protection against applying it in a
manner inconsistent with custom and convention anything therefore is to
them a sufficient definition of a term which will serve as a correct
index to what the term denotes although not embracing the whole and
sometimes perhaps not even any part of what it connotes this gives
rise to two sorts of imperfect or unscientific definition namely
essential but incomplete definitions and accidental definitions or
descriptions in the former a connotative name is defined by a part only
of its connotation in the latter by something which forms no part of the
connotation at all
an example of the first kind of imperfect definitions is the
followingman is a rational animal it is impossible to consider this as
a complete definition of the word man since as before remarked if we
adhered to it we should be obliged to call the houyhnhms men but as there
happen to be no houyhnhms this imperfect definition is sufficient to mark
out and distinguish from all other things the objects at present denoted
by man all the beings actually known to exist of whom the name is
predicable though the word is defined by some only among the attributes
which it connotes not by all it happens that all known objects which
possess the enumerated attributes possess also those which are omitted
so that the field of predication which the word covers and the employment
of it which is conformable to usage are as well indicated by the
inadequate definition as by an adequate one such definitions however
are always liable to be overthrown by the discovery of new objects in
nature
definitions of this kind are what logicians have had in view when they
laid down the rule that the definition of a species should be per genus
et differentiam differentia being seldom taken to mean the whole of the
peculiarities constitutive of the species but some one of those
peculiarities only a complete definition would be per genus et
differentias rather than differentiam it would include with the name
of the superior genus not merely some attribute which distinguishes the
species intended to be defined from all other species of the same genus
but all the attributes implied in the name of the species which the
name of the superior genus has not already implied the assertion
however that a definition must of necessity consist of a genus and
differenti is not tenable it was early remarked by logicians that the
summum genus in any classification having no genus superior to itself
could not be defined in this manner yet we have seen that all names
except those of our elementary feelings are susceptible of definition in
the strictest sense by setting forth in words the constituent parts of
the fact or phenomenon of which the connotation of every word is
ultimately composed
 4 although the first kind of imperfect definition which defines a
connotative term by a part only of what it connotes but a part sufficient
to mark out correctly the boundaries of its denotation has been
considered by the ancients and by logicians in general as a complete
definition it has always been deemed necessary that the attributes
employed should really form part of the connotation for the rule was that
the definition must be drawn from the essence of the class and this
would not have been the case if it had been in any degree made up of
attributes not connoted by the name the second kind of imperfect
definition therefore in which the name of a class is defined by any of
its accidentsthat is by attributes which are not included in its
connotationhas been rejected from the rank of genuine definition by all
logicians and has been termed description
this kind of imperfect definition however takes its rise from the same
cause as the other namely the willingness to accept as a definition
anything which whether it expounds the meaning of the name or not
enables us to discriminate the things denoted by the name from all other
things and consequently to employ the term in predication without
deviating from established usage this purpose is duly answered by stating
any no matter what of the attributes which are common to the whole of
the class and peculiar to it or any combination of attributes which may
happen to be peculiar to it though separately each of those attributes
may be common to it with some other things it is only necessary that the
definition or description thus formed should be convertible with the
name which it professes to define that is should be exactly coextensive
with it being predicable of everything of which it is predicable and of
nothing of which it is not predicable although the attributes specified
may have no connexion with those which mankind had in view when they
formed or recognised the class and gave it a name the following are
correct definitions of man according to this test man is a mammiferous
animal having by nature two hands for the human species answers to
this description and no other animal does man is an animal who cooks
his food man is a featherless biped
what would otherwise be a mere description may be raised to the rank of a
real definition by the peculiar purpose which the speaker or writer has in
view as was seen in the preceding chapter it may for the ends of a
particular art or science or for the more convenient statement of an
authors particular doctrines be advisable to give to some general name
without altering its denotation a special connotation different from its
ordinary one when this is done a definition of the name by means of the
attributes which make up the special connotation though in general a mere
accidental definition or description becomes on the particular occasion
and for the particular purpose a complete and genuine definition this
actually occurs with respect to one of the preceding examples man is a
mammiferous animal having two hands which is the scientific definition
of man considered as one of the species in cuviers distribution of the
animal kingdom
in cases of this sort although the definition is still a declaration of
the meaning which in the particular instance the name is appointed to
convey it cannot be said that to state the meaning of the word is the
purpose of the definition the purpose is not to expound a name but to
help to expound a classification the special meaning which cuvier
assigned to the word man quite foreign to its ordinary meaning though
involving no change in the denotation of the word was incidental to a
plan of arranging animals into classes on a certain principle that is
according to a certain set of distinctions and since the definition of
man according to the ordinary connotation of the word though it would
have answered every other purpose of a definition would not have pointed
out the place which the species ought to occupy in that particular
classification he gave the word a special connotation that he might be
able to define it by the kind of attributes on which for reasons of
scientific convenience he had resolved to found his division of animated
nature
scientific definitions whether they are definitions of scientific terms
or of common terms used in a scientific sense are almost always of the
kind last spoken of their main purpose is to serve as the landmarks of
scientific classification and since the classifications in any science
are continually modified as scientific knowledge advances the definitions
in the sciences are also constantly varying a striking instance is
afforded by the words acid and alkali especially the former as
experimental discovery advanced the substances classed with acids have
been constantly multiplying and by a natural consequence the attributes
connoted by the word have receded and become fewer at first it connoted
the attributes of combining with an alkali to form a neutral substance
called a salt being compounded of a base and oxygen causticity to the
taste and touch fluidity c the true analysis of muriatic acid into
chlorine and hydrogen caused the second property composition from a base
and oxygen to be excluded from the connotation the same discovery fixed
the attention of chemists upon hydrogen as an important element in acids
and more recent discoveries having led to the recognition of its presence
in sulphuric nitric and many other acids where its existence was not
previously suspected there is now a tendency to include the presence of
this element in the connotation of the word but carbonic acid silica
sulphurous acid have no hydrogen in their composition that property
cannot therefore be connoted by the term unless those substances are no
longer to be considered acids causticity and fluidity have long since
been excluded from the characteristics of the class by the inclusion of
silica and many other substances in it and the formation of neutral
bodies by combination with alkalis together with such electrochemical
peculiarities as this is supposed to imply are now the only differenti
which form the fixed connotation of the word acid as a term of chemical
science
scientific men are still seeking and may be long ere they find a
suitable definition of one of the earliest words in the vocabulary of the
human race and one of those of which the popular sense is plainest and
best understood the word i mean is heat and the source of the difficulty
is the imperfect state of our scientific knowledge which has shown to us
multitudes of phenomena certainly connected with the same power which
causes what our senses recognise as heat but has not yet taught us the
laws of those phenomena with sufficient accuracy to admit of our
determining under what characteristics the whole of those phenomena shall
ultimately be embodied as a class which characteristics would of course
be so many differenti for the definition of the power itself we have
advanced far enough to know that one of the attributes connoted must be
that of operating as a repulsive force but this is certainly not all
which must ultimately be included in the scientific definition of heat
what is true of the definition of any term of science is of course true
of the definition of a science itself and accordingly as observed in
the introductory chapter of this work the definition of a science must
necessarily be progressive and provisional any extension of knowledge or
alteration in the current opinions respecting the subject matter may lead
to a change more or less extensive in the particulars included in the
science and its composition being thus altered it may easily happen that
a different set of characteristics will be found better adapted as
differenti for defining its name
in the same manner in which a special or technical definition has for its
object to expound the artificial classification out of which it grows the
aristotelian logicians seem to have imagined that it was also the business
of ordinary definition to expound the ordinary and what they deemed the
natural classification of things namely the division of them into
kinds and to show the place which each kind occupies as superior
collateral or subordinate among other kinds this notion would account
for the rule that all definition must necessarily be per genus et
differentiam and would also explain why any one differentia was deemed
sufficient but to expound or express in words a distinction of kind
has already been shown to be an impossibility the very meaning of a kind
is that the properties which distinguish it do not grow out of one
another and cannot therefore be set forth in words even by implication
otherwise than by enumerating them all and all are not known nor ever
will be so it is idle therefore to look to this as one of the purposes
of a definition while if it be only required that the definition of a
kind should indicate what kinds include it or are included by it any
definitions which expound the connotation of the names will do this for
the name of each class must necessarily connote enough of its properties
to fix the boundaries of the class if the definition therefore be a
full statement of the connotation it is all that a definition can be
required to be
 5 of the two incomplete or unscientific modes of definition and in
what they differ from the complete or scientific mode enough has now been
said we shall next examine an ancient doctrine once generally prevalent
and still by no means exploded which i regard as the source of a great
part of the obscurity hanging over some of the most important processes of
the understanding in the pursuit of truth according to this the
definitions of which we have now treated are only one of two sorts into
which definitions may be divided viz definitions of names and
definitions of things the former are intended to explain the meaning of a
term the latter the nature of a thing the last being incomparably the
most important
this opinion was held by the ancient philosophers and by their followers
with the exception of the nominalists but as the spirit of modern
metaphysics until a recent period has been on the whole a nominalist
spirit the notion of definitions of things has been to a certain extent
in abeyance still continuing however to breed confusion in logic by
its consequences indeed rather than by itself yet the doctrine in its own
proper form now and then breaks out and has appeared among other places
where it was scarcely to be expected in a deservedly popular work
archbishop whatelys logic25 in a review of that work published by me
in the westminster review for january 1828 and containing some opinions
which i no longer entertain i find the following observations on the
question now before us observations with which my present view of that
question is still sufficiently in accordance
the distinction between nominal and real definitions between definitions
of words and what are called definitions of things though conformable to
the ideas of most of the aristotelian logicians cannot as it appears to
us be maintained we apprehend that no definition is ever intended to
explain and unfold the nature of the thing it is some confirmation of
our opinion that none of those writers who have thought that there were
definitions of things have ever succeeded in discovering any criterion by
which the definition of a thing can be distinguished from any other
proposition relating to the thing the definition they say unfolds the
nature of the thing but no definition can unfold its whole nature and
every proposition in which any quality whatever is predicated of the
thing unfolds some part of its nature the true state of the case we take
to be this all definitions are of names and of names only but in some
definitions it is clearly apparent that nothing is intended except to
explain the meaning of the word while in others besides explaining the
meaning of the word it is intended to be implied that there exists a
thing corresponding to the word whether this be or be not implied in any
given case cannot be collected from the mere form of the expression a
centaur is an animal with the upper parts of a man and the lower parts of
a horse and a triangle is a rectilineal figure with three sides are
in form expressions precisely similar although in the former it is not
implied that any thing conformable to the term really exists while in
the latter it is as may be seen by substituting in both definitions the
word means for is in the first expression a centaur means an
animal c the sense would remain unchanged in the second a triangle
means c the meaning would be altered since it would be obviously
impossible to deduce any of the truths of geometry from a proposition
expressive only of the manner in which we intend to employ a particular
sign
there are therefore expressions commonly passing for definitions
which include in themselves more than the mere explanation of the meaning
of a term but it is not correct to call an expression of this sort a
peculiar kind of definition its difference from the other kind consists
in this that it is not a definition but a definition and something more
the definition above given of a triangle obviously comprises not one but
two propositions perfectly distinguishable the one is there may exist
a figure bounded by three straight lines the other and this figure
may be termed a triangle the former of these propositions is not a
definition at all the latter is a mere nominal definition or explanation
of the use and application of a term the first is susceptible of truth or
falsehood and may therefore be made the foundation of a train of
reasoning the latter can neither be true nor false the only character it
is susceptible of is that of conformity or disconformity to the ordinary
usage of language
there is a real distinction then between definitions of names and what
are erroneously called definitions of things but it is that the latter
along with the meaning of a name covertly asserts a matter of fact this
covert assertion is not a definition but a postulate the definition is a
mere identical proposition which gives information only about the use of
language and from which no conclusions affecting matters of fact can
possibly be drawn the accompanying postulate on the other hand affirms
a fact which may lead to consequences of every degree of importance it
affirms the real existence of things possessing the combination of
attributes set forth in the definition and this if true may be
foundation sufficient on which to build a whole fabric of scientific
truth
we have already made and shall often have to repeat the remark that the
philosophers who overthrew realism by no means got rid of the consequences
of realism but retained long afterwards in their own philosophy
numerous propositions which could only have a rational meaning as part of
a realistic system it had been handed down from aristotle and probably
from earlier times as an obvious truth that the science of geometry is
deduced from definitions this so long as a definition was considered to
be a proposition unfolding the nature of the thing did well enough but
hobbes followed and rejected utterly the notion that a definition
declares the nature of the thing or does anything but state the meaning
of a name yet he continued to affirm as broadly as any of his
predecessors that the  principia or original premisses of
mathematics and even of all science are definitions producing the
singular paradox that systems of scientific truth nay all truths
whatever at which we arrive by reasoning are deduced from the arbitrary
conventions of mankind concerning the signification of words
to save the credit of the doctrine that definitions are the premisses of
scientific knowledge the proviso is sometimes added that they are so
only under a certain condition namely that they be framed conformably to
the phenomena of nature that is that they ascribe such meanings to terms
as shall suit objects actually existing but this is only an instance of
the attempt so often made to escape from the necessity of abandoning old
language after the ideas which it expresses have been exchanged for
contrary ones from the meaning of a name we are told it is possible to
infer physical facts provided the name has corresponding to it an
existing thing but if this proviso be necessary from which of the two is
the inference really drawn from the existence of a thing having the
properties or from the existence of a name meaning them
take for instance any of the definitions laid down as premisses in
euclids elements the definition let us say of a circle this being
analysed consists of two propositions the one an assumption with respect
to a matter of fact the other a genuine definition a figure may exist
having all the points in the line which bounds it equally distant from a
single point within it any figure possessing this property is called a
circle let us look at one of the demonstrations which are said to depend
on this definition and observe to which of the two propositions contained
in it the demonstration really appeals about the centre a describe the
circle bcd here is an assumption that a figure such as the definition
expresses may be described which is no other than the postulate or
covert assumption involved in the socalled definition but whether that
figure be called a circle or not is quite immaterial the purpose would be
as well answered in all respects except brevity were we to say through
the point b draw a line returning into itself of which every point shall
be at an equal distance from the point a by this the definition of a
circle would be got rid of and rendered needless but not the postulate
implied in it without that the demonstration could not stand the circle
being now described let us proceed to the consequence since b c d is a
circle the radius b a is equal to the radius c a b a is equal to c a
not because b c d is a circle but because b c d is a figure with the
radii equal our warrant for assuming that such a figure about the centre
a with the radius b a may be made to exist is the postulate whether
the admissibility of these postulates rests on intuition or on proof may
be a matter of dispute but in either case they are the premisses on which
the theorems depend and while these are retained it would make no
difference in the certainty of geometrical truths though every definition
in euclid and every technical term therein defined were laid aside
it is perhaps superfluous to dwell at so much length on what is so
nearly selfevident but when a distinction obvious as it may appear has
been confounded and by powerful intellects it is better to say too much
than too little for the purpose of rendering such mistakes impossible in
future i will therefore detain the reader while i point out one of the
absurd consequences flowing from the supposition that definitions as
such are the premisses in any of our reasonings except such as relate to
words only if this supposition were true we might argue correctly from
true premisses and arrive at a false conclusion we should only have to
assume as a premiss the definition of a nonentity or rather of a name
which has no entity corresponding to it let this for instance be our
definition
a dragon is a serpent breathing flame
this proposition considered only as a definition is indisputably
correct a dragon is a serpent breathing flame the word means that
the tacit assumption indeed if there were any such understood
assertion of the existence of an object with properties corresponding to
the definition would in the present instance be false out of this
definition we may carve the premisses of the following syllogism
a dragon is a thing which breathes flame
a dragon is a serpent
from which the conclusion is
therefore some serpent or serpents breathe flame
an unexceptionable syllogism in the first mode of the third figure in
which both premisses are true and yet the conclusion false which every
logician knows to be an absurdity the conclusion being false and the
syllogism correct the premisses cannot be true but the premisses
considered as parts of a definition are true therefore the premisses
considered as parts of a definition cannot be the real ones the real
premisses must be
a dragon is a really existing thing which breathes flame
a dragon is a really existing serpent
which implied premisses being false the falsity of the conclusion
presents no absurdity
if we would determine what conclusion follows from the same ostensible
premisses when the tacit assumption of real existence is left out let us
according to the recommendation in the westminster review substitute
means for is we then have
dragon is a word meaning a thing which breathes flame
dragon is a word meaning a serpent
from which the conclusion is
some word or words which mean a serpent also mean a thing which
            breathes flame
where the conclusion as well as the premisses is true and is the only
kind of conclusion which can ever follow from a definition namely a
proposition relating to the meaning of words
there is still another shape into which we may transform this syllogism
we may suppose the middle term to be the designation neither of a thing
nor of a name but of an idea we then have
the idea of a dragon is an idea of a thing which breathes flame
the idea of a dragon is an idea of a serpent
therefore there is an idea of a serpent which is an idea of a thing
breathing flame
here the conclusion is true and also the premisses but the premisses are
not definitions they are propositions affirming that an idea existing in
the mind includes certain ideal elements the truth of the conclusion
follows from the existence of the psychological phenomenon called the idea
of a dragon and therefore still from the tacit assumption of a matter of
fact26
when as in this last syllogism the conclusion is a proposition
respecting an idea the assumption on which it depends may be merely that
of the existence of an idea but when the conclusion is a proposition
concerning a thing the postulate involved in the definition which stands
as the apparent premiss is the existence of a thing conformable to the
definition and not merely of an idea conformable to it this assumption
of real existence we always convey the impression that we intend to make
when we profess to define any name which is already known to be a name of
really existing objects on this account it is that the assumption was
not necessarily implied in the definition of a dragon while there was no
doubt of its being included in the definition of a circle
 6 one of the circumstances which have contributed to keep up the
notion that demonstrative truths follow from definitions rather than from
the postulates implied in those definitions is that the postulates even
in those sciences which are considered to surpass all others in
demonstrative certainty are not always exactly true it is not true that
a circle exists or can be described which has all its radii exactly
equal such accuracy is ideal only it is not found in nature still less
can it be realised by art people had a difficulty therefore in
conceiving that the most certain of all conclusions could rest on
premisses which instead of being certainly true are certainly not true
to the full extent asserted this apparent paradox will be examined when
we come to treat of demonstration where we shall be able to show that as
much of the postulate is true as is required to support as much as is
true of the conclusion philosophers however to whom this view had not
occurred or whom it did not satisfy have thought it indispensable that
there should be found in definitions something more certain or at least
more accurately true than the implied postulate of the real existence of
a corresponding object and this something they flattered themselves they
had found when they laid it down that a definition is a statement and
analysis not of the mere meaning of a word nor yet of the nature of a
thing but of an idea thus the proposition a circle is a plane figure
bounded by a line all the points of which are at an equal distance from a
given point within it was considered by them not as an assertion that
any real circle has that property which would not be exactly true but
that we conceive a circle as having it that our abstract idea of a
circle is an idea of a figure with its radii exactly equal
conformably to this it is said that the subject matter of mathematics
and of every other demonstrative science is not things as they really
exist but abstractions of the mind a geometrical line is a line without
breadth but no such line exists in nature it is a notion made up by the
mind out of the materials in nature the definition it is said is a
definition of this mental line not of any actual line and it is only of
the mental line not of any line existing in nature that the theorems of
geometry are accurately true
allowing this doctrine respecting the nature of demonstrative truth to be
correct which in a subsequent place i shall endeavour to prove that it
is not even on that supposition the conclusions which seem to follow
from a definition do not follow from the definition as such but from an
implied postulate even if it be true that there is no object in nature
answering to the definition of a line and that the geometrical properties
of lines are not true of any lines in nature but only of the idea of a
line the definition at all events postulates the real existence of such
an idea it assumes that the mind can frame or rather has framed the
notion of length without breadth and without any other sensible property
whatever to me indeed it appears that the mind cannot form any such
notion it cannot conceive length without breadth it can only in
contemplating objects attend to their length exclusively of their
other sensible qualities and so determine what properties may be
predicated of them in virtue of their length alone if this be true the
postulate involved in the geometrical definition of a line is the real
existence not of length without breadth but merely of length that is
of long objects this is quite enough to support all the truths of
geometry since every property of a geometrical line is really a property
of all physical objects possessing length but even what i hold to be the
false doctrine on the subject leaves the conclusion that our reasonings
are grounded on the matters of fact postulated in definitions and not on
the definitions themselves entirely unaffected and accordingly this
conclusion is one which i have in common with dr whewell in his
philosophy of the inductive sciences although on the nature of
demonstrative truth dr whewells opinions are greatly at variance with
mine and here as in many other instances i gladly acknowledge that his
writings are eminently serviceable in clearing from confusion the initial
steps in the analysis of the mental processes even where his views
respecting the ultimate analysis are such as though with unfeigned
respect i cannot but regard as fundamentally erroneous
 7 although according to the opinion here presented definitions are
properly of names only and not of things it does not follow from this
that definitions are arbitrary how to define a name may not only be an
inquiry of considerable difficulty and intricacy but may involve
considerations going deep into the nature of the things which are denoted
by the name such for instance are the inquiries which form the subjects
of the most important of platos dialogues as what is rhetoric the
topic of the gorgias or what is justice that of the republic such
also is the question scornfully asked by pilate what is truth and the
fundamental question with speculative moralists in all ages what is
virtue
it would be a mistake to represent these difficult and noble inquiries as
having nothing in view beyond ascertaining the conventional meaning of a
name they are inquiries not so much to determine what is as what should
be the meaning of a name which like other practical questions of
terminology requires for its solution that we should enter and sometimes
enter very deeply into the properties not merely of names but of the
things named
although the meaning of every concrete general name resides in the
attributes which it connotes the objects were named before the
attributes as appears from the fact that in all languages abstract names
are mostly compounds or other derivatives of the concrete names which
correspond to them connotative names therefore were after proper
names the first which were used and in the simpler cases no doubt a
distinct connotation was present to the minds of those who first used the
name and was distinctly intended by them to be conveyed by it the first
person who used the word white as applied to snow or to any other
object knew no doubt very well what quality he intended to predicate
and had a perfectly distinct conception in his mind of the attribute
signified by the name
but where the resemblances and differences on which our classifications
are founded are not of this palpable and easily determinable kind
especially where they consist not in any one quality but in a number of
qualities the effects of which being blended together are not very easily
discriminated and referred each to its true source it often happens that
names are applied to nameable objects with no distinct connotation
present to the minds of those who apply them they are only influenced by
a general resemblance between the new object and all or some of the old
familiar objects which they have been accustomed to call by that name
this as we have seen is the law which even the mind of the philosopher
must follow in giving names to the simple elementary feelings of our
nature but where the things to be named are complex wholes a
philosopher is not content with noticing a general resemblance he
examines what the resemblance consists in and he only gives the same name
to things which resemble one another in the same definite particulars the
philosopher therefore habitually employs his general names with a
definite connotation but language was not made and can only in some
small degree be mended by philosophers in the minds of the real arbiters
of language general names especially where the classes they denote
cannot be brought before the tribunal of the outward senses to be
identified and discriminated connote little more than a vague gross
resemblance to the things which they were earliest or have been most
accustomed to call by those names when for instance ordinary persons
predicate the words just or unjust of any action noble or mean of
any sentiment expression or demeanour statesman or charlatan of any
personage figuring in politics do they mean to affirm of those various
subjects any determinate attributes of whatever kind no they merely
recognise as they think some likeness more or less vague and loose
between these and some other things which they have been accustomed to
denominate or to hear denominated by those appellations
language as sir james mackintosh used to say of governments is not
made but grows a name is not imposed at once and by previous purpose
upon a class of objects but is first applied to one thing and then
extended by a series of transitions to another and another by this
process as has been remarked by several writers and illustrated with
great force and clearness by dugald stewart in his philosophical essays
a name not unfrequently passes by successive links of resemblance from one
object to another until it becomes applied to things having nothing in
common with the first things to which the name was given which however
do not for that reason drop the name so that it at last denotes a
confused huddle of objects having nothing whatever in common and
connotes nothing not even a vague and general resemblance when a name
has fallen into this state in which by predicating it of any object we
assert literally nothing about the object it has become unfit for the
purposes either of thought or of the communication of thought and can
only be made serviceable by stripping it of some part of its multifarious
denotation and confining it to objects possessed of some attributes in
common which it may be made to connote such are the inconveniences of a
language which is not made but grows like the governments which are in
a similar case it may be compared to a road which is not made but has
made itself it requires continual mending in order to be passable
from this it is already evident why the question respecting the
definition of an abstract name is often one of so much difficulty the
question what is justice is in other words what is the attribute which
mankind mean to predicate when they call an action just to which the
first answer is that having come to no precise agreement on the point
they do not mean to predicate distinctly any attribute at all
nevertheless all believe that there is some common attribute belonging to
all the actions which they are in the habit of calling just the question
then must be whether there is any such common attribute and in the
first place whether mankind agree sufficiently with one another as to the
particular actions which they do or do not call just to render the
inquiry what quality those actions have in common a possible one if so
whether the actions really have any quality in common and if they have
what it is of these three the first alone is an inquiry into usage and
convention the other two are inquiries into matters of fact and if the
second question whether the actions form a class at all has been
answered negatively there remains a fourth often more arduous than all
the rest namely how best to form a class artificially which the name
may denote
and here it is fitting to remark that the study of the spontaneous growth
of languages is of the utmost importance to those who would logically
remodel them the classifications rudely made by established language
when retouched as they almost always require to be by the hands of the
logician are often in themselves excellently suited to his purposes when
compared with the classifications of a philosopher they are like the
customary law of a country which has grown up as it were spontaneously
compared with laws methodized and digested into a code the former are a
far less perfect instrument than the latter but being the result of a
long though unscientific course of experience they contain a mass of
materials which may be made very usefully available in the formation of
the systematic body of written law in like manner the established
grouping of objects under a common name though it may be founded only on
a gross and general resemblance is evidence in the first place that the
resemblance is obvious and therefore considerable and in the next
place that it is a resemblance which has struck great numbers of persons
during a series of years and ages even when a name by successive
extensions has come to be applied to things among which there does not
exist this gross resemblance common to them all still at every step in
its progress we shall find such a resemblance and these transitions of
the meaning of words are often an index to real connexions between the
things denoted by them which might otherwise escape the notice of
thinkers of those at least who from using a different language or from
any difference in their habitual associations have fixed their attention
in preference on some other aspect of the things the history of
philosophy abounds in examples of such oversights committed for want of
perceiving the hidden link that connected together the seemingly disparate
meanings of some ambiguous word27
whenever the inquiry into the definition of the name of any real object
consists of anything else than a mere comparison of authorities we
tacitly assume that a meaning must be found for the name compatible with
its continuing to denote if possible all but at any rate the greater or
the more important part of the things of which it is commonly predicated
the inquiry therefore into the definition is an inquiry into the
resemblances and differences among those things whether there be any
resemblance running through them all if not through what portion of them
such a general resemblance can be traced and finally what are the common
attributes the possession of which gives to them all or to that portion
of them the character of resemblance which has led to their being classed
together when these common attributes have been ascertained and
specified the name which belongs in common to the resembling objects
acquires a distinct instead of a vague connotation and by possessing this
distinct connotation becomes susceptible of definition
in giving a distinct connotation to the general name the philosopher will
endeavour to fix upon such attributes as while they are common to all the
things usually denoted by the name are also of greatest importance in
themselves either directly or from the number the conspicuousness or
the interesting character of the consequences to which they lead he will

and recondite qualities on which they often depend give that general
character and aspect to a set of objects which determine the groups into
which they naturally fall but to penetrate to the more hidden agreement
on which these obvious and superficial agreements depend is often one of
the most difficult of scientific problems as it is among the most
difficult so it seldom fails to be among the most important and since
upon the result of this inquiry respecting the causes of the properties of
a class of things there incidentally depends the question what shall be

chapter i of inference or reasoning in general
 1 in the preceding book we have been occupied not with the nature of
proof but with the nature of assertion the import conveyed by a
proposition whether that proposition be true or false not the means by
which to discriminate true from false propositions the proper subject
however of logic is proof before we could understand what proof is it
was necessary to understand what that is to which proof is applicable
what that is which can be a subject of belief or disbelief of affirmation
or denial what in short the different kinds of propositions assert
this preliminary inquiry we have prosecuted to a definite result
assertion in the first place relates either to the meaning of words or
to some property of the things which words signify assertions respecting
the meaning of words among which definitions are the most important hold
a place and an indispensable one in philosophy but as the meaning of
words is essentially arbitrary this class of assertions are not
susceptible of truth or falsity nor therefore of proof or disproof
assertions respecting things or what may be called real propositions in
contradistinction to verbal ones are of various sorts we have analysed
the import of each sort and have ascertained the nature of the things
they relate to and the nature of what they severally assert respecting
those things we found that whatever be the form of the proposition and
whatever its nominal subject or predicate the real subject of every
proposition is some one or more facts or phenomena of consciousness or
some one or more of the hidden causes or powers to which we ascribe those
facts and that what is predicated or asserted either in the affirmative
or negative of those phenomena or those powers is always either
existence order in place order in time causation or resemblance this
then is the theory of the import of propositions reduced to its ultimate
elements but there is another and a less abstruse expression for it
which though stopping short in an earlier stage of the analysis is
sufficiently scientific for many of the purposes for which such a general
expression is required this expression recognises the commonly received
distinction between subject and attribute and gives the following as the
analysis of the meaning of propositionsevery proposition asserts that
some given subject does or does not possess some attribute or that some
attribute is or is not either in all or in some portion of the subjects
in which it is met with conjoined with some other attribute
we shall now for the present take our leave of this portion of our
inquiry and proceed to the peculiar problem of the science of logic
namely how the assertions of which we have analysed the import are
proved or disproved such of them at least as not being amenable to
direct consciousness or intuition are appropriate subjects of proof
we say of a fact or statement that it is proved when we believe its
truth by reason of some other fact or statement from which it is said to
follow most of the propositions whether affirmative or negative
universal particular or singular which we believe are not believed on
their own evidence but on the ground of something previously assented to
and from which they are said to be inferred to infer a proposition from
a previous proposition or propositions to give credence to it or claim
credence for it as a conclusion from something else is to reason in
the most extensive sense of the term there is a narrower sense in which
the name reasoning is confined to the form of inference which is termed
ratiocination and of which the syllogism is the general type the reasons
for not conforming to this restricted use of the term were stated in an
early stage of our inquiry and additional motives will be suggested by
the considerations on which we are now about to enter
 2 in proceeding to take into consideration the cases in which
inferences can legitimately be drawn we shall first mention some cases in
which the inference is apparent not real and which require notice
chiefly that they may not be confounded with cases of inference properly
so called this occurs when the proposition ostensibly inferred from
another appears on analysis to be merely a repetition of the same or
part of the same assertion which was contained in the first all the
cases mentioned in books of logic as examples of quipollency or
equivalence of propositions are of this nature thus if we were to
argue no man is incapable of reason for every man is rational or all
men are mortal for no man is exempt from death it would be plain that we
were not proving the proposition but only appealing to another mode of
wording it which may or may not be more readily comprehensible by the
hearer or better adapted to suggest the real proof but which contains in
itself no shadow of proof
another case is where from an universal proposition we affect to infer
another which differs from it only in being particular as all a is b
therefore some a is b no a is b therefore some a is not b this too is
not to conclude one proposition from another but to repeat a second time
something which had been asserted at first with the difference that we
do not here repeat the whole of the previous assertion but only an
indefinite part of it
a third case is where the antecedent having affirmed a predicate of a
given subject the consequent affirms of the same subject something
already connoted by the former predicate as socrates is a man therefore
socrates is a living creature where all that is connoted by living
creature was affirmed of socrates when he was asserted to be a man if the
propositions are negative we must invert their order thus socrates is
not a living creature therefore he is not a man for if we deny the less
the greater which includes it is already denied by implication these
therefore are not really cases of inference and yet the trivial examples
by which in manuals of logic the rules of the syllogism are illustrated
are often of this illchosen kind demonstrations in form of conclusions
to which whoever understands the terms used in the statement of the data
has already and consciously assented
the most complex case of this sort of apparent inference is what is called
the conversion of propositions which consists in turning the predicate
into a subject and the subject into a predicate and framing out of the
same terms thus reversed another proposition which must be true if the
former is true thus from the particular affirmative proposition some a
is b we may infer that some b is a from the universal negative no a is
b we may conclude that no b is a from the universal affirmative
proposition all a is b it cannot be inferred that all b is a though all
water is liquid it is not implied that all liquid is water but it is
implied that some liquid is so and hence the proposition all a is b is
legitimately convertible into some b is a this process which converts an
universal proposition into a particular is termed conversion per
accidens from the proposition some a is not b we cannot even infer
that some b is not a though some men are not englishmen it does not
follow that some englishmen are not men the only legitimate conversion
if such it can be called of a particular negative proposition is in the
form some a is not b therefore something which is not b is a and this
is termed conversion by contraposition in this case however the
predicate and subject are not merely reversed but one of them is altered
instead of a and b the terms of the new proposition are a thing
which is not b and a the original proposition some a is not b is
first changed into a proposition quipollent with it some a is a thing
which is not b and the proposition being now no longer a particular
negative but a particular affirmative admits of conversion in the first
mode or as it is called simple conversion
in all these cases there is not really any inference there is in the
conclusion no new truth nothing but what was already asserted in the
premisses and obvious to whoever apprehends them the fact asserted in
the conclusion is either the very same fact or part of the fact asserted
in the original proposition this follows from our previous analysis of
the import of propositions when we say for example that some lawful
sovereigns are tyrants what is the meaning of the assertion that the
attributes connoted by the term lawful sovereign and the attributes
connoted by the term tyrant sometimes coexist in the same individual
now this is also precisely what we mean when we say that some tyrants are
lawful sovereigns which therefore is not a second proposition inferred
from the first any more than the english translation of euclids elements
is a collection of theorems different from and consequences of those
contained in the greek original again if we assert that no great general
is a rash man we mean that the attributes connoted by great general
and those connoted by rash never coexist in the same subject which is
also the exact meaning which would be expressed by saying that no rash
man is a great general when we say that all quadrupeds are warmblooded
we assert not only that the attributes connoted by quadruped and those
connoted by warmblooded sometimes coexist but that the former never
exist without the latter now the proposition some warmblooded creatures
are quadrupeds expresses the first half of this meaning dropping the
latter half and therefore has been already affirmed in the antecedent
proposition all quadrupeds are warmblooded but that all warmblooded
creatures are quadrupeds or in other words that the attributes connoted
by warmblooded never exist without those connoted by quadruped has
not been asserted and cannot be inferred in order to reassert in an
inverted form the whole of what was affirmed in the proposition all
quadrupeds are warmblooded we must convert it by contraposition thus
nothing which is not warmblooded is a quadruped this proposition and
the one from which it is derived are exactly equivalent and either of
them may be substituted for the other for to say that when the
attributes of a quadruped are present those of a warmblooded creature
are present is to say that when the latter are absent the former are
absent
in a manual for young students it would be proper to dwell at greater
length on the conversion and quipollency of propositions for although
that cannot be called reasoning or inference which is a mere reassertion
in different words of what had been asserted before there is no more
important intellectual habit nor any the cultivation of which falls more
strictly within the province of the art of logic than that of discerning
rapidly and surely the identity of an assertion when disguised under
diversity of language that important chapter in logical treatises which
relates to the opposition of propositions and the excellent technical
language which logic provides for distinguishing the different kinds or
modes of opposition are of use chiefly for this purpose such
considerations as these that contrary propositions may both be false but
cannot both be true that subcontrary propositions may both be true but
cannot both be false that of two contradictory propositions one must be
true and the other false that of two subalternate propositions the truth
of the universal proves the truth of the particular and the falsity of
the particular proves the falsity of the universal but not vice
vers28 are apt to appear at first sight very technical and
mysterious but when explained seem almost too obvious to require so
formal a statement since the same amount of explanation which is
necessary to make the principles intelligible would enable the truths
which they convey to be apprehended in any particular case which can
occur in this respect however these axioms of logic are on a level with
those of mathematics that things which are equal to the same thing are
equal to one another is as obvious in any particular case as it is in the
general statement and if no such general maxim had ever been laid down
the demonstrations in euclid would never have halted for any difficulty in
stepping across the gap which this axiom at present serves to bridge over
yet no one has ever censured writers on geometry for placing a list of
these elementary generalizations at the head of their treatises as a
first exercise to the learner of the faculty which will be required in him
at every step that of apprehending a general truth and the student of
logic in the discussion even of such truths as we have cited above
acquires habits of circumspect interpretation of words and of exactly
measuring the length and breadth of his assertions which are among the
most indispensable conditions of any considerable mental attainment and
which it is one of the primary objects of logical discipline to cultivate
 3 having noticed in order to exclude from the province of reasoning or
inference properly so called the cases in which the progression from one
truth to another is only apparent the logical consequent being a mere
repetition of the logical antecedent we now pass to those which are cases
of inference in the proper acceptation of the term those in which we set
out from known truths to arrive at others really distinct from them
reasoning in the extended sense in which i use the term and in which it
is synonymous with inference is popularly said to be of two kinds
reasoning from particulars to generals and reasoning from generals to
particulars the former being called induction the latter ratiocination
or syllogism it will presently be shown that there is a third species of
reasoning which falls under neither of these descriptions and which
nevertheless is not only valid but is the foundation of both the others
it is necessary to observe that the expressions reasoning from
particulars to generals and reasoning from generals to particulars are
recommended by brevity rather than by precision and do not adequately
mark without the aid of a commentary the distinction between induction
in the sense now adverted to and ratiocination the meaning intended by
these expressions is that induction is inferring a proposition from
propositions less general than itself and ratiocination is inferring a
proposition from propositions equally or more general when from the
observation of a number of individual instances we ascend to a general
proposition or when by combining a number of general propositions we
conclude from them another proposition still more general the process
which is substantially the same in both instances is called induction
when from a general proposition not alone for from a single proposition
nothing can be concluded which is not involved in the terms but by
combining it with other propositions we infer a proposition of the same
degree of generality with itself or a less general proposition or a
proposition merely individual the process is ratiocination when in
short the conclusion is more general than the largest of the premisses
the argument is commonly called induction when less general or equally
general it is ratiocination
as all experience begins with individual cases and proceeds from them to
generals it might seem most conformable to the natural order of thought
that induction should be treated of before we touch upon ratiocination it
will however be advantageous in a science which aims at tracing our
acquired knowledge to its sources that the inquirer should commence with
the latter rather than with the earlier stages of the process of
constructing our knowledge and should trace derivative truths backward to
the truths from which they are deduced and on which they depend for their
evidence before attempting to point out the original spring from which
both ultimately take their rise the advantages of this order of
proceeding in the present instance will manifest themselves as we advance
in a manner superseding the necessity of any further justification or
explanation
of induction therefore we shall say no more at present than that it at
least is without doubt a process of real inference the conclusion in an
induction embraces more than is contained in the premisses the principle
or law collected from particular instances the general proposition in
which we embody the result of our experience covers a much larger extent
of ground than the individual experiments which are said to form its
basis a principle ascertained by experience is more than a mere summing
up of what has been specifically observed in the individual cases which
have been examined it is a generalization grounded on those cases and
expressive of our belief that what we there found true is true in an
indefinite number of cases which we have not examined and are never
likely to examine the nature and grounds of this inference and the
conditions necessary to make it legitimate will be the subject of
discussion in the third book but that such inference really takes place
is not susceptible of question in every induction we proceed from truths
which we knew to truths which we did not know from facts certified by
observation to facts which we have not observed and even to facts not
capable of being now observed future facts for example but which we do
not hesitate to believe on the sole evidence of the induction itself
induction then is a real process of reasoning or inference whether and
in what sense so much can be said of the syllogism remains to be
determined by the examination into which we are about to enter
chapter ii of ratiocination or syllogism
 1 the analysis of the syllogism has been so accurately and fully
performed in the common manuals of logic that in the present work which
is not designed as a manual it is sufficient to recapitulate memori
caus the leading results of that analysis as a foundation for the
remarks to be afterwards made on the functions of the syllogism and the
place which it holds in science
to a legitimate syllogism it is essential that there should be three and
no more than three propositions namely the conclusion or proposition
to be proved and two other propositions which together prove it and
which are called the premisses it is essential that there should be
three and no more than three terms namely the subject and predicate of
the conclusion and another called the middleterm which must be found in
both premisses since it is by means of it that the other two terms are to
be connected together the predicate of the conclusion is called the major
term of the syllogism the subject of the conclusion is called the minor
term as there can be but three terms the major and minor terms must each
be found in one and only one of the premisses together with the
middleterm which is in them both the premiss which contains the
middleterm and the major term is called the major premiss that which
contains the middle term and the minor term is called the minor premiss
syllogisms are divided by some logicians into three figures by others
into four according to the position of the middleterm which may either
be the subject in both premisses the predicate in both or the subject in
one and the predicate in the other the most common case is that in which
the middleterm is the subject of the major premiss and the predicate of
the minor this is reckoned as the first figure when the middleterm is
the predicate in both premisses the syllogism belongs to the second
figure when it is the subject in both to the third in the fourth figure
the middleterm is the subject of the minor premiss and the predicate of
the major those writers who reckon no more than three figures include
this case in the first
each figure is divided into modes according to what are called the
quantity and quality of the propositions that is according as they
are universal or particular affirmative or negative the following are
examples of all the legitimate modes that is all those in which the
conclusion correctly follows from the premisses a is the minor term c
the major b the middleterm
first figure
all b is c   no b is c    all b is c    no b is c
all a is b   all a is b   some a is b   some a is b
therefore    therefore    therefore     therefore
all a is c   no a is c    some a is c   some a is not c
second figure
no c is b    all c is b   no c is b         all c is b
all a is b   no a is b    some a is b       some a is not b
therefore    therefore    therefore         therefore
no a is c    no a is c    some a is not c   some a is not c
third figure
all b is c    no b is c    some b is c   all b is c    some b is    no b is c
                                                       not c
all b is a    all b is a   all b is a    some b is a   all b is a   some b is a
therefore     therefore    therefore     therefore     therefore    therefore
some a is c   some a is    some a is c   some a is c   some a is    some a is
              not c                                    not c        not c
fourth figure
all c is b    all c is b   some c is b   no c is b    no c is b
all b is a    no b is a    all b is a    all b is a   some b is a
therefore     therefore    therefore     therefore    therefore
some a is c   some a is    some a is c   some a is    some a is
              not c                      not c        not c
in these exemplars or blank forms of making syllogisms no place is
assigned to singular propositions not of course because such
propositions are not used in ratiocination but because their predicate
being affirmed or denied of the whole of the subject they are ranked for
the purposes of the syllogism with universal propositions thus these
two syllogisms
all men are mortal     all men are mortal
all kings are men      socrates is a man
therefore               therefore
all kings are mortal   socrates is mortal
are arguments precisely similar and are both ranked in the first mode of
the first figure
the reasons why syllogisms in any of the above forms are legitimate that
is why if the premisses be true the conclusion must necessarily be so
and why this is not the case in any other possible mode that is in
any other combination of universal and particular affirmative and
negative propositions any person taking interest in these inquiries may
be presumed to have either learnt from the common school books of the
syllogistic logic or to be capable of divining for himself the reader
may however be referred for every needful explanation to archbishop
whatelys elements of logic where he will find stated with
philosophical precision and explained with remarkable perspicuity the
whole of the common doctrine of the syllogism
all valid ratiocination all reasoning by which from general propositions
previously admitted other propositions equally or less general are
inferred may be exhibited in some of the above forms the whole of
euclid for example might be thrown without difficulty into a series of
syllogisms regular in mode and figure
although a syllogism framed according to any of these formul is a valid
argument all correct ratiocination admits of being stated in syllogisms
of the first figure alone the rules for throwing an argument in any of
the other figures into the first figure are called rules for the
reduction of syllogisms it is done by the conversion of one or other
or both of the premisses thus an argument in the first mode of the
second figure as
no c is b
all a is b
therefore
no a is c
may be reduced as follows the proposition no c is b being an universal
negative admits of simple conversion and may be changed into no b is c
which as we showed is the very same assertion in other wordsthe same
fact differently expressed this transformation having been effected the
argument assumes the following form
no b is c
all a is b
therefore
no a is c
which is a good syllogism in the second mode of the first figure again
an argument in the first mode of the third figure must resemble the
following
all b is c
all b is a
therefore
some a is c
where the minor premiss all b is a conformably to what was laid down in
the last chapter respecting universal affirmatives does not admit of
simple conversion but may be converted per accidens thus some a is b
which though it does not express the whole of what is asserted in the
proposition all b is a expresses as was formerly shown part of it and
must therefore be true if the whole is true we have then as the result
of the reduction the following syllogism in the third mode of the first
figure
all b is c
some a is b
from which it obviously follows that
some a is c
in the same manner or in a manner on which after these examples it is not
necessary to enlarge every mode of the second third and fourth figures
may be reduced to some one of the four modes of the first in other words
every conclusion which can be proved in any of the last three figures may
be proved in the first figure from the same premisses with a slight
alteration in the mere manner of expressing them every valid
ratiocination therefore may be stated in the first figure that is in
one of the following forms
every b is c   no b is c
all a is b    all a is b
some a is b   some a is b
therefore      therefore
all a is c    no a is c
some a is c   some a is not c
or if more significant symbols are preferred
to prove an affirmative the argument must admit of being stated in this
form
all animals are mortal
all mensome mensocrates are animals
therefore
all mensome mensocrates are mortal
to prove a negative the argument must be capable of being expressed in
this form
no one who is capable of selfcontrol is necessarily vicious
all negroessome negroesmr as negro are capable of selfcontrol
therefore
no negroes aresome negroes are notmr as negro is not necessarily
vicious
although all ratiocination admits of being thrown into one or the other of
these forms and sometimes gains considerably by the transformation both
in clearness and in the obviousness of its consequence there are no
doubt cases in which the argument falls more naturally into one of the
other three figures and in which its conclusiveness is more apparent at
the first glance in those figures than when reduced to the first thus
if the proposition were that pagans may be virtuous and the evidence to
prove it were the example of aristides a syllogism in the third figure
aristides was virtuous
aristides was a pagan
therefore
some pagan was virtuous
would be a more natural mode of stating the argument and would carry
conviction more instantly home than the same ratiocination strained into
the first figure thus
aristides was virtuous
some pagan was aristides
therefore
some pagan was virtuous
a german philosopher lambert whose neues organon published in the
year 1764 contains among other things one of the most elaborate and
complete expositions ever yet made of the syllogistic doctrine has
expressly examined what sorts of arguments fall most naturally and
suitably into each of the four figures and his solution is characterized
by great ingenuity and clearness of thought29 the argument however is
one and the same in whichever figure it is expressed since as we have
already seen the premisses of a syllogism in the second third or fourth
figure and those of the syllogism in the first figure to which it may be
reduced are the same premisses in everything except language or at
least as much of them as contributes to the proof of the conclusion is
the same we are therefore at liberty in conformity with the general
opinion of logicians to consider the two elementary forms of the first
figure as the universal types of all correct ratiocination the one when
the conclusion to be proved is affirmative the other when it is
negative even though certain arguments may have a tendency to clothe
themselves in the forms of the second third and fourth figures which
however cannot possibly happen with the only class of arguments which are
of firstrate scientific importance those in which the conclusion is an
universal affirmative such conclusions being susceptible of proof in the
first figure alone
 2 on examining then these two general formul we find that in both
of them one premiss the major is an universal proposition and
according as this is affirmative or negative the conclusion is so too
all ratiocination therefore starts from a general proposition
principle or assumption a proposition in which a predicate is affirmed
or denied of an entire class that is in which some attribute or the
negation of some attribute is asserted of an indefinite number of objects
distinguished by a common characteristic and designated in consequence
by a common name
the other premiss is always affirmative and asserts that something which
may be either an individual a class or part of a class belongs to or
is included in the class respecting which something was affirmed or
denied in the major premiss it follows that the attribute affirmed or
denied of the entire class may if there was truth in that affirmation or
denial be affirmed or denied of the object or objects alleged to be
included in the class and this is precisely the assertion made in the
conclusion
whether or not the foregoing is an adequate account of the constituent
parts of the syllogism will be presently considered but as far as it
goes it is a true account it has accordingly been generalized and
erected into a logical maxim on which all ratiocination is said to be
founded insomuch that to reason and to apply the maxim are supposed to
be one and the same thing the maxim is that whatever can be affirmed or
denied of a class may be affirmed or denied of everything included in
the class this axiom supposed to be the basis of the syllogistic theory
is termed by logicians the dictum de omni et nullo
this maxim however when considered as a principle of reasoning appears
suited to a system of metaphysics once indeed generally received but
which for the last two centuries has been considered as finally abandoned
though there have not been wanting in our own day attempts at its
revival so long as what were termed universals were regarded as a
peculiar kind of substances having an objective existence distinct from
the individual objects classed under them the dictum de omni conveyed
an important meaning because it expressed the intercommunity of nature
which it was necessary on that theory that we should suppose to exist
between those general substances and the particular substances which were
subordinated to them that everything predicable of the universal was
predicable of the various individuals contained under it was then no
identical proposition but a statement of what was conceived as a
fundamental law of the universe the assertion that the entire nature and
properties of the substantia secunda formed part of the properties of
each of the individual substances called by the same name that the
properties of man for example were properties of all men was a
proposition of real significance when man did not mean all men but
something inherent in men and vastly superior to them in dignity now
however when it is known that a class an universal a genus or species
is not an entity per se but neither more nor less than the individual
substances themselves which are placed in the class and that there is
nothing real in the matter except those objects a common name given to
them and common attributes indicated by the name what i should be glad
to know do we learn by being told that whatever can be affirmed of a
class may be affirmed of every object contained in the class the class
is nothing but the objects contained in it and the dictum de omni
merely amounts to the identical proposition that whatever is true of
certain objects is true of each of those objects if all ratiocination
were no more than the application of this maxim to particular cases the
syllogism would indeed be what it has so often been declared to be
solemn trifling the dictum de omni is on a par with another truth
which in its time was also reckoned of great importance whatever is
is and not to be compared in point of significance to the cognate
aphorism it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be since
this is at the lowest equivalent to the logical axiom that contradictory
propositions cannot both be true to give any real meaning to the dictum
de omni we must consider it not as an axiom but as a definition we
must look upon it as intended to explain in a circuitous and paraphrastic
manner the meaning of the word class
an error which seemed finally refuted and dislodged from thought often
needs only put on a new suit of phrases to be welcomed back to its old
quarters and allowed to repose unquestioned for another cycle of ages
modern philosophers have not been sparing in their contempt for the
scholastic dogma that genera and species are a peculiar kind of
substances which general substances being the only permanent things
while the individual substances comprehended under them are in a perpetual
flux knowledge which necessarily imports stability can only have
relation to those general substances or universals and not to the facts
or particulars included under them yet though nominally rejected this
very doctrine whether disguised under the abstract ideas of locke whose
speculations however it has less vitiated than those of perhaps any
other writer who has been infected with it under the ultranominalism of
hobbes and condillac or the ontology of the later kantians has never
ceased to poison philosophy once accustomed to consider scientific
investigation as essentially consisting in the study of universals men
did not drop this habit of thought when they ceased to regard universals
as possessing an independent existence and even those who went the length
of considering them as mere names could not free themselves from the
notion that the investigation of truth consisted entirely or partly in
some kind of conjuration or juggle with those names when a philosopher
adopted fully the nominalist view of the signification of general
language retaining along with it the dictum de omni as the foundation
of all reasoning two such premisses fairly put together were likely if
he was a consistent thinker to land him in rather startling conclusions
accordingly it has been seriously held by writers of deserved celebrity
that the process of arriving at new truths by reasoning consists in the
mere substitution of one set of arbitrary signs for another a doctrine
which they supposed to derive irresistible confirmation from the example
of algebra if there were any process in sorcery or necromancy more
preternatural than this i should be much surprised the culminating point
of this philosophy is the noted aphorism of condillac that a science is
nothing or scarcely anything but une langue bien faite in other
words that the one sufficient rule for discovering the nature and
properties of objects is to name them properly as if the reverse were not
the truth that it is impossible to name them properly except in
proportion as we are already acquainted with their nature and properties
can it be necessary to say that none not even the most trivial knowledge
with respect to things ever was or could be originally got at by any
conceivable manipulation of mere names as such and that what can be
learnt from names is only what somebody who used the names knew before
philosophical analysis confirms the indication of common sense that the
function of names is but that of enabling us to remember and to
communicate our thoughts that they also strengthen even to an
incalculable extent the power of thought itself is most true but they
do this by no intrinsic and peculiar virtue they do it by the power
inherent in an artificial memory an instrument of which few have
adequately considered the immense potency as an artificial memory
language truly is what it has so often been called an instrument of
thought but it is one thing to be the instrument and another to be the
exclusive subject upon which the instrument is exercised we think
indeed to a considerable extent by means of names but what we think of
are the things called by those names and there cannot be a greater error
than to imagine that thought can be carried on with nothing in our mind
but names or that we can make the names think for us
 3 those who considered the dictum de omni as the foundation of the
syllogism looked upon arguments in a manner corresponding to the
erroneous view which hobbes took of propositions because there are some
propositions which are merely verbal hobbes in order apparently that his
definition might be rigorously universal defined a proposition as if no
propositions declared anything except the meaning of words if hobbes was
right if no further account than this could be given of the import of
propositions no theory could be given but the commonly received one of
the combination of propositions in a syllogism if the minor premiss
asserted nothing more than that something belongs to a class and if the
major premiss asserted nothing of that class except that it is included in
another class the conclusion would only be that what was included in the
lower class is included in the higher and the result therefore nothing
except that the classification is consistent with itself but we have seen
that it is no sufficient account of the meaning of a proposition to say
that it refers something to or excludes something from a class every
proposition which conveys real information asserts a matter of fact
dependent on the laws of nature and not on artificial classification it
asserts that a given object does or does not possess a given attribute or
it asserts that two attributes or sets of attributes do or do not
constantly or occasionally coexist since such is the purport of all
propositions which convey any real knowledge and since ratiocination is a
mode of acquiring real knowledge any theory of ratiocination which does
not recognise this import of propositions cannot we may be sure be the
true one
applying this view of propositions to the two premisses of a syllogism we
obtain the following results the major premiss which as already
remarked is always universal asserts that all things which have a
certain attribute or attributes have or have not along with it a
certain other attribute or attributes the minor premiss asserts that
the thing or set of things which are the subject of that premiss have the
firstmentioned attribute and the conclusion is that they have or that
they have not the second thus in our former example
all men are mortal
socrates is a man
therefore
socrates is mortal
the subject and predicate of the major premiss are connotative terms
denoting objects and connoting attributes the assertion in the major
premiss is that along with one of the two sets of attributes we always
find the other that the attributes connoted by man never exist unless
conjoined with the attribute called mortality the assertion in the minor
premiss is that the individual named socrates possesses the former
attributes and it is concluded that he possesses also the attribute
mortality or if both the premisses are general propositions as
all men are mortal
all kings are men
therefore
all kings are mortal
the minor premiss asserts that the attributes denoted by kingship only
exist in conjunction with those signified by the word man the major
asserts as before that the last mentioned attributes are never found
without the attribute of mortality the conclusion is that wherever the
attributes of kingship are found that of mortality is found also
if the major premiss were negative as no men are omnipotent it would
assert not that the attributes connoted by man never exist without but
that they never exist with those connoted by omnipotent from which
together with the minor premiss it is concluded that the same
incompatibility exists between the attribute omnipotence and those
constituting a king in a similar manner we might analyse any other
example of the syllogism
if we generalize this process and look out for the principle or law
involved in every such inference and presupposed in every syllogism the
propositions of which are anything more than merely verbal we find not
the unmeaning dictum de omni et nullo but a fundamental principle or
rather two principles strikingly resembling the axioms of mathematics
the first which is the principle of affirmative syllogisms is that
things which coexist with the same thing coexist with one another the
second is the principle of negative syllogisms and is to this effect
that a thing which coexists with another thing with which other a third
thing does not coexist is not coexistent with that third thing these
axioms manifestly relate to facts and not to conventions and one or
other of them is the ground of the legitimacy of every argument in which
facts and not conventions are the matter treated of
 4 it remains to translate this exposition of the syllogism from the one
into the other of the two languages in which we formerly remarked30 that
all propositions and of course therefore all combinations of
propositions might be expressed we observed that a proposition might be
considered in two different lights as a portion of our knowledge of
nature or as a memorandum for our guidance under the former or
speculative aspect an affirmative general proposition is an assertion of
a speculative truth viz that whatever has a certain attribute has a
certain other attribute under the other aspect it is to be regarded not
as a part of our knowledge but as an aid for our practical exigencies by
enabling us when we see or learn that an object possesses one of the two
attributes to infer that it possesses the other thus employing the first
attribute as a mark or evidence of the second thus regarded every
syllogism comes within the following general formula
attribute a is a mark of attribute b
a given object has the mark a
therefore
the given object has the attribute b
referred to this type the arguments which we have lately cited as
specimens of the syllogism will express themselves in the following
manner
the attributes of man are a mark of the attribute mortality
socrates has the attributes of man
therefore
socrates has the attribute mortality
and again
the attributes of man are a mark of the attribute mortality
the attributes of a king are a mark of the attributes of man
therefore
the attributes of a king are a mark of the attribute mortality
and lastly
the attributes of man are a mark of the absence of the attribute
omnipotence
the attributes of a king are a mark of the attributes of man
therefore
the attributes of a king are a mark of the absence of the attribute
signified by the word omnipotent or are evidence of the absence of
that attribute
to correspond with this alteration in the form of the syllogisms the
axioms on which the syllogistic process is founded must undergo a
corresponding transformation in this altered phraseology both those
axioms may be brought under one general expression namely that whatever
possesses any mark possesses that which it is a mark of or when the
minor premiss as well as the major is universal we may state it thus
whatever is a mark of any mark is a mark of that which this last is a
mark of to trace the identity of these axioms with those previously laid
down may be left to the intelligent reader we shall find as we proceed
the great convenience of the phraseology into which we have last thrown
them and which is better adapted than any i am acquainted with to
express with precision and force what is aimed at and actually
accomplished in every case of the ascertainment of a truth by
ratiocination
chapter iii of the functions and logical value of the syllogism
 1 we have shown what is the real nature of the truths with which the
syllogism is conversant in contradistinction to the more superficial
manner in which their import is conceived in the common theory and what
are the fundamental axioms on which its probative force or conclusiveness
depends we have now to inquire whether the syllogistic process that of
reasoning from generals to particulars is or is not a process of
inference a progress from the known to the unknown a means of coming to
a knowledge of something which we did not know before
logicians have been remarkably unanimous in their mode of answering this
question it is universally allowed that a syllogism is vicious if there
be anything more in the conclusion than was assumed in the premisses but
this is in fact to say that nothing ever was or can be proved by
syllogism which was not known or assumed to be known before is
ratiocination then not a process of inference and is the syllogism to
which the word reasoning has so often been represented to be exclusively
appropriate not really entitled to be called reasoning at all this seems
an inevitable consequence of the doctrine admitted by all writers on the
subject that a syllogism can prove no more than is involved in the
premisses yet the acknowledgment so explicitly made has not prevented
one set of writers from continuing to represent the syllogism as the
correct analysis of what the mind actually performs in discovering and
proving the larger half of the truths whether of science or of daily
life which we believe while those who have avoided this inconsistency
and followed out the general theorem respecting the logical value of the
syllogism to its legitimate corollary have been led to impute uselessness
and frivolity to the syllogistic theory itself on the ground of the
petitio principii which they allege to be inherent in every syllogism
as i believe both these opinions to be fundamentally erroneous i must
request the attention of the reader to certain considerations without
which any just appreciation of the true character of the syllogism and
the functions it performs in philosophy appears to me impossible but
which seem to have been either overlooked or insufficiently adverted to
both by the defenders of the syllogistic theory and by its assailants
 2 it must be granted that in every syllogism considered as an argument
to prove the conclusion there is a petitio principii when we say
all men are mortal
socrates is a man
therefore
socrates is mortal
it is unanswerably urged by the adversaries of the syllogistic theory
that the proposition socrates is mortal is presupposed in the more
general assumption all men are mortal that we cannot be assured of the
mortality of all men unless we are already certain of the mortality of
every individual man that if it be still doubtful whether socrates or
any other individual you choose to name be mortal or not the same degree
of uncertainty must hang over the assertion all men are mortal that the
general principle instead of being given as evidence of the particular
case cannot itself be taken for true without exception until every
shadow of doubt which could affect any case comprised with it is
dispelled by evidence aliund and then what remains for the syllogism
to prove that in short no reasoning from generals to particulars can
as such prove anything since from a general principle you cannot infer
any particulars but those which the principle itself assumes as known
this doctrine appears to me irrefragable and if logicians though unable
to dispute it have usually exhibited a strong disposition to explain it
away this was not because they could discover any flaw in the argument
itself but because the contrary opinion seemed to rest on arguments
equally indisputable in the syllogism last referred to for example or
in any of those which we previously constructed is it not evident that
the conclusion may to the person to whom the syllogism is presented be
actually and bon fide a new truth is it not matter of daily experience
that truths previously undreamt of facts which have not been and cannot
be directly observed are arrived at by way of general reasoning we
believe that the duke of wellington is mortal we do not know this by
direct observation since he is not dead if we were asked how this being
the case we know the duke to be mortal we should probably answer
because all men are so here therefore we arrive at the knowledge of a
truth not as yet susceptible of observation by a reasoning which admits
of being exhibited in the following syllogism
all men are mortal
the duke of wellington is a man
therefore
the duke of wellington is mortal
and since a large portion of our knowledge is thus acquired logicians
have persisted in representing the syllogism as a process of inference or
proof although none of them has cleared up the difficulty which arises
from the inconsistency between that assertion and the principle that if
there be anything in the conclusion which was not already asserted in the
premisses the argument is vicious for it is impossible to attach any
serious scientific value to such a mere salvo as the distinction drawn
between being involved by implication in the premisses and being
directly asserted in them when archbishop whately for example says31
that the object of reasoning is merely to expand and unfold the
assertions wrapt up as it were and implied in those with which we set
out and to bring a person to perceive and acknowledge the full force of
that which he has admitted he does not i think meet the real
difficulty requiring to be explained namely how it happens that a
science like geometry can be all wrapt up in a few definitions and
axioms nor does this defence of the syllogism differ much from what its
assailants urge against it as an accusation when they charge it with
being of no use except to those who seek to press the consequences of an
admission into which a person has been entrapped without having considered
and understood its full force when you admitted the major premiss you
asserted the conclusion but says archbishop whately you asserted it by
implication merely this however can here only mean that you asserted it
unconsciously that you did not know you were asserting it but if so
the difficulty revives in this shapeought you not to have known were you
warranted in asserting the general proposition without having satisfied
yourself of the truth of everything which it fairly includes and if not
what then is the syllogistic art but a contrivance for catching you in a
trap and holding you fast in it32
 3 from this difficulty there appears to be but one issue the
proposition that the duke of wellington is mortal is evidently an
inference it is got at as a conclusion from something else but do we in
reality conclude it from the proposition all men are mortal i answer
no
the error committed is i conceive that of overlooking the distinction
between the two parts of the process of philosophizing the inferring
part and the registering part and ascribing to the latter the functions
of the former the mistake is that of referring a person to his own notes
for the origin of his knowledge if a person is asked a question and is
at the moment unable to answer it he may refresh his memory by turning to
a memorandum which he carries about with him but if he were asked how
the fact came to his knowledge he would scarcely answer because it was
set down in his notebook unless the book was written like the koran
with a quill from the wing of the angel gabriel
assuming that the proposition the duke of wellington is mortal is
immediately an inference from the proposition all men are mortal whence
do we derive our knowledge of that general truth of course from
observation now all which man can observe are individual cases from
these all general truths must be drawn and into these they may be again
resolved for a general truth is but an aggregate of particular truths a
comprehensive expression by which an indefinite number of individual
facts are affirmed or denied at once but a general proposition is not
merely a compendious form for recording and preserving in the memory a
number of particular facts all of which have been observed
generalization is not a process of mere naming it is also a process of
inference from instances which we have observed we feel warranted in
concluding that what we found true in those instances holds in all
similar ones past present and future however numerous they may be we
then by that valuable contrivance of language which enables us to speak
of many as if they were one record all that we have observed together
with all that we infer from our observations in one concise expression
and have thus only one proposition instead of an endless number to
remember or to communicate the results of many observations and
inferences and instructions for making innumerable inferences in
unforeseen cases are compressed into one short sentence
when therefore we conclude from the death of john and thomas and every
other person we ever heard of in whose case the experiment had been fairly
tried that the duke of wellington is mortal like the rest we may
indeed pass through the generalization all men are mortal as an
intermediate stage but it is not in the latter half of the process the
descent from all men to the duke of wellington that the inference
resides the inference is finished when we have asserted that all men are
mortal what remains to be performed afterwards is merely decyphering our
own notes
archbishop whately has contended that syllogising or reasoning from
generals to particulars is not agreeably to the vulgar idea a peculiar
mode of reasoning but the philosophical analysis of the mode in which
all men reason and must do so if they reason at all with the deference
due to so high an authority i cannot help thinking that the vulgar notion
is in this case the more correct if from our experience of john
thomas c who once were living but are now dead we are entitled to
conclude that all human beings are mortal we might surely without any
logical inconsequence have concluded at once from those instances that
the duke of wellington is mortal the mortality of john thomas and
company is after all the whole evidence we have for the mortality of the
duke of wellington not one iota is added to the proof by interpolating a
general proposition since the individual cases are all the evidence we
can possess evidence which no logical form into which we choose to throw
it can make greater than it is and since that evidence is either
sufficient in itself or if insufficient for the one purpose cannot be
sufficient for the other i am unable to see why we should be forbidden to
take the shortest cut from these sufficient premisses to the conclusion
and constrained to travel the high priori road by the arbitrary fiat of
logicians i cannot perceive why it should be impossible to journey from
one place to another unless we march up a hill and then march down
again it may be the safest road and there may be a resting place at the
top of the hill affording a commanding view of the surrounding country
but for the mere purpose of arriving at our journeys end our taking that
road is perfectly optional it is a question of time trouble and danger
not only may we reason from particulars to particulars without passing
through generals but we perpetually do so reason all our earliest
inferences are of this nature from the first dawn of intelligence we draw
inferences but years elapse before we learn the use of general language
the child who having burnt his fingers avoids to thrust them again into
the fire has reasoned or inferred though he has never thought of the
general maxim fire burns he knows from memory that he has been burnt
and on this evidence believes when he sees a candle that if he puts his
finger into the flame of it he will be burnt again he believes this in
every case which happens to arise but without looking in each instance
beyond the present case he is not generalizing he is inferring a
particular from particulars in the same way also brutes reason there
is no ground for attributing to any of the lower animals the use of signs
of such a nature as to render general propositions possible but those
animals profit by experience and avoid what they have found to cause them
pain in the same manner though not always with the same skill as a
human creature not only the burnt child but the burnt dog dreads the
fire
i believe that in point of fact when drawing inferences from our
personal experience and not from maxims handed down to us by books or
tradition we much oftener conclude from particulars to particulars
directly than through the intermediate agency of any general proposition
we are constantly reasoning from ourselves to other people or from one
person to another without giving ourselves the trouble to erect our
observations into general maxims of human or external nature when we
conclude that some person will on some given occasion feel or act so and
so we sometimes judge from an enlarged consideration of the manner in
which human beings in general or persons of some particular character
are accustomed to feel and act but much oftener from having known the
feelings and conduct of the same person in some previous instance or from
considering how we should feel or act ourselves it is not only the
village matron who when called to a consultation upon the case of a
neighbours child pronounces on the evil and its remedy simply on the
recollection and authority of what she accounts the similar case of her
lucy we all where we have no definite maxims to steer by guide
ourselves in the same way and if we have an extensive experience and
retain its impressions strongly we may acquire in this manner a very
considerable power of accurate judgment which we may be utterly incapable
of justifying or of communicating to others among the higher order of
practical intellects there have been many of whom it was remarked how
admirably they suited their means to their ends without being able to
give any sufficient reasons for what they did and applied or seemed to
apply recondite principles which they were wholly unable to state this
is a natural consequence of having a mind stored with appropriate
particulars and having been long accustomed to reason at once from these
to fresh particulars without practising the habit of stating to oneself
or to others the corresponding general propositions an old warrior on a
rapid glance at the outlines of the ground is able at once to give the
necessary orders for a skilful arrangement of his troops though if he has
received little theoretical instruction and has seldom been called upon
to answer to other people for his conduct he may never have had in his
mind a single general theorem respecting the relation between ground and
array but his experience of encampments in circumstances more or less
similar has left a number of vivid unexpressed ungeneralized analogies
in his mind the most appropriate of which instantly suggesting itself
determines him to a judicious arrangement
the skill of an uneducated person in the use of weapons or of tools is
of a precisely similar nature the savage who executes unerringly the
exact throw which brings down his game or his enemy in the manner most
suited to his purpose under the operation of all the conditions
necessarily involved the weight and form of the weapon the direction and
distance of the object the action of the wind c owes this power to a
long series of previous experiments the results of which he certainly
never framed into any verbal theorems or rules the same thing may
generally be said of any other extraordinary manual dexterity not long
ago a scotch manufacturer procured from england at a high rate of wages
a working dyer famous for producing very fine colours with the view of
teaching to his other workmen the same skill the workman came but his
mode of proportioning the ingredients in which lay the secret of the
effects he produced was by taking them up in handfuls while the common
method was to weigh them the manufacturer sought to make him turn his
handling system into an equivalent weighing system that the general
principle of his peculiar mode of proceeding might be ascertained this
however the man found himself quite unable to do and therefore could
impart his skill to nobody he had from the individual cases of his own
experience established a connexion in his mind between fine effects of
colour and tactual perceptions in handling his dyeing materials and from
these perceptions he could in any particular case infer the means to be
employed and the effects which would be produced but could not put
others in possession of the grounds on which he proceeded from having
never generalized them in his own mind or expressed them in language
almost every one knows lord mansfields advice to a man of practical good
sense who being appointed governor of a colony had to preside in its
court of justice without previous judicial practice or legal education
the advice was to give his decision boldly for it would probably be
right but never to venture on assigning reasons for they would almost
infallibly be wrong in cases like this which are of no uncommon
occurrence it would be absurd to suppose that the bad reason was the
source of the good decision lord mansfield knew that if any reason were
assigned it would be necessarily an afterthought the judge being in
fact guided by impressions from past experience without the circuitous
process of framing general principles from them and that if he attempted
to frame any such he would assuredly fail lord mansfield however would
not have doubted that a man of equal experience who had also a mind
stored with general propositions derived by legitimate induction from that
experience would have been greatly preferable as a judge to one however
sagacious who could not be trusted with the explanation and justification
of his own judgments the cases of men of talent performing wonderful
things they know not how are examples of the rudest and most spontaneous
form of the operations of superior minds it is a defect in them and
often a source of errors not to have generalized as they went on but
generalization though a help the most important indeed of all helps is
not an essential
even the scientifically instructed who possess in the form of general
propositions a systematic record of the results of the experience of
mankind need not always revert to those general propositions in order to
apply that experience to a new case it is justly remarked by dugald
stewart that though our reasonings in mathematics depend entirely on the
axioms it is by no means necessary to our seeing the conclusiveness of
the proof that the axioms should be expressly adverted to when it is
inferred that a b is equal to c d because each of them is equal to e f
the most uncultivated understanding as soon as the propositions were
understood would assent to the inference without having ever heard of
the general truth that things which are equal to the same thing are equal
to one another this remark of stewart consistently followed out goes
to the root as i conceive of the philosophy of ratiocination and it is
to be regretted that he himself stopt short at a much more limited
application of it he saw that the general propositions on which a
reasoning is said to depend may in certain cases be altogether omitted
without impairing its probative force but he imagined this to be a
peculiarity belonging to axioms and argued from it that axioms are not
the foundations or first principles of geometry from which all the other
truths of the science are synthetically deduced as the laws of motion and
of the composition of forces in dynamics the equal mobility of fluids in
hydrostatics the laws of reflection and refraction in optics are the
first principles of those sciences but are merely necessary assumptions
selfevident indeed and the denial of which would annihilate all
demonstration but from which as premisses nothing can be demonstrated
in the present as in many other instances this thoughtful and elegant
writer has perceived an important truth but only by halves finding in
the case of geometrical axioms that general names have not any talismanic
virtue for conjuring new truths out of the pit of darkness and not seeing
that this is equally true in every other case of generalization he
contended that axioms are in their nature barren of consequences and that
the really fruitful truths the real first principles of geometry are the
definitions that the definition for example of the circle is to the
properties of the circle what the laws of equilibrium and of the pressure
of the atmosphere are to the rise of the mercury in the torricellian tube
yet all that he had asserted respecting the function to which the axioms
are confined in the demonstrations of geometry holds equally true of the
definitions every demonstration in euclid might be carried on without
them this is apparent from the ordinary process of proving a proposition
of geometry by means of a diagram what assumption in fact do we set out
from to demonstrate by a diagram any of the properties of the circle not
that in all circles the radii are equal but only that they are so in the
circle abc as our warrant for assuming this we appeal it is true to
the definition of a circle in general but it is only necessary that the
assumption be granted in the case of the particular circle supposed from
this which is not a general but a singular proposition combined with
other propositions of a similar kind some of which when generalized are
called definitions and others axioms we prove that a certain conclusion
is true not of all circles but of the particular circle abc or at least
would be so if the facts precisely accorded with our assumptions the
enunciation as it is called that is the general theorem which stands at
the head of the demonstration is not the proposition actually
demonstrated one instance only is demonstrated but the process by which
this is done is a process which when we consider its nature we perceive
might be exactly copied in an indefinite number of other instances in
every instance which conforms to certain conditions the contrivance of
general language furnishing us with terms which connote these conditions
we are able to assert this indefinite multitude of truths in a single
expression and this expression is the general theorem by dropping the
use of diagrams and substituting in the demonstrations general phrases
for the letters of the alphabet we might prove the general theorem
directly that is we might demonstrate all the cases at once and to do
this we must of course employ as our premisses the axioms and
definitions in their general form but this only means that if we can
prove an individual conclusion by assuming an individual fact then in
whatever case we are warranted in making an exactly similar assumption we
may draw an exactly similar conclusion the definition is a sort of notice
to ourselves and others what assumptions we think ourselves entitled to
make and so in all cases the general propositions whether called
definitions axioms or laws of nature which we lay down at the beginning
of our reasonings are merely abridged statements in a kind of
shorthand of the particular facts which as occasion arises we either
think we may proceed on as proved or intend to assume in any one
demonstration it is enough if we assume for a particular case suitably
selected what by the statement of the definition or principle we announce
that we intend to assume in all cases which may arise the definition of
the circle therefore is to one of euclids demonstrations exactly what
according to stewart the axioms are that is the demonstration does not
depend on it but yet if we deny it the demonstration fails the proof
does not rest on the general assumption but on a similar assumption
confined to the particular case that case however being chosen as a
specimen or paradigm of the whole class of cases included in the theorem
there can be no ground for making the assumption in that case which does
not exist in every other and if you deny the assumption as a general
truth you deny the right to make it in the particular instance
there are undoubtedly the most ample reasons for stating both the
principles and the theorems in their general form and these will be
explained presently so far as explanation is requisite but that
unpractised learners even in making use of one theorem to demonstrate
another reason rather from particular to particular than from the general
proposition is manifest from the difficulty they find in applying a
theorem to a case in which the configuration of the diagram is extremely
unlike that of the diagram by which the original theorem was demonstrated
a difficulty which except in cases of unusual mental power long practice
can alone remove and removes chiefly by rendering us familiar with all
the configurations consistent with the general conditions of the theorem
 4 from the considerations now adduced the following conclusions seem
to be established all inference is from particulars to particulars
general propositions are merely registers of such inferences already made
and short formul for making more the major premiss of a syllogism
consequently is a formula of this description and the conclusion is not
an inference drawn from the formula but an inference drawn according
to the formula the real logical antecedent or premisses being the
particular facts from which the general proposition was collected by
induction those facts and the individual instances which supplied them
may have been forgotten but a record remains not indeed descriptive of
the facts themselves but showing how those cases may be distinguished
respecting which the facts when known were considered to warrant a given
inference according to the indications of this record we draw our
conclusion which is to all intents and purposes a conclusion from the
forgotten facts for this it is essential that we should read the record
correctly and the rules of the syllogism are a set of precautions to
ensure our doing so
this view of the functions of the syllogism is confirmed by the
consideration of precisely those cases which might be expected to be least
favourable to it namely those in which ratiocination is independent of
any previous induction we have already observed that the syllogism in
the ordinary course of our reasoning is only the latter half of the
process of travelling from premisses to a conclusion there are however
some peculiar cases in which it is the whole process particulars alone
are capable of being subjected to observation and all knowledge which is
derived from observation begins therefore of necessity in particulars
but our knowledge may in cases of a certain description be conceived as
coming to us from other sources than observation it may present itself as
coming from testimony which on the occasion and for the purpose in hand
is accepted as of an authoritative character and the information thus
communicated may be conceived to comprise not only particular facts but
general propositions as when a scientific doctrine is accepted without
examination on the authority of writers or the generalization may not be
in the ordinary sense an assertion at all but a command a law not in
the philosophical but in the moral and political sense of the term an
expression of the desire of a superior that we or any number of other
persons shall conform our conduct to certain general instructions so far
as this asserts a fact namely a volition of the legislator that fact is
an individual fact and the proposition therefore is not a general
proposition but the description therein contained of the conduct which it
is the will of the legislator that his subjects should observe is
general the proposition asserts not that all men are anything but
that all men shall do something
in both these cases the generalities are the original data and the
particulars are elicited from them by a process which correctly resolves
itself into a series of syllogisms the real nature however of the
supposed deductive process is evident enough the only point to be
determined is whether the authority which declared the general
proposition intended to include this case in it and whether the
legislator intended his command to apply to the present case among others
or not this is ascertained by examining whether the case possesses the
marks by which as those authorities have signified the cases which they
meant to certify or to influence may be known the object of the inquiry
is to make out the witnesss or the legislators intention through the
indication given by their words this is a question as the germans
express it of hermeneutics the operation is not a process of inference
but a process of interpretation
in this last phrase we have obtained an expression which appears to me to
characterize more aptly than any other the functions of the syllogism in
all cases when the premisses are given by authority the function of
reasoning is to ascertain the testimony of a witness or the will of a
legislator by interpreting the signs in which the one has intimated his
assertion and the other his command in like manner when the premisses
are derived from observation the function of reasoning is to ascertain
what we or our predecessors formerly thought might be inferred from the
observed facts and to do this by interpreting a memorandum of ours or of
theirs the memorandum reminds us that from evidence more or less
carefully weighed it formerly appeared that a certain attribute might be
inferred wherever we perceive a certain mark the proposition all men are
mortal for instance shows that we have had experience from which we
thought it followed that the attributes connoted by the term man are a
mark of mortality but when we conclude that the duke of wellington is
mortal we do not infer this from the memorandum but from the former
experience all that we infer from the memorandum is our own previous
belief or that of those who transmitted to us the proposition
concerning the inferences which that former experience would warrant
this view of the nature of the syllogism renders consistent and
intelligible what otherwise remains obscure and confused in the theory of
archbishop whately and other enlightened defenders of the syllogistic
doctrine respecting the limits to which its functions are confined they
affirm in as explicit terms as can be used that the sole office of
general reasoning is to prevent inconsistency in our opinions to prevent
us from assenting to anything the truth of which would contradict
something to which we had previously on good grounds given our assent and
they tell us that the sole ground which a syllogism affords for assenting
to the conclusion is that the supposition of its being false combined
with the supposition that the premisses are true would lead to a
contradiction in terms now this would be but a lame account of the real
grounds which we have for believing the facts which we learn from
reasoning in contradistinction to observation the true reason why we
believe that the duke of wellington will die is that his fathers and our
fathers and all other persons who were cotemporary with them have died
those facts are the real premisses of the reasoning but we are not led to
infer the conclusion from those premisses by the necessity of avoiding
any verbal inconsistency there is no contradiction in supposing that all
those persons have died and that the duke of wellington may
notwithstanding live for ever but there would be a contradiction if we
first on the ground of those same premisses made a general assertion
including and covering the case of the duke of wellington and then
refused to stand to it in the individual case there is an inconsistency
to be avoided between the memorandum we make of the inferences which may
be justly drawn in future cases and the inferences we actually draw in
those cases when they arise with this view we interpret our own formula
precisely as a judge interprets a law in order that we may avoid drawing
any inferences not conformable to our former intention as a judge avoids
giving any decision not conformable to the legislators intention the
rules for this interpretation are the rules of the syllogism and its sole
purpose is to maintain consistency between the conclusions we draw in
every particular case and the previous general directions for drawing
them whether those general directions were framed by ourselves as the
result of induction or were received by us from an authority competent to
give them
 5 in the above observations it has i think been clearly shown that
although there is always a process of reasoning or inference where a
syllogism is used the syllogism is not a correct analysis of that process
of reasoning or inference which is on the contrary when not a mere
inference from testimony an inference from particulars to particulars
authorized by a previous inference from particulars to generals and
substantially the same with it of the nature therefore of induction
but while these conclusions appear to me undeniable i must yet enter a
protest as strong as that of archbishop whately himself against the
doctrine that the syllogistic art is useless for the purposes of
reasoning the reasoning lies in the act of generalization not in
interpreting the record of that act but the syllogistic form is an
indispensable collateral security for the correctness of the
generalization itself
it has already been seen that if we have a collection of particulars
sufficient for grounding an induction we need not frame a general
proposition we may reason at once from those particulars to other
particulars but it is to be remarked withal that whenever from a set of
particular cases we can legitimately draw any inference we may
legitimately make our inference a general one if from observation and
experiment we can conclude to one new case so may we to an indefinite
number if that which has held true in our past experience will therefore
hold in time to come it will hold not merely in some individual case but
in all cases of a given description every induction therefore which
suffices to prove one fact proves an indefinite multitude of facts the
experience which justifies a single prediction must be such as will
suffice to bear out a general theorem this theorem it is extremely
important to ascertain and declare in its broadest form of generality
and thus to place before our minds in its full extent the whole of what
our evidence must prove if it proves anything
this throwing of the whole body of possible inferences from a given set of
particulars into one general expression operates as a security for their
being just inferences in more ways than one first the general principle
presents a larger object to the imagination than any of the singular
propositions which it contains a process of thought which leads to a
comprehensive generality is felt as of greater importance than one which
terminates in an insulated fact and the mind is even unconsciously led
to bestow greater attention upon the process and to weigh more carefully
the sufficiency of the experience appealed to for supporting the
inference grounded upon it there is another and a more important
advantage in reasoning from a course of individual observations to some
new and unobserved case which we are but imperfectly acquainted with or
we should not be inquiring into it and in which since we are inquiring
into it we probably feel a peculiar interest there is very little to
prevent us from giving way to negligence or to any bias which may affect
our wishes or our imagination and under that influence accepting
insufficient evidence as sufficient but if instead of concluding
straight to the particular case we place before ourselves an entire class
of factsthe whole contents of a general proposition every tittle of
which is legitimately inferrible from our premisses if that one
particular conclusion is so there is then a considerable likelihood that
if the premisses are insufficient and the general inference therefore
groundless it will comprise within it some fact or facts the reverse of
which we already know to be true and we shall thus discover the error in
our generalization by what the schoolmen termed a reductio ad
impossibile
thus if during the reign of marcus aurelius a subject of the roman
empire under the bias naturally given to the imagination and expectations
by the lives and characters of the antonines had been disposed to
conclude that commodus would be a just ruler supposing him to stop there
he might only have been undeceived by sad experience but if he reflected
that this conclusion could not be justifiable unless from the same
evidence he was also warranted in concluding some general proposition as
for instance that all roman emperors are just rulers he would
immediately have thought of nero domitian and other instances which
showing the falsity of the general conclusion and therefore the
insufficiency of the premisses would have warned him that those premisses
could not prove in the instance of commodus what they were inadequate to
prove in any collection of cases in which his was included
the advantage in judging whether any controverted inference is
legitimate of referring to a parallel case is universally acknowledged
but by ascending to the general proposition we bring under our view not
one parallel case only but all possible parallel cases at once all cases
to which the same set of evidentiary considerations are applicable
when therefore we argue from a number of known cases to another case
supposed to be analogous it is always possible and generally
advantageous to divert our argument into the circuitous channel of an
induction from those known cases to a general proposition and a
subsequent application of that general proposition to the unknown case
this second part of the operation which as before observed is
essentially a process of interpretation will be resolvable into a
syllogism or a series of syllogisms the majors of which will be general
propositions embracing whole classes of cases every one of which
propositions must be true in all its extent if the argument is
maintainable if therefore any fact fairly coming within the range of
one of these general propositions and consequently asserted by it is
known or suspected to be other than the proposition asserts it to be this
mode of stating the argument causes us to know or to suspect that the
original observations which are the real grounds of our conclusion are
not sufficient to support it and in proportion to the greater chance of
our detecting the inconclusiveness of our evidence will be the increased
reliance we are entitled to place in it if no such evidence of defect
shall appear
the value therefore of the syllogistic form and of the rules for using
it correctly does not consist in their being the form and the rules
according to which our reasonings are necessarily or even usually made
but in their furnishing us with a mode in which those reasonings may
always be represented and which is admirably calculated if they are
inconclusive to bring their inconclusiveness to light an induction from
particulars to generals followed by a syllogistic process from those
generals to other particulars is a form in which we may always state our
reasonings if we please it is not a form in which we must reason but
it is a form in which we may reason and into which it is indispensable
to throw our reasoning when there is any doubt of its validity though
when the case is familiar and little complicated and there is no
suspicion of error we may and do reason at once from the known
particular cases to unknown ones
these are the uses of syllogism as a mode of verifying any given
argument its ulterior uses as respects the general course of our
intellectual operations hardly require illustration being in fact the
acknowledged uses of general language they amount substantially to this
that the inductions may be made once for all a single careful
interrogation of experience may suffice and the result may be registered
in the form of a general proposition which is committed to memory or to
writing and from which afterwards we have only to syllogize the
particulars of our experiments may then be dismissed from the memory in
which it would be impossible to retain so great a multitude of details
while the knowledge which those details afforded for future use and which
would otherwise be lost as soon as the observations were forgotten or as
their record became too bulky for reference is retained in a commodious
and immediately available shape by means of general language
against this advantage is to be set the countervailing inconvenience that
inferences originally made on insufficient evidence become consecrated
and as it were hardened into general maxims and the mind cleaves to
them from habit after it has outgrown any liability to be misled by
similar fallacious appearances if they were now for the first time
presented but having forgotten the particulars it does not think of
revising its own former decision an inevitable drawback which however
considerable in itself forms evidently but a small deduction from the
immense advantages of general language
the use of the syllogism is in truth no other than the use of general
propositions in reasoning we can reason without them in simple and
obvious cases we habitually do so minds of great sagacity can do it in
cases not simple and obvious provided their experience supplies them with
instances essentially similar to every combination of circumstances likely
to arise but other minds or the same minds without the same preeminent
advantages of personal experience are quite helpless without the aid of
general propositions wherever the case presents the smallest
complication and if we made no general propositions few persons would
get much beyond those simple inferences which are drawn by the more
intelligent of the brutes though not necessary to reasoning general
propositions are necessary to any considerable progress in reasoning it
is therefore natural and indispensable to separate the process of
investigation into two parts and obtain general formul for determining
what inferences may be drawn before the occasion arises for drawing the
inferences the work of drawing them is then that of applying the formul
and the rules of syllogism are a system of securities for the correctness
of the application
 6 to complete the series of considerations connected with the
philosophical character of the syllogism it is requisite to consider
since the syllogism is not the universal type of the reasoning process
what is the real type this resolves itself into the question what is the
nature of the minor premiss and in what manner it contributes to
establish the conclusion for as to the major we now fully understand
that the place which it nominally occupies in our reasonings properly
belongs to the individual facts or observations of which it expresses the
general result the major itself being no real part of the argument but
an intermediate halting place for the mind interposed by an artifice of
language between the real premisses and the conclusion by way of a
security which it is in a most material degree for the correctness of
the process the minor however being an indispensable part of the
syllogistic expression of an argument without doubt either is or
corresponds to an equally indispensable part of the argument itself and
we have only to inquire what part
it is perhaps worth while to notice here a speculation of one of the
philosophers to whom mental science is most indebted but who though a
very penetrating was a very hasty thinker and whose want of due
circumspection rendered him fully as remarkable for what he did not see
as for what he saw i allude to dr thomas brown whose theory of
ratiocination is peculiar he saw the petitio principii which is
inherent in every syllogism if we consider the major to be itself the
evidence by which the conclusion is proved instead of being what in fact
it is an assertion of the existence of evidence sufficient to prove any
conclusion of a given description seeing this dr brown not only failed
to see the immense advantage in point of security for correctness which
is gained by interposing this step between the real evidence and the
conclusion but he thought it incumbent on him to strike out the major
altogether from the reasoning process without substituting anything else
and maintained that our reasonings consist only of the minor premiss and
the conclusion socrates is a man therefore socrates is mortal thus
actually suppressing as an unnecessary step in the argument the appeal
to former experience the absurdity of this was disguised from him by the
opinion he adopted that reasoning is merely analysing our own general
notions or abstract ideas and that the proposition socrates is mortal
is evolved from the proposition socrates is a man simply by recognising
the notion of mortality as already contained in the notion we form of a
man
after the explanations so fully entered into on the subject of
propositions much further discussion cannot be necessary to make the
radical error of this view of ratiocination apparent if the word man
connoted mortality if the meaning of mortal were involved in the
meaning of man we might undoubtedly evolve the conclusion from the
minor alone because the minor would have distinctly asserted it but if
as is in fact the case the word man does not connote mortality how does
it appear that in the mind of every person who admits socrates to be a
man the idea of man must include the idea of mortality dr brown could
not help seeing this difficulty and in order to avoid it was led
contrary to his intention to reestablish under another name that step
in the argument which corresponds to the major by affirming the necessity
of previously perceiving the relation between the idea of man and the
idea of mortal if the reasoner has not previously perceived this
relation he will not says dr brown infer because socrates is a man
that socrates is mortal but even this admission though amounting to a
surrender of the doctrine that an argument consists of the minor and the
conclusion alone will not save the remainder of dr browns theory the
failure of assent to the argument does not take place merely because the
reasoner for want of due analysis does not perceive that his idea of man
includes the idea of mortality it takes place much more commonly
because in his mind that relation between the two ideas has never existed
and in truth it never does exist except as the result of experience
consenting for the sake of the argument to discuss the question on a
supposition of which we have recognised the radical incorrectness namely
that the meaning of a proposition relates to the ideas of the things
spoken of and not to the things themselves i must yet observe that the
idea of man as an universal idea the common property of all rational
creatures cannot involve anything but what is strictly implied in the
name if any one includes in his own private idea of man as no doubt is
almost always the case some other attributes such for instance as
mortality he does so only as the consequence of experience after having
satisfied himself that all men possess that attribute so that whatever
the idea contains in any persons mind beyond what is included in the
conventional signification of the word has been added to it as the result
of assent to a proposition while dr browns theory requires us to
suppose on the contrary that assent to the proposition is produced by
evolving through an analytic process this very element out of the idea
this theory therefore may be considered as sufficiently refuted and the
minor premiss must be regarded as totally insufficient to prove the
conclusion except with the assistance of the major or of that which the
major represents namely the various singular propositions expressive of
the series of observations of which the generalization called the major
premiss is the result
in the argument then which proves that socrates is mortal one
indispensable part of the premisses will be as follows my father and my
fathers father a b c and an indefinite number of other persons were
mortal which is only an expression in different words of the observed
fact that they have died this is the major premiss divested of the
petitio principii and cut down to as much as is really known by direct
evidence
in order to connect this proposition with the conclusion socrates is
mortal the additional link necessary is such a proposition as the
following socrates resembles my father and my fathers father and the
other individuals specified this proposition we assert when we say that
socrates is a man by saying so we likewise assert in what respect he
resembles them namely in the attributes connoted by the word man and
from this we conclude that he further resembles them in the attribute
mortality
 7 we have thus obtained what we were seeking an universal type of the
reasoning process we find it resolvable in all cases into the following
elements certain individuals have a given attribute an individual or
individuals resemble the former in certain other attributes therefore
they resemble them also in the given attribute this type of ratiocination
does not claim like the syllogism to be conclusive from the mere form of
the expression nor can it possibly be so that one proposition does or
does not assert the very fact which was already asserted in another may
appear from the form of the expression that is from a comparison of the
language but when the two propositions assert facts which are bon fide
different whether the one fact proves the other or not can never appear
from the language but must depend on other considerations whether from
the attributes in which socrates resembles those men who have heretofore
died it is allowable to infer that he resembles them also in being
mortal is a question of induction and is to be decided by the principles
or canons which we shall hereafter recognise as tests of the correct
performance of that great mental operation
meanwhile however it is certain as before remarked that if this
inference can be drawn as to socrates it can be drawn as to all others
who resemble the observed individuals in the same attributes in which he
resembles them that is to express the thing concisely of all mankind
if therefore the argument be conclusive in the case of socrates we are
at liberty once for all to treat the possession of the attributes of man
as a mark or satisfactory evidence of the attribute of mortality this
we do by laying down the universal proposition all men are mortal and
interpreting this as occasion arises in its application to socrates and
others by this means we establish a very convenient division of the
entire logical operation into two steps first that of ascertaining what
attributes are marks of mortality and secondly whether any given
individuals possess those marks and it will generally be advisable in
our speculations on the reasoning process to consider this double
operation as in fact taking place and all reasoning as carried on in the
form into which it must necessarily be thrown to enable us to apply to it
any test of its correct performance
although therefore all processes of thought in which the ultimate
premisses are particulars whether we conclude from particulars to a
general formula or from particulars to other particulars according to
that formula are equally induction we shall yet conformably to usage
consider the name induction as more peculiarly belonging to the process of
establishing the general proposition and the remaining operation which
is substantially that of interpreting the general proposition we shall
call by its usual name deduction and we shall consider every process by
which anything is inferred respecting an unobserved case as consisting of
an induction followed by a deduction because although the process needs
not necessarily be carried on in this form it is always susceptible of
the form and must be thrown into it when assurance of scientific accuracy
is needed and desired
note supplementary to the preceding chapter
    this theory of the syllogism which has received the important
    adhesion of dr whewell33 has been controverted by a writer in
    the british quarterly review34 the doctrine being new
    discussion respecting it is extremely desirable to ensure that
    nothing essential to the question escapes observation and i
    shall therefore reply to this writers objections with somewhat
    more minuteness than their strength may seem to require
    the reviewer denies that there is a petitio principii in the
    syllogism or that the proposition all men are mortal asserts or
    assumes that socrates is mortal in support of this denial he
    argues that we may and in fact do admit the general proposition
    that all men are mortal without having particularly examined the
    case of socrates and even without knowing whether the individual
    so named is a man or not but this of course was never denied
    that we can and do draw conclusions concerning cases specifically
    unknown to us is the datum from which all who discuss this
    subject must set out the question is in what terms the evidence
    or ground on which we draw these conclusions may best be
    designatedwhether it is most correct to say that the unknown
    case is proved by known cases or that it is proved by a general
    proposition including both sets of cases the unknown and the
    known i contend for the former mode of expression i hold it an
    abuse of language to say that the proof that socrates is mortal
    is that all men are mortal turn it in what way we will this
    seems to me to be asserting that a thing is the proof of itself
    whoever pronounces the words all men are mortal has affirmed
    that socrates is mortal though he may never have heard of
    socrates for since socrates whether known to be so or not
    really is a man he is included in the words all men and in
    every assertion of which they are the subject if the reviewer
    does not see that there is a difficulty here i can only advise
    him to reconsider the subject until he does after which he will
    be a more competent judge of the success or failure of an attempt
    to remove the difficulty35 that he had reflected very little on
    the point when he wrote his remarks is shown by his oversight
    respecting the dictum de omni et nullo he acknowledges that
    this maxim as commonly expressedwhatever is true of a class is
    true of everything included in the class is a mere identical
    proposition since the class is nothing but the things included
    in it but he thinks this defect would be cured by wording the
    maxim thuswhatever is true of a class is true of everything
    which can be shown to be a member of the class as if a thing
    could be shown to be a member of the class without being one if
    a class means the sum of all the things included in the class the
    things which can be shown to be included in it are a part of
    these it is the sum of them too and the dictum is as much an
    identical proposition with respect to them as to the rest one
    would almost imagine that in the reviewers opinion things are
    not members of a class until they are called up publicly to take
    their place in itthat so long in fact as socrates is not known
    to be a man he is not a man and any assertion which can be
    made concerning men does not at all regard him nor is affected as
    to its truth or falsity by anything in which he is concerned
    the reviewer says that if the major premiss included the
    conclusion we should be able to affirm the conclusion without
    the intervention of the minor premiss but every one sees that
    that is impossible it does not follow because the major premiss
    contains the conclusion that the words themselves must show all
    the conclusions which it contains and which or evidence of
    which it presupposes the minor is equally required on both
    theories it is respecting the functions of the major premiss that
    the theories differ whether that premiss merely affirms the
    existence of proof or is itself part of the proofwhether the
    conclusion follows from the minor and major or from the minor and
    the particular instances which are the foundation of the major on
    either supposition it is necessary that the new case should be
    perceived to be one coming within the description of those to
    which the previous experience is applicable which is the purport
    of the minor premiss when we say that all men are mortal we make
    an assertion reaching beyond the sphere of our knowledge of
    individual cases and when a new individual socrates is brought
    within the field of our knowledge by means of the minor premiss
    we learn that we have already made an assertion respecting
    socrates without knowing it our own general formula is to that
    extent for the first time interpreted to us but according to
    the reviewers theory it is our having made the assertion which
    proves the assertion while i contend that the proof is not the
    assertion but the grounds of experience on which the assertion
    was made and by which it must be justified
    the reviewer comes much nearer to the gist of the question when
    he objects that the formula in which the major is left outa b
    c c were mortal therefore the duke of wellington is mortal
    does not express all the steps of the mental process but omits
    one of the most essential that which consists in recognising the
    cases a b c as sufficient evidence of what is true of the
    duke of wellington this recognition of the sufficiency of the
    induction he calls an inference and says that its result must
    be interpolated between the cases a b c and the case of the
    duke of wellington and that our final conclusion is from what is
    thus interpolated and not directly from the individual facts that
    a b c c were mortal on this it may first be observed that
    the formula does express all that takes place in ordinary
    unscientific reasoning mankind in general conclude at once from
    experience of death in past cases to the expectation of it in
    future without testing the experience by any principles of
    induction or passing through any general proposition this is not
    safe reasoning but it is reasoning and the syllogism therefore
    is not the universal type of reasoning but only a form in which
    it is desirable that we should reason but in the second place
    suppose that the enquirer does logically satisfy himself that the
    conditions of legitimate induction are realized in the cases a b
    c it is still obvious that if he knows the duke of wellington to
    be a man he is as much justified in concluding at once that the
    duke of wellington is mortal as in concluding that all men are
    mortal the general conclusion is not legitimate unless the
    particular one would be so too and in no sense intelligible to
    me can the particular conclusion be said to be drawn from the
    general one36 that the process of testing the sufficiency of an
    inductive inference is an operation of a general character i
    readily concede to the reviewer i had myself said as much by
    laying down as a fundamental law that whenever there is ground
    for drawing any conclusion at all from particular instances there
    is ground for a general conclusion but that this general
    conclusion should be actually drawn however useful cannot be an
    indispensable condition of the validity of the inference in the
    particular case a man gives away sixpence by the same power by
    which he disposes of his whole fortune but it is not necessary to
    the lawfulness of his doing the one that he should formally
    assert even to himself his right to do the other
    the reviewer has recourse for an example to syllogisms in the
    second figure though all are by a mere verbal transformation
    reducible to the first and asks where is the petitio
    principii in this syllogism every poet is a man of genius a b
    is not a man of genius therefore a b is not a poet it is true
    that in a syllogism of this particular type the petitio
    principii is disguised a b is not included in the terms every
    poet but the proposition every poet is a man of genius a very
    questionable proposition by the way cannot have been
    inductively proved unless the negative branch of the enquiry has
    been attended to as well as the positive unless it has been fully
    considered whether among persons who are not men of genius
    there are not some who ought to be termed poets and unless this
    has been determined in the negative therefore the case of a b
    has been decided by implication as much as the case of socrates
    in the first example the proposition every poet is a man of
    genius is confessedly quipollent with no one who is not a man
    of genius is a poet and in this the petitio principii as
    regards a b is no longer implied but express as in an ordinary
    syllogism of the first figure
    another critic has endeavoured to get rid of the petitio
    principii in the syllogism by substituting for the common form of
    expression the following formall known men were mortal
    socrates is a man therefore socrates is mortal to this however
    there is the fatal objection that the syllogism thus
    transformed does not prove the conclusion it wants not the form
    only but the substance of proof it is not merely because a thing
    is true in all known instances that it can be inferred to be
    true in any new instance many things may be true of all known men
    which would not be true of all men while on the other hand a
    thing may be superabundantly proved true of all men without
    having been ascertained by actual experience to be true of all
    known men or even of the hundredth part of them
chapter iv of trains of reasoning and deductive sciences
 1 in our analysis of the syllogism it appeared that the minor premiss
always affirms a resemblance between a new case and some cases previously
known while the major premiss asserts something which having been found
true of those known cases we consider ourselves warranted in holding true
of any other case resembling the former in certain given particulars
if all ratiocinations resembled as to the minor premiss the examples
which were exclusively employed in the preceding chapter if the
resemblance which that premiss asserts were obvious to the senses as in
the proposition socrates is a man or were at once ascertainable by
direct observation there would be no necessity for trains of reasoning
and deductive or ratiocinative sciences would not exist trains of
reasoning exist only for the sake of extending an induction founded as
all inductions must be on observed cases to other cases in which we not
only cannot directly observe what is to be proved but cannot directly
observe even the mark which is to prove it
 2 suppose the syllogism to be all cows ruminate the animal which is
before me is a cow therefore it ruminates the minor if true at all is
obviously so the only premiss the establishment of which requires any
anterior process of inquiry is the major and provided the induction of
which that premiss is the expression was correctly performed the
conclusion respecting the animal now present will be instantly drawn
because as soon as she is compared with the formula she will be
identified as being included in it but suppose the syllogism to be the
followingall arsenic is poisonous the substance which is before me is
arsenic therefore it is poisonous the truth of the minor may not here be
obvious at first sight it may not be intuitively evident but may itself
be known only by inference it may be the conclusion of another argument
which thrown into the syllogistic form would stand thuswhatever forms
a compound with hydrogen which yields a black precipitate with nitrate of
silver is arsenic the substance before me conforms to this condition
therefore it is arsenic to establish therefore the ultimate conclusion
the substance before me is poisonous requires a process which in order
to be syllogistically expressed stands in need of two syllogisms and we
have a train of reasoning
when however we thus add syllogism to syllogism we are really adding
induction to induction two separate inductions must have taken place to
render this chain of inference possible inductions founded probably on
different sets of individual instances but which converge in their
results so that the instance which is the subject of inquiry comes within
the range of them both the record of these inductions is contained in the
majors of the two syllogisms first we or others for us have examined
various objects which yielded under the given circumstances the given
precipitate and found that they possessed the properties connoted by the
word arsenic they were metallic volatile their vapour had a smell of
garlic and so forth next we or others for us have examined various
specimens which possessed this metallic and volatile character whose
vapour had this smell c and have invariably found that they were
poisonous the first observation we judge that we may extend to all
substances whatever which yield the precipitate the second to all
metallic and volatile substances resembling those we examined and
consequently not to those only which are seen to be such but to those
which are concluded to be such by the prior induction the substance
before us is only seen to come within one of these inductions but by
means of this one it is brought within the other we are still as
before concluding from particulars to particulars but we are now
concluding from particulars observed to other particulars which are not
as in the simple case seen to resemble them in the material points but
inferred to do so because resembling them in something else which we
have been led by quite a different set of instances to consider as a mark
of the former resemblance
this first example of a train of reasoning is still extremely simple the
series consisting of only two syllogisms the following is somewhat more
complicatedno government which earnestly seeks the good of its
subjects is likely to be overthrown some particular government earnestly
seeks the good of its subjects therefore it is not likely to be
overthrown the major premiss in this argument we shall suppose not to be
derived from considerations  priori but to be a generalization from
history which whether correct or erroneous must have been founded on
observation of governments concerning whose desire of the good of their
subjects there was no doubt it has been found or thought to be found
that these were not likely to be overthrown and it has been deemed that
those instances warranted an extension of the same predicate to any and
every government which resembles them in the attribute of desiring
earnestly the good of its subjects but does the government in question
thus resemble them this may be debated pro and con by many arguments
and must in any case be proved by another induction for we cannot
directly observe the sentiments and desires of the persons who carry on
the government to prove the minor therefore we require an argument in
this form every government which acts in a certain manner desires the
good of its subjects the supposed government acts in that particular
manner therefore it desires the good of its subjects but is it true that
the government acts in the manner supposed this minor also may require
proof still another induction as thuswhat is asserted by intelligent
and disinterested witnesses may be believed to be true that the
government acts in this manner is asserted by such witnesses therefore
it may be believed to be true the argument hence consists of three steps
having the evidence of our senses that the case of the government under
consideration resembles a number of former cases in the circumstance of
having something asserted respecting it by intelligent and disinterested
witnesses we infer first that as in those former instances so in this
instance the assertion is true secondly what was asserted of the
government being that it acts in a particular manner and other
governments or persons having been observed to act in the same manner the
government in question is brought into known resemblance with those other
governments or persons and since they were known to desire the good of
the people it is thereupon by a second induction inferred that the
particular government spoken of desires the good of the people this
brings that government into known resemblance with the other governments
which were thought likely to escape revolution and thence by a third
induction it is predicted that this particular government is also likely
to escape this is still reasoning from particulars to particulars but we
now reason to the new instance from three distinct sets of former
instances to one only of those sets of instances do we directly perceive
the new one to be similar but from that similarity we inductively infer
that it has the attribute by which it is assimilated to the next set and
brought within the corresponding induction after which by a repetition of
the same operation we infer it to be similar to the third set and hence a
third induction conducts us to the ultimate conclusion
 3 notwithstanding the superior complication of these examples compared
with those by which in the preceding chapter we illustrated the general
theory of reasoning every doctrine which we then laid down holds equally
true in these more intricate cases the successive general propositions
are not steps in the reasoning are not intermediate links in the chain of
inference between the particulars observed and those to which we apply
the observation if we had sufficiently capacious memories and a
sufficient power of maintaining order among a huge mass of details the
reasoning could go on without any general propositions they are mere
formul for inferring particulars from particulars the principle of
general reasoning is as before explained that if from observation of
certain known particulars what was seen to be true of them can be
inferred to be true of any others it may be inferred of all others which
are of a certain description and in order that we may never fail to draw
this conclusion in a new case when it can be drawn correctly and may
avoid drawing it when it cannot we determine once for all what are the
distinguishing marks by which such cases may be recognised the subsequent
process is merely that of identifying an object and ascertaining it to
have those marks whether we identify it by the very marks themselves or
by others which we have ascertained through another and a similar
process to be marks of those marks the real inference is always from
particulars to particulars from the observed instances to an unobserved
one but in drawing this inference we conform to a formula which we have
adopted for our guidance in such operations and which is a record of the
criteria by which we thought we had ascertained that we might distinguish
when the inference could and when it could not be drawn the real
premisses are the individual observations even though they may have been
forgotten or being the observations of others and not of ourselves may
to us never have been known but we have before us proof that we or
others once thought them sufficient for an induction and we have marks to
show whether any new case is one of those to which if then known the
induction would have been deemed to extend these marks we either
recognise at once or by the aid of other marks which by another previous
induction we collected to be marks of them even these marks of marks
may only be recognised through a third set of marks and we may have a
train of reasoning of any length to bring a new case within the scope of
an induction grounded on particulars its similarity to which is only
ascertained in this indirect manner
thus in the preceding example the ultimate inductive inference was that
a certain government was not likely to be overthrown this inference was
drawn according to a formula in which desire of the public good was set
down as a mark of not being likely to be overthrown a mark of this mark
was acting in a particular manner and a mark of acting in that manner
was being asserted to do so by intelligent and disinterested witnesses
this mark the government under discussion was recognised by the senses as
possessing hence that government fell within the last induction and by
it was brought within all the others the perceived resemblance of the
case to one set of observed particular cases brought it into known
resemblance with another set and that with a third
in the more complex branches of knowledge the deductions seldom consist
as in the examples hitherto exhibited of a single chain a a mark of
b b of c c of d therefore a a mark of d they consist to
carry on the same metaphor of several chains united at the extremity as
thus a a mark of d b of e c of f d e f of n therefore
a b c a mark of n suppose for example the following combination of
circumstances 1st rays of light impinging on a reflecting surface 2nd
that surface parabolic 3rd those rays parallel to each other and to the
axis of the surface it is to be proved that the concourse of these three
circumstances is a mark that the reflected rays will pass through the
focus of the parabolic surface now each of the three circumstances is
singly a mark of something material to the case rays of light impinging
on a reflecting surface are a mark that those rays will be reflected at
an angle equal to the angle of incidence the parabolic form of the
surface is a mark that from any point of it a line drawn to the focus
and a line parallel to the axis will make equal angles with the surface
and finally the parallelism of the rays to the axis is a mark that their
angle of incidence coincides with one of these equal angles the three
marks taken together are therefore a mark of all these three things
united but the three united are evidently a mark that the angle of
reflexion must coincide with the other of the two equal angles that
formed by a line drawn to the focus and this again by the fundamental
axiom concerning straight lines is a mark that the reflected rays pass
through the focus most chains of physical deduction are of this more
complicated type and even in mathematics such are abundant as in all
propositions where the hypothesis includes numerous conditions if a
circle be taken and if within that circle a point be taken not the
centre and if straight lines be drawn from that point to the
circumference then c
 4 the considerations now stated remove a serious difficulty from the
view we have taken of reasoning which view might otherwise have seemed
not easily reconcilable with the fact that there are deductive or
ratiocinative sciences it might seem to follow if all reasoning be
induction that the difficulties of philosophical investigation must lie
in the inductions exclusively and that when these were easy and
susceptible of no doubt or hesitation there could be no science or at
least no difficulties in science the existence for example of an
extensive science of mathematics requiring the highest scientific genius
in those who contributed to its creation and calling for a most continued
and vigorous exertion of intellect in order to appropriate it when
created may seem hard to be accounted for on the foregoing theory but
the considerations more recently adduced remove the mystery by showing
that even when the inductions themselves are obvious there may be much
difficulty in finding whether the particular case which is the subject of
inquiry comes within them and ample room for scientific ingenuity in so
combining various inductions as by means of one within which the case
evidently falls to bring it within others in which it cannot be directly
seen to be included
when the more obvious of the inductions which can be made in any science
from direct observations have been made and general formulas have been
framed determining the limits within which these inductions are
applicable as often as a new case can be at once seen to come within one
of the formulas the induction is applied to the new case and the
business is ended but new cases are continually arising which do not
obviously come within any formula whereby the question we want solved in
respect of them could be answered let us take an instance from geometry
and as it is taken only for illustration let the reader concede to us for
the present what we shall endeavour to prove in the next chapter that
the first principles of geometry are results of induction our example
shall be the fifth proposition of the first book of euclid the inquiry
is are the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle equal or unequal
the first thing to be considered is what inductions we have from which
we can infer equality or inequality for inferring equality we have the
following formulthings which being applied to each other coincide are
equals things which are equal to the same thing are equals a whole and
the sum of its parts are equals the sums of equal things are equals the
differences of equal things are equals there are no other formul to
prove equality for inferring inequality we have the followinga whole
and its parts are unequals the sums of equal things and unequal things
are unequals the differences of equal things and unequal things are
unequals in all eight formul the angles at the base of an isosceles
triangle do not obviously come within any of these the formul specify
certain marks of equality and of inequality but the angles cannot be
perceived intuitively to have any of those marks we can however examine
whether they have properties which in any other formul are set down as
marks of those marks on examination it appears that they have and we
ultimately succeed in bringing them within this formula the differences
of equal things are equal whence comes the difficulty in recognising
these angles as the differences of equal things because each of them is
the difference not of one pair only but of innumerable pairs of angles
and out of these we had to imagine and select two which could either be
intuitively perceived to be equals or possessed some of the marks of
equality set down in the various formul by an exercise of ingenuity
which on the part of the first inventor deserves to be regarded as
considerable two pairs of angles were hit upon which united these
requisites first it could be perceived intuitively that their
differences were the angles at the base and secondly they possessed one
of the marks of equality namely coincidence when applied to one another
this coincidence however was not perceived intuitively but inferred in
conformity to another formula
for greater clearness i subjoin an analysis of the demonstration euclid
it will be remembered demonstrates his fifth proposition by means of the
fourth this it is not allowable for us to do because we are undertaking
to trace deductive truths not to prior deductions but to their original
inductive foundation we must therefore use the premisses of the fourth
proposition instead of its conclusion and prove the fifth directly from
first principles to do so requires six formulas we presuppose an
equilateral triangle whose vertices are a d e with point b on the side
ad and point c on the side ae such that bc is parallel to de we must
begin as in euclid by prolonging the equal sides ab ac to equal
distances and joining the extremities be dc
first formula the sums of equals are equal
a d and a e are sums of equals by the supposition having that mark of
equality they are concluded by this formula to be equal
second formula equal straight lines being applied to one another
coincide
a c a b are within this formula by supposition a d a e have been
brought within it by the preceding step both these pairs of straight
lines have the property of equality which according to the second
formula is a mark that if applied to each other they will coincide
coinciding altogether means coinciding in every part and of course at
their extremities d e and b c
third formula straight lines having their extremities coincident
coincide
b e and c d have been brought within this formula by the preceding
induction they will therefore coincide
fourth formula angles having their sides coincident coincide
the third induction having shown that b e and c d coincide and the second
that a b a c coincide the angles a b e and a c d are thereby brought
within the fourth formula and accordingly coincide
fifth formula things which coincide are equal
the angles a b e and a c d are brought within this formula by the
induction immediately preceding this train of reasoning being also
applicable mutatis mutandis to the angles e b c d c b these also are
brought within the fifth formula and finally
sixth formula the differences of equals are equal
the angle a b c being the difference of a b e c b e and the angle a c b
being the difference of a c d d c b which have been proved to be equals
a b c and a c b are brought within the last formula by the whole of the
previous process
the difficulty here encountered is chiefly that of figuring to ourselves
the two angles at the base of the triangle a b c as remainders made by
cutting one pair of angles out of another while each pair shall be
corresponding angles of triangles which have two sides and the intervening
angle equal it is by this happy contrivance that so many different
inductions are brought to bear upon the same particular case and this not
being at all an obvious idea it may be seen from an example so near the
threshold of mathematics how much scope there may well be for scientific
dexterity in the higher branches of that and other sciences in order so
to combine a few simple inductions as to bring within each of them
innumerable cases which are not obviously included in it and how long
and numerous and complicated may be the processes necessary for bringing
the inductions together even when each induction may itself be very easy
and simple all the inductions involved in all geometry are comprised in
those simple ones the formul of which are the axioms and a few of the
socalled definitions the remainder of the science is made up of the
processes employed for bringing unforeseen cases within these inductions
or in syllogistic language for proving the minors necessary to complete
the syllogisms the majors being the definitions and axioms in those
definitions and axioms are laid down the whole of the marks by an artful
combination of which it has been found possible to discover and prove all
that is proved in geometry the marks being so few and the inductions
which furnish them being so obvious and familiar the connecting of
several of them together which constitutes deductions or trains of
reasoning forms the whole difficulty of the science and with a trifling
exception its whole bulk and hence geometry is a deductive science
 5 it will be seen hereafter that there are weighty scientific reasons
for giving to every science as much of the character of a deductive
science as possible for endeavouring to construct the science from the
fewest and the simplest possible inductions and to make these by any
combinations however complicated suffice for proving even such truths
relating to complex cases as could be proved if we chose by inductions
from specific experience every branch of natural philosophy was
originally experimental each generalization rested on a special
induction and was derived from its own distinct set of observations and
experiments from being sciences of pure experiment as the phrase is or
to speak more correctly sciences in which the reasonings mostly consist
of no more than one step and are expressed by single syllogisms all
these sciences have become to some extent and some of them in nearly the
whole of their extent sciences of pure reasoning whereby multitudes of
truths already known by induction from as many different sets of
experiments have come to be exhibited as deductions or corollaries from
inductive propositions of a simpler and more universal character thus
mechanics hydrostatics optics acoustics and thermology have
successively been rendered mathematical and astronomy was brought by
newton within the laws of general mechanics why it is that the
substitution of this circuitous mode of proceeding for a process
apparently much easier and more natural is held and justly to be the
greatest triumph of the investigation of nature we are not in this stage
of our inquiry prepared to examine but it is necessary to remark that
although by this progressive transformation all sciences tend to become
more and more deductive they are not therefore the less inductive every
step in the deduction is still an induction the opposition is not between
the terms deductive and inductive but between deductive and experimental
a science is experimental in proportion as every new case which presents
any peculiar features stands in need of a new set of observations and
experiments a fresh induction it is deductive in proportion as it can
draw conclusions respecting cases of a new kind by processes which bring
those cases under old inductions by ascertaining that cases which cannot
be observed to have the requisite marks have however marks of those
marks
we can now therefore perceive what is the generic distinction between
sciences which can be made deductive and those which must as yet remain
experimental the difference consists in our having been able or not yet
able to discover marks of marks if by our various inductions we have
been able to proceed no further than to such propositions as these a a
mark of b or a and b marks of one another c a mark of d or
c and d marks of one another without anything to connect a or b
with c or d we have a science of detached and mutually independent
generalizations such as these that acids redden vegetable blues and
that alkalies colour them green from neither of which propositions could
we directly or indirectly infer the other and a science so far as it
is composed of such propositions is purely experimental chemistry in
the present state of our knowledge has not yet thrown off this character
there are other sciences however of which the propositions are of this
kind a a mark of b b a mark of c c of d d of e c in
these sciences we can mount the ladder from a to e by a process of
ratiocination we can conclude that a is a mark of e and that every
object which has the mark a has the property e although perhaps we
never were able to observe a and e together and although even d
our only direct mark of e may be not perceptible in those objects but
only inferrible or varying the first metaphor we may be said to get from
a to e underground the marks b c d which indicate the route
must all be possessed somewhere by the objects concerning which we are
inquiring but they are below the surface a is the only mark that is
visible and by it we are able to trace in succession all the rest
 6 we can now understand how an experimental may transform itself into a
deductive science by the mere progress of experiment in an experimental
science the inductions as we have said lie detached as a a mark of
b c a mark of d e a mark of f and so on now a new set of
instances and a consequent new induction may at any time bridge over the
interval between two of these unconnected arches b for example may be
ascertained to be a mark of c which enables us thenceforth to prove
deductively that a is a mark of c or as sometimes happens some
comprehensive induction may raise an arch high in the air which bridges
over hosts of them at once b d f and all the rest turning out
to be marks of some one thing or of things between which a connexion has
already been traced as when newton discovered that the motions whether
regular or apparently anomalous of all the bodies of the solar system
each of which motions had been inferred by a separate logical operation
from separate marks were all marks of moving round a common centre with
a centripetal force varying directly as the mass and inversely as the
square of the distance from that centre this is the greatest example
which has yet occurred of the transformation at one stroke of a science
which was still to a great degree merely experimental into a deductive
science
transformations of the same nature but on a smaller scale continually
take place in the less advanced branches of physical knowledge without
enabling them to throw off the character of experimental sciences thus
with regard to the two unconnected propositions before cited namely
acids redden vegetable blues alkalies make them green it is remarked by
liebig that all blue colouring matters which are reddened by acids as
well as reciprocally all red colouring matters which are rendered blue
by alkalies contain nitrogen and it is quite possible that this
circumstance may one day furnish a bond of connexion between the two
propositions in question by showing that the antagonist action of acids
and alkalies in producing or destroying the colour blue is the result of
some one more general law although this connecting of detached
generalizations is so much gain it tends but little to give a deductive
character to any science as a whole because the new courses of
observation and experiment which thus enable us to connect together a few
general truths usually make known to us a still greater number of
unconnected new ones hence chemistry though similar extensions and
simplifications of its generalizations are continually taking place is
still in the main an experimental science and is likely so to continue
unless some comprehensive induction should be hereafter arrived at which
like newtons shall connect a vast number of the smaller known inductions
together and change the whole method of the science at once chemistry
has already one great generalization which though relating to one of the
subordinate aspects of chemical phenomena possesses within its limited
sphere this comprehensive character the principle of dalton called the
atomic theory or the doctrine of chemical equivalents which by enabling
us to a certain extent to foresee the proportions in which two substances
will combine before the experiment has been tried constitutes
undoubtedly a source of new chemical truths obtainable by deduction as
well as a connecting principle for all truths of the same description
previously obtained by experiment
 7 the discoveries which change the method of a science from
experimental to deductive mostly consist in establishing either by
deduction or by direct experiment that the varieties of a particular
phenomenon uniformly accompany the varieties of some other phenomenon
better known thus the science of sound which previously stood in the
lowest rank of merely experimental science became deductive when it was
proved by experiment that every variety of sound was consequent on and
therefore a mark of a distinct and definable variety of oscillatory
motion among the particles of the transmitting medium when this was
ascertained it followed that every relation of succession or coexistence
which obtained between phenomena of the more known class obtained also
between the phenomena which corresponded to them in the other class every
sound being a mark of a particular oscillatory motion became a mark of
everything which by the laws of dynamics was known to be inferrible from
that motion and everything which by those same laws was a mark of any
oscillatory motion among the particles of an elastic medium became a mark
of the corresponding sound and thus many truths not before suspected
concerning sound become deducible from the known laws of the propagation
of motion through an elastic medium while facts already empirically known
respecting sound become an indication of corresponding properties of
vibrating bodies previously undiscovered
but the grand agent for transforming experimental into deductive sciences
is the science of number the properties of numbers alone among all known
phenomena are in the most rigorous sense properties of all things
whatever all things are not coloured or ponderable or even extended
but all things are numerable and if we consider this science in its whole
extent from common arithmetic up to the calculus of variations the
truths already ascertained seem all but infinite and admit of indefinite
extension
these truths though affirmable of all things whatever of course apply to
them only in respect of their quantity but if it comes to be discovered
that variations of quality in any class of phenomena correspond regularly
to variations of quantity either in those same or in some other phenomena
every formula of mathematics applicable to quantities which vary in that
particular manner becomes a mark of a corresponding general truth
respecting the variations in quality which accompany them and the science
of quantity being as far as any science can be altogether deductive the
theory of that particular kind of qualities becomes to this extent
deductive likewise
the most striking instance in point which history affords though not an
example of an experimental science rendered deductive but of an
unparalleled extension given to the deductive process in a science which
was deductive already is the revolution in geometry which originated
with descartes and was completed by clairaut these great mathematicians
pointed out the importance of the fact that to every variety of position
in points direction in lines or form in curves or surfaces all of
which are qualities there corresponds a peculiar relation of quantity
between either two or three rectilineal coordinates insomuch that if the
law were known according to which those coordinates vary relatively to
one another every other geometrical property of the line or surface in
question whether relating to quantity or quality would be capable of
being inferred hence it followed that every geometrical question could be
solved if the corresponding algebraical one could and geometry received
an accession actual or potential of new truths corresponding to every
property of numbers which the progress of the calculus had brought or
might in future bring to light in the same general manner mechanics
astronomy and in a less degree every branch of natural philosophy
commonly so called have been made algebraical the varieties of physical
phenomena with which those sciences are conversant have been found to
answer to determinable varieties in the quantity of some circumstance or
other or at least to varieties of form or position for which
corresponding equations of quantity had already been or were susceptible
of being discovered by geometers
in these various transformations the propositions of the science of
number do but fulfil the function proper to all propositions forming a
train of reasoning viz that of enabling us to arrive in an indirect
method by marks of marks at such of the properties of objects as we
cannot directly ascertain or not so conveniently by experiment we
travel from a given visible or tangible fact through the truths of
numbers to the fact sought the given fact is a mark that a certain
relation subsists between the quantities of some of the elements
concerned while the fact sought presupposes a certain relation between
the quantities of some other elements now if these last quantities are
dependent in some known manner upon the former or vice versa we can
argue from the numerical relation between the one set of quantities to
determine that which subsists between the other set the theorems of the
calculus affording the intermediate links and thus one of the two
physical facts becomes a mark of the other by being a mark of a mark of a
mark of it
chapter v of demonstration and necessary truths
 1 if as laid down in the two preceding chapters the foundation of all
sciences even deductive or demonstrative sciences is induction if every
step in the ratiocinations even of geometry is an act of induction and if
a train of reasoning is but bringing many inductions to bear upon the same
subject of inquiry and drawing a case within one induction by means of
another wherein lies the peculiar certainty always ascribed to the
sciences which are entirely or almost entirely deductive why are they
called the exact sciences why are mathematical certainty and the
evidence of demonstration common phrases to express the very highest
degree of assurance attainable by reason why are mathematics by almost
all philosophers and by many even those branches of natural philosophy
which through the medium of mathematics have been converted into
deductive sciences considered to be independent of the evidence of
experience and observation and characterized as systems of necessary
truth
the answer i conceive to be that this character of necessity ascribed to
the truths of mathematics and even with some reservations to be
hereafter made the peculiar certainty attributed to them is an illusion
in order to sustain which it is necessary to suppose that those truths
relate to and express the properties of purely imaginary objects it is
acknowledged that the conclusions of geometry are deduced partly at
least from the socalled definitions and that those definitions are
assumed to be correct descriptions as far as they go of the objects with
which geometry is conversant now we have pointed out that from a
definition as such no proposition unless it be one concerning the
meaning of a word can ever follow and that what apparently follows from
a definition follows in reality from an implied assumption that there
exists a real thing conformable thereto this assumption in the case of
the definitions of geometry is false there exist no real things exactly
conformable to the definitions there exist no points without magnitude
no lines without breadth nor perfectly straight no circles with all
their radii exactly equal nor squares with all their angles perfectly
right it will perhaps be said that the assumption does not extend to the
actual but only to the possible existence of such things i answer that
according to any test we have of possibility they are not even possible
their existence so far as we can form any judgment would seem to be
inconsistent with the physical constitution of our planet at least if not
of the universe to get rid of this difficulty and at the same time to
save the credit of the supposed system of necessary truth it is customary
to say that the points lines circles and squares which are the subject
of geometry exist in our conceptions merely and are part of our minds
which minds by working on their own materials construct an  priori
science the evidence of which is purely mental and has nothing whatever
to do with outward experience by howsoever high authorities this doctrine
may have been sanctioned it appears to me psychologically incorrect the
points lines circles and squares which any one has in his mind are i
apprehend simply copies of the points lines circles and squares which
he has known in his experience our idea of a point i apprehend to be
simply our idea of the minimum visibile the smallest portion of surface
which we can see a line as defined by geometers is wholly
inconceivable we can reason about a line as if it had no breadth because
we have a power which is the foundation of all the control we can
exercise over the operations of our minds the power when a perception is
present to our senses or a conception to our intellects of attending
to a part only of that perception or conception instead of the whole but
we cannot conceive a line without breadth we can form no mental picture
of such a line all the lines which we have in our minds are lines
possessing breadth if any one doubts this we may refer him to his own
experience i much question if any one who fancies that he can conceive
what is called a mathematical line thinks so from the evidence of his
consciousness i suspect it is rather because he supposes that unless such
a conception were possible mathematics could not exist as a science a
supposition which there will be no difficulty in showing to be entirely
groundless
since then neither in nature nor in the human mind do there exist any
objects exactly corresponding to the definitions of geometry while yet
that science cannot be supposed to be conversant about nonentities
nothing remains but to consider geometry as conversant with such lines
angles and figures as really exist and the definitions as they are
called must be regarded as some of our first and most obvious
generalizations concerning those natural objects the correctness of those
generalizations as generalizations is without a flaw the equality of
all the radii of a circle is true of all circles so far as it is true of
any one but it is not exactly true of any circle it is only nearly true
so nearly that no error of any importance in practice will be incurred by
feigning it to be exactly true when we have occasion to extend these
inductions or their consequences to cases in which the error would be
appreciableto lines of perceptible breadth or thickness parallels which
deviate sensibly from equidistance and the likewe correct our
conclusions by combining with them a fresh set of propositions relating
to the aberration just as we also take in propositions relating to the
physical or chemical properties of the material if those properties
happen to introduce any modification into the result which they easily
may even with respect to figure and magnitude as in the case for
instance of expansion by heat so long however as there exists no
practical necessity for attending to any of the properties of the object
except its geometrical properties or to any of the natural irregularities
in those it is convenient to neglect the consideration of the other
properties and of the irregularities and to reason as if these did not
exist accordingly we formally announce in the definitions that we
intend to proceed on this plan but it is an error to suppose because we
resolve to confine our attention to a certain number of the properties of
an object that we therefore conceive or have an idea of the object
denuded of its other properties we are thinking all the time of
precisely such objects as we have seen and touched and with all the
properties which naturally belong to them but for scientific convenience
we feign them to be divested of all properties except those which are
material to our purpose and in regard to which we design to consider
them
the peculiar accuracy supposed to be characteristic of the first
principles of geometry thus appears to be fictitious the assertions on
which the reasonings of the science are founded do not any more than in
other sciences exactly correspond with the fact but we suppose that
they do so for the sake of tracing the consequences which follow from the
supposition the opinion of dugald stewart respecting the foundations of
geometry is i conceive substantially correct that it is built on
hypotheses that it owes to this alone the peculiar certainty supposed to
distinguish it and that in any science whatever by reasoning from a set
of hypotheses we may obtain a body of conclusions as certain as those of
geometry that is as strictly in accordance with the hypotheses and as
irresistibly compelling assent on condition that those hypotheses are
true
when therefore it is affirmed that the conclusions of geometry are
necessary truths the necessity consists in reality only in this that
they necessarily follow from the suppositions from which they are deduced
those suppositions are so far from being necessary that they are not even
true they purposely depart more or less widely from the truth the only
sense in which necessity can be ascribed to the conclusions of any
scientific investigation is that of necessarily following from some
assumption which by the conditions of the inquiry is not to be
questioned in this relation of course the derivative truths of every
deductive science must stand to the inductions or assumptions on which
the science is founded and which whether true or untrue certain or
doubtful in themselves are always supposed certain for the purposes of
the particular science and therefore the conclusions of all deductive
sciences were said by the ancients to be necessary propositions we have
observed already that to be predicated necessarily was characteristic of
the predicable proprium and that a proprium was any property of a thing
which could be deduced from its essence that is from the properties
included in its definition
 2 the important doctrine of dugald stewart which i have endeavoured to
enforce has been contested by dr whewell both in the dissertation
appended to his excellent mechanical euclid and in his more recent
elaborate work on the philosophy of the inductive sciences in which
last he also replies to an article in the edinburgh review ascribed to
a writer of great scientific eminence in which stewarts opinion was
defended against his former strictures the supposed refutation of stewart
consists in proving against him as has also been done in this work that
the premisses of geometry are not definitions but assumptions of the real
existence of things corresponding to those definitions this however is
doing little for dr whewells purpose for it is these very assumptions
which are asserted to be hypotheses and which he if he denies that
geometry is founded on hypotheses must show to be absolute truths all he
does however is to observe that they at any rate are not arbitrary
hypotheses that we should not be at liberty to substitute other
hypotheses for them that not only a definition to be admissible must
necessarily refer to and agree with some conception which we can
distinctly frame in our thoughts but that the straight lines for
instance which we define must be those by which angles are contained
those by which triangles are bounded those of which parallelism may be
predicated and the like37 and this is true but this has never been
contradicted those who say that the premisses of geometry are hypotheses
are not bound to maintain them to be hypotheses which have no relation
whatever to fact since an hypothesis framed for the purpose of scientific
inquiry must relate to something which has real existence for there can
be no science respecting nonentities it follows that any hypothesis we
make respecting an object to facilitate our study of it must not involve
anything which is distinctly false and repugnant to its real nature we
must not ascribe to the thing any property which it has not our liberty
extends only to suppressing some of those which it has under the
indispensable obligation of restoring them whenever and in as far as
their presence or absence would make any material difference in the truth
of our conclusions of this nature accordingly are the first principles
involved in the definitions of geometry in their positive part they are
observed facts it is only in their negative part that they are
hypothetical that the hypotheses should be of this particular character
is however no further necessary than inasmuch as no others could enable
us to deduce conclusions which with due corrections would be true of
real objects and in fact when our aim is only to illustrate truths and
not to investigate them we are not under any such restriction we might
suppose an imaginary animal and work out by deduction from the known
laws of physiology its natural history or an imaginary commonwealth and
from the elements composing it might argue what would be its fate and
the conclusions which we might thus draw from purely arbitrary hypotheses
might form a highly useful intellectual exercise but as they could only
teach us what would be the properties of objects which do not really
exist they would not constitute any addition to our knowledge of nature
while on the contrary if the hypothesis merely divests a real object of
some portion of its properties without clothing it in false ones the
conclusions will always express under known liability to correction
actual truth
 3 but although dr whewell has not shaken stewarts doctrine as to the
hypothetical character of that portion of the first principles of geometry
which are involved in the socalled definitions he has i conceive
greatly the advantage of stewart on another important point in the theory
of geometrical reasoning the necessity of admitting among those first
principles axioms as well as definitions some of the axioms of euclid
might no doubt be exhibited in the form of definitions or might be
deduced by reasoning from propositions similar to what are so called
thus if instead of the axiom magnitudes which can be made to coincide
are equal we introduce a definition equal magnitudes are those which
may be so applied to one another as to coincide the three axioms which
follow magnitudes which are equal to the same are equal to one
anotherif equals are added to equals the sums are equalif equals are
taken from equals the remainders are equal may be proved by an imaginary
superposition resembling that by which the fourth proposition of the
first book of euclid is demonstrated but although these and several
others may be struck out of the list of first principles because though
not requiring demonstration they are susceptible of it there will be
found in the list of axioms two or three fundamental truths not capable
of being demonstrated among which must be reckoned the proposition that
two straight lines cannot inclose a space or its equivalent straight
lines which coincide in two points coincide altogether and some property
of parallel lines other than that which constitutes their definition the
most suitable perhaps being that selected by professor playfair two
straight lines which intersect each other cannot both of them be parallel
to a third straight line38
the axioms as well those which are indemonstrable as those which admit of
being demonstrated differ from that other class of fundamental principles
which are involved in the definitions in this that they are true without
any mixture of hypothesis that things which are equal to the same thing
are equal to one another is as true of the lines and figures in nature
as it would be of the imaginary ones assumed in the definitions in this
respect however mathematics are only on a par with most other sciences
in almost all sciences there are some general propositions which are
exactly true while the greater part are only more or less distant
approximations to the truth thus in mechanics the first law of motion
the continuance of a movement once impressed until stopped or slackened
by some resisting force is true without qualification or error the
rotation of the earth in twentyfour hours of the same length as in our
time has gone on since the first accurate observations without the
increase or diminution of one second in all that period these are
inductions which require no fiction to make them be received as accurately
true but along with them there are others as for instance the
propositions respecting the figure of the earth which are but
approximations to the truth and in order to use them for the further
advancement of our knowledge we must feign that they are exactly true
though they really want something of being so
 4 it remains to inquire what is the ground of our belief in
axiomswhat is the evidence on which they rest i answer they are
experimental truths generalizations from observation the proposition
two straight lines cannot inclose a spaceor in other words two straight
lines which have once met do not meet again but continue to divergeis
an induction from the evidence of our senses
this opinion runs counter to a scientific prejudice of long standing and
great strength and there is probably no one proposition enunciated in
this work for which a more unfavourable reception is to be expected it
is however no new opinion and even if it were so would be entitled to
be judged not by its novelty but by the strength of the arguments by
which it can be supported i consider it very fortunate that so eminent a
champion of the contrary opinion as dr whewell has recently found
occasion for a most elaborate treatment of the whole theory of axioms in
attempting to construct the philosophy of the mathematical and physical
sciences on the basis of the doctrine against which i now contend whoever
is anxious that a discussion should go to the bottom of the subject must
rejoice to see the opposite side of the question worthily represented if
what is said by dr whewell in support of an opinion which he has made
the foundation of a systematic work can be shown not to be conclusive
enough will have been done without going further to seek stronger
arguments and a more powerful adversary
it is not necessary to show that the truths which we call axioms are
originally suggested by observation and that we should never have known
that two straight lines cannot inclose a space if we had never seen a
straight line thus much being admitted by dr whewell and by all in
recent times who have taken his view of the subject but they contend
that it is not experience which proves the axiom but that its truth is
perceived  priori by the constitution of the mind itself from the
first moment when the meaning of the proposition is apprehended and
without any necessity for verifying it by repeated trials as is requisite
in the case of truths really ascertained by observation
they cannot however but allow that the truth of the axiom two straight
lines cannot inclose a space even if evident independently of experience
is also evident from experience whether the axiom needs confirmation or
not it receives confirmation in almost every instant of our lives
since we cannot look at any two straight lines which intersect one
another without seeing that from that point they continue to diverge more
and more experimental proof crowds in upon us in such endless profusion
and without one instance in which there can be even a suspicion of an
exception to the rule that we should soon have a stronger ground for
believing the axiom even as an experimental truth than we have for
almost any of the general truths which we confessedly learn from the
evidence of our senses independently of  priori evidence we should
certainly believe it with an intensity of conviction far greater than we
accord to any ordinary physical truth and this too at a time of life much
earlier than that from which we date almost any part of our acquired
knowledge and much too early to admit of our retaining any recollection
of the history of our intellectual operations at that period where then
is the necessity for assuming that our recognition of these truths has a
different origin from the rest of our knowledge when its existence is
perfectly accounted for by supposing its origin to be the same when the
causes which produce belief in all other instances exist in this
instance and in a degree of strength as much superior to what exists in
other cases as the intensity of the belief itself is superior the burden
of proof lies on the advocates of the contrary opinion it is for them to
point out some fact inconsistent with the supposition that this part of
our knowledge of nature is derived from the same sources as every other
part
this for instance they would be able to do if they could prove
chronologically that we had the conviction at least practically so early
in infancy as to be anterior to those impressions on the senses upon
which on the other theory the conviction is founded this however
cannot be proved the point being too far back to be within the reach of
memory and too obscure for external observation the advocates of the 
priori theory are obliged to have recourse to other arguments these are
reducible to two which i shall endeavour to state as clearly and as
forcibly as possible
 5 in the first place it is said that if our assent to the proposition
that two straight lines cannot inclose a space were derived from the
senses we could only be convinced of its truth by actual trial that is
by seeing or feeling the straight lines whereas in fact it is seen to be
true by merely thinking of them that a stone thrown into water goes to
the bottom may be perceived by our senses but mere thinking of a stone
thrown into the water would never have led us to that conclusion not so
however with the axioms relating to straight lines if i could be made to
conceive what a straight line is without having seen one i should at
once recognise that two such lines cannot inclose a space intuition is
imaginary looking39 but experience must be real looking if we see a
property of straight lines to be true by merely fancying ourselves to be
looking at them the ground of our belief cannot be the senses or
experience it must be something mental
to this argument it might be added in the case of this particular axiom
for the assertion would not be true of all axioms that the evidence of
it from actual ocular inspection is not only unnecessary but
unattainable what says the axiom that two straight lines cannot
inclose a space that after having once intersected if they are prolonged
to infinity they do not meet but continue to diverge from one another
how can this in any single case be proved by actual observation we may
follow the lines to any distance we please but we cannot follow them to
infinity for aught our senses can testify they may immediately beyond
the farthest point to which we have traced them begin to approach and at
last meet unless therefore we had some other proof of the impossibility
than observation affords us we should have no ground for believing the
axiom at all
to these arguments which i trust i cannot be accused of understating a
satisfactory answer will i conceive be found if we advert to one of the
characteristic properties of geometrical formstheir capacity of being
painted in the imagination with a distinctness equal to reality in other
words the exact resemblance of our ideas of form to the sensations which
suggest them this in the first place enables us to make at least with
a little practice mental pictures of all possible combinations of lines
and angles which resemble the realities quite as well as any which we
could make on paper and in the next place makes those pictures just as
fit subjects of geometrical experimentation as the realities themselves
inasmuch as pictures if sufficiently accurate exhibit of course all the
properties which would be manifested by the realities at one given
instant and on simple inspection and in geometry we are concerned only
with such properties and not with that which pictures could not exhibit
the mutual action of bodies one upon another the foundations of geometry
would therefore be laid in direct experience even if the experiments
which in this case consist merely in attentive contemplation were
practised solely upon what we call our ideas that is upon the diagrams
in our minds and not upon outward objects for in all systems of
experimentation we take some objects to serve as representatives of all
which resemble them and in the present case the conditions which qualify
a real object to be the representative of its class are completely
fulfilled by an object existing only in our fancy without denying
therefore the possibility of satisfying ourselves that two straight lines
cannot inclose a space by merely thinking of straight lines without
actually looking at them i contend that we do not believe this truth on
the ground of the imaginary intuition simply but because we know that the
imaginary lines exactly resemble real ones and that we may conclude from
them to real ones with quite as much certainty as we could conclude from
one real line to another the conclusion therefore is still an induction
from observation and we should not be authorized to substitute
observation of the image in our mind for observation of the reality if
we had not learnt by longcontinued experience that the properties of the
reality are faithfully represented in the image just as we should be
scientifically warranted in describing an animal which we had never seen
from a picture made of it with a daguerreotype but not until we had
learnt by ample experience that observation of such a picture is
precisely equivalent to observation of the original
these considerations also remove the objection arising from the
impossibility of ocularly following the lines in their prolongation to
infinity for though in order actually to see that two given lines never
meet it would be necessary to follow them to infinity yet without doing
so we may know that if they ever do meet or if after diverging from one
another they begin again to approach this must take place not at an
infinite but at a finite distance supposing therefore such to be the
case we can transport ourselves thither in imagination and can frame a
mental image of the appearance which one or both of the lines must present
at that point which we may rely on as being precisely similar to the
reality now whether we fix our contemplation upon this imaginary
picture or call to mind the generalizations we have had occasion to make
from former ocular observation we learn by the evidence of experience
that a line which after diverging from another straight line begins to
approach to it produces the impression on our senses which we describe by
the expression a bent line not by the expression a straight
line40
 6 the first of the two arguments in support of the theory that axioms
are  priori truths having i think been sufficiently answered i
proceed to the second which is usually the most relied on axioms it is
asserted are conceived by us not only as true but as universally and
necessarily true now experience cannot possibly give to any proposition
this character i may have seen snow a hundred times and may have seen
that it was white but this cannot give me entire assurance even that all
snow is white much less that snow must be white however many
instances we may have observed of the truth of a proposition there is
nothing to assure us that the next case shall not be an exception to the
rule if it be strictly true that every ruminant animal yet known has
cloven hoofs we still cannot be sure that some creature will not
hereafter be discovered which has the first of these attributes without
having the other experience must always consist of a limited number of
observations and however numerous these may be they can show nothing
with regard to the infinite number of cases in which the experiment has
not been made besides axioms are not only universal they are also
necessary now experience cannot offer the smallest ground for the
necessity of a proposition she can observe and record what has happened
but she cannot find in any case or in any accumulation of cases any
reason for what must happen she may see objects side by side but she
cannot see a reason why they must ever be side by side she finds certain
events to occur in succession but the succession supplies in its
occurrence no reason for its recurrence she contemplates external
objects but she cannot detect any internal bond which indissolubly
connects the future with the past the possible with the real to learn a
proposition by experience and to see it to be necessarily true are two
altogether different processes of thought41 and dr whewell adds if
any one does not clearly comprehend this distinction of necessary and
contingent truths he will not be able to go along with us in our
researches into the foundations of human knowledge nor indeed to pursue
with success any speculation on the subject42
in the following passage we are told what the distinction is the
nonrecognition of which incurs this denunciation necessary truths are
those in which we not only learn that the proposition is true but see
that it must be true in which the negation of the truth is not only
false but impossible in which we cannot even by an effort of
imagination or in a supposition conceive the reverse of that which is
asserted that there are such truths cannot be doubted we may take for
example all relations of number three and two added together make
five we cannot conceive it to be otherwise we cannot by any freak of
thought imagine three and two to make seven43
although dr whewell has naturally and properly employed a variety of
phrases to bring his meaning more forcibly home he will i presume allow
that they are all equivalent and that what he means by a necessary truth
would be sufficiently defined a proposition the negation of which is not
only false but inconceivable i am unable to find in any of his
expressions turn them what way you will a meaning beyond this and i do
not believe he would contend that they mean anything more
this therefore is the principle asserted that propositions the
negation of which is inconceivable or in other words which we cannot
figure to ourselves as being false must rest on evidence of a higher and
more cogent description than any which experience can afford and we have
next to consider whether there is any ground for this assertion
now i cannot but wonder that so much stress should be laid on the
circumstance of inconceivableness when there is such ample experience to
show that our capacity or incapacity of conceiving a thing has very
little to do with the possibility of the thing in itself but is in truth
very much an affair of accident and depends on the past history and
habits of our own minds there is no more generally acknowledged fact in
human nature than the extreme difficulty at first felt in conceiving
anything as possible which is in contradiction to long established and
familiar experience or even to old familiar habits of thought and this
difficulty is a necessary result of the fundamental laws of the human
mind when we have often seen and thought of two things together and have
never in any one instance either seen or thought of them separately there
is by the primary law of association an increasing difficulty which may
in the end become insuperable of conceiving the two things apart this is
most of all conspicuous in uneducated persons who are in general utterly
unable to separate any two ideas which have once become firmly associated
in their minds and if persons of cultivated intellect have any advantage
on the point it is only because having seen and heard and read more and
being more accustomed to exercise their imagination they have experienced
their sensations and thoughts in more varied combinations and have been
prevented from forming many of these inseparable associations but this
advantage has necessarily its limits the most practised intellect is not
exempt from the universal laws of our conceptive faculty if daily habit
presents to any one for a long period two facts in combination and if he
is not led during that period either by accident or by his voluntary
mental operations to think of them apart he will probably in time become
incapable of doing so even by the strongest effort and the supposition
that the two facts can be separated in nature will at last present itself
to his mind with all the characters of an inconceivable phenomenon44
there are remarkable instances of this in the history of science
instances in which the most instructed men rejected as impossible because
inconceivable things which their posterity by earlier practice and
longer perseverance in the attempt found it quite easy to conceive and
which everybody now knows to be true there was a time when men of the
most cultivated intellects and the most emancipated from the dominion of
early prejudice could not credit the existence of antipodes were unable
to conceive in opposition to old association the force of gravity acting
upwards instead of downwards the cartesians long rejected the newtonian
doctrine of the gravitation of all bodies towards one another on the
faith of a general proposition the reverse of which seemed to them to be
inconceivablethe proposition that a body cannot act where it is not all
the cumbrous machinery of imaginary vortices assumed without the smallest
particle of evidence appeared to these philosophers a more rational mode
of explaining the heavenly motions than one which involved what seemed to
them so great an absurdity45 and they no doubt found it as impossible
to conceive that a body should act upon the earth at the distance of the
sun or moon as we find it to conceive an end to space or time or two
straight lines inclosing a space newton himself had not been able to
realize the conception or we should not have had his hypothesis of a
subtle ether the occult cause of gravitation and his writings prove
that although he deemed the particular nature of the intermediate agency a
matter of conjecture the necessity of some such agency appeared to him
indubitable it would seem that even now the majority of scientific men
have not completely got over this very difficulty for though they have at
last learnt to conceive the sun attracting the earth without any
intervening fluid they cannot yet conceive the sun illuminating the
earth without some such medium
if then it be so natural to the human mind even in a high state of
culture to be incapable of conceiving and on that ground to believe
impossible what is afterwards not only found to be conceivable but proved
to be true what wonder if in cases where the association is still older
more confirmed and more familiar and in which nothing ever occurs to
shake our conviction or even suggest to us any conception at variance
with the association the acquired incapacity should continue and be
mistaken for a natural incapacity it is true our experience of the
varieties in nature enables us within certain limits to conceive other
varieties analogous to them we can conceive the sun or moon falling for
although we never saw them fall nor ever perhaps imagined them falling
we have seen so many other things fall that we have innumerable familiar
analogies to assist the conception which after all we should probably
have some difficulty in framing were we not well accustomed to see the
sun and moon move or appear to move so that we are only called upon to
conceive a slight change in the direction of motion a circumstance
familiar to our experience but when experience affords no model on which
to shape the new conception how is it possible for us to form it how
for example can we imagine an end to space or time we never saw any
object without something beyond it nor experienced any feeling without
something following it when therefore we attempt to conceive the last
point of space we have the idea irresistibly raised of other points
beyond it when we try to imagine the last instant of time we cannot help
conceiving another instant after it nor is there any necessity to assume
as is done by a modern school of metaphysicians a peculiar fundamental
law of the mind to account for the feeling of infinity inherent in our
conceptions of space and time that apparent infinity is sufficiently
accounted for by simpler and universally acknowledged laws
now in the case of a geometrical axiom such for example as that two
straight lines cannot inclose a spacea truth which is testified to us by
our very earliest impressions of the external worldhow is it possible
whether those external impressions be or be not the ground of our belief
that the reverse of the proposition could be otherwise than
inconceivable to us what analogy have we what similar order of facts in
any other branch of our experience to facilitate to us the conception of
two straight lines inclosing a space nor is even this all i have already
called attention to the peculiar property of our impressions of form that
the ideas or mental images exactly resemble their prototypes and
adequately represent them for the purposes of scientific observation from
this and from the intuitive character of the observation which in this
case reduces itself to simple inspection we cannot so much as call up in
our imagination two straight lines in order to attempt to conceive them
inclosing a space without by that very act repeating the scientific
experiment which establishes the contrary will it really be contended
that the inconceivableness of the thing in such circumstances proves
anything against the experimental origin of the conviction is it not
clear that in whichever mode our belief in the proposition may have
originated the impossibility of our conceiving the negative of it must
on either hypothesis be the same as then dr whewell exhorts those who
have any difficulty in recognising the distinction held by him between
necessary and contingent truths to study geometrya condition which i
can assure him i have conscientiously fulfilledi in return with equal
confidence exhort those who agree with him to study the elementary laws
of association being convinced that nothing more is requisite than a
moderate familiarity with those laws to dispel the illusion which
ascribes a peculiar necessity to our earliest inductions from experience
and measures the possibility of things in themselves by the human
capacity of conceiving them
i hope to be pardoned for adding that dr whewell himself has both
confirmed by his testimony the effect of habitual association in giving to
an experimental truth the appearance of a necessary one and afforded a
striking instance of that remarkable law in his own person in his
philosophy of the inductive sciences he continually asserts that
propositions which not only are not selfevident but which we know to
have been discovered gradually and by great efforts of genius and
patience have when once established appeared so selfevident that but
for historical proof it would have been impossible to conceive that they
had not been recognised from the first by all persons in a sound state of
their faculties we now despise those who in the copernican controversy
could not conceive the apparent motion of the sun on the heliocentric
hypothesis or those who in opposition to galileo thought that a uniform
force might be that which generated a velocity proportional to the space
or those who held there was something absurd in newtons doctrine of the
different refrangibility of differently coloured rays or those who
imagined that when elements combine their sensible qualities must be
manifest in the compound or those who were reluctant to give up the
distinction of vegetables into herbs shrubs and trees we cannot help
thinking that men must have been singularly dull of comprehension to find
a difficulty in admitting what is to us so plain and simple we have a
latent persuasion that we in their place should have been wiser and more
clearsighted that we should have taken the right side and given our
assent at once to the truth yet in reality such a persuasion is a mere
delusion the persons who in such instances as the above were on the
losing side were very far in most cases from being persons more
prejudiced or stupid or narrowminded than the greater part of mankind
now are and the cause for which they fought was far from being a
manifestly bad one till it had been so decided by the result of the
war so complete has been the victory of truth in most of these
instances that at present we can hardly imagine the struggle to have been
necessary the very essence of these triumphs is that they lead us to
regard the views we reject as not only false but inconceivable46
this last proposition is precisely what i contend for and i ask no more
in order to overthrow the whole theory of its author on the nature of the
evidence of axioms for what is that theory that the truth of axioms
cannot have been learnt from experience because their falsity is
inconceivable but dr whewell himself says that we are continually led
by the natural progress of thought to regard as inconceivable what our
forefathers not only conceived but believed nay even he might have
added were unable to conceive the contrary of he cannot intend to
justify this mode of thought he cannot mean to say that we can be
right in regarding as inconceivable what others have conceived and as
selfevident what to others did not appear evident at all after so
complete an admission that inconceivableness is an accidental thing not
inherent in the phenomenon itself but dependent on the mental history of
the person who tries to conceive it how can he ever call upon us to
reject a proposition as impossible on no other ground than its
inconceivableness yet he not only does so but has unintentionally
afforded some of the most remarkable examples which can be cited of the
very illusion which he has himself so clearly pointed out i select as
specimens his remarks on the evidence of the three laws of motion and of
the atomic theory
with respect to the laws of motion dr whewell says no one can doubt
that in historical fact these laws were collected from experience that
such is the case is no matter of conjecture we know the time the
persons the circumstances belonging to each step of each discovery47
after this testimony to adduce evidence of the fact would be superfluous
and not only were these laws by no means intuitively evident but some of
them were originally paradoxes the first law was especially so that a
body once in motion would continue for ever to move in the same
direction with undiminished velocity unless acted upon by some new force
was a proposition which mankind found for a long time the greatest
difficulty in crediting it stood opposed to apparent experience of the
most familiar kind which taught that it was the nature of motion to abate
gradually and at last terminate of itself yet when once the contrary
doctrine was firmly established mathematicians as dr whewell observes
speedily began to believe that laws thus contradictory to first
appearances and which even after full proof had been obtained it had
required generations to render familiar to the minds of the scientific
world were under a demonstrable necessity compelling them to be such as
they are and no other and he himself though not venturing absolutely
to pronounce that all these laws can be rigorously traced to an
absolute necessity in the nature of things48 does actually think in
that manner of the law just mentioned of which he says though the
discovery of the first law of motion was made historically speaking by
means of experiment we have now attained a point of view in which we see
that it might have been certainly known to be true independently of
experience49 can there be a more striking exemplification than is here
afforded of the effect of association which we have described
philosophers for generations have the most extraordinary difficulty in
putting certain ideas together they at last succeed in doing so and
after a sufficient repetition of the process they first fancy a natural
bond between the ideas then experience a growing difficulty which at
last by the continuation of the same progress becomes an impossibility
of severing them from one another if such be the progress of an
experimental conviction of which the date is of yesterday and which is in
opposition to first appearances how must it fare with those which are
conformable to appearances familiar from the first dawn of intelligence
and of the conclusiveness of which from the earliest records of human
thought no sceptic has suggested even a momentary doubt
the other instance which i shall quote is a truly astonishing one and may
be called the reductio ad absurdum of the theory of inconceivableness
speaking of the laws of chemical composition dr whewell says50 that
they could never have been clearly understood and therefore never firmly
established without laborious and exact experiments is certain but yet
we may venture to say that being once known they possess an evidence
beyond that of mere experiment for how in fact can we conceive
combinations otherwise than as definite in kind and quality if we were
to suppose each element ready to combine with any other indifferently and
indifferently in any quantity we should have a world in which all would
be confusion and indefiniteness there would be no fixed kinds of bodies
salts and stones and ores would approach to and graduate into each
other by insensible degrees instead of this we know that the world
consists of bodies distinguishable from each other by definite
differences capable of being classified and named and of having general
propositions asserted concerning them and as we cannot conceive a world
in which this should not be the case it would appear that we cannot
conceive a state of things in which the laws of the combination of
elements should not be of that definite and measured kind which we have
above asserted51
that a philosopher of dr whewells eminence should gravely assert that we
cannot conceive a world in which the simple elements would combine in
other than definite proportions that by dint of meditating on a
scientific truth the original discoverer of which was still living he
should have rendered the association in his own mind between the idea of
combination and that of constant proportions so familiar and intimate as
to be unable to conceive the one fact without the other is so signal an
instance of the mental law for which i am contending that one word more
in illustration must be superfluous52
chapter vi the same subject continued
 1 in the examination which formed the subject of the last chapter into
the nature of the evidence of those deductive sciences which are commonly
represented to be systems of necessary truth we have been led to the
following conclusions the results of those sciences are indeed necessary
in the sense of necessarily following from certain first principles
commonly called axioms and definitions of being certainly true if those
axioms and definitions are so but their claim to the character of
necessity in any sense beyond this as implying an evidence independent of
and superior to observation and experience must depend on the previous
establishment of such a claim in favour of the definitions and axioms
themselves with regard to axioms we found that considered as
experimental truths they rest on superabundant and obvious evidence we
inquired whether since this is the case it be necessary to suppose any
other evidence of those truths than experimental evidence any other
origin for our belief of them than an experimental origin we decided
that the burden of proof lies with those who maintain the affirmative and
we examined at considerable length such arguments as they have produced
the examination having led to the rejection of those arguments we have
thought ourselves warranted in concluding that axioms are but a class the
highest class of inductions from experience the simplest and easiest
cases of generalization from the facts furnished to us by our senses or by
our internal consciousness
while the axioms of demonstrative sciences thus appeared to be
experimental truths the definitions as they are incorrectly called in
those sciences were found by us to be generalizations from experience
which are not even accurately speaking truths being propositions in
which while we assert of some kind of object some property or properties
which observation shows to belong to it we at the same time deny that it
possesses any other properties although in truth other properties do in
every individual instance accompany and in almost all instances modify
the property thus exclusively predicated the denial therefore is a mere
fiction or supposition made for the purpose of excluding the
consideration of those modifying circumstances when their influence is of
too trifling amount to be worth considering or adjourning it when
important to a more convenient moment
from these considerations it would appear that deductive or demonstrative
sciences are all without exception inductive sciences that their
evidence is that of experience but that they are also in virtue of the
peculiar character of one indispensable portion of the general formulas
according to which their inductions are made hypothetical sciences their
conclusions are only true on certain suppositions which are or ought to
be approximations to the truth but are seldom if ever exactly true
and to this hypothetical character is to be ascribed the peculiar
certainty which is supposed to be inherent in demonstration
what we have now asserted however cannot be received as universally true
of deductive or demonstrative sciences until verified by being applied to
the most remarkable of all those sciences that of numbers the theory of
the calculus arithmetic and algebra it is harder to believe of the
doctrines of this science than of any other either that they are not
truths  priori but experimental truths or that their peculiar
certainty is owing to their being not absolute but only conditional
truths this therefore is a case which merits examination apart and the
more so because on this subject we have a double set of doctrines to
contend with that of the  priori philosophers on one side and on the
other a theory the most opposite to theirs which was at one time very
generally received and is still far from being altogether exploded among
metaphysicians
 2 this theory attempts to solve the difficulty apparently inherent in
the case by representing the propositions of the science of numbers as
merely verbal and its processes as simple transformations of language
substitutions of one expression for another the proposition two and one
are equal to three according to these writers is not a truth is not the
assertion of a really existing fact but a definition of the word three a
statement that mankind have agreed to use the name three as a sign exactly
equivalent to two and one to call by the former name whatever is called
by the other more clumsy phrase according to this doctrine the longest
process in algebra is but a succession of changes in terminology by which
equivalent expressions are substituted one for another a series of
translations of the same fact from one into another language though how
after such a series of translations the fact itself comes out changed
as when we demonstrate a new geometrical theorem by algebra they have
not explained and it is a difficulty which is fatal to their theory
it must be acknowledged that there are peculiarities in the processes of
arithmetic and algebra which render the theory in question very plausible
and have not unnaturally made those sciences the stronghold of nominalism
the doctrine that we can discover facts detect the hidden processes of
nature by an artful manipulation of language is so contrary to common
sense that a person must have made some advances in philosophy to believe
it men fly to so paradoxical a belief to avoid as they think some even
greater difficulty which the vulgar do not see what has led many to
believe that reasoning is a mere verbal process is that no other theory
seemed reconcileable with the nature of the science of numbers for we do
not carry any ideas along with us when we use the symbols of arithmetic or
of algebra in a geometrical demonstration we have a mental diagram if
not one on paper ab ac are present to our imagination as lines
intersecting other lines forming an angle with one another and the like
but not so a and b these may represent lines or any other magnitudes
but those magnitudes are never thought of nothing is realized in our
imagination but a and b the ideas which on the particular occasion
they happen to represent are banished from the mind during every
intermediate part of the process between the beginning when the
premisses are translated from things into signs and the end when the
conclusion is translated back from signs into things nothing then being
in the reasoners mind but the symbols what can seem more inadmissible
than to contend that the reasoning process has to do with anything more
we seem to have come to one of bacons prerogative instances an
experimentum crucis on the nature of reasoning itself
nevertheless it will appear on consideration that this apparently so
decisive instance is no instance at all that there is in every step of an
arithmetical or algebraical calculation a real induction a real inference
of facts from facts and that what disguises the induction is simply its
comprehensive nature and the consequent extreme generality of the
language all numbers must be numbers of something there are no such
things as numbers in the abstract ten must mean ten bodies or ten
sounds or ten beatings of the pulse but though numbers must be numbers
of something they may be numbers of anything propositions therefore
concerning numbers have the remarkable peculiarity that they are
propositions concerning all things whatever all objects all existences
of every kind known to our experience all things possess quantity
consist of parts which can be numbered and in that character possess all
the properties which are called properties of numbers that half of four
is two must be true whatever the word four represents whether four men
four miles or four pounds weight we need only conceive a thing divided
into four equal parts and all things may be conceived as so divided to
be able to predicate of it every property of the number four that is
every arithmetical proposition in which the number four stands on one side
of the equation algebra extends the generalization still farther every
number represents that particular number of all things without
distinction but every algebraical symbol does more it represents all
numbers without distinction as soon as we conceive a thing divided into
equal parts without knowing into what number of parts we may call it a
or x and apply to it without danger of error every algebraical
formula in the books the proposition 2a  b  2a  2b is a
truth coextensive with all nature since then algebraical truths are true
of all things whatever and not like those of geometry true of lines
only or angles only it is no wonder that the symbols should not excite in
our minds ideas of any things in particular when we demonstrate the
fortyseventh proposition of euclid it is not necessary that the words
should raise in us an image of all rightangled triangles but only of
some one rightangled triangle so in algebra we need not under the
symbol a picture to ourselves all things whatever but only some one
thing why not then the letter itself the mere written characters a
b x y z serve as well for representatives of things in
general as any more complex and apparently more concrete conception that
we are conscious of them however in their character of things and not of
mere signs is evident from the fact that our whole process of reasoning
is carried on by predicating of them the properties of things in
resolving an algebraic equation by what rules do we proceed by applying
at each step to a b and x the proposition that equals added to
equals make equals that equals taken from equals leave equals and other
propositions founded on these two these are not properties of language
or of signs as such but of magnitudes which is as much as to say of all
things the inferences therefore which are successively drawn are
inferences concerning things not symbols although as any things whatever
will serve the turn there is no necessity for keeping the idea of the
thing at all distinct and consequently the process of thought may in
this case be allowed without danger to do what all processes of thought
when they have been performed often will do if permitted namely to
become entirely mechanical hence the general language of algebra comes to
be used familiarly without exciting ideas as all other general language
is prone to do from mere habit though in no other case than this can it
be done with complete safety but when we look back to see from whence the
probative force of the process is derived we find that at every single
step unless we suppose ourselves to be thinking and talking of the
things and not the mere symbols the evidence fails
there is another circumstance which still more than that which we have
now mentioned gives plausibility to the notion that the propositions of
arithmetic and algebra are merely verbal this is that when considered as
propositions respecting things they all have the appearance of being
identical propositions the assertion two and one are equal to three
considered as an assertion respecting objects as for instance two
pebbles and one pebble are equal to three pebbles does not affirm
equality between two collections of pebbles but absolute identity it
affirms that if we put one pebble to two pebbles those very pebbles are
three the objects therefore being the very same and the mere assertion
that objects are themselves being insignificant it seems but natural to
consider the proposition two and one are equal to three as asserting
mere identity of signification between the two names
this however though it looks so plausible will not bear examination
the expression two pebbles and one pebble and the expression three
pebbles stand indeed for the same aggregation of objects but they by no
means stand for the same physical fact they are names of the same
objects but of those objects in two different states though they
denote the same things their connotation is different three pebbles
in two separate parcels and three pebbles in one parcel do not make the
same impression on our senses and the assertion that the very same
pebbles may by an alteration of place and arrangement be made to produce
either the one set of sensations or the other though a very familiar
proposition is not an identical one it is a truth known to us by early
and constant experience an inductive truth and such truths are the
foundation of the science of number the fundamental truths of that
science all rest on the evidence of sense they are proved by showing to
our eyes and our fingers that any given number of objects ten balls for
example may by separation and rearrangement exhibit to our senses all
the different sets of numbers the sum of which is equal to ten all the
improved methods of teaching arithmetic to children proceed on a knowledge
of this fact all who wish to carry the childs mind along with them in
learning arithmetic all who wish to teach numbers and not mere
ciphersnow teach it through the evidence of the senses in the manner we
have described
we may if we please call the proposition three is two and one a
definition of the number three and assert that arithmetic as it has been
asserted that geometry is a science founded on definitions but they are
definitions in the geometrical sense not the logical asserting not the
meaning of a term only but along with it an observed matter of fact the
proposition a circle is a figure bounded by a line which has all its
points equally distant from a point within it is called the definition
of a circle but the proposition from which so many consequences follow
and which is really a first principle in geometry is that figures
answering to this description exist and thus we may call three is two
and one a definition of three but the calculations which depend on that
proposition do not follow from the definition itself but from an
arithmetical theorem presupposed in it namely that collections of
objects exist which while they impress the senses thus symbol three
circles two above one may be separated into two parts thus symbol
two circles a space and a third circle this proposition being granted
we term all such parcels threes after which the enunciation of the
abovementioned physical fact will serve also for a definition of the word
three
the science of number is thus no exception to the conclusion we previously
arrived at that the processes even of deductive sciences are altogether
inductive and that their first principles are generalizations from
experience it remains to be examined whether this science resembles
geometry in the further circumstance that some of its inductions are not
exactly true and that the peculiar certainty ascribed to it on account
of which its propositions are called necessary truths is fictitious and
hypothetical being true in no other sense than that those propositions
necessarily follow from the hypothesis of the truth of premisses which are
avowedly mere approximations to truth
 3 the inductions of arithmetic are of two sorts first those which we
have just expounded such as one and one are two two and one are three
c which may be called the definitions of the various numbers in the
improper or geometrical sense of the word definition and secondly the
two following axioms the sums of equals are equal the differences of
equals are equal these two are sufficient for the corresponding
propositions respecting unequals may be proved from these by a reductio
ad absurdum
these axioms and likewise the socalled definitions are as already
shown results of induction true of all objects whatever and as it may
seem exactly true without the hypothetical assumption of unqualified
truth where an approximation to it is all that exists the conclusions
therefore it will naturally be inferred are exactly true and the
science of number is an exception to other demonstrative sciences in this
that the absolute certainty which is predicable of its demonstrations is
independent of all hypothesis
on more accurate investigation however it will be found that even in
this case there is one hypothetical element in the ratiocination in all
propositions concerning numbers a condition is implied without which
none of them would be true and that condition is an assumption which may
be false the condition is that 1  1 that all the numbers are numbers
of the same or of equal units let this be doubtful and not one of the
propositions of arithmetic will hold true how can we know that one pound
and one pound make two pounds if one of the pounds may be troy and the
other avoirdupois they may not make two pounds of either or of any
weight how can we know that a fortyhorse power is always equal to
itself unless we assume that all horses are of equal strength it is
certain that 1 is always equal in number to 1 and where the mere number
of objects or of the parts of an object without supposing them to be
equivalent in any other respect is all that is material the conclusions
of arithmetic so far as they go to that alone are true without mixture
of hypothesis there are a few such cases as for instance an inquiry
into the amount of the population of any country it is indifferent to
that inquiry whether they are grown people or children strong or weak
tall or short the only thing we want to ascertain is their number but
whenever from equality or inequality of number equality or inequality in
any other respect is to be inferred arithmetic carried into such
inquiries becomes as hypothetical a science as geometry all units must be
assumed to be equal in that other respect and this is never practically
true for one actual pound weight is not exactly equal to another nor one
miles length to another a nicer balance or more accurate measuring
instruments would always detect some difference
what is commonly called mathematical certainty therefore which comprises
the twofold conception of unconditional truth and perfect accuracy is not
an attribute of all mathematical truths but of those only which relate to
pure number as distinguished from quantity in the more enlarged sense
and only so long as we abstain from supposing that the numbers are a
precise index to actual quantities the certainty usually ascribed to the
conclusions of geometry and even to those of mechanics is nothing
whatever but certainty of inference we can have full assurance of
particular results under particular suppositions but we cannot have the
same assurance that these suppositions are accurately true nor that they
include all the data which may exercise an influence over the result in
any given instance
 4 it appears therefore that the method of all deductive sciences is
hypothetical they proceed by tracing the consequences of certain
assumptions leaving for separate consideration whether the assumptions
are true or not and if not exactly true whether they are a sufficiently
near approximation to the truth the reason is obvious since it is only
in questions of pure number that the assumptions are exactly true and
even there only so long as no conclusions except purely numerical ones
are to be founded on them it must in all other cases of deductive
investigation form a part of the inquiry to determine how much the
assumptions want of being exactly true in the case in hand this is
generally a matter of observation to be repeated in every fresh case or
if it has to be settled by argument instead of observation may require in
every different case different evidence and present every degree of
difficulty from the lowest to the highest but the other part of the
processnamely to determine what else may be concluded if we find and in
proportion as we find the assumptions to be truemay be performed once
for all and the results held ready to be employed as the occasions turn
up for use we thus do all beforehand that can be so done and leave the
least possible work to be performed when cases arise and press for a
decision this inquiry into the inferences which can be drawn from
assumptions is what properly constitutes demonstrative science
it is of course quite as practicable to arrive at new conclusions from
facts assumed as from facts observed from fictitious as from real
inductions deduction as we have seen consists of a series of inferences
in this forma is a mark of b b of c c of d therefore a
is a mark of d which last may be a truth inaccessible to direct
observation in like manner it is allowable to say suppose that a
were a mark of b b of c and c of d a would be a mark of
d which last conclusion was not thought of by those who laid down the
premisses a system of propositions as complicated as geometry might be
deduced from assumptions which are false as was done by ptolemy
descartes and others in their attempts to explain synthetically the
phenomena of the solar system on the supposition that the apparent motions
of the heavenly bodies were the real motions or were produced in some way
more or less different from the true one sometimes the same thing is
knowingly done for the purpose of showing the falsity of the assumption
which is called a reductio ad absurdum in such cases the reasoning is
as follows a is a mark of b and b of c now if c were also a
mark of d a would be a mark of d but d is known to be a mark of
the absence of a consequently a would be a mark of its own absence
which is a contradiction therefore c is not a mark of d
 5 it has even been held by some writers that all ratiocination rests
in the last resort on a reductio ad absurdum since the way to enforce
assent to it in case of obscurity would be to show that if the
conclusion be denied we must deny some one at least of the premisses
which as they are all supposed true would be a contradiction and in
accordance with this many have thought that the peculiar nature of the
evidence of ratiocination consisted in the impossibility of admitting the
premisses and rejecting the conclusion without a contradiction in terms
this theory however is inadmissible as an explanation of the grounds on
which ratiocination itself rests if any one denies the conclusion
notwithstanding his admission of the premisses he is not involved in any
direct and express contradiction until he is compelled to deny some
premiss and he can only be forced to do this by a reductio ad absurdum
that is by another ratiocination now if he denies the validity of the
reasoning process itself he can no more be forced to assent to the second
syllogism than to the first in truth therefore no one is ever forced to
a contradiction in terms he can only be forced to a contradiction or
rather an infringement of the fundamental maxim of ratiocination namely
that whatever has a mark has what it is a mark of or in the case of
universal propositions that whatever is a mark of anything is a mark of
whatever else that thing is a mark of for in the case of every correct
argument as soon as thrown into the syllogistic form it is evident
without the aid of any other syllogism that he who admitting the
premisses fails to draw the conclusion does not conform to the above
axiom
without attaching exaggerated importance to the distinction now drawn i
think it enables us to characterize in a more accurate manner than is
usually done the nature of demonstrative evidence and of logical
necessity that is necessary from which to withhold assent would be to
violate the above axiom and since the axiom can only be violated by
assenting to premisses and rejecting a legitimate conclusion from them
nothing is necessary except the connexion between a conclusion and
premisses of which doctrine the whole of this and the preceding chapter
are submitted as the proof
we have now proceeded as far in the theory of deduction as we can advance
in the present stage of our inquiry any further insight into the subject
requires that the foundation shall have been laid of the philosophic
theory of induction itself in which theory that of deduction as a mode
of induction which we have now shown it to be will assume spontaneously
the place which belongs to it and will receive its share of whatever
light may be thrown upon the great intellectual operation of which it
forms so important a part
we here therefore close the second book the theory of induction in the
most comprehensive sense of the term will form the subject of the third
book iii of induction
    according to the doctrine now stated the highest or rather the
    only proper object of physics is to ascertain those established
    conjunctions of successive events which constitute the order of
    the universe to record the phenomena which it exhibits to our
    observations or which it discloses to our experiments and to
    refer these phenomena to their general lawsd stewart
    elements of the philosophy of the human mind vol ii chap iv
    sect 1
chapter i preliminary observations on induction in general
 1 the portion of the present inquiry upon which we are now about to
enter may be considered as the principal both from its surpassing in
intricacy all the other branches and because it relates to a process
which has been shown in the preceding book to be that in which the
investigation of nature essentially consists we have found that all
inference consequently all proof and all discovery of truths not
selfevident consists of inductions and the interpretation of
inductions that all our knowledge not intuitive comes to us exclusively
from that source what induction is therefore and what conditions render
it legitimate cannot but be deemed the main question of the science of
logicthe question which includes all others it is however one which
professed writers on logic have almost entirely passed over the
generalities of the subject have not been altogether neglected by
metaphysicians but for want of sufficient acquaintance with the
processes by which science has actually succeeded in establishing general
truths their analysis of the inductive operation even when
unexceptionable as to correctness has not been specific enough to be made
the foundation of practical rules which might be for induction itself
what the rules of the syllogism are for the interpretation of induction
while those by whom physical science has been carried to its present state
of improvementand who to arrive at a complete theory of the process
needed only to generalize and adapt to all varieties of problems the
methods which they themselves employed in their habitual pursuitsnever
until very lately made any serious attempt to philosophize on the subject
nor regarded the mode in which they arrived at their conclusions as
deserving of study independently of the conclusions themselves
 2 for the purposes of the present inquiry induction may be defined
the operation of discovering and proving general propositions it is true
that as already shown the process of indirectly ascertaining individual
facts is as truly inductive as that by which we establish general truths
but it is not a different kind of induction it is another form of the
very same process since on the one hand generals are but collections of
particulars definite in kind but indefinite in number and on the other
hand whenever the evidence which we derive from observation of known
cases justifies us in drawing an inference respecting even one unknown
case we should on the same evidence be justified in drawing a similar
inference with respect to a whole class of cases the inference either
does not hold at all or it holds in all cases of a certain description
in all cases which in certain definable respects resemble those we have
observed
if these remarks are just if the principles and rules of inference are
the same whether we infer general propositions or individual facts it
follows that a complete logic of the sciences would be also a complete
logic of practical business and common life since there is no case of
legitimate inference from experience in which the conclusion may not
legitimately be a general proposition an analysis of the process by which
general truths are arrived at is virtually an analysis of all induction
whatever whether we are inquiring into a scientific principle or into an
individual fact and whether we proceed by experiment or by ratiocination
every step in the train of inferences is essentially inductive and the
legitimacy of the induction depends in both cases on the same conditions
true it is that in the case of the practical inquirer who is endeavouring
to ascertain facts not for the purposes of science but for those of
business such for instance as the advocate or the judge the chief
difficulty is one in which the principles of induction will afford him no
assistance it lies not in making his inductions but in the selection
of them in choosing from among all general propositions ascertained to be
true those which furnish marks by which he may trace whether the given
subject possesses or not the predicate in question in arguing a doubtful
question of fact before a jury the general propositions or principles to
which the advocate appeals are mostly in themselves sufficiently trite
and assented to as soon as stated his skill lies in bringing his case
under those propositions or principles in calling to mind such of the
known or received maxims of probability as admit of application to the
case in hand and selecting from among them those best adapted to his
object success is here dependent on natural or acquired sagacity aided
by knowledge of the particular subject and of subjects allied with it
invention though it can be cultivated cannot be reduced to rule there
is no science which will enable a man to bethink himself of that which
will suit his purpose
but when he has thought of something science can tell him whether that
which he has thought of will suit his purpose or not the inquirer or
arguer must be guided by his own knowledge and sagacity in the choice of
the inductions out of which he will construct his argument but the
validity of the argument when constructed depends on principles and must
be tried by tests which are the same for all descriptions of inquiries
whether the result be to give a an estate or to enrich science with a new
general truth in the one case and in the other the senses or testimony
must decide on the individual facts the rules of the syllogism will
determine whether those facts being supposed correct the case really
falls within the formul of the different inductions under which it has
been successively brought and finally the legitimacy of the inductions
themselves must be decided by other rules and these it is now our purpose
to investigate if this third part of the operation be in many of the
questions of practical life not the most but the least arduous portion
of it we have seen that this is also the case in some great departments
of the field of science in all those which are principally deductive and
most of all in mathematics where the inductions themselves are few in
number and so obvious and elementary that they seem to stand in no need
of the evidence of experience while to combine them so as to prove a
given theorem or solve a problem may call for the utmost powers of
invention and contrivance with which our species is gifted
if the identity of the logical processes which prove particular facts and
those which establish general scientific truths required any additional
confirmation it would be sufficient to consider that in many branches of
science single facts have to be proved as well as principles facts as
completely individual as any that are debated in a court of justice but
which are proved in the same manner as the other truths of the science
and without disturbing in any degree the homogeneity of its method a
remarkable example of this is afforded by astronomy the individual facts
on which that science grounds its most important deductions such facts as
the magnitudes of the bodies of the solar system their distances from one
another the figure of the earth and its rotation are scarcely any of
them accessible to our means of direct observation they are proved
indirectly by the aid of inductions founded on other facts which we can
more easily reach for example the distance of the moon from the earth
was determined by a very circuitous process the share which direct
observation had in the work consisted in ascertaining at one and the same
instant the zenith distances of the moon as seen from two points very
remote from one another on the earths surface the ascertainment of these
angular distances ascertained their supplements and since the angle at
the earths centre subtended by the distance between the two places of
observation was deducible by spherical trigonometry from the latitude and
longitude of those places the angle at the moon subtended by the same
line became the fourth angle of a quadrilateral of which the other three
angles were known the four angles being thus ascertained and two sides
of the quadrilateral being radii of the earth the two remaining sides and
the diagonal or in other words the moons distance from the two places
of observation and from the centre of the earth could be ascertained at
least in terms of the earths radius from elementary theorems of
geometry at each step in this demonstration we take in a new induction
represented in the aggregate of its results by a general proposition
not only is the process by which an individual astronomical fact was thus
ascertained exactly similar to those by which the same science
establishes its general truths but also as we have shown to be the case
in all legitimate reasoning a general proposition might have been
concluded instead of a single fact in strictness indeed the result of
the reasoning is a general proposition a theorem respecting the
distance not of the moon in particular but of any inaccessible object
showing in what relation that distance stands to certain other quantities
and although the moon is almost the only heavenly body the distance of
which from the earth can really be thus ascertained this is merely owing
to the accidental circumstances of the other heavenly bodies which render
them incapable of affording such data as the application of the theorem
requires for the theorem itself is as true of them as it is of the
moon53
we shall fall into no error then if in treating of induction we limit
our attention to the establishment of general propositions the principles
and rules of induction as directed to this end are the principles and
rules of all induction and the logic of science is the universal logic
applicable to all inquiries in which man can engage
chapter ii of inductions improperly so called
 1 induction then is that operation of the mind by which we infer
that what we know to be true in a particular case or cases will be true
in all cases which resemble the former in certain assignable respects in
other words induction is the process by which we conclude that what is
true of certain individuals of a class is true of the whole class or that
what is true at certain times will be true in similar circumstances at all
times
this definition excludes from the meaning of the term induction various
logical operations to which it is not unusual to apply that name
induction as above defined is a process of inference it proceeds from
the known to the unknown and any operation involving no inference any
process in which what seems the conclusion is no wider than the premisses
from which it is drawn does not fall within the meaning of the term yet
in the common books of logic we find this laid down as the most perfect
indeed the only quite perfect form of induction in those books every
process which sets out from a less general and terminates in a more
general expressionwhich admits of being stated in the form this and
that a are b therefore every a is bis called an induction whether
anything be really concluded or not and the induction is asserted to be
not perfect unless every single individual of the class a is included in
the antecedent or premiss that is unless what we affirm of the class
has already been ascertained to be true of every individual in it so that
the nominal conclusion is not really a conclusion but a mere reassertion
of the premisses if we were to say all the planets shine by the suns
light from observation of each separate planet or all the apostles were
jews because this is true of peter paul john and every other
apostlethese and such as these would in the phraseology in question
be called perfect and the only perfect inductions this however is a
totally different kind of induction from ours it is no inference from
facts known to facts unknown but a mere shorthand registration of facts
known the two simulated arguments which we have quoted are not
generalizations the propositions purporting to be conclusions from them
are not really general propositions a general proposition is one in which
the predicate is affirmed or denied of an unlimited number of individuals
namely all whether few or many existing or capable of existing which
possess the properties connoted by the subject of the proposition all
men are mortal does not mean all now living but all men past present
and to come when the signification of the term is limited so as to render
it a name not for any and every individual falling under a certain general
description but only for each of a number of individuals designated as
such and as it were counted off individually the proposition though it
may be general in its language is no general proposition but merely that
number of singular propositions written in an abridged character the
operation may be very useful as most forms of abridged notation are but
it is no part of the investigation of truth though often bearing an
important part in the preparation of the materials for that investigation
 2 a second process which requires to be distinguished from induction
is one to which mathematicians sometimes give that name and which so far
resembles induction properly so called that the propositions it leads to
are really general propositions for example when we have proved with
respect to the circle that a straight line cannot meet it in more than
two points and when the same thing has been successively proved of the
ellipse the parabola and the hyperbola it may be laid down as an
universal property of the sections of the cone in this example there is
no induction because there is no inference the conclusion is a mere
summing up of what was asserted in the various propositions from which it
is drawn a case somewhat though not altogether similar is the proof of
a geometrical theorem by means of a diagram whether the diagram be on
paper or only in the imagination the demonstration as formerly
observed54 does not prove directly the general theorem it proves only
that the conclusion which the theorem asserts generally is true of the
particular triangle or circle exhibited in the diagram but since we
perceive that in the same way in which we have proved it of that circle
it might also be proved of any other circle we gather up into one general
expression all the singular propositions susceptible of being thus proved
and embody them in an universal proposition having shown that the three
angles of the triangle abc are together equal to two right angles we
conclude that this is true of every other triangle not because it is true
of abc but for the same reason which proved it to be true of abc if this
were to be called induction an appropriate name for it would be
induction by parity of reasoning but the term cannot properly belong to
it the characteristic quality of induction is wanting since the truth
obtained though really general is not believed on the evidence of
particular instances we do not conclude that all triangles have the
property because some triangles have but from the ulterior demonstrative
evidence which was the ground of our conviction in the particular
instances
there are nevertheless in mathematics some examples of socalled
induction in which the conclusion does bear the appearance of a
generalization grounded on some of the particular cases included in it a
mathematician when he has calculated a sufficient number of the terms of
an algebraical or arithmetical series to have ascertained what is called
the law of the series does not hesitate to fill up any number of the
succeeding terms without repeating the calculations but i apprehend he
only does so when it is apparent from  priori considerations which
might be exhibited in the form of demonstration that the mode of
formation of the subsequent terms each from that which preceded it must
be similar to the formation of the terms which have been already
calculated and when the attempt has been hazarded without the sanction of
such general considerations there are instances on record in which it has
led to false results
it is said that newton discovered the binomial theorem by induction by
raising a binomial successively to a certain number of powers and
comparing those powers with one another until he detected the relation in
which the algebraic formula of each power stands to the exponent of that
power and to the two terms of the binomial the fact is not improbable
but a mathematician like newton who seemed to arrive per saltum at
principles and conclusions that ordinary mathematicians only reached by a
succession of steps certainly could not have performed the comparison in
question without being led by it to the  priori ground of the law
since any one who understands sufficiently the nature of multiplication to
venture upon multiplying several lines of symbols at one operation cannot
but perceive that in raising a binomial to a power the coefficients must
depend on the laws of permutation and combination and as soon as this is
recognised the theorem is demonstrated indeed when once it was seen
that the law prevailed in a few of the lower powers its identity with the
law of permutation would at once suggest the considerations which prove it
to obtain universally even therefore such cases as these are but
examples of what i have called induction by parity of reasoning that is
not really induction because not involving inference of a general
proposition from particular instances
 3 there remains a third improper use of the term induction which it is
of real importance to clear up because the theory of induction has been
in no ordinary degree confused by it and because the confusion is
exemplified in the most recent and most elaborate treatise on the
inductive philosophy which exists in our language the error in question
is that of confounding a mere description of a set of observed phenomena
with an induction from them
suppose that a phenomenon consists of parts and that these parts are only
capable of being observed separately and as it were piecemeal when the
observations have been made there is a convenience amounting for many
purposes to a necessity in obtaining a representation of the phenomenon
as a whole by combining or as we may say piecing these detached
fragments together a navigator sailing in the midst of the ocean
discovers land he cannot at first or by any one observation determine
whether it is a continent or an island but he coasts along it and after
a few days finds himself to have sailed completely round it he then
pronounces it an island now there was no particular time or place of
observation at which he could perceive that this land was entirely
surrounded by water he ascertained the fact by a succession of partial
observations and then selected a general expression which summed up in
two or three words the whole of what he so observed but is there anything
of the nature of an induction in this process did he infer anything that
had not been observed from something else which had certainly not he
had observed the whole of what the proposition asserts that the land in
question is an island is not an inference from the partial facts which
the navigator saw in the course of his circumnavigation it is the facts
themselves it is a summary of those facts the description of a complex
fact to which those simpler ones are as the parts of a whole
now there is i conceive no difference in kind between this simple
operation and that by which kepler ascertained the nature of the
planetary orbits and keplers operation all at least that was
characteristic in it was not more an inductive act than that of our
supposed navigator
the object of kepler was to determine the real path described by each of
the planets or let us say by the planet mars for it was of that body
that he first established two of the three great astronomical truths which
bear his name to do this there was no other mode than that of direct
observation and all which observation could do was to ascertain a great
number of the successive places of the planet or rather of its apparent
places that the planet occupied successively all these positions or at
all events positions which produced the same impressions on the eye and
that it passed from one of these to another insensibly and without any
apparent breach of continuity thus much the senses with the aid of the
proper instruments could ascertain what kepler did more than this was
to find what sort of a curve these different points would make supposing
them to be all joined together he expressed the whole series of the
observed places of mars by what dr whewell calls the general conception
of an ellipse this operation was far from being as easy as that of the
navigator who expressed the series of his observations on successive
points of the coast by the general conception of an island but it is the
very same sort of operation and if the one is not an induction but a
description this must also be true of the other
to avoid misapprehension we must remark that kepler in one respect
performed a real act of induction namely in concluding that because the
observed places of mars were correctly represented by points in an
imaginary ellipse therefore mars would continue to revolve in that same
ellipse and even in concluding that the position of the planet during the
time which intervened between two observations must have coincided with
the intermediate points of the curve but this really inductive operation
requires to be carefully distinguished from the mere act of bringing the
facts actually observed under a general description so distinct are these
two operations that the one might have been performed without the other
men might and did make correct inductions concerning the heavenly motions
before they had obtained correct general descriptions of them it was
known that the planets always moved in the same paths long before it had
been ascertained that those paths were ellipses astronomers early
remarked that the same set of apparent positions returned periodically
when they obtained a new description of the phenomenon they did not
necessarily make any further induction nor which is the true test of a
new general truth add anything to the power of prediction which they
already possessed
 4 the descriptive operation which enables a number of details to be
summed up in a single proposition dr whewell by an aptly chosen
expression has termed the colligation of facts55 in most of his
observations concerning that mental process i fully agree and would
gladly transfer all that portion of his book into my own pages i only
think him mistaken in setting up this kind of operation which according
to the old and received meaning of the term is not induction at all as
the type of induction generally and laying down throughout his work as
principles of induction the principles of mere colligation
dr whewell maintains that the general proposition which binds together
the particular facts and makes them as it were one fact is not the
mere sum of those facts but something more since there is introduced a
conception of the mind which did not exist in the facts themselves the
particular facts says he56 are not merely brought together but
there is a new element added to the combination by the very act of thought
by which they are combined when the greeks after long observing the
motions of the planets saw that these motions might be rightly considered
as produced by the motion of one wheel revolving in the inside of another
wheel these wheels were creations of their minds added to the facts
which they perceived by sense and even if the wheels were no longer
supposed to be material but were reduced to mere geometrical spheres or
circles they were not the less products of the mind alonesomething
additional to the facts observed the same is the case in all other
discoveries the facts are known but they are insulated and unconnected
till the discoverer supplies from his own store a principle of connexion
the pearls are there but they will not hang together till some one
provides the string
that a conception of the mind is introduced is indeed undeniable and i
willingly concede that to hit upon the right conception is often a far
more difficult and more meritorious achievement than to prove its
applicability when obtained but a conception implies and corresponds to
something conceived and though the conception itself is not in the facts
but in our mind it must be a conception of something which really is in
the facts some property which they actually possess and which they would
manifest to our senses if our senses were able to take cognizance of
them if for instance the planet left behind it in space a visible
track and if the observer were in a fixed position at such a distance
above the plane of the orbit as would enable him to see the whole of it at
once he would see it to be an ellipse and if gifted with appropriate
instruments and powers of locomotion he could prove it to be such by
measuring its different dimensions these things are indeed impossible to
us but not impossible in themselves if they were so keplers law could
not be true
subject to the indispensable condition which has just been stated i
cannot perceive that the part which conceptions have in the operation of
studying facts has ever been overlooked or undervalued no one ever
disputed that in order to reason about anything we must have a conception
of it or that when we include a multitude of things under a general
expression there is implied in the expression a conception of something
common to those things but it by no means follows that the conception is
necessarily preexistent or constructed by the mind out of its own
materials if the facts are rightly classed under the conception it is
because there is in the facts themselves something of which the conception
is itself a copy and which if we cannot directly perceive it is because
of the limited power of our organs and not because the thing itself is
not there the conception itself is often obtained by abstraction from the
very facts which in dr whewells language it is afterwards called in to
connect this he himself admits when he observes which he does on
several occasions how great a service would be rendered to the science
of physiology by the philosopher who should establish a precise tenable
and consistent conception of life57 such a conception can only be
abstracted from the phenomena of life itself from the very facts which it
is put in requisition to connect in other cases no doubt instead of
collecting the conception from the very phenomena which we are attempting
to colligate we select it from among those which have been previously
collected by abstraction from other facts in the instance of keplers
laws the latter was the case the facts being out of the reach of being
observed in any such manner as would have enabled the senses to identify
directly the path of the planet the conception requisite for framing a
general description of that path could not be collected by abstraction
from the observations themselves the mind had to supply hypothetically
from among the conceptions it had obtained from other portions of its
experience some one which would correctly represent the series of the
observed facts it had to frame a supposition respecting the general
course of the phenomenon and ask itself if this be the general
description what will the details be and then compare these with the
details actually observed if they agreed the hypothesis would serve for
a description of the phenomenon if not it was necessarily abandoned and
another tried it is such a case as this which gives rise to the doctrine
that the mind in framing the descriptions adds something of its own
which it does not find in the facts
yet it is a fact surely that the planet does describe an ellipse and a
fact which we could see if we had adequate visual organs and a suitable
position not having these advantages but possessing the conception of an
ellipse or to express the meaning in less technical language knowing
what an ellipse was kepler tried whether the observed places of the
planet were consistent with such a path he found they were so and he
consequently asserted as a fact that the planet moved in an ellipse but
this fact which kepler did not add to but found in the motions of the
planet namely that it occupied in succession the various points in the
circumference of a given ellipse was the very fact the separate parts of
which had been separately observed it was the sum of the different
observations
having stated this fundamental difference between my opinion and that of
dr whewell i must add that his account of the manner in which a
conception is selected suitable to express the facts appears to me
perfectly just the experience of all thinkers will i believe testify
that the process is tentative that it consists of a succession of
guesses many being rejected until one at last occurs fit to be chosen
we know from kepler himself that before hitting upon the conception of
an ellipse he tried nineteen other imaginary paths which finding them
inconsistent with the observations he was obliged to reject but as dr
whewell truly says the successful hypothesis though a guess ought
generally to be called not a lucky but a skilful guess the guesses
which serve to give mental unity and wholeness to a chaos of scattered
particulars are accidents which rarely occur to any minds but those
abounding in knowledge and disciplined in intellectual combinations
how far this tentative method so indispensable as a means to the
colligation of facts for purposes of description admits of application to
induction itself and what functions belong to it in that department will
be considered in the chapter of the present book which relates to
hypotheses on the present occasion we have chiefly to distinguish this
process of colligation from induction properly so called and that the
distinction may be made clearer it is well to advert to a curious and
interesting remark which is as strikingly true of the former operation
as it appears to me unequivocally false of the latter
in different stages of the progress of knowledge philosophers have
employed for the colligation of the same order of facts different
conceptions the early rude observations of the heavenly bodies in which
minute precision was neither attained nor sought presented nothing
inconsistent with the representation of the path of a planet as an exact
circle having the earth for its centre as observations increased in
accuracy and facts were disclosed which were not reconcileable with this
simple supposition for the colligation of those additional facts the
supposition was varied and varied again and again as facts became more
numerous and precise the earth was removed from the centre to some other
point within the circle the planet was supposed to revolve in a smaller
circle called an epicycle round an imaginary point which revolved in a
circle round the earth in proportion as observation elicited fresh facts
contradictory to these representations other epicycles and other
excentrics were added producing additional complication until at last
kepler swept all these circles away and substituted the conception of an
exact ellipse even this is found not to represent with complete
correctness the accurate observations of the present day which disclose
many slight deviations from an orbit exactly elliptical now dr whewell
has remarked that these successive general expressions though apparently
so conflicting were all correct they all answered the purpose of
colligation they all enabled the mind to represent to itself with
facility and by a simultaneous glance the whole body of facts at that
time ascertained each in its turn served as a correct description of the
phenomena so far as the senses had up to that time taken cognizance of
them if a necessity afterwards arose for discarding one of these general
descriptions of the planets orbit and framing a different imaginary
line by which to express the series of observed positions it was because
a number of new facts had now been added which it was necessary to
combine with the old facts into one general description but this did not
affect the correctness of the former expression considered as a general
statement of the only facts which it was intended to represent and so
true is this that as is well remarked by m comte these ancient
generalizations even the rudest and most imperfect of them that of
uniform movement in a circle are so far from being entirely false that
they are even now habitually employed by astronomers when only a rough
approximation to correctness is required lastronomie moderne en
dtruisant sans retour les hypothses primitives envisages comme lois
relles du monde a soigneusement maintenu leur valeur positive et
permanente la proprit de reprsenter commodment les phnomnes quand

bien plus tendues precisment  cause que nous ne nous faisons aucune
illusion sur la ralit des hypothses ce qui nous permet demployer sans
scrupule en chaque cas celle que nous jugeons la plus avantageuse58
dr whewells remark therefore is philosophically correct successive
expressions for the colligation of observed facts or in other words
successive descriptions of a phenomenon as a whole which has been
observed only in parts may though conflicting be all correct as far as
they go but it would surely be absurd to assert this of conflicting
inductions
the scientific study of facts may be undertaken for three different
purposes the simple description of the facts their explanation or their
prediction meaning by prediction the determination of the conditions
under which similar facts may be expected again to occur to the first of
these three operations the name of induction does not properly belong to
the other two it does now dr whewells observation is true of the first
alone considered as a mere description the circular theory of the
heavenly motions represents perfectly well their general features and by
adding epicycles without limit those motions even as now known to us
might be expressed with any degree of accuracy that might be required the
elliptical theory as a mere description would have a great advantage in
point of simplicity and in the consequent facility of conceiving it and
reasoning about it but it would not really be more true than the other
different descriptions therefore may be all true but not surely
different explanations the doctrine that the heavenly bodies moved by a
virtue inherent in their celestial nature the doctrine that they were
moved by impact which led to the hypothesis of vortices as the only
impelling force capable of whirling bodies in circles and the newtonian
doctrine that they are moved by the composition of a centripetal with an
original projectile force all these are explanations collected by real
induction from supposed parallel cases and they were all successively
received by philosophers as scientific truths on the subject of the
heavenly bodies can it be said of these as was said of the different
descriptions that they are all true as far as they go is it not clear
that one only can be true in any degree and the other two must be
altogether false so much for explanations let us now compare different
predictions the first that eclipses will occur whenever one planet or
satellite is so situated as to cast its shadow upon another the second
that they will occur whenever some great calamity is impending over
mankind do these two doctrines only differ in the degree of their truth
as expressing real facts with unequal degrees of accuracy assuredly the
one is true and the other absolutely false59
in every way therefore it is evident that to explain induction as the
colligation of facts by means of appropriate conceptions that is
conceptions which will really express them is to confound mere
description of the observed facts with inference from those facts and
ascribe to the latter what is a characteristic property of the former
there is however between colligation and induction a real correlation
which it is important to conceive correctly colligation is not always
induction but induction is always colligation the assertion that the
planets move in ellipses was but a mode of representing observed facts
it was but a colligation while the assertion that they are drawn or
tend towards the sun was the statement of a new fact inferred by
induction but the induction once made accomplishes the purposes of
colligation likewise it brings the same facts which kepler had connected
by his conception of an ellipse under the additional conception of bodies
acted upon by a central force and serves therefore as a new bond of
connexion for those facts a new principle for their classification
further that general description which is improperly confounded with
induction is nevertheless a necessary preparation for induction no less
necessary than correct observation of the facts themselves without the
previous colligation of detached observations by means of one general
conception we could never have obtained any basis for an induction
except in the case of phenomena of very limited compass we should not be
able to affirm any predicates at all of a subject incapable of being
observed otherwise than piecemeal much less could we extend those
predicates by induction to other similar subjects induction therefore
always presupposes not only that the necessary observations are made with
the necessary accuracy but also that the results of these observations
are so far as practicable connected together by general descriptions
enabling the mind to represent to itself as wholes whatever phenomena are
capable of being so represented
 5 dr whewell has replied at some length to the preceding observations
restating his opinions but without as far as i can perceive adding
anything to his former arguments since however mine have not had the
good fortune to make any impression upon him i will subjoin a few
remarks tending to shew more clearly in what our difference of opinion
consists as well as in some measure to account for it
all the definitions of induction by writers of authority make it consist
in drawing inferences from known cases to unknown affirming of a class a
predicate which has been found true of some cases belonging to the class
concluding because some things have a certain property that other things
which resemble them have the same propertyor because a thing has
manifested a property at a certain time that it has and will have that
property at other times
it will scarcely be contended that keplers operation was an induction in
this sense of the term the statement that mars moves in an elliptical
orbit was no generalization from individual cases to a class of cases
neither was it an extension to all time of what had been found true at
some particular time the whole amount of generalization which the case
admitted of was already completed or might have been so long before the
elliptic theory was thought of it had been ascertained that the planets
returned periodically to the same apparent places the series of these
places was or might have been completely determined and the apparent
course of each planet marked out on the celestial globe in an
uninterrupted line kepler did not extend an observed truth to other cases
than those in which it had been observed he did not widen the subject
of the proposition which expressed the observed facts he left the subject
as it was the alteration he made was in the predicate instead of saying
the successive places of mars are so and so he summed them up in the
statement that the successive places of mars are points in an ellipse it
is true this statement as dr whewell says was not the sum of the
observations merely it was the sum of the observations seen under a
new point of view60 but it was not the sum of more than the
observations as a real induction is it took in no cases but those which
had been actually observed or which could have been inferred from the
observations before the new point of view presented itself there was not
that transition from known cases to unknown which constitutes induction
in the original and acknowledged meaning of the term
old definitions it is true cannot prevail against new knowledge and if
the keplerian operation as a logical process were really identical with
what takes place in acknowledged induction the definition of induction
ought to be so widened as to take it in since scientific language ought
to adapt itself to the true relations which subsist between the things it
is employed to designate here then it is that i join issue with dr
whewell he does think the operations identical he allows of no logical
process in any case of induction other than what there was in keplers
case namely guessing until a guess is found which tallies with the
facts and accordingly as we shall see hereafter he rejects all canons
of induction because it is not by means of them that we guess dr
whewells theory of the logic of science would be very perfect if it did
not pass over altogether the question of proof but in my apprehension
there is such a thing as proof and inductions differ altogether from
descriptions in their relation to that element induction is proof it is
inferring something unobserved from something observed it requires
therefore an appropriate test of proof and to provide that test is the
special purpose of inductive logic when on the contrary we merely
collate known observations and in dr whewells phraseology connect
them by means of a new conception if the conception does but serve to
connect the observations we have all we want as the proposition in which
it is embodied pretends to no other truth than what it may share with many
other modes of representing the same facts to be consistent with the
facts is all it requires it neither needs nor admits of proof though it
may serve to prove other things inasmuch as by placing the facts in
mental connexion with other facts not previously seen to resemble them
it assimilates the case to another class of phenomena concerning which
real inductions have already been made thus keplers socalled law
brought the orbit of mars into the class ellipse and by doing so proved
all the properties of an ellipse to be true of the orbit but in this
proof keplers law supplied the minor premiss and not as is the case
with real inductions the major
the mental operation which extracts from a number of detached observations
certain general characters in which the observed phenomena resemble one
another or resemble other known facts is what bacon locke and most
subsequent metaphysicians have understood by the word abstraction a
general expression obtained by abstraction connecting known facts by
means of common characters but without concluding from them to unknown
may i think with strict logical correctness be termed a description
nor do i know in what other way things can ever be described my position
however does not depend on the employment of that particular word i am
quite content to use dr whewells term colligation provided it be
clearly seen that the process is not induction but something radically
different
what more may usefully be said on the subject of colligation or of the
correlative expression invented by dr whewell the explication of
conceptions and generally on the subject of ideas and mental
representations as connected with the study of facts will find a more
appropriate place in the fourth book on the operations subsidiary to
induction to which the reader must refer for the removal of any
difficulty which the present discussion may have left
chapter iii of the ground of induction
 1 induction properly so called as distinguished from those mental
operations sometimes though improperly designated by the name which i
have attempted in the preceding chapter to characterize may then be
summarily defined as generalization from experience it consists in
inferring from some individual instances in which a phenomenon is observed
to occur that it occurs in all instances of a certain class namely in
all which resemble the former in what are regarded as the material
circumstances
in what way the material circumstances are to be distinguished from those
which are immaterial or why some of the circumstances are material and
others not so we are not yet ready to point out we must first observe
that there is a principle implied in the very statement of what induction
is an assumption with regard to the course of nature and the order of the
universe namely that there are such things in nature as parallel cases
that what happens once will under a sufficient degree of similarity of
circumstances happen again and not only again but as often as the same
circumstances recur this i say is an assumption involved in every case
of induction and if we consult the actual course of nature we find that
the assumption is warranted the universe we find is so constituted
that whatever is true in any one case is true in all cases of a certain
description the only difficulty is to find what description
this universal fact which is our warrant for all inferences from
experience has been described by different philosophers in different
forms of language that the course of nature is uniform that the universe
is governed by general laws and the like one of the most usual of these
modes of expression but also one of the most inadequate is that which
has been brought into familiar use by the metaphysicians of the school of
reid and stewart the disposition of the human mind to generalize from
experiencea propensity considered by these philosophers as an instinct
of our naturethey usually describe under some such name as our
intuitive conviction that the future will resemble the past now it has
been well pointed out that whether the tendency be or not an original
and ultimate element of our nature time in its modifications of past
present and future has no concern either with the belief itself or with
the grounds of it we believe that fire will burn tomorrow because it
burned today and yesterday but we believe on precisely the same
grounds that it burned before we were born and that it burns this very
day in cochinchina it is not from the past to the future as past and
future that we infer but from the known to the unknown from facts
observed to facts unobserved from what we have perceived or been
directly conscious of to what has not come within our experience in this
last predicament is the whole region of the future but also the vastly
greater portion of the present and of the past
whatever be the most proper mode of expressing it the proposition that
the course of nature is uniform is the fundamental principle or general
axiom of induction it would yet be a great error to offer this large
generalization as any explanation of the inductive process on the
contrary i hold it to be itself an instance of induction and induction
by no means of the most obvious kind far from being the first induction
we make it is one of the last or at all events one of those which are
latest in attaining strict philosophical accuracy as a general maxim
indeed it has scarcely entered into the minds of any but philosophers
nor even by them as we shall have many opportunities of remarking have
its extent and limits been always very justly conceived the truth is
that this great generalization is itself founded on prior generalizations
the obscurer laws of nature were discovered by means of it but the more
obvious ones must have been understood and assented to as general truths
before it was ever heard of we should never have thought of affirming
that all phenomena take place according to general laws if we had not
first arrived in the case of a great multitude of phenomena at some
knowledge of the laws themselves which could be done no otherwise than by
induction in what sense then can a principle which is so far from
being our earliest induction be regarded as our warrant for all the
others in the only sense in which as we have already seen the general
propositions which we place at the head of our reasonings when we throw
them into syllogisms ever really contribute to their validity as
archbishop whately remarks every induction is a syllogism with the major
premiss suppressed or as i prefer expressing it every induction may be
thrown into the form of a syllogism by supplying a major premiss if this
be actually done the principle which we are now considering that of the
uniformity of the course of nature will appear as the ultimate major
premiss of all inductions and will therefore stand to all inductions in
the relation in which as has been shown at so much length the major
proposition of a syllogism always stands to the conclusion not
contributing at all to prove it but being a necessary condition of its
being proved since no conclusion is proved for which there cannot be
found a true major premiss
the statement that the uniformity of the course of nature is the ultimate
major premiss in all cases of induction may be thought to require some
explanation the immediate major premiss in every inductive argument it
certainly is not of that archbishop whatelys must be held to be the
correct account the induction john peter c are mortal therefore
all mankind are mortal may as he justly says be thrown into a
syllogism by prefixing as a major premiss what is at any rate a necessary
condition of the validity of the argument namely that what is true of
john peter c is true of all mankind but how come we by this major
premiss it is not selfevident nay in all cases of unwarranted
generalization it is not true how then is it arrived at necessarily
either by induction or ratiocination and if by induction the process
like all other inductive arguments may be thrown into the form of a
syllogism this previous syllogism it is therefore necessary to
construct there is in the long run only one possible construction the
real proof that what is true of john peter c is true of all mankind
can only be that a different supposition would be inconsistent with the
uniformity which we know to exist in the course of nature whether there
would be this inconsistency or not may be a matter of long and delicate
inquiry but unless there would we have no sufficient ground for the
major of the inductive syllogism it hence appears that if we throw the
whole course of any inductive argument into a series of syllogisms we
shall arrive by more or fewer steps at an ultimate syllogism which will
have for its major premiss the principle or axiom of the uniformity of
the course of nature61
it was not to be expected that in the case of this axiom any more than of
other axioms there should be unanimity among thinkers with respect to the
grounds on which it is to be received as true i have already stated that
i regard it as itself a generalization from experience others hold it to
be a principle which antecedently to any verification by experience we
are compelled by the constitution of our thinking faculty to assume as
true having so recently and at so much length combated a similar
doctrine as applied to the axioms of mathematics by arguments which are
in a great measure applicable to the present case i shall defer the more
particular discussion of this controverted point in regard to the
fundamental axiom of induction until a more advanced period of our
inquiry62 at present it is of more importance to understand thoroughly
the import of the axiom itself for the proposition that the course of
nature is uniform possesses rather the brevity suitable to popular than
the precision requisite in philosophical language its terms require to
be explained and a stricter than their ordinary signification given to
them before the truth of the assertion can be admitted
 2 every persons consciousness assures him that he does not always
expect uniformity in the course of events he does not always believe that
the unknown will be similar to the known that the future will resemble
the past nobody believes that the succession of rain and fine weather
will be the same in every future year as in the present nobody expects to
have the same dreams repeated every night on the contrary everybody
mentions it as something extraordinary if the course of nature is
constant and resembles itself in these particulars to look for
constancy where constancy is not to be expected as for instance that a
day which has once brought good fortune will always be a fortunate day is
justly accounted superstition
the course of nature in truth is not only uniform it is also infinitely
various some phenomena are always seen to recur in the very same
combinations in which we met with them at first others seem altogether
capricious while some which we had been accustomed to regard as bound
down exclusively to a particular set of combinations we unexpectedly find
detached from some of the elements with which we had hitherto found them
conjoined and united to others of quite a contrary description to an
inhabitant of central africa fifty years ago no fact probably appeared
to rest on more uniform experience than this that all human beings are
black to europeans not many years ago the proposition all swans are
white appeared an equally unequivocal instance of uniformity in the
course of nature further experience has proved to both that they were
mistaken but they had to wait fifty centuries for this experience during
that long time mankind believed in an uniformity of the course of nature
where no such uniformity really existed
according to the notion which the ancients entertained of induction the
foregoing were cases of as legitimate inference as any inductions
whatever in these two instances in which the conclusion being false
the ground of inference must have been insufficient there was
nevertheless as much ground for it as this conception of induction
admitted of the induction of the ancients has been well described by
bacon under the name of inductio per enumerationem simplicem ubi non
reperitur instantia contradictoria it consists in ascribing the
character of general truths to all propositions which are true in every
instance that we happen to know of this is the kind of induction which is
natural to the mind when unaccustomed to scientific methods the tendency
which some call an instinct and which others account for by association
to infer the future from the past the known from the unknown is simply a
habit of expecting that what has been found true once or several times
and never yet found false will be found true again whether the instances
are few or many conclusive or inconclusive does not much affect the
matter these are considerations which occur only on reflection the
unprompted tendency of the mind is to generalize its experience provided
this points all in one direction provided no other experience of a
conflicting character comes unsought the notion of seeking it of
experimenting for it of interrogating nature to use bacons
expression is of much later growth the observation of nature by
uncultivated intellects is purely passive they accept the facts which
present themselves without taking the trouble of searching for more it
is a superior mind only which asks itself what facts are needed to enable
it to come to a sure conclusion and then looks out for these
but though we have always a propensity to generalize from unvarying
experience we are not always warranted in doing so before we can be at
liberty to conclude that something is universally true because we have
never known an instance to the contrary we must have reason to believe
that if there were in nature any instances to the contrary we should have
known of them this assurance in the great majority of cases we cannot
have or can have only in a very moderate degree the possibility of
having it is the foundation on which we shall see hereafter that
induction by simple enumeration may in some remarkable cases amount
practically to proof63 no such assurance however can be had on any
of the ordinary subjects of scientific inquiry popular notions are
usually founded on induction by simple enumeration in science it carries
us but a little way we are forced to begin with it we must often rely on
it provisionally in the absence of means of more searching investigation
but for the accurate study of nature we require a surer and a more
potent instrument
it was above all by pointing out the insufficiency of this rude and
loose conception of induction that bacon merited the title so generally
awarded to him of founder of the inductive philosophy the value of his
own contributions to a more philosophical theory of the subject has
certainly been exaggerated although along with some fundamental errors
his writings contain more or less fully developed several of the most
important principles of the inductive method physical investigation has
now far outgrown the baconian conception of induction moral and political
inquiry indeed are as yet far behind that conception the current and
approved modes of reasoning on these subjects are still of the same
vicious description against which bacon protested the method almost
exclusively employed by those professing to treat such matters
inductively is the very inductio per enumerationem simplicem which he
condemns and the experience which we hear so confidently appealed to by
all sects parties and interests is still in his own emphatic words
mera palpatio
 3 in order to a better understanding of the problem which the logician
must solve if he would establish a scientific theory of induction let us
compare a few cases of incorrect inductions with others which are
acknowledged to be legitimate some we know which were believed for
centuries to be correct were nevertheless incorrect that all swans are
white cannot have been a good induction since the conclusion has turned
out erroneous the experience however on which the conclusion rested was
genuine from the earliest records the testimony of the inhabitants of
the known world was unanimous on the point the uniform experience
therefore of the inhabitants of the known world agreeing in a common
result without one known instance of deviation from that result is not
always sufficient to establish a general conclusion
but let us now turn to an instance apparently not very dissimilar to this
mankind were wrong it seems in concluding that all swans were white are
we also wrong when we conclude that all mens heads grow above their
shoulders and never below in spite of the conflicting testimony of the
naturalist pliny as there were black swans though civilized people had
existed for three thousand years on the earth without meeting with them
may there not also be men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders
notwithstanding a rather less perfect unanimity of negative testimony from
observers most persons would answer no it was more credible that a bird
should vary in its colour than that men should vary in the relative
position of their principal organs and there is no doubt that in so
saying they would be right but to say why they are right would be
impossible without entering more deeply than is usually done into the
true theory of induction
again there are cases in which we reckon with the most unfailing
confidence upon uniformity and other cases in which we do not count upon
it at all in some we feel complete assurance that the future will
resemble the past the unknown be precisely similar to the known in
others however invariable may be the result obtained from the instances
which have been observed we draw from them no more than a very feeble
presumption that the like result will hold in all other cases that a
straight line is the shortest distance between two points we do not doubt
to be true even in the region of the fixed stars when a chemist announces
the existence and properties of a newlydiscovered substance if we
confide in his accuracy we feel assured that the conclusions he has
arrived at will hold universally although the induction be founded but on
a single instance we do not withhold our assent waiting for a repetition
of the experiment or if we do it is from a doubt whether the one
experiment was properly made not whether if properly made it would be
conclusive here then is a general law of nature inferred without
hesitation from a single instance an universal proposition from a
singular one now mark another case and contrast it with this not all
the instances which have been observed since the beginning of the world
in support of the general proposition that all crows are black would be
deemed a sufficient presumption of the truth of the proposition to
outweigh the testimony of one unexceptionable witness who should affirm
that in some region of the earth not fully explored he had caught and
examined a crow and had found it to be grey
why is a single instance in some cases sufficient for a complete
induction while in others myriads of concurring instances without a
single exception known or presumed go such a very little way towards
establishing an universal proposition whoever can answer this question
knows more of the philosophy of logic than the wisest of the ancients and
has solved the problem of induction
chapter iv of laws of nature
 1 in the contemplation of that uniformity in the course of nature
which is assumed in every inference from experience one of the first
observations that present themselves is that the uniformity in question
is not properly uniformity but uniformities the general regularity
results from the coexistence of partial regularities the course of
nature in general is constant because the course of each of the various
phenomena that compose it is so a certain fact invariably occurs whenever
certain circumstances are present and does not occur when they are
absent the like is true of another fact and so on from these separate
threads of connexion between parts of the great whole which we term
nature a general tissue of connexion unavoidably weaves itself by which
the whole is held together if a is always accompanied by d b by e and c
by f it follows that a b is accompanied by d e a c by d f b c by e f
and finally a b c by d e f and thus the general character of regularity
is produced which along with and in the midst of infinite diversity
pervades all nature
the first point therefore to be noted in regard to what is called the
uniformity of the course of nature is that it is itself a complex fact
compounded of all the separate uniformities which exist in respect to
single phenomena these various uniformities when ascertained by what is
regarded as a sufficient induction we call in common parlance laws of
nature scientifically speaking that title is employed in a more
restricted sense to designate the uniformities when reduced to their most
simple expression thus in the illustration already employed there were
seven uniformities all of which if considered sufficiently certain
would in the more lax application of the term be called laws of nature
but of the seven three alone are properly distinct and independent these
being presupposed the others follow of course the three first
therefore according to the stricter acceptation are called laws of
nature the remainder not because they are in truth mere cases of the
three first virtually included in them said therefore to result from
them whoever affirms those three has already affirmed all the rest
to substitute real examples for symbolical ones the following are three
uniformities or call them laws of nature the law that air has weight
the law that pressure on a fluid is propagated equally in all directions
and the law that pressure in one direction not opposed by equal pressure
in the contrary direction produces motion which does not cease until
equilibrium is restored from these three uniformities we should be able
to predict another uniformity namely the rise of the mercury in the
torricellian tube this in the stricter use of the phrase is not a law
of nature it is a result of laws of nature it is a case of each and
every one of the three laws and is the only occurrence by which they
could all be fulfilled if the mercury were not sustained in the
barometer and sustained at such a height that the column of mercury were
equal in weight to a column of the atmosphere of the same diameter here
would be a case either of the air not pressing upon the surface of the
mercury with the force which is called its weight or of the downward
pressure on the mercury not being propagated equally in an upward
direction or of a body pressed in one direction and not in the direction
opposite either not moving in the direction in which it is pressed or
stopping before it had attained equilibrium if we knew therefore the
three simple laws but had never tried the torricellian experiment we
might deduce its result from those laws the known weight of the air
combined with the position of the apparatus would bring the mercury
within the first of the three inductions the first induction would bring
it within the second and the second within the third in the manner which
we characterized in treating of ratiocination we should thus come to know
the more complex uniformity independently of specific experience through
our knowledge of the simpler ones from which it results although for
reasons which will appear hereafter verification by specific experience
would still be desirable and might possibly be indispensable
complex uniformities which like this are mere cases of simpler ones and
have therefore been virtually affirmed in affirming those may with
propriety be called laws but can scarcely in the strictness of
scientific speech be termed laws of nature it is the custom in science
wherever regularity of any kind can be traced to call the general
proposition which expresses the nature of that regularity a law as
when in mathematics we speak of the law of decrease of the successive
terms of a converging series but the expression law of nature has
generally been employed with a sort of tacit reference to the original
sense of the word law namely the expression of the will of a superior
when therefore it appeared that any of the uniformities which were
observed in nature would result spontaneously from certain other
uniformities no separate act of creative will being supposed necessary
for the production of the derivative uniformities these have not usually
been spoken of as laws of nature according to another mode of expression
the question what are the laws of nature may be stated thuswhat are
the fewest and simplest assumptions which being granted the whole
existing order of nature would result another mode of stating it would be
thus what are the fewest general propositions from which all the
uniformities which exist in the universe might be deductively inferred
every great advance which marks an epoch in the progress of science has
consisted in a step made towards the solution of this problem even a
simple colligation of inductions already made without any fresh extension
of the inductive inference is already an advance in that direction when
kepler expressed the regularity which exists in the observed motions of
the heavenly bodies by the three general propositions called his laws
he in so doing pointed out three simple suppositions which instead of a
much greater number would suffice to construct the whole scheme of the
heavenly motions so far as it was known up to that time a similar and
still greater step was made when these laws which at first did not seem
to be included in any more general truths were discovered to be cases of
the three laws of motion as obtaining among bodies which mutually tend
towards one another with a certain force and have had a certain
instantaneous impulse originally impressed upon them after this great
discovery keplers three propositions though still called laws would
hardly by any person accustomed to use language with precision be termed
laws of nature that phrase would be reserved for the simpler laws into
which newton is said to have resolved them
according to this language every wellgrounded inductive generalization
is either a law of nature or a result of laws of nature capable if
those laws are known of being predicted from them and the problem of
inductive logic may be summed up in two questions how to ascertain the
laws of nature and how after having ascertained them to follow them
into their results on the other hand we must not suffer ourselves to
imagine that this mode of statement amounts to a real analysis or to
anything but a mere verbal transformation of the problem for the
expression laws of nature means nothing but the uniformities which
exist among natural phenomena or in other words the results of
induction when reduced to their simplest expression it is however
something to have advanced so far as to see that the study of nature is
the study of laws not a law of uniformities in the plural number
that the different natural phenomena have their separate rules or modes of
taking place which though much intermixed and entangled with one
another may to a certain extent be studied apart that to resume our
former metaphor the regularity which exists in nature is a web composed
of distinct threads and only to be understood by tracing each of the
threads separately for which purpose it is often necessary to unravel
some portion of the web and exhibit the fibres apart the rules of
experimental inquiry are the contrivances for unravelling the web
 2 in thus attempting to ascertain the general order of nature by
ascertaining the particular order of the occurrence of each one of the
phenomena of nature the most scientific proceeding can be no more than an
improved form of that which was primitively pursued by the human
understanding while undirected by science when mankind first formed the
idea of studying phenomena according to a stricter and surer method than
that which they had in the first instance spontaneously adopted they did
not conformably to the well meant but impracticable precept of descartes
set out from the supposition that nothing had been already ascertained
many of the uniformities existing among phenomena are so constant and so
open to observation as to force themselves upon involuntary recognition
some facts are so perpetually and familiarly accompanied by certain
others that mankind learnt as children learn to expect the one where
they found the other long before they knew how to put their expectation
into words by asserting in a proposition the existence of a connexion
between those phenomena no science was needed to teach that food
nourishes that water drowns or quenches thirst that the sun gives light
and heat that bodies fall to the ground the first scientific inquirers
assumed these and the like as known truths and set out from them to
discover others which were unknown nor were they wrong in so doing
subject however as they afterwards began to see to an ulterior revision
of these spontaneous generalizations themselves when the progress of
knowledge pointed out limits to them or showed their truth to be
contingent on some other circumstance not originally attended to it will
appear i think from the subsequent part of our inquiry that there is no
logical fallacy in this mode of proceeding but we may see already that
any other mode is rigorously impracticable since it is impossible to
frame any scientific method of induction or test of the correctness of
inductions unless on the hypothesis that some inductions deserving of
reliance have been already made
let us revert for instance to one of our former illustrations and
consider why it is that with exactly the same amount of evidence both
negative and positive we did not reject the assertion that there are
black swans while we should refuse credence to any testimony which
asserted that there were men wearing their heads underneath their
shoulders the first assertion was more credible than the latter but why
more credible so long as neither phenomenon had been actually witnessed
what reason was there for finding the one harder to be believed than the
other apparently because there is less constancy in the colours of
animals than in the general structure of their internal anatomy but how
do we know this doubtless from experience it appears then that we
need experience to inform us in what degree and in what cases or sorts
of cases experience is to be relied on experience must be consulted in
order to learn from it under what circumstances arguments from it will be
valid we have no ulterior test to which we subject experience in general
but we make experience its own test experience testifies that among the
uniformities which it exhibits or seems to exhibit some are more to be
relied on than others and uniformity therefore may be presumed from
any given number of instances with a greater degree of assurance in
proportion as the case belongs to a class in which the uniformities have
hitherto been found more uniform
this mode of correcting one generalization by means of another a narrower
generalization by a wider which common sense suggests and adopts in
practice is the real type of scientific induction all that art can do is
but to give accuracy and precision to this process and adapt it to all
varieties of cases without any essential alteration in its principle
there are of course no means of applying such a test as that above
described unless we already possess a general knowledge of the prevalent
character of the uniformities existing throughout nature the
indispensable foundation therefore of a scientific formula of induction
must be a survey of the inductions to which mankind have been conducted in
unscientific practice with the special purpose of ascertaining what kinds
of uniformities have been found perfectly invariable pervading all
nature and what are those which have been found to vary with difference
of time place or other changeable circumstances
 3 the necessity of such a survey is confirmed by the consideration
that the stronger inductions are the touchstone to which we always
endeavour to bring the weaker if we find any means of deducing one of the
less strong inductions from stronger ones it acquires at once all the
strength of those from which it is deduced and even adds to that
strength since the independent experience on which the weaker induction
previously rested becomes additional evidence of the truth of the better
established law in which it is now found to be included we may have
inferred from historical evidence that the uncontrolled power of a
monarch of an aristocracy or of the majority will often be abused but
we are entitled to rely on this generalization with much greater assurance
when it is shown to be a corollary from still better established facts
the very low degree of elevation of character ever yet attained by the
average of mankind and the little efficacy for the most part of the
modes of education hitherto practised in maintaining the predominance of
reason and conscience over the selfish propensities it is at the same
time obvious that even these more general facts derive an accession of
evidence from the testimony which history bears to the effects of
despotism the strong induction becomes still stronger when a weaker one
has been bound up with it
on the other hand if an induction conflicts with stronger inductions or
with conclusions capable of being correctly deduced from them then
unless on reconsideration it should appear that some of the stronger
inductions have been expressed with greater universality than their
evidence warrants the weaker one must give way the opinion so long
prevalent that a comet or any other unusual appearance in the heavenly
regions was the precursor of calamities to mankind or to those at least
who witnessed it the belief in the veracity of the oracles of delphi or
dodona the reliance on astrology or on the weatherprophecies in
almanacs were doubtless inductions supposed to be grounded on
experience64 and faith in such delusions seems quite capable of holding
out against a great multitude of failures provided it be nourished by a
reasonable number of casual coincidences between the prediction and the
event what has really put an end to these insufficient inductions is
their inconsistency with the stronger inductions subsequently obtained by
scientific inquiry respecting the causes on which terrestrial events
really depend and where those scientific truths have not yet penetrated
the same or similar delusions still prevail
it may be affirmed as a general principle that all inductions whether
strong or weak which can be connected by a ratiocination are
confirmatory of one another while any which lead deductively to
consequences that are incompatible become mutually each others test
showing that one or other must be given up or at least more guardedly
expressed in the case of inductions which confirm each other the one
which becomes a conclusion from ratiocination rises to at least the level
of certainty of the weakest of those from which it is deduced while in
general all are more or less increased in certainty thus the torricellian
experiment though a mere case of three more general laws not only
strengthened greatly the evidence on which those laws rested but
converted one of them the weight of the atmosphere from a doubtful
generalization into one of the bestestablished doctrines in the range of
physical science
if then a survey of the uniformities which have been ascertained to
exist in nature should point out some which as far as any human purpose
requires certainty may be considered as quite certain and quite
universal then by means of these uniformities we may be able to raise
multitudes of other inductions to the same point in the scale for if we
can show with respect to any induction that either it must be true or
one of these certain and universal inductions must admit of an exception
the former generalization will attain the same certainty and
indefeasibleness within the bounds assigned to it which are the
attributes of the latter it will be proved to be a law and if not a
result of other and simpler laws it will be a law of nature
there are such certain and universal inductions and it is because there
are such that a logic of induction is possible
chapter v of the law of universal causation
 1 the phenomena of nature exist in two distinct relations to one
another that of simultaneity and that of succession every phenomenon is
related in an uniform manner to some phenomena that coexist with it and
to some that have preceded or will follow it
of the uniformities which exist among synchronous phenomena the most
important on every account are the laws of number and next to them
those of space or in other words of extension and figure the laws of
number are common to synchronous and successive phenomena that two and
two make four is equally true whether the second two follow the first two
or accompany them it is as true of days and years as of feet and inches
the laws of extension and figure in other words the theorems of
geometry from its lowest to its highest branches are on the contrary
laws of simultaneous phenomena only the various parts of space and of
the objects which are said to fill space coexist and the unvarying laws
which are the subject of the science of geometry are an expression of the
mode of their coexistence
this is a class of laws or in other words of uniformities for the
comprehension and proof of which it is not necessary to suppose any lapse
of time any variety of facts or events succeeding one another if all the
objects in the universe were unchangeably fixed and had remained in that
condition from eternity the propositions of geometry would still be true
of those objects all things which possess extension or in other words
which fill space are subject to geometrical laws possessing extension
they possess figure possessing figure they must possess some figure in
particular and have all the properties which geometry assigns to that
figure if one body be a sphere and another a cylinder of equal height
and diameter the one will be exactly twothirds of the other let the
nature and quality of the material be what it will again each body and
each point of a body must occupy some place or position among other
bodies and the position of two bodies relatively to each other of
whatever nature the bodies be may be unerringly inferred from the
position of each of them relatively to any third body
in the laws of number then and in those of space we recognise in the
most unqualified manner the rigorous universality of which we are in
quest those laws have been in all ages the type of certainty the
standard of comparison for all inferior degrees of evidence their
invariability is so perfect that we are unable even to conceive any
exception to them and philosophers have been led although as i have
endeavoured to show erroneously to consider their evidence as lying not
in experience but in the original constitution of the intellect if
therefore from the laws of space and number we were able to deduce
uniformities of any other description this would be conclusive evidence
to us that those other uniformities possessed the same degree of rigorous
certainty but this we cannot do from laws of space and number alone
nothing can be deduced but laws of space and number
of all truths relating to phenomena the most valuable to us are those
which relate to the order of their succession on a knowledge of these is
founded every reasonable anticipation of future facts and whatever power
we possess of influencing those facts to our advantage even the laws of
geometry are chiefly of practical importance to us as being a portion of
the premisses from which the order of the succession of phenomena may be
inferred inasmuch as the motion of bodies the action of forces and the
propagation of influences of all sorts take place in certain lines and
over definite spaces the properties of those lines and spaces are an
important part of the laws to which those phenomena are themselves
subject again motions forces or other influences and times are
numerable quantities and the properties of number are applicable to them
as to all other things but though the laws of number and space are
important elements in the ascertainment of uniformities of succession
they can do nothing towards it when taken by themselves they can only be
made instrumental to that purpose when we combine with them additional
premisses expressive of uniformities of succession already known by
taking for instance as premisses these propositions that bodies acted
upon by an instantaneous force move with uniform velocity in straight
lines that bodies acted upon by a continuous force move with accelerated
velocity in straight lines and that bodies acted upon by two forces in
different directions move in the diagonal of a parallelogram whose sides
represent the direction and quantity of those forces we may by combining
these truths with propositions relating to the properties of straight
lines and of parallelograms as that a triangle is half of a
parallelogram of the same base and altitude deduce another important
uniformity of succession viz that a body moving round a centre of force
describes areas proportional to the times but unless there had been laws
of succession in our premisses there could have been no truths of
succession in our conclusions a similar remark might be extended to every
other class of phenomena really peculiar and had it been attended to
would have prevented many chimerical attempts at demonstrations of the
indemonstrable and explanations which do not explain
it is not therefore enough for us that the laws of space which are only
laws of simultaneous phenomena and the laws of number which though true
of successive phenomena do not relate to their succession possess the
rigorous certainty and universality of which we are in search we must
endeavour to find some law of succession which has those same attributes
and is therefore fit to be made the foundation of processes for
discovering and of a test for verifying all other uniformities of
succession this fundamental law must resemble the truths of geometry in
their most remarkable peculiarity that of never being in any instance
whatever defeated or suspended by any change of circumstances
now among all those uniformities in the succession of phenomena which
common observation is sufficient to bring to light there are very few
which have any even apparent pretension to this rigorous
indefeasibility and of those few one only has been found capable of
completely sustaining it in that one however we recognise a law which
is universal also in another sense it is coextensive with the entire
field of successive phenomena all instances whatever of succession being
examples of it this law is the law of causation the truth that every
fact which has a beginning has a cause is coextensive with human
experience
this generalization may appear to some minds not to amount to much since
after all it asserts only this it is a law that every event depends on
some law we must not however conclude that the generality of the
principle is merely verbal it will be found on inspection to be no vague
or unmeaning assertion but a most important and really fundamental truth
 2 the notion of cause being the root of the whole theory of induction
it is indispensable that this idea should at the very outset of our
inquiry be with the utmost practicable degree of precision fixed and
determined if indeed it were necessary for the purpose of inductive
logic that the strife should be quelled which has so long raged among the
different schools of metaphysicians respecting the origin and analysis of
our idea of causation the promulgation or at least the general
reception of a true theory of induction might be considered desperate
for a long time to come but the science of the investigation of truth by
means of evidence is happily independent of many of the controversies
which perplex the science of the ultimate constitution of the human mind
and is under no necessity of pushing the analysis of mental phenomena to
that extreme limit which alone ought to satisfy a metaphysician
i premise then that when in the course of this inquiry i speak of the
cause of any phenomenon i do not mean a cause which is not itself a
phenomenon i make no research into the ultimate or ontological cause of
anything to adopt a distinction familiar in the writings of the scotch
metaphysicians and especially of reid the causes with which i concern
myself are not efficient but physical causes they are causes in that
sense alone in which one physical fact is said to be the cause of
another of the efficient causes of phenomena or whether any such causes
exist at all i am not called upon to give an opinion the notion of
causation is deemed by the schools of metaphysics most in vogue at the
present moment to imply a mysterious and most powerful tie such as
cannot or at least does not exist between any physical fact and that
other physical fact on which it is invariably consequent and which is
popularly termed its cause and thence is deduced the supposed necessity
of ascending higher into the essences and inherent constitution of
things to find the true cause the cause which is not only followed by
but actually produces the effect no such necessity exists for the
purposes of the present inquiry nor will any such doctrine be found in
the following pages but neither will there be found anything incompatible
with it we are in no way concerned in the question the only notion of a
cause which the theory of induction requires is such a notion as can be
gained from experience the law of causation the recognition of which is
the main pillar of inductive science is but the familiar truth that
invariability of succession is found by observation to obtain between
every fact in nature and some other fact which has preceded it
independently of all consideration respecting the ultimate mode of
production of phenomena and of every other question regarding the nature
of things in themselves
between the phenomena then which exist at any instant and the phenomena
which exist at the succeeding instant there is an invariable order of
succession and as we said in speaking of the general uniformity of the
course of nature this web is composed of separate fibres this collective
order is made up of particular sequences obtaining invariably among the
separate parts to certain facts certain facts always do and as we
believe will continue to succeed the invariable antecedent is termed
the cause the invariable consequent the effect and the universality of
the law of causation consists in this that every consequent is connected
in this manner with some particular antecedent or set of antecedents let
the fact be what it may if it has begun to exist it was preceded by some
fact or facts with which it is invariably connected for every event
there exists some combination of objects or events some given concurrence
of circumstances positive and negative the occurrence of which is always
followed by that phenomenon we may not have found out what this
concurrence of circumstances may be but we never doubt that there is such
a one and that it never occurs without having the phenomenon in question
as its effect or consequence on the universality of this truth depends
the possibility of reducing the inductive process to rules the undoubted
assurance we have that there is a law to be found if we only knew how to
find it will be seen presently to be the source from which the canons of
the inductive logic derive their validity
 3 it is seldom if ever between a consequent and a single antecedent
that this invariable sequence subsists it is usually between a consequent
and the sum of several antecedents the concurrence of all of them being
requisite to produce that is to be certain of being followed by the
consequent in such cases it is very common to single out one only of the
antecedents under the denomination of cause calling the others merely
conditions thus if a person eats of a particular dish and dies in
consequence that is would not have died if he had not eaten of it
people would be apt to say that eating of that dish was the cause of his
death there needs not however be any invariable connexion between
eating of the dish and death but there certainly is among the
circumstances which took place some combination or other on which death
is invariably consequent as for instance the act of eating of the dish
combined with a particular bodily constitution a particular state of
present health and perhaps even a certain state of the atmosphere the
whole of which circumstances perhaps constituted in this particular case
the conditions of the phenomenon or in other words the set of
antecedents which determined it and but for which it would not have
happened the real cause is the whole of these antecedents and we have
philosophically speaking no right to give the name of cause to one of
them exclusively of the others what in the case we have supposed
disguises the incorrectness of the expression is this that the various
conditions except the single one of eating the food were not events
that is instantaneous changes or successions of instantaneous changes
but states possessing more or less of permanency and might therefore
have preceded the effect by an indefinite length of duration for want of
the event which was requisite to complete the required concurrence of
conditions while as soon as that event eating the food occurs no other
cause is waited for but the effect begins immediately to take place and
hence the appearance is presented of a more immediate and close connexion
between the effect and that one antecedent than between the effect and
the remaining conditions but though we may think proper to give the name
of cause to that one condition the fulfilment of which completes the
tale and brings about the effect without further delay this condition
has really no closer relation to the effect than any of the other
conditions has the production of the consequent required that they should
all exist immediately previous though not that they should all begin
to exist immediately previous the statement of the cause is incomplete
unless in some shape or other we introduce all the conditions a man takes
mercury goes out of doors and catches cold we say perhaps that the
cause of his taking cold was exposure to the air it is clear however
that his having taken mercury may have been a necessary condition of his
catching cold and though it might consist with usage to say that the
cause of his attack was exposure to the air to be accurate we ought to
say that the cause was exposure to the air while under the effect of
mercury
if we do not when aiming at accuracy enumerate all the conditions it is
only because some of them will in most cases be understood without being
expressed or because for the purpose in view they may without detriment
be overlooked for example when we say the cause of a mans death was
that his foot slipped in climbing a ladder we omit as a thing unnecessary
to be stated the circumstance of his weight though quite as indispensable
a condition of the effect which took place when we say that the assent of
the crown to a bill makes it law we mean that the assent being never
given until all the other conditions are fulfilled makes up the sum of
the conditions though no one now regards it as the principal one when
the decision of a legislative assembly has been determined by the casting
vote of the chairman we sometimes say that this one person was the cause
of all the effects which resulted from the enactment yet we do not really
suppose that his single vote contributed more to the result than that of
any other person who voted in the affirmative but for the purpose we
have in view which is to insist on his share of the responsibility the
part which any other person had in the transaction is not material
in all these instances the fact which was dignified by the name of cause
was the one condition which came last into existence but it must not be
supposed that in the employment of the term this or any other rule is
always adhered to nothing can better shew the absence of any scientific
ground for the distinction between the cause of a phenomenon and its
conditions than the capricious manner in which we select from among the
conditions that which we choose to denominate the cause however numerous
the conditions may be there is hardly any of them which may not
according to the purpose of our immediate discourse obtain that nominal
preeminence this will be seen by analysing the conditions of some one
familiar phenomenon for example a stone thrown into water falls to the
bottom what are the conditions of this event in the first place there
must be a stone and water and the stone must be thrown into the water
but these suppositions forming part of the enunciation of the phenomenon
itself to include them also among the conditions would be a vicious
tautology and this class of conditions therefore have never received
the name of cause from any but the schoolmen by whom they were called the
material cause causa materialis the next condition is there must be
an earth and accordingly it is often said that the fall of a stone is
caused by the earth or by a power or property of the earth or a force
exerted by the earth all of which are merely roundabout ways of saying
that it is caused by the earth or lastly the earths attraction which
also is only a technical mode of saying that the earth causes the motion
with the additional particularity that the motion is towards the earth
which is not a character of the cause but of the effect let us now pass
to another condition it is not enough that the earth should exist the
body must be within that distance from it in which the earths attraction
preponderates over that of any other body accordingly we may say and the
expression would be confessedly correct that the cause of the stones
falling is its being within the sphere of the earths attraction we
proceed to a further condition the stone is immersed in water it is
therefore a condition of its reaching the ground that its specific
gravity exceed that of the surrounding fluid or in other words that it
surpass in weight an equal volume of water accordingly any one would be
acknowledged to speak correctly who said that the cause of the stones
going to the bottom is its exceeding in specific gravity the fluid in
which it is immersed
thus we see that each and every condition of the phenomenon may be taken
in its turn and with equal propriety in common parlance but with equal
impropriety in scientific discourse may be spoken of as if it were the
entire cause and in practice that particular condition is usually styled
the cause whose share in the matter is superficially the most conspicuous
or whose requisiteness to the production of the effect we happen to be
insisting on at the moment so great is the force of this last
consideration that it sometimes induces us to give the name of cause even
to one of the negative conditions we say for example the army was
surprised because the sentinel was off his post but since the sentinels
absence was not what created the enemy or put the soldiers asleep how
did it cause them to be surprised all that is really meant is that the
event would not have happened if he had been at his duty his being off
his post was no producing cause but the mere absence of a preventing
cause it was simply equivalent to his nonexistence from nothing from a
mere negation no consequences can proceed all effects are connected by
the law of causation with some set of positive conditions negative
ones it is true being almost always required in addition in other
words every fact or phenomenon which has a beginning invariably arises
when some certain combination of positive facts exists provided certain
other positive facts do not exist
there is no doubt a tendency which our first example that of death
from taking a particular food sufficiently illustrates to associate the
idea of causation with the proximate antecedent event rather than with
any of the antecedent states or permanent facts which may happen also
to be conditions of the phenomenon the reason being that the event not
only exists but begins to exist immediately previous while the other
conditions may have preexisted for an indefinite time and this tendency
shows itself very visibly in the different logical fictions which are
resorted to even by men of science to avoid the necessity of giving the
name of cause to anything which had existed for an indeterminate length of
time before the effect thus rather than say that the earth causes the
fall of bodies they ascribe it to a force exerted by the earth or an
attraction by the earth abstractions which they can represent to
themselves as exhausted by each effort and therefore constituting at each
successive instant a fresh fact simultaneous with or only immediately
preceding the effect inasmuch as the coming of the circumstance which
completes the assemblage of conditions is a change or event it thence
happens that an event is always the antecedent in closest apparent
proximity to the consequent and this may account for the illusion which
disposes us to look upon the proximate event as standing more peculiarly
in the position of a cause than any of the antecedent states but even
this peculiarity of being in closer proximity to the effect than any
other of its conditions is as we have already seen far from being
necessary to the common notion of a cause with which notion on the
contrary any one of the conditions either positive or negative is
found on occasion completely to accord65
the cause then philosophically speaking is the sum total of the
conditions positive and negative taken together the whole of the
contingencies of every description which being realized the consequent
invariably follows the negative conditions however of any phenomenon a
special enumeration of which would generally be very prolix may be all
summed up under one head namely the absence of preventing or
counteracting causes the convenience of this mode of expression is mainly
grounded on the fact that the effects of any cause in counteracting
another cause may in most cases be with strict scientific exactness
regarded as a mere extension of its own proper and separate effects if
gravity retards the upward motion of a projectile and deflects it into a
parabolic trajectory it produces in so doing the very same kind of
effect and even as mathematicians know the same quantity of effect as
it does in its ordinary operation of causing the fall of bodies when
simply deprived of their support if an alkaline solution mixed with an
acid destroys its sourness and prevents it from reddening vegetable
blues it is because the specific effect of the alkali is to combine with
the acid and form a compound with totally different qualities this
property which causes of all descriptions possess of preventing the
effects of other causes by virtue for the most part of the same laws
according to which they produce their own66 enables us by establishing
the general axiom that all causes are liable to be counteracted in their
effects by one another to dispense with the consideration of negative
conditions entirely and limit the notion of cause to the assemblage of
the positive conditions of the phenomenon one negative condition
invariably understood and the same in all instances namely the absence
of all counteracting causes being sufficient along with the sum of the
positive conditions to make up the whole set of circumstances on which
the phenomenon is dependent
 4 among the positive conditions as we have seen that there are some to
which in common parlance the term cause is more readily and frequently
awarded so there are others to which it is in ordinary circumstances
refused in most cases of causation a distinction is commonly drawn
between something which acts and some other thing which is acted upon
between an agent and a patient both of these it would be universally
allowed are conditions of the phenomenon but it would be thought absurd
to call the latter the cause that title being reserved for the former
the distinction however vanishes on examination or rather is found to
be only verbal arising from an incident of mere expression namely that
the object said to be acted upon and which is considered as the scene
in which the effect takes place is commonly included in the phrase by
which the effect is spoken of so that if it were also reckoned as part of
the cause the seeming incongruity would arise of its being supposed to
cause itself in the instance which we have already had of falling
bodies the question was thus putwhat is the cause which makes a stone
fall and if the answer had been the stone itself the expression would
have been in apparent contradiction to the meaning of the word cause the
stone therefore is conceived as the patient and the earth or
according to the common and most unphilosophical practice some occult
quality of the earth is represented as the agent or cause but that
there is nothing fundamental in the distinction may be seen from this
that it is quite possible to conceive the stone as causing its own fall
provided the language employed be such as to save the mere verbal
incongruity we might say that the stone moves towards the earth by the
properties of the matter composing it and according to this mode of
presenting the phenomenon the stone itself might without impropriety be
called the agent although to save the established doctrine of the
inactivity of matter men usually prefer here also to ascribe the effect
to an occult quality and say that the cause is not the stone itself but
the weight or gravitation of the stone
those who have contended for a radical distinction between agent and
patient have generally conceived the agent as that which causes some
state of or some change in the state of another object which is called
the patient but a little reflection will show that the licence we assume
of speaking of phenomena as states of the various objects which take
part in them an artifice of which so much use has been made by some
philosophers brown in particular for the apparent explanation of
phenomena is simply a sort of logical fiction useful sometimes as one
among several modes of expression but which should never be supposed to
be the statement of a scientific truth even those attributes of an object
which might seem with greatest propriety to be called states of the object
itself its sensible qualities its colour hardness shape and the like
are in reality as no one has pointed out more clearly than brown
himself phenomena of causation in which the substance is distinctly the
agent or producing cause the patient being our own organs and those of
other sentient beings what we call states of objects are always
sequences into which those the objects enter generally as antecedents or
causes and things are never more active than in the production of those
phenomena in which they are said to be acted upon thus in the example of
a stone falling to the earth according to the theory of gravitation the
stone is as much an agent as the earth which not only attracts but is
itself attracted by the stone in the case of a sensation produced in our
organs the laws of our organization and even those of our minds are as
directly operative in determining the effect produced as the laws of the
outward object though we call prussic acid the agent of a persons death
the whole of the vital and organic properties of the patient are as
actively instrumental as the poison in the chain of effects which so
rapidly terminates his sentient existence in the process of education we
may call the teacher the agent and the scholar only the material acted
upon yet in truth all the facts which preexisted in the scholars mind
exert either cooperating or counteracting agencies in relation to the
teachers efforts it is not light alone which is the agent in vision but
light coupled with the active properties of the eye and brain and with
those of the visible object the distinction between agent and patient is
merely verbal patients are always agents in a great proportion indeed
of all natural phenomena they are so to such a degree as to react
forcibly upon the causes which acted upon them and even when this is not
the case they contribute in the same manner as any of the other
conditions to the production of the effect of which they are vulgarly
treated as the mere theatre all the positive conditions of a phenomenon
are alike agents alike active and in any expression of the cause which
professes to be a complete one none of them can with reason be excluded
except such as have already been implied in the words used for describing
the effect nor by including even these would there be incurred any but a
merely verbal inconsistency
 5 it now remains to advert to a distinction which is of firstrate
importance both for clearing up the notion of cause and for obviating a
very specious objection often made against the view which we have taken of
the subject
when we define the cause of anything in the only sense in which the
present inquiry has any concern with causes to be the antecedent which
it invariably follows we do not use this phrase as exactly synonymous
with the antecedent which it invariably has followed in our past
experience such a mode of conceiving causation would be liable to the
objection very plausibly urged by dr reid namely that according to this
doctrine night must be the cause of day and day the cause of night since
these phenomena have invariably succeeded one another from the beginning
of the world but it is necessary to our using the word cause that we
should believe not only that the antecedent always has been followed by
the consequent but that as long as the present constitution of things
endures it always will be so and this would not be true of day and
night we do not believe that night will be followed by day under all
imaginable circumstances but only that it will be so provided the sun
rises above the horizon if the sun ceased to rise which for aught we
know may be perfectly compatible with the general laws of matter night
would be or might be eternal on the other hand if the sun is above the
horizon his light not extinct and no opaque body between us and him we
believe firmly that unless a change takes place in the properties of
matter this combination of antecedents will be followed by the
consequent day that if the combination of antecedents could be
indefinitely prolonged it would be always day and that if the same
combination had always existed it would always have been day quite
independently of night as a previous condition therefore is it that we do
not call night the cause nor even a condition of day the existence of
the sun or some such luminous body and there being no opaque medium in
a straight line67 between that body and the part of the earth where we
are situated are the sole conditions and the union of these without the
addition of any superfluous circumstance constitutes the cause this is
what writers mean when they say that the notion of cause involves the idea
of necessity if there be any meaning which confessedly belongs to the
term necessity it is unconditionalness that which is necessary that
which must be means that which will be whatever supposition we may
make in regard to all other things the succession of day and night
evidently is not necessary in this sense it is conditional on the
occurrence of other antecedents that which will be followed by a given
consequent when and only when some third circumstance also exists is
not the cause even though no case should have ever occurred in which the
phenomenon took place without it
invariable sequence therefore is not synonymous with causation unless
the sequence besides being invariable is unconditional there are
sequences as uniform in past experience as any others whatever which yet
we do not regard as cases of causation but as conjunctions in some sort
accidental such to an accurate thinker is that of day and night the
one might have existed for any length of time and the other not have
followed the sooner for its existence it follows only if certain other
antecedents exist and where those antecedents existed it would follow in
any case no one probably ever called night the cause of day mankind
must so soon have arrived at the very obvious generalization that the
state of general illumination which we call day would follow the presence
of a sufficiently luminous body whether darkness had preceded or not
we may define therefore the cause of a phenomenon to be the antecedent
or the concurrence of antecedents on which it is invariably and
unconditionally consequent or if we adopt the convenient modification
of the meaning of the word cause which confines it to the assemblage of
positive conditions without the negative then instead of
unconditionally we must say subject to no other than negative
conditions
it is evident that from a limited number of unconditional sequences
there will result a much greater number of conditional ones certain
causes being given that is certain antecedents which are unconditionally
followed by certain consequents the mere coexistence of these causes will
give rise to an unlimited number of additional uniformities if two causes
exist together the effects of both will exist together and if many
causes coexist these causes by what we shall term hereafter the
intermixture of their laws will give rise to new effects accompanying or
succeeding one another in some particular order which order will be
invariable while the causes continue to coexist but no longer the motion
of the earth in a given orbit round the sun is a series of changes which
follow one another as antecedents and consequents and will continue to do
so while the suns attraction and the force with which the earth tends to
advance in a direct line through space continue to coexist in the same
quantities as at present but vary either of these causes and the
unvarying succession of motions would cease to take place the series of
the earths motions therefore though a case of sequence invariable
within the limits of human experience is not a case of causation it is
not unconditional
this distinction between the relations of succession which so far as we
know are unconditional and those relations whether of succession or of
coexistence which like the earths motions or the succession of day and
night depend on the existence or on the coexistence of other antecedent
factscorresponds to the great division which dr whewell and other
writers have made of the field of science into the investigation of what
they term the laws of phenomena and the investigation of causes a
phraseology as i conceive not philosophically sustainable inasmuch as
the ascertainment of causes such causes as the human faculties can
ascertain namely causes which are themselves phenomena is therefore
merely the ascertainment of other and more universal laws of phenomena
yet the distinction however incorrectly expressed is not only real but
is one of the fundamental distinctions in science indeed it is on this
alone as we shall hereafter find that the possibility rests of framing a
rigorous canon of induction
 6 does a cause always stand with its effect in the relation of
antecedent and consequent do we not often say of two simultaneous facts
that they are cause and effectas when we say that fire is the cause of
warmth the sun and moisture the cause of vegetation and the like since
a cause does not necessarily perish because its effect has been produced
the two things do very generally coexist and there are some appearances
and some common expressions seeming to imply not only that causes may
but that they must be contemporaneous with their effects cessante caus
cessat et effectus has been a dogma of the schools the necessity for
the continued existence of the cause in order to the continuance of the
effect seems to have been once a generally received doctrine keplers
numerous attempts to account for the motions of the heavenly bodies on
mechanical principles were rendered abortive by his always supposing that
the force which set those bodies in motion must continue to operate in
order to keep up the motion which it at first produced yet there were at
all times many familiar instances of the continuance of effects long
after their causes had ceased a coup de soleil gives a person a brain
fever will the fever go off as soon as he is moved out of the sunshine a
sword is run through his body must the sword remain in his body in order
that he may continue dead a ploughshare once made remains a ploughshare
without any continuance of heating and hammering and even after the man
who heated and hammered it has been gathered to his fathers on the other
hand the pressure which forces up the mercury in an exhausted tube must
be continued in order to sustain it in the tube this it may be replied
is because another force is acting without intermission the force of
gravity which would restore it to its level unless counterpoised by a
force equally constant but again a tight bandage causes pain which pain
will sometimes go off as soon as the bandage is removed the illumination
which the sun diffuses over the earth ceases when the sun goes down
there is therefore a distinction to be drawn the conditions which are
necessary for the first production of a phenomenon are occasionally also
necessary for its continuance but more commonly its continuance requires
no condition except negative ones most things once produced continue as
they are until something changes or destroys them but some require the
permanent presence of the agencies which produced them at first these
may if we please be considered as instantaneous phenomena requiring to
be renewed at each instant by the cause by which they were at first
generated accordingly the illumination of any given point of space has
always been looked upon as an instantaneous fact which perishes and is
perpetually renewed as long as the necessary conditions subsist if we
adopt this language we avoid the necessity of admitting that the
continuance of the cause is ever required to maintain the effect we may
say it is not required to maintain but to reproduce the effect or else
to counteract some force tending to destroy it and this may be a
convenient phraseology but it is only a phraseology the fact remains
that in some cases though these are a minority the continuance of the
conditions which produced an effect is necessary to the continuance of the
effect
as to the ulterior question whether it is strictly necessary that the
cause or assemblage of conditions should precede by ever so short an
instant the production of the effect a question raised and argued with
much ingenuity by a writer from whom i have quoted68 i think the
inquiry an unimportant one there certainly are cases in which the effect
follows without any interval perceptible by our faculties and when there
is an interval we cannot tell by how many intermediate links
imperceptible to us that interval may really be filled up but even
granting that an effect may commence simultaneously with its cause the
view i have taken of causation is in no way practically affected whether
the cause and its effect be necessarily successive or not causation is
still the law of the succession of phenomena everything which begins to
exist must have a cause what does not begin to exist does not need a
cause what causation has to account for is the origin of phenomena and
all the successions of phenomena must be resolvable into causation these
are the axioms of our doctrine if these be granted we can afford though
i see no necessity for doing so to drop the words antecedent and
consequent as applied to cause and effect i have no objection to define a
cause the assemblage of phenomena which occurring some other phenomenon
invariably commences or has its origin whether the effect coincides in
point of time with or immediately follows the hindmost of its
conditions is immaterial at all events it does not precede it and when
we are in doubt between two coexistent phenomena which is cause and
which effect we rightly deem the question solved if we can ascertain
which of them preceded the other
 7 it continually happens that several different phenomena which are
not in the slightest degree dependent or conditional on one another are
found all to depend as the phrase is on one and the same agent in other
words one and the same phenomenon is seen to be followed by several sorts
of effects quite heterogeneous but which go on simultaneously one with
another provided of course that all other conditions requisite for each
of them also exist thus the sun produces the celestial motions it
produces daylight and it produces heat the earth causes the fall of
heavy bodies and it also in its capacity of an immense magnet causes
the phenomena of the magnetic needle a crystal of galena causes the
sensations of hardness of weight of cubical form of grey colour and
many others between which we can trace no interdependence the purpose to
which the phraseology of properties and powers is specially adapted is
the expression of this sort of cases when the same phenomenon is followed
either subject or not to the presence of other conditions by effects of
different and dissimilar orders it is usual to say that each different
sort of effect is produced by a different property of the cause thus we
distinguish the attractive or gravitative property of the earth and its
magnetic property the gravitative luminiferous and calorific properties
of the sun the colour shape weight and hardness of a crystal these
are mere phrases which explain nothing and add nothing to our knowledge
of the subject but considered as abstract names denoting the connexion
between the different effects produced and the object which produces them
they are a very powerful instrument of abridgment and of that
acceleration of the process of thought which abridgment accomplishes
this class of considerations leads to a conception which we shall find to
be of great importance that of a permanent cause or original natural
agent there exist in nature a number of permanent causes which have
subsisted ever since the human race has been in existence and for an
indefinite and probably an enormous length of time previous the sun the
earth and planets with their various constituents air water and the
other distinguishable substances whether simple or compound of which
nature is made up are such permanent causes these have existed and the
effects or consequences which they were fitted to produce have taken
place as often as the other conditions of the production met from the
very beginning of our experience but we can give no account of the origin
of the permanent causes themselves why these particular natural agents
existed originally and no others or why they are commingled in such and
such proportions and distributed in such and such a manner throughout
space is a question we cannot answer more than this we can discover
nothing regular in the distribution itself we can reduce it to no
uniformity to no law there are no means by which from the distribution
of these causes or agents in one part of space we could conjecture
whether a similar distribution prevails in another the coexistence
therefore of primeval causes ranks to us among merely casual
concurrences and all those sequences or coexistences among the effects of
several such causes which though invariable while those causes coexist
would if the coexistence terminated terminate along with it we do not
class as cases of causation or laws of nature we can only calculate on
finding these sequences or coexistences where we know by direct evidence
that the natural agents on the properties of which they ultimately depend
are distributed in the requisite manner these permanent causes are not
always objects they are sometimes events that is to say periodical
cycles of events that being the only mode in which events can possess the
property of permanence not only for instance is the earth itself a
permanent cause or primitive natural agent but the earths rotation is
so too it is a cause which has produced from the earliest period by
the aid of other necessary conditions the succession of day and night
the ebb and flow of the sea and many other effects while as we can
assign no cause except conjecturally for the rotation itself it is
entitled to be ranked as a primeval cause it is however only the
origin of the rotation which is mysterious to us once begun its
continuance is accounted for by the first law of motion that of the
permanence of rectilinear motion once impressed combined with the
gravitation of the parts of the earth towards one another
all phenomena without exception which begin to exist that is all except
the primeval causes are effects either immediate or remote of those
primitive facts or of some combination of them there is no thing
produced no event happening in the known universe which is not
connected by an uniformity or invariable sequence with some one or more
of the phenomena which preceded it insomuch that it will happen again as
often as those phenomena occur again and as no other phenomenon having
the character of a counteracting cause shall coexist these antecedent
phenomena again were connected in a similar manner with some that
preceded them and so on until we reach as the ultimate step attainable
by us either the properties of some one primeval cause or the
conjunction of several the whole of the phenomena of nature were
therefore the necessary or in other words the unconditional
consequences of some former collocation of the permanent causes
the state of the whole universe at any instant we believe to be the
consequence of its state at the previous instant insomuch that one who
knew all the agents which exist at the present moment their collocation
in space and their properties in other words the laws of their agency
could predict the whole subsequent history of the universe at least
unless some new volition of a power capable of controlling the universe
should supervene69 and if any particular state of the entire universe
could ever recur a second time all subsequent states would return too
and history would like a circulating decimal of many figures
periodically repeat itself
jam redit et virgo redeunt saturnia regna
alter erit tum tiphys et altera qu vehat argo
delectos heroas erunt quoque altera bella
atque iterum ad troiam magnus mittetur achilles
and though things do not really revolve in this eternal round the whole
series of events in the history of the universe past and future is not
the less capable in its own nature of being constructed  priori by
any one whom we can suppose acquainted with the original distribution of
all natural agents and with the whole of their properties that is the
laws of succession existing between them and their effects saving the
more than human powers of combination and calculation which would be
required even in one possessing the data for the actual performance of
the task
 8 since everything which occurs is determined by laws of causation and
collocations of the original causes it follows that the coexistences
which are observable among effects cannot be themselves the subject of any
similar set of laws distinct from laws of causation uniformities there
are as well of coexistence as of succession among effects but these
must in all cases be a mere result either of the identity or of the
coexistence of their causes if the causes did not coexist neither could
the effects and these causes being also effects of prior causes and
these of others until we reach the primeval causes it follows that
except in the case of effects which can be traced immediately or remotely
to one and the same cause the coexistences of phenomena can in no case be
universal unless the coexistences of the primeval causes to which the
effects are ultimately traceable can be reduced to an universal law but
we have seen that they cannot there are accordingly no original and
independent in other words no unconditional uniformities of coexistence
between effects of different causes if they coexist it is only because
the causes have casually coexisted the only independent and unconditional
coexistences which are sufficiently invariable to have any claim to the
character of laws are between different and mutually independent effects
of the same cause in other words between different properties of the
same natural agent this portion of the laws of nature will be treated of
in the latter part of the present book under the name of the specific
properties of kinds
 9 it is proper in this place to advert to a doctrine at least as old as
dr reid though propounded by him not as certain but as probable which
has been revived during the last few years in several quarters and at
present gives more signs of life than any other theory of causation at
variance with that set forth in the preceding pages
according to the theory in question mind or to speak more precisely
will is the only cause of phenomena the type of causation as well as
the exclusive source from which we derive the idea is our own voluntary
agency here and here only it is said we have direct evidence of
causation we know that we can move our bodies respecting the phenomena
of inanimate nature we have no other direct knowledge than that of
antecedence and sequence but in the case of our voluntary actions it is
affirmed that we are conscious of power before we have experience of
results an act of volition whether followed by an effect or not is
accompanied by a consciousness of effort of force exerted of power in
action which is necessarily causal or causative this feeling of energy
or force inherent in an act of will is knowledge  priori assurance
prior to experience that we have the power of causing effects volition
therefore it is asserted is something more than an unconditional
antecedent it is a cause in a different sense from that in which
physical phenomena are said to cause one another it is an efficient
cause from this the transition is easy to the further doctrine that
volition is the sole efficient cause of all phenomena it is
inconceivable that dead force could continue unsupported for a moment
beyond its creation we cannot even conceive of change or phenomena
without the energy of a mind the word action itself says another
writer of the same school has no real significance except when applied
to the doings of an intelligent agent let any one conceive if he can of
any power energy or force inherent in a lump of matter phenomena may
have the semblance of being produced by physical causes but they are in
reality produced say these writers by the immediate agency of mind all
things which do not proceed from a human or i suppose an animal will
proceed they say directly from divine will the earth is not moved by
the combination of a centripetal and a projectile force this is but a
mode of speaking which serves to facilitate our conceptions it is moved
by the direct volition of an omnipotent being in a path coinciding with
that which we deduce from the hypothesis of these two forces
as i have so often observed the general question of the existence of
efficient causes does not fall within the limits of our subject but a
theory which represents them as capable of being subjects of human
knowledge and which passes off as efficient causes what are only physical
or phenomenal causes belongs as much to logic as to metaphysics and is a
fit subject for discussion here
to my apprehension a volition is not an efficient but simply a physical
cause our will causes our bodily actions in the same sense and in no
other in which cold causes ice or a spark causes an explosion of
gunpowder the volition a state of our mind is the antecedent the
motion of our limbs in conformity to the volition is the consequent this
sequence i conceive to be not a subject of direct consciousness in the
sense intended by the theory the antecedent indeed and the consequent
are subjects of consciousness but the connexion between them is a subject
of experience i cannot admit that our consciousness of the volition
contains in itself any  priori knowledge that the muscular motion will
follow if our nerves of motion were paralyzed or our muscles stiff and
inflexible and had been so all our lives i do not see the slightest
ground for supposing that we should ever unless by information from other
people have known anything of volition as a physical power or been
conscious of any tendency in feelings of our mind to produce motions of
our body or of other bodies i will not undertake to say whether we
should in that case have had the physical feeling which i suppose is meant
when these writers speak of consciousness of effort i see no reason why
we should not since that physical feeling is probably a state of nervous
sensation beginning and ending in the brain without involving the motory
apparatus but we certainly should not have designated it by any term
equivalent to effort since effort implies consciously aiming at an end
which we should not only in that case have had no reason to do but could
not even have had the idea of doing if conscious at all of this peculiar
sensation we should have been conscious of it i conceive only as a kind
of uneasiness accompanying our feelings of desire
those against whom i am contending have never produced and do not pretend
to produce any positive evidence70 that the power of our will to move
our bodies would be known to us independently of experience what they
have to say on the subject is that the production of physical events by a
will seems to carry its own explanation with it while the action of
matter upon matter seems to require something else to explain it and is
even according to them inconceivable on any other supposition than
that some will intervenes between the apparent cause and its apparent
effect they thus rest their case on an appeal to the inherent laws of our
conceptive faculty mistaking as i apprehend for the laws of that
faculty its acquired habits grounded on the spontaneous tendencies of its
uncultured state the succession between the will to move a limb and the
actual motion is one of the most direct and instantaneous of all
sequences which come under our observation and is familiar to every
moments experience from our earliest infancy more familiar than any
succession of events exterior to our bodies and especially more so than
any other case of the apparent origination as distinguished from the mere
communication of motion now it is the natural tendency of the mind to
be always attempting to facilitate its conception of unfamiliar facts by
assimilating them to others which are familiar accordingly our voluntary
acts being the most familiar to us of all cases of causation are in the
infancy and early youth of the human race spontaneously taken as the type
of causation in general and all phenomena are supposed to be directly
produced by the will of some sentient being this original fetichism i
shall not characterize in the words of hume or of any follower of hume
but in those of a religious metaphysician dr reid in order more
effectually to shew the unanimity which exists on the subject among all
competent thinkers
when we turn our attention to external objects and begin to exercise our
rational faculties about them we find that there are some motions and
changes in them which we have power to produce and that there are many
which must have some other cause either the objects must have life and
active power as we have or they must be moved or changed by something
that has life and active power as external objects are moved by us
our first thoughts seem to be that the objects in which we perceive such
motion have understanding and active power as we have savages says the
abb raynal wherever they see motion which they cannot account for
there they suppose a soul all men may be considered as savages in this
respect until they are capable of instruction and of using their
faculties in a more perfect manner than savages do
the abb raynals observation is sufficiently confirmed both from fact
and from the structure of all languages
rude nations do really believe sun moon and stars earth sea and air
fountains and lakes to have understanding and active power to pay
homage to them and implore their favour is a kind of idolatry natural to
savages
all languages carry in their structure the marks of their being formed
when this belief prevailed the distinction of verbs and participles into
active and passive which is found in all languages must have been
originally intended to distinguish what is really active from what is
merely passive and in all languages we find active verbs applied to
those objects in which according to the abb raynals observation
savages suppose a soul
thus we say the sun rises and sets and comes to the meridian the moon
changes the sea ebbs and flows the winds blow languages were formed by
men who believed these objects to have life and active power in
themselves it was therefore proper and natural to express their motions
and changes by active verbs
there is no surer way of tracing the sentiments of nations before they
have records than by the structure of their language which
notwithstanding the changes produced in it by time will always retain
some signatures of the thoughts of those by whom it was invented when we
find the same sentiments indicated in the structure of all languages
those sentiments must have been common to the human species when languages
were invented
when a few of superior intellectual abilities find leisure for
speculation they begin to philosophize and soon discover that many of
those objects which at first they believed to be intelligent and active
are really lifeless and passive this is a very important discovery it
elevates the mind emancipates from many vulgar superstitions and invites
to further discoveries of the same kind
as philosophy advances life and activity in natural objects retires and
leaves them dead and inactive instead of moving voluntarily we find them
to be moved necessarily instead of acting we find them to be acted upon
and nature appears as one great machine where one wheel is turned by
another that by a third and how far this necessary succession may reach
the philosopher does not know71
there is then a spontaneous tendency of the intellect to account to
itself for all cases of causation by assimilating them to the intentional
acts of voluntary agents like itself this is the instinctive philosophy
of the human mind in its earliest stage before it has become familiar
with any other invariable sequences than those between its own volitions
and its voluntary acts as the notion of fixed laws of succession among
external phenomena gradually establishes itself the propensity to refer
all phenomena to voluntary agency slowly gives way before it the
suggestions however of daily life continuing to be more powerful than
those of scientific thought the original instinctive philosophy maintains
its ground in the mind underneath the growths obtained by cultivation
and keeps up a constant resistance to their throwing their roots deep into
the soil the theory against which i am contending derives its nourishment
from that substratum its strength does not lie in argument but in its
affinity to an obstinate tendency of the infancy of the human mind
that this tendency however is not the result of an inherent mental law
is proved by superabundant evidence the history of science from its
earliest dawn shows that mankind have not been unanimous in thinking
either that the action of matter upon matter was not conceivable or
that the action of mind upon matter was to some thinkers and some
schools of thinkers both in ancient and in modern times this last has
appeared much more inconceivable than the former sequences entirely
physical and material as soon as they had become sufficiently familiar to
the human mind came to be thought perfectly natural and were regarded
not only as needing no explanation themselves but as being capable of
affording it to others and even of serving as the ultimate explanation of
things in general
one of the most recent supporters of the volitional theory has furnished
an explanation at once historically true and philosophically acute of
the failure of the greek philosophers in physical inquiry in which as i
conceive he unconsciously depicts his own state of mind their
stumblingblock was one as to the nature of the evidence they had to
expect for their conviction they had not seized the idea that they
must not expect to understand the processes of outward causes but only
their results and consequently the whole physical philosophy of the
greeks was an attempt to identify mentally the effect with its cause to
feel after some not only necessary but natural connexion where they meant
by natural that which would per se carry some presumption to their own
mind they wanted to see some reason why the physical antecedent
should produce this particular consequent and their only attempts were in
directions where they could find such reasons72 in other words they
were not content merely to know that one phenomenon was always followed by
another they thought that they had not attained the true aim of science
unless they could perceive something in the nature of the one phenomenon
from which it might have been known or presumed previous to trial that
it would be followed by the other just what the writer who has so
clearly pointed out their error thinks that he perceives in the nature of
the phenomenon volition and to complete the statement of the case he
should have added that these early speculators not only made this their
aim but were quite satisfied with their success in it not only sought
for causes which should carry in their mere statement evidence of their
efficiency but fully believed that they had found such causes the
reviewer can see plainly that this was an error because he does not
believe that there exist any relations between material phenomena which
can account for their producing one another but the very fact of the
persistency of the greeks in this error shows that their minds were in a
very different state they were able to derive from the assimilation of
physical facts to other physical facts the kind of mental satisfaction
which we connect with the word explanation and which the reviewer would
have us think can only be found in referring phenomena to a will when
thales and hippo held that moisture was the universal cause and eternal
element of which all other things were but the infinitely various
sensible manifestations when anaximenes predicated the same thing of air
pythagoras of numbers and the like they all thought that they had found
a real explanation and were content to rest in this explanation as
ultimate the ordinary sequences of the external universe appeared to
them no less than to their critic to be inconceivable without the
supposition of some universal agency to connect the antecedents with the
consequents but they did not think that volition exerted by minds was
the only agency which fulfilled this requirement moisture or air or
numbers carried to their minds a precisely similar impression of making
that intelligible which was otherwise inconceivable and gave the same
full satisfaction to the demands of their conceptive faculty
it was not the greeks alone who wanted to see some reason why the
physical antecedent should produce this particular consequent some
connexion which would per se carry some presumption to their own mind
among modern philosophers leibnitz laid it down as a selfevident
principle that all physical causes without exception must contain in their
own nature something which makes it intelligible that they should be able
to produce the effects which they do produce far from admitting volition
as the only kind of cause which carried internal evidence of its own
power and as the real bond of connexion between physical antecedents and
their consequents he demanded some naturally and per se efficient
physical antecedent as the bond of connexion between volition itself and
its effects he distinctly refused to admit the will of a god as a
sufficient explanation of anything except miracles and insisted upon
finding something that would account better for the phenomena of nature
than a mere reference to divine volition73
again and conversely the action of mind upon matter which we are now
told not only needs no explanation itself but is the explanation of all
other effects has appeared to some thinkers to be itself the grand
inconceivability it was to get over this very difficulty that the
cartesians invented the system of occasional causes they could not
conceive that thoughts in a mind could produce movements in a body or
that bodily movements could produce thoughts they could see no necessary
connexion no relation  priori between a motion and a thought and as
the cartesians more than any other school of philosophical speculation
before or since made their own minds the measure of all things and
refused on principle to believe that nature had done what they were
unable to see any reason why she must do they affirmed it to be
impossible that a material and a mental fact could be causes one of
another they regarded them as mere occasions on which the real agent
god thought fit to exert his power as a cause when a man wills to move
his foot it is not his will that moves it but god they said moves it
on the occasion of his will god according to this system is the only
efficient cause not qu mind or qu endowed with volition but qu
omnipotent this hypothesis was as i said originally suggested by the
supposed inconceivability of any real mutual action between mind and
matter but it was afterwards extended to the action of matter upon
matter for on a nicer examination they found this inconceivable too and
therefore according to their logic impossible the deus ex machin was
ultimately called in to produce a spark on the occasion of a flint and
steel coming together or to break an egg on the occasion of its falling
on the ground
all this undoubtedly shows that it is the disposition of mankind in
general not to be satisfied with knowing that one fact is invariably
antecedent and another consequent but to look out for something which may
seem to explain their being sosomething        
 but we also see that this demand may be completely satisfied by an
agency purely physical provided it be much more familiar than that which
it is invoked to explain to thales and anaximenes it appeared
inconceivable that the antecedents which we see in nature should produce
the consequents but perfectly natural that water or air should produce
them the writers whom i oppose declare this inconceivable but can
conceive that mind or volition is per se an efficient cause while the
cartesians could not conceive even that but peremptorily declared that no
mode of production of any fact whatever was conceivable except the direct
agency of an omnipotent being thus giving additional proof of what finds
new confirmation in every stage of the history of science that both what
persons can and what they cannot conceive is very much an affair of
accident and depends altogether on their experience and their habits of
thought that by cultivating the requisite associations of ideas people
may make themselves unable to conceive any given thing and may make
themselves able to conceive most things however inconceivable these may
at first appear and the same facts in each persons mental history which
determine what is or is not conceivable to him determine also which among
the various sequences in nature will appear to him so natural and
plausible as to need no other proof of their existence to be evident by
their own light independent equally of experience and of explanation
by what rule is any one to decide between one theory of this description
and another the theorists do not direct us to any external evidence they
appeal each to his own subjective feelings one says the succession c
b appears to me more natural conceivable and credible per se than the
succession a b you are therefore mistaken in thinking that b depends
upon a i am certain though i can give no other evidence of it that c
comes in between a and b and is the real and only cause of b the other
answersthe successions c b and a b appear to me equally natural and
conceivable or the latter more so than the former a is quite capable of
producing b without any other intervention a third agrees with the first
in being unable to conceive that a can produce b but finds the sequence
d b still more natural than c b or of nearer kin to the subject
matter and prefers his d theory to the c theory it is plain that there
is no universal law operating here except the law that each persons
conceptions are governed and limited by his individual experience and
habits of thought we are warranted in saying of all three what each of
them already believes of the other two namely that they exalt into an
original law of the human intellect and of outward nature one particular
sequence of phenomena which appears to them more natural and more
conceivable than other sequences only because it is more familiar and
from this judgment i am unable to except the theory that volition is an
efficient cause
i am unwilling to leave the subject without adverting to the additional
fallacy contained in the corollary from this theory in the inference that
because volition is an efficient cause therefore it is the only cause and
the direct agent in producing even what is apparently produced by
something else volitions are not known to produce anything directly
except nervous action for the will influences even the muscles only
through the nerves though it were granted then that every phenomenon
has an efficient and not merely a phenomenal cause and that volition in
the case of the peculiar phenomena which are known to be produced by it
is that efficient cause are we therefore to say with these writers that
since we know of no other efficient cause and ought not to assume one
without evidence there is no other and volition is the direct cause of
all phenomena a more outrageous stretch of inference could hardly be
made because among the infinite variety of the phenomena of nature there
is one namely a particular mode of action of certain nerves which has
for its cause and as we are now supposing for its efficient cause a
state of our mind and because this is the only efficient cause of which
we are conscious being the only one of which in the nature of the case we
can be conscious since it is the only one which exists within
ourselves does this justify us in concluding that all other phenomena
must have the same kind of efficient cause with that one eminently
special narrow and peculiarly human or animal phenomenon it is true
there are cases in which with acknowledged propriety we generalize from
a single instance to a multitude of instances but they must be instances
which resemble the one known instance and not such as have no
circumstance in common with it except that of being instances i have for
example no direct evidence that any creature is alive except myself yet
i attribute with full assurance life and sensation to other human beings
and animals but i do not conclude that all other things are alive merely
because i am i ascribe to certain other creatures a life like my own
because they manifest it by the same sort of indications by which mine is
manifested i find that their phenomena and mine conform to the same laws
and it is for this reason that i believe both to arise from a similar
cause accordingly i do not extend the conclusion beyond the grounds for
it earth fire mountains trees are remarkable agencies but their
phenomena do not conform to the same laws as my actions do and i
therefore do not believe earth or fire mountains or trees to possess
animal life but the supporters of the volition theory ask us to infer
that volition causes everything for no reason except that it causes one
particular thing although that one phenomenon far from being a type of
all natural phenomena is eminently peculiar its laws bearing scarcely
any resemblance to those of any other phenomenon whether of inorganic or
of organic nature74
chapter vi of the composition of causes
 1 to complete the general notion of causation on which the rules of
experimental inquiry into the laws of nature must be founded one
distinction still remains to be pointed out a distinction so radical and
of so much importance as to require a chapter to itself
the preceding discussions have rendered us familiar with the case in which
several agents or causes concur as conditions to the production of an
effect a case in truth almost universal there being very few effects
to the production of which no more than one agent contributes suppose
then that two different agents operating jointly are followed under a
certain set of collateral conditions by a given effect if either of
these agents instead of being joined with the other had operated alone
under the same set of conditions in all other respects some effect would
probably have followed which would have been different from the joint
effect of the two and more or less dissimilar to it now if we happen to
know what would be the effects of each cause when acting separately from
the other we are often able to arrive deductively or  priori at a
correct prediction of what will arise from their conjunct agency to
enable us to do this it is only necessary that the same law which
expresses the effect of each cause acting by itself shall also correctly
express the part due to that cause of the effect which follows from the
two together this condition is realised in the extensive and important
class of phenomena commonly called mechanical namely the phenomena of the
communication of motion or of pressure which is tendency to motion from
one body to another in this important class of cases of causation one
cause never properly speaking defeats or frustrates another both have
their full effect if a body is propelled in two directions by two forces
one tending to drive it to the north and the other to the east it is
caused to move in a given time exactly as far in both directions as the
two forces would separately have carried it and is left precisely where
it would have arrived if it had been acted upon first by one of the two
forces and afterwards by the other this law of nature is called in
dynamics the principle of the composition of forces and in imitation of
that wellchosen expression i shall give the name of the composition of
causes to the principle which is exemplified in all cases in which the
joint effect of several causes is identical with the sum of their separate
effects
this principle however by no means prevails in all departments of the
field of nature the chemical combination of two substances produces as
is well known a third substance with properties entirely different from
those of either of the two substances separately or both of them taken
together not a trace of the properties of hydrogen or of oxygen is
observable in those of their compound water the taste of sugar of lead
is not the sum of the tastes of its component elements acetic acid and
lead or its oxide nor is the colour of green vitriol a mixture of the
colours of sulphuric acid and copper this explains why mechanics is a
deductive or demonstrative science and chemistry not in the one we can
compute the effects of all combinations of causes whether real or
hypothetical from the laws which we know to govern those causes when
acting separately because they continue to observe the same laws when in
combination which they observed when separate whatever would have
happened in consequence of each cause taken by itself happens when they
are together and we have only to cast up the results not so in the
phenomena which are the peculiar subject of the science of chemistry
there most of the uniformities to which the causes conformed when
separate cease altogether when they are conjoined and we are not at
least in the present state of our knowledge able to foresee what result
will follow from any new combination until we have tried the specific
experiment
if this be true of chemical combinations it is still more true of those
far more complex combinations of elements which constitute organised
bodies and in which those extraordinary new uniformities arise which are
called the laws of life all organised bodies are composed of parts
similar to those composing inorganic nature and which have even
themselves existed in an inorganic state but the phenomena of life which
result from the juxtaposition of those parts in a certain manner bear no
analogy to any of the effects which would be produced by the action of the
component substances considered as mere physical agents to whatever
degree we might imagine our knowledge of the properties of the several
ingredients of a living body to be extended and perfected it is certain
that no mere summing up of the separate actions of those elements will
ever amount to the action of the living body itself the tongue for
instance is like all other parts of the animal frame composed of
gelatine fibrin and other products of the chemistry of digestion but
from no knowledge of the properties of those substances could we ever
predict that it could taste unless gelatine or fibrin could themselves
taste for no elementary fact can be in the conclusion which was not
first in the premisses
there are thus two different modes of the conjunct action of causes from
which arise two modes of conflict or mutual interference between laws of
nature suppose at a given point of time and space two or more causes
which if they acted separately would produce effects contrary or at
least conflicting with each other one of them tending to undo wholly or
partially what the other tends to do thus the expansive force of the
gases generated by the ignition of gunpowder tends to project a bullet
towards the sky while its gravity tends to make it fall to the ground a
stream running into a reservoir at one end tends to fill it higher and
higher while a drain at the other extremity tends to empty it now in
such cases as these even if the two causes which are in joint action
exactly annul one another still the laws of both are fulfilled the
effect is the same as if the drain had been open for half an hour
first75 and the stream had flowed in for as long afterwards each agent
produced the same amount of effect as if it had acted separately though
the contrary effect which was taking place during the same time
obliterated it as fast as it was produced here then are two causes
producing by their joint operation an effect which at first seems quite
dissimilar to those which they produce separately but which on
examination proves to be really the sum of those separate effects it will
be noticed that we here enlarge the idea of the sum of two effects so as
to include what is commonly called their difference but which is in
reality the result of the addition of opposites a conception to which
mankind are indebted for that admirable extension of the algebraical
calculus which has so vastly increased its powers as an instrument of
discovery by introducing into its reasonings with the sign of
subtraction prefixed and under the name of negative quantities every
description whatever of positive phenomena provided they are of such a
quality in reference to those previously introduced that to add the one
is equivalent to subtracting an equal quantity of the other
there is then one mode of the mutual interference of laws of nature in
which even when the concurrent causes annihilate each others effects
each exerts its full efficacy according to its own law its law as a
separate agent but in the other description of cases the agencies which
are brought together cease entirely and a totally different set of
phenomena arise as in the experiment of two liquids which when mixed in
certain proportions instantly become a solid mass instead of merely a
larger amount of liquid
 2 this difference between the case in which the joint effect of causes
is the sum of their separate effects and the case in which it is
heterogeneous to them between laws which work together without
alteration and laws which when called upon to work together cease and
give place to others is one of the fundamental distinctions in nature
the former case that of the composition of causes is the general one
the other is always special and exceptional there are no objects which do
not as to some of their phenomena obey the principle of the composition
of causes none that have not some laws which are rigidly fulfilled in
every combination into which the objects enter the weight of a body for
instance is a property which it retains in all the combinations in which
it is placed the weight of a chemical compound or of an organized body
is equal to the sum of the weights of the elements which compose it the
weight either of the elements or of the compound will vary if they be
carried farther from their centre of attraction or brought nearer to it
but whatever affects the one affects the other they always remain
precisely equal so again the component parts of a vegetable or animal
substance do not lose their mechanical and chemical properties as separate
agents when by a peculiar mode of juxtaposition they as an aggregate
whole acquire physiological or vital properties in addition those bodies
continue as before to obey mechanical and chemical laws in so far as
the operation of those laws is not counteracted by the new laws which
govern them as organised beings when in short a concurrence of causes
takes place which calls into action new laws bearing no analogy to any
that we can trace in the separate operation of the causes the new laws
while they supersede one portion of the previous laws may coexist with
another portion and may even compound the effect of those previous laws
with their own
again laws which were themselves generated in the second mode may
generate others in the first though there be laws which like those of
chemistry and physiology owe their existence to a breach of the principle
of composition of causes it does not follow that these peculiar or as
they might be termed heteropathic laws are not capable of composition
with one another the causes which by one combination have had their laws
altered may carry their new laws with them unaltered into their ulterior
combinations and hence there is no reason to despair of ultimately
raising chemistry and physiology to the condition of deductive sciences
for though it is impossible to deduce all chemical and physiological
truths from the laws or properties of simple substances or elementary
agents they may possibly be deducible from laws which commence when these
elementary agents are brought together into some moderate number of not
very complex combinations the laws of life will never be deducible from
the mere laws of the ingredients but the prodigiously complex facts of
life may all be deducible from comparatively simple laws of life which
laws depending indeed on combinations but on comparatively simple
combinations of antecedents may in more complex circumstances be
strictly compounded with one another and with the physical and chemical
laws of the ingredients the details of the vital phenomena even now
afford innumerable exemplifications of the composition of causes and in
proportion as these phenomena are more accurately studied there appears
more reason to believe that the same laws which operate in the simpler
combinations of circumstances do in fact continue to be observed in the
more complex this will be found equally true in the phenomena of mind
and even in social and political phenomena the result of the laws of
mind it is in the case of chemical phenomena that the least progress has
yet been made in bringing the special laws under general ones from which
they may be deduced but there are even in chemistry many circumstances to
encourage the hope that such general laws will hereafter be discovered
the different actions of a chemical compound will never undoubtedly be
found to be the sums of the actions of its separate elements but there
may exist between the properties of the compound and those of its
elements some constant relation which if discoverable by a sufficient
induction would enable us to foresee the sort of compound which will
result from a new combination before we have actually tried it and to
judge of what sort of elements some new substance is compounded before we
have analysed it the law of definite proportions first discovered in its
full generality by dalton is a complete solution of this problem in one
though but a secondary aspect that of quantity and in respect to
quality we have already some partial generalizations sufficient to
indicate the possibility of ultimately proceeding farther we can
predicate some common properties of the kind of compounds which result
from the combination in each of the small number of possible proportions
of any acid whatever with any base we have also the curious law
discovered by berthollet that two soluble salts mutually decompose one
another whenever the new combinations which result produce an insoluble
compound or one less soluble than the two former another uniformity is
that called the law of isomorphism the identity of the crystalline forms
of substances which possess in common certain peculiarities of chemical
composition thus it appears that even heteropathic laws such laws of
combined agency as are not compounded of the laws of the separate
agencies are yet at least in some cases derived from them according to
a fixed principle there may therefore be laws of the generation of laws
from others dissimilar to them and in chemistry these undiscovered laws
of the dependence of the properties of the compound on the properties of
its elements may together with the laws of the elements themselves
furnish the premisses by which the science is perhaps destined one day to
be rendered deductive
it would seem therefore that there is no class of phenomena in which the
composition of causes does not obtain that as a general rule causes in
combination produce exactly the same effects as when acting singly but
that this rule though general is not universal that in some instances
at some particular points in the transition from separate to united
action the laws change and an entirely new set of effects are either
added to or take the place of those which arise from the separate agency
of the same causes the laws of these new effects being again susceptible
of composition to an indefinite extent like the laws which they
superseded
 3 that effects are proportional to their causes is laid down by some
writers as an axiom in the theory of causation and great use is sometimes
made of this principle in reasonings respecting the laws of nature though
it is incumbered with many difficulties and apparent exceptions which
much ingenuity has been expended in showing not to be real ones this
proposition in so far as it is true enters as a particular case into the
general principle of the composition of causes the causes compounded
being in this instance homogeneous in which case if in any their
joint effect might be expected to be identical with the sum of their
separate effects if a force equal to one hundred weight will raise a
certain body along an inclined plane a force equal to two hundred weight
will raise two bodies exactly similar and thus the effect is proportional
to the cause but does not a force equal to two hundred weight actually
contain in itself two forces each equal to one hundred weight which if
employed apart would separately raise the two bodies in question the
fact therefore that when exerted jointly they raise both bodies at once
results from the composition of causes and is a mere instance of the
general fact that mechanical forces are subject to the law of composition
and so in every other case which can be supposed for the doctrine of the
proportionality of effects to their causes cannot of course be applicable
to cases in which the augmentation of the cause alters the kind of
effect that is in which the surplus quantity superadded to the cause
does not become compounded with it but the two together generate an
altogether new phenomenon suppose that the application of a certain
quantity of heat to a body merely increases its bulk that a double
quantity melts it and a triple quantity decomposes it these three
effects being heterogeneous no ratio whether corresponding or not to
that of the quantities of heat applied can be established between them
thus the supposed axiom of the proportionality of effects to their causes
fails at the precise point where the principle of the composition of
causes also fails viz where the concurrence of causes is such as to
determine a change in the properties of the body generally and render it
subject to new laws more or less dissimilar to those to which it
conformed in its previous state the recognition therefore of any such
law of proportionality is superseded by the more comprehensive principle
in which as much of it as is true is implicitly asserted
the general remarks on causation which seemed necessary as an
introduction to the theory of the inductive process may here terminate
that process is essentially an inquiry into cases of causation all the
uniformities which exist in the succession of phenomena and most of the
uniformities in their coexistence are either as we have seen themselves
laws of causation or consequences resulting from and corollaries capable
of being deduced from such laws if we could determine what causes are
correctly assigned to what effects and what effects to what causes we
should be virtually acquainted with the whole course of nature all those
uniformities which are mere results of causation might then be explained
and accounted for and every individual fact or event might be predicted
provided we had the requisite data that is the requisite knowledge of
the circumstances which in the particular instance preceded it
to ascertain therefore what are the laws of causation which exist in
nature to determine the effects of every cause and the causes of all
effectsis the main business of induction and to point out how this is
done is the chief object of inductive logic
chapter vii of observation and experiment
 1 it results from the preceding exposition that the process of
ascertaining what consequents in nature are invariably connected with
what antecedents or in other words what phenomena are related to each
other as causes and effects is in some sort a process of analysis that
every fact which begins to exist has a cause and that this cause must be
found somewhere among the facts which immediately preceded the occurrence
may be taken for certain the whole of the present facts are the
infallible result of all past facts and more immediately of all the facts
which existed at the moment previous here then is a great sequence
which we know to be uniform if the whole prior state of the entire
universe could again recur it would again be followed by the present
state the question is how to resolve this complex uniformity into the
simpler uniformities which compose it and assign to each portion of the
vast antecedent the portion of the consequent which is attendant on it
this operation which we have called analytical inasmuch as it is the
resolution of a complex whole into the component elements is more than a
merely mental analysis no mere contemplation of the phenomena and
partition of them by the intellect alone will of itself accomplish the
end we have now in view nevertheless such a mental partition is an
indispensable first step the order of nature as perceived at a first
glance presents at every instant a chaos followed by another chaos we
must decompose each chaos into single facts we must learn to see in the
chaotic antecedent a multitude of distinct antecedents in the chaotic
consequent a multitude of distinct consequents this supposing it done
will not of itself tell us on which of the antecedents each consequent is
invariably attendant to determine that point we must endeavour to effect
a separation of the facts from one another not in our minds only but in
nature the mental analysis however must take place first and every one
knows that in the mode of performing it one intellect differs immensely
from another it is the essence of the act of observing for the observer
is not he who merely sees the thing which is before his eyes but he who
sees what parts that thing is composed of to do this well is a rare
talent one person from inattention or attending only in the wrong
place overlooks half of what he sees another sets down much more than he
sees confounding it with what he imagines or with what he infers
another takes note of the kind of all the circumstances but being
inexpert in estimating their degree leaves the quantity of each vague and
uncertain another sees indeed the whole but makes such an awkward
division of it into parts throwing things into one mass which require to
be separated and separating others which might more conveniently be
considered as one that the result is much the same sometimes even worse
than if no analysis had been attempted at all it would be possible to
point out what qualities of mind and modes of mental culture fit a
person for being a good observer that however is a question not of
logic but of the theory of education in the most enlarged sense of the
term there is not properly an art of observing there may be rules for
observing but these like rules for inventing are properly instructions
for the preparation of ones own mind for putting it into the state in
which it will be most fitted to observe or most likely to invent they
are therefore essentially rules of selfeducation which is a different
thing from logic they do not teach how to do the thing but how to make
ourselves capable of doing it they are an art of strengthening the limbs
not an art of using them
the extent and minuteness of observation which may be requisite and the
degree of decomposition to which it may be necessary to carry the mental
analysis depend on the particular purpose in view to ascertain the state
of the whole universe at any particular moment is impossible but would
also be useless in making chemical experiments we do not think it
necessary to note the position of the planets because experience has
shown as a very superficial experience is sufficient to show that in
such cases that circumstance is not material to the result and
accordingly in the ages when men believed in the occult influences of the
heavenly bodies it might have been unphilosophical to omit ascertaining
the precise condition of those bodies at the moment of the experiment as
to the degree of minuteness of the mental subdivision if we were obliged
to break down what we observe into its very simplest elements that is
literally into single facts it would be difficult to say where we should
find them we can hardly ever affirm that our divisions of any kind have
reached the ultimate unit but this too is fortunately unnecessary the
only object of the mental separation is to suggest the requisite physical
separation so that we may either accomplish it ourselves or seek for it
in nature and we have done enough when we have carried the subdivision as
far as the point at which we are able to see what observations or
experiments we require it is only essential at whatever point our mental
decomposition of facts may for the present have stopped that we should
hold ourselves ready and able to carry it farther as occasion requires
and should not allow the freedom of our discriminating faculty to be
imprisoned by the swathes and bands of ordinary classification as was the
case with all early speculative inquirers not excepting the greeks to
whom it hardly ever occurred that what was called by one abstract name
might in reality be several phenomena or that there was a possibility
of decomposing the facts of the universe into any elements but those which
ordinary language already recognised
 2 the different antecedents and consequents being then supposed to
be so far as the case requires ascertained and discriminated from one
another we are to inquire which is connected with which in every
instance which comes under our observation there are many antecedents and
many consequents if those antecedents could not be severed from one
another except in thought or if those consequents never were found apart
it would be impossible for us to distinguish  posteriori at least the
real laws or to assign to any cause its effect or to any effect its
cause to do so we must be able to meet with some of the antecedents
apart from the rest and observe what follows from them or some of the
consequents and observe by what they are preceded we must in short
follow the baconian rule of varying the circumstances this is indeed
only the first rule of physical inquiry and not as some have thought
the sole rule but it is the foundation of all the rest
for the purpose of varying the circumstances we may have recourse
according to a distinction commonly made either to observation or to
experiment we may either find an instance in nature suited to our
purposes or by an artificial arrangement of circumstances make one
the value of the instance depends on what it is in itself not on the mode
in which it is obtained its employment for the purposes of induction
depends on the same principles in the one case and in the other as the
uses of money are the same whether it is inherited or acquired there is
in short no difference in kind no real logical distinction between the
two processes of investigation there are however practical distinctions
to which it is of considerable importance to advert
 3 the first and most obvious distinction between observation and
experiment is that the latter is an immense extension of the former it
not only enables us to produce a much greater number of variations in the
circumstances than nature spontaneously offers but also in thousands of
cases to produce the precise sort of variation which we are in want of
for discovering the law of the phenomenon a service which nature being
constructed on a quite different scheme from that of facilitating our
studies is seldom so friendly as to bestow upon us for example in order
to ascertain what principle in the atmosphere enables it to sustain life
the variation we require is that a living animal should be immersed in
each component element of the atmosphere separately but nature does not
supply either oxygen or azote in a separate state we are indebted to
artificial experiment for our knowledge that it is the former and not the
latter which supports respiration and for our knowledge of the very
existence of the two ingredients
thus far the advantage of experimentation over simple observation is
universally recognised all are aware that it enables us to obtain
innumerable combinations of circumstances which are not to be found in
nature and so add to natures experiments a multitude of experiments of
our own but there is another superiority or as bacon would have
expressed it another prerogative of instances artificially obtained over
spontaneous instancesof our own experiments over even the same
experiments when made by naturewhich is not of less importance and
which is far from being felt and acknowledged in the same degree
when we can produce a phenomenon artificially we can take it as it were
home with us and observe it in the midst of circumstances with which in
all other respects we are accurately acquainted if we desire to know what
are the effects of the cause a and are able to produce a by means at our
disposal we can generally determine at our own discretion so far as is
compatible with the nature of the phenomenon a the whole of the
circumstances which shall be present along with it and thus knowing
exactly the simultaneous state of everything else which is within the
reach of as influence we have only to observe what alteration is made in
that state by the presence of a
for example by the electric machine we can produce in the midst of known
circumstances the phenomena which nature exhibits on a grander scale in
the form of lightning and thunder now let any one consider what amount of
knowledge of the effects and laws of electric agency mankind could have
obtained from the mere observation of thunderstorms and compare it with
that which they have gained and may expect to gain from electrical and
galvanic experiments this example is the more striking now that we have
reason to believe that electric action is of all natural phenomena except
heat the most pervading and universal which therefore it might
antecedently have been supposed could stand least in need of artificial
means of production to enable it to be studied while the fact is so much
the contrary that without the electric machine the voltaic battery and
the leyden jar we probably should never have suspected the existence of
electricity as one of the great agents in nature the few electric
phenomena we should have known of would have continued to be regarded
either as supernatural or as a sort of anomalies and eccentricities in
the order of the universe
when we have succeeded in insulating the phenomenon which is the subject
of inquiry by placing it among known circumstances we may produce
further variations of circumstances to any extent and of such kinds as we
think best calculated to bring the laws of the phenomenon into a clear
light by introducing one well defined circumstance after another into the
experiment we obtain assurance of the manner in which the phenomenon
behaves under an indefinite variety of possible circumstances thus
chemists after having obtained some newlydiscovered substance in a pure
state that is having made sure that there is nothing present which can
interfere with and modify its agency introduce various other substances
one by one to ascertain whether it will combine with them or decompose
them and with what result and also apply heat or electricity or
pressure to discover what will happen to the substance under each of
these circumstances
but if on the other hand it is out of our power to produce the
phenomenon and we have to seek for instances in which nature produces it
the task before us is very different instead of being able to choose what
the concomitant circumstances shall be we now have to discover what they
are which when we go beyond the simplest and most accessible cases it
is next to impossible to do with any precision and completeness let us
take as an exemplification of a phenomenon which we have no means of
fabricating artificially a human mind nature produces many but the
consequence of our not being able to produce it by art is that in every
instance in which we see a human mind developing itself or acting upon
other things we see it surrounded and obscured by an indefinite multitude
of unascertainable circumstances rendering the use of the common
experimental methods almost delusive we may conceive to what extent this
is true if we consider among other things that whenever nature produces
a human mind she produces in close connexion with it also a body that
is a vast complication of physical facts in no two cases perhaps exactly
similar and most of which except the mere structure which we can
examine in a sort of coarse way after it has ceased to act are radically
out of the reach of our means of exploration if instead of a human mind
we suppose the subject of investigation to be a human society or state
all the same difficulties recur in a greatly augmented degree
we have thus already come within sight of a conclusion which the progress
of the inquiry will i think bring before us with the clearest evidence
namely that in the sciences which deal with phenomena in which artificial
experiments are impossible as in the case of astronomy or in which they
have a very limited range as in physiology mental philosophy and the
social science induction from direct experience is practised at a
disadvantage generally equivalent to impracticability from which it
follows that the methods of those sciences in order to accomplish
anything worthy of attainment must be to a great extent if not
principally deductive this is already known to be the case with the
first of the sciences we have mentioned astronomy that it is not
generally recognised as true of the others is probably one of the reasons
why they are still in their infancy
 4 if what is called pure observation is at so great a disadvantage
compared with artificial experimentation in one department of the direct
exploration of phenomena there is another branch in which the advantage
is all on the side of the former
inductive inquiry having for its object to ascertain what causes are
connected with what effects we may begin this search at either end of the
road which leads from the one point to the other we may either inquire
into the effects of a given cause or into the causes of a given effect
the fact that light blackens chloride of silver might have been discovered
either by experiments on light trying what effect it would produce on
various substances or by observing that portions of the chloride had
repeatedly become black and inquiring into the circumstances the effect
of the urali poison might have become known either by administering it to
animals or by examining how it happened that the wounds which the indians
of guiana inflict with their arrows prove so uniformly mortal now it is
manifest from the mere statement of the examples without any theoretical
discussion that artificial experimentation is applicable only to the
former of these modes of investigation we can take a cause and try what
it will produce but we cannot take an effect and try what it will be
produced by we can only watch till we see it produced or are enabled to
produce it by accident
this would be of little importance if it always depended on our choice
from which of the two ends of the sequence we would undertake our
inquiries but we have seldom any option as we can only travel from the
known to the unknown we are obliged to commence at whichever end we are
best acquainted with if the agent is more familiar to us than its
effects we watch for or contrive instances of the agent under such
varieties of circumstances as are open to us and observe the result if
on the contrary the conditions on which a phenomenon depends are obscure
but the phenomenon itself familiar we must commence our inquiry from the
effect if we are struck with the fact that chloride of silver has been
blackened and have no suspicion of the cause we have no resource but to
compare instances in which the fact has chanced to occur until by that
comparison we discover that in all those instances the substance had been
exposed to light if we knew nothing of the indian arrows but their fatal
effect accident alone could turn our attention to experiments on the
urali in the regular course of investigation we could only inquire or
try to observe what had been done to the arrows in particular instances
wherever having nothing to guide us to the cause we are obliged to set
out from the effect and to apply the rule of varying the circumstances to
the consequents not the antecedents we are necessarily destitute of the
resource of artificial experimentation we cannot at our choice obtain
consequents as we can antecedents under any set of circumstances
compatible with their nature there are no means of producing effects but
through their causes and by the supposition the causes of the effect in
question are not known to us we have therefore no expedient but to study
it where it offers itself spontaneously if nature happens to present us
with instances sufficiently varied in their circumstances and if we are
able to discover either among the proximate antecedents or among some
other order of antecedents something which is always found when the
effect is found however various the circumstances and never found when
it is not we may discover by mere observation without experiment a real
uniformity in nature
but though this is certainly the most favourable case for sciences of pure
observation as contrasted with those in which artificial experiments are
possible there is in reality no case which more strikingly illustrates
the inherent imperfection of direct induction when not founded on
experimentation suppose that by a comparison of cases of the effect we
have found an antecedent which appears to be and perhaps is invariably
connected with it we have not yet proved that antecedent to be the cause
until we have reversed the process and produced the effect by means of
that antecedent if we can produce the antecedent artificially and if
when we do so the effect follows the induction is complete that
antecedent is the cause of that consequent76 but we have then added the
evidence of experiment to that of simple observation until we had done
so we had only proved invariable antecedence but not unconditional
antecedence or causation until it had been shown by the actual
production of the antecedent under known circumstances and the occurrence
thereupon of the consequent that the antecedent was really the condition
on which it depended the uniformity of succession which was proved to
exist between them might for aught we knew be like the succession of
day and night no case of causation at all both antecedent and consequent
might be successive stages of the effect of an ulterior cause
observation in short without experiment supposing no aid from
deduction can ascertain sequences and coexistences but cannot prove
causation
in order to see these remarks verified by the actual state of the
sciences we have only to think of the condition of natural history in
zoology for example there is an immense number of uniformities
ascertained some of coexistence others of succession to many of which
notwithstanding considerable variations of the attendant circumstances we
know not any exception but the antecedents for the most part are such
as we cannot artificially produce or if we can it is only by setting in
motion the exact process by which nature produces them and this being to
us a mysterious process of which the main circumstances are not only
unknown but unobservable the name of experimentation would here be
completely misapplied such are the facts and what is the result that on
this vast subject which affords so much and such varied scope for
observation we have not properly speaking ascertained a single cause a
single unconditional uniformity we know not in the case of most of the
phenomena that we find conjoined which is the condition of the other
which is cause and which effect or whether either of them is so or they
are not rather conjunct effects of causes yet to be discovered complex
results of laws hitherto unknown
although some of the foregoing observations may be in technical
strictness of arrangement premature in this place it seemed that a few
general remarks on the difference between sciences of mere observation and
sciences of experimentation and the extreme disadvantage under which
directly inductive inquiry is necessarily carried on in the former were
the best preparation for discussing the methods of direct induction a
preparation rendering superfluous much that must otherwise have been
introduced with some inconvenience into the heart of that discussion to
the consideration of these methods we now proceed
chapter viii of the four methods of experimental inquiry
 1 the simplest and most obvious modes of singling out from among the
circumstances which precede or follow a phenomenon those with which it is
really connected by an invariable law are two in number one is by
comparing together different instances in which the phenomenon occurs the
other is by comparing instances in which the phenomenon does occur with
instances in other respects similar in which it does not these two
methods may be respectively denominated the method of agreement and the
method of difference
in illustrating these methods it will be necessary to bear in mind the
twofold character of inquiries into the laws of phenomena which may be
either inquiries into the cause of a given effect or into the effects or
properties of a given cause we shall consider the methods in their
application to either order of investigation and shall draw our examples
equally from both
we shall denote antecedents by the large letters of the alphabet and the
consequents corresponding to them by the small let a then be an agent
or cause and let the object of our inquiry be to ascertain what are the
effects of this cause if we can either find or produce the agent a in
such varieties of circumstances that the different cases have no
circumstance in common except a then whatever effect we find to be
produced in all our trials is indicated as the effect of a suppose for
example that a is tried along with b and c and that the effect is a
b c and suppose that a is next tried with d and e but without b and
c and that the effect is a d e then we may reason thus b and
c are not effects of a for they were not produced by it in the second
experiment nor are d and e for they were not produced in the first
whatever is really the effect of a must have been produced in both
instances now this condition is fulfilled by no circumstance except a
the phenomenon a cannot have been the effect of b or c since it was
produced where they were not nor of d or e since it was produced where
they were not therefore it is the effect of a
for example let the antecedent a be the contact of an alkaline substance
and an oil this combination being tried under several varieties of
circumstance resembling each other in nothing else the results agree in
the production of a greasy and detersive or saponaceous substance it is
therefore concluded that the combination of an oil and an alkali causes
the production of a soap it is thus we inquire by the method of
agreement into the effect of a given cause
in a similar manner we may inquire into the cause of a given effect let
a be the effect here as shown in the last chapter we have only the
resource of observation without experiment we cannot take a phenomenon of
which we know not the origin and try to find its mode of production by
producing it if we succeeded in such a random trial it could only be by
accident but if we can observe a in two different combinations a b
c and a d e and if we know or can discover that the antecedent
circumstances in these cases respectively were a b c and a d e we may
conclude by a reasoning similar to that in the preceding example that a
is the antecedent connected with the consequent a by a law of causation
b and c we may say cannot be causes of a since on its second
occurrence they were not present nor are d and e for they were not
present on its first occurrence a alone of the five circumstances was
found among the antecedents of a in both instances
for example let the effect a be crystallization we compare instances
in which bodies are known to assume crystalline structure but which have
no other point of agreement and we find them to have one and as far as
we can observe only one antecedent in common the deposition of a solid
matter from a liquid state either a state of fusion or of solution we
conclude therefore that the solidification of a substance from a liquid
state is an invariable antecedent of its crystallization
in this example we may go farther and say it is not only the invariable
antecedent but the cause or at least the proximate event which completes
the cause for in this case we are able after detecting the antecedent a
to produce it artificially and by finding that a follows it verify the
result of our induction the importance of thus reversing the proof was
strikingly manifested when by keeping a phial of water charged with
siliceous particles undisturbed for years a chemist i believe dr
wollaston succeeded in obtaining crystals of quartz and in the equally
interesting experiment in which sir james hall produced artificial marble
by the cooling of its materials from fusion under immense pressure two
admirable examples of the light which may be thrown upon the most secret
processes of nature by wellcontrived interrogation of her
but if we cannot artificially produce the phenomenon a the conclusion
that it is the cause of a remains subject to very considerable doubt
though an invariable it may not be the unconditional antecedent of a
but may precede it as day precedes night or night day this uncertainty
arises from the impossibility of assuring ourselves that a is the only
immediate antecedent common to both the instances if we could be certain
of having ascertained all the invariable antecedents we might be sure
that the unconditional invariable antecedent or cause must be found
somewhere among them unfortunately it is hardly ever possible to
ascertain all the antecedents unless the phenomenon is one which we can
produce artificially even then the difficulty is merely lightened not
removed men knew how to raise water in pumps long before they adverted to
what was really the operating circumstance in the means they employed
namely the pressure of the atmosphere on the open surface of the water
it is however much easier to analyse completely a set of arrangements
made by ourselves than the whole complex mass of the agencies which
nature happens to be exerting at the moment of the production of a given
phenomenon we may overlook some of the material circumstances in an
experiment with an electrical machine but we shall at the worst be
better acquainted with them than with those of a thunderstorm
the mode of discovering and proving laws of nature which we have now
examined proceeds on the following axiom whatever circumstance can be
excluded without prejudice to the phenomenon or can be absent
notwithstanding its presence is not connected with it in the way of
causation the casual circumstances being thus eliminated if only one
remains that one is the cause which we are in search of if more than
one they either are or contain among them the cause and so mutatis
mutandis of the effect as this method proceeds by comparing different
instances to ascertain in what they agree i have termed it the method of
agreement and we may adopt as its regulating principle the following
canon
first canon
if two or more instances of the phenomenon under investigation have only
one circumstance in common the circumstance in which alone all the
instances agree is the cause or effect of the given phenomenon
quitting for the present the method of agreement to which we shall almost
immediately return we proceed to a still more potent instrument of the
investigation of nature the method of difference
 2 in the method of agreement we endeavoured to obtain instances which
agreed in the given circumstance but differed in every other in the
present method we require on the contrary two instances resembling one
another in every other respect but differing in the presence or absence
of the phenomenon we wish to study if our object be to discover the
effects of an agent a we must procure a in some set of ascertained
circumstances as a b c and having noted the effects produced compare
them with the effect of the remaining circumstances b c when a is absent
if the effect of a b c is a b c and the effect of b c b c it is
evident that the effect of a is a so again if we begin at the other
end and desire to investigate the cause of an effect a we must select
an instance as a b c in which the effect occurs and in which the
antecedents were a b c and we must look out for another instance in which
the remaining circumstances b c occur without a if the antecedents
in that instance are b c we know that the cause of a must be a either
a alone or a in conjunction with some of the other circumstances present
it is scarcely necessary to give examples of a logical process to which we
owe almost all the inductive conclusions we draw in daily life when a man
is shot through the heart it is by this method we know that it was the
gunshot which killed him for he was in the fulness of life immediately
before all circumstances being the same except the wound
the axioms implied in this method are evidently the following whatever
antecedent cannot be excluded without preventing the phenomenon is the
cause or a condition of that phenomenon whatever consequent can be
excluded with no other difference in the antecedents than the absence of
a particular one is the effect of that one instead of comparing
different instances of a phenomenon to discover in what they agree this
method compares an instance of its occurrence with an instance of its
nonoccurrence to discover in what they differ the canon which is the
regulating principle of the method of difference may be expressed as
follows
second canon
if an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs and an
instance in which it does not occur have every circumstance in common
save one that one occurring only in the former the circumstance in which
alone the two instances differ is the effect or cause or a necessary
part of the cause of the phenomenon
 3 the two methods which we have now stated have many features of
resemblance but there are also many distinctions between them both are
methods of elimination this term employed in the theory of equations
to denote the process by which one after another of the elements of a
question is excluded and the solution made to depend on the relation
between the remaining elements only is well suited to express the
operation analogous to this which has been understood since the time of
bacon to be the foundation of experimental inquiry namely the successive
exclusion of the various circumstances which are found to accompany a
phenomenon in a given instance in order to ascertain what are those among
them which can be absent consistently with the existence of the
phenomenon the method of agreement stands on the ground that whatever can
be eliminated is not connected with the phenomenon by any law the method
of difference has for its foundation that whatever can not be
eliminated is connected with the phenomenon by a law
of these methods that of difference is more particularly a method of
artificial experiment while that of agreement is more especially the
resource employed where experimentation is impossible a few reflections
will prove the fact and point out the reason of it
it is inherent in the peculiar character of the method of difference that
the nature of the combinations which it requires is much more strictly
defined than in the method of agreement the two instances which are to be
compared with one another must be exactly similar in all circumstances
except the one which we are attempting to investigate they must be in the
relation of a b c and b c or of a b c and b c it is true that this
similarity of circumstances needs not extend to such as are already known
to be immaterial to the result and in the case of most phenomena we learn
at once from the commonest experience that most of the coexistent
phenomena of the universe may be either present or absent without
affecting the given phenomenon or if present are present indifferently
when the phenomenon does not happen and when it does still even
limiting the identity which is required between the two instances a b c
and b c to such circumstances as are not already known to be indifferent
it is very seldom that nature affords two instances of which we can be
assured that they stand in this precise relation to one another in the
spontaneous operations of nature there is generally such complication and
such obscurity they are mostly either on so overwhelmingly large or on so
inaccessibly minute a scale we are so ignorant of a great part of the
facts which really take place and even those of which we are not ignorant
are so multitudinous and therefore so seldom exactly alike in any two
cases that a spontaneous experiment of the kind required by the method
of difference is commonly not to be found when on the contrary we
obtain a phenomenon by an artificial experiment a pair of instances such
as the method requires is obtained almost as a matter of course provided
the process does not last a long time a certain state of surrounding
circumstances existed before we commenced the experiment this is b c we
then introduce a say for instance by merely bringing an object from
another part of the room before there has been time for any change in the
other elements it is in short as m comte observes the very nature
of an experiment to introduce into the preexisting state of
circumstances a change perfectly definite we choose a previous state of
things with which we are well acquainted so that no unforeseen alteration
in that state is likely to pass unobserved and into this we introduce as
rapidly as possible the phenomenon which we wish to study so that in
general we are entitled to feel complete assurance that the preexisting
state and the state which we have produced differ in nothing except the
presence or absence of that phenomenon if a bird is taken from a cage
and instantly plunged into carbonic acid gas the experimentalist may be
fully assured at all events after one or two repetitions that no
circumstance capable of causing suffocation had supervened in the interim
except the change from immersion in the atmosphere to immersion in
carbonic acid gas there is one doubt indeed which may remain in some
cases of this description the effect may have been produced not by the
change but by the means employed to produce the change the possibility
however of this last supposition generally admits of being conclusively
tested by other experiments it thus appears that in the study of the
various kinds of phenomena which we can by our voluntary agency modify
or control we can in general satisfy the requisitions of the method of
difference but that by the spontaneous operations of nature those
requisitions are seldom fulfilled
the reverse of this is the case with the method of agreement we do not
here require instances of so special and determinate a kind any instances
whatever in which nature presents us with a phenomenon may be examined
for the purposes of this method and if all such instances agree in
anything a conclusion of considerable value is already attained we can
seldom indeed be sure that the one point of agreement is the only one
but this ignorance does not as in the method of difference vitiate the
conclusion the certainty of the result as far as it goes is not
affected we have ascertained one invariable antecedent or consequent
however many other invariable antecedents or consequents may still remain
unascertained if a b c a d e a f g are all equally followed by a
then a is an invariable consequent of a if a b c a d e
a f g all number a among their antecedents then a is connected as
an antecedent by some invariable law with a but to determine whether
this invariable antecedent is a cause or this invariable consequent an
effect we must be able in addition to produce the one by means of the
other or at least to obtain that which alone constitutes our assurance
of having produced anything namely an instance in which the effect a
has come into existence with no other change in the preexisting
circumstances than the addition of a and this if we can do it is an
application of the method of difference not of the method of agreement
it thus appears to be by the method of difference alone that we can ever
in the way of direct experience arrive with certainty at causes the
method of agreement leads only to laws of phenomena as some writers call
them but improperly since laws of causation are also laws of phenomena
that is to uniformities which either are not laws of causation or in
which the question of causation must for the present remain undecided the
method of agreement is chiefly to be resorted to as a means of suggesting
applications of the method of difference as in the last example the
comparison of a b c a d e a f g suggested that a was the antecedent on
which to try the experiment whether it could produce a or as an
inferior resource in case the method of difference is impracticable
which as we before showed generally arises from the impossibility of
artificially producing the phenomena and hence it is that the method of
agreement though applicable in principle to either case is more
emphatically the method of investigation on those subjects where
artificial experimentation is impossible because on those it is
generally our only resource of a directly inductive nature while in the
phenomena which we can produce at pleasure the method of difference
generally affords a more efficacious process which will ascertain causes
as well as mere laws
 4 there are however many cases in which though our power of
producing the phenomenon is complete the method of difference either
cannot be made available at all or not without a previous employment of
the method of agreement this occurs when the agency by which we can
produce the phenomenon is not that of one single antecedent but of a
combination of antecedents which we have no power of separating from each
other and exhibiting apart for instance suppose the subject of inquiry
to be the cause of the double refraction of light we can produce this
phenomenon at pleasure by employing any one of the many substances which
are known to refract light in that peculiar manner but if taking one of
those substances as iceland spar for example we wish to determine on
which of the properties of iceland spar this remarkable phenomenon
depends we can make no use for that purpose of the method of
difference for we cannot find another substance precisely resembling
iceland spar except in some one property the only mode therefore of
prosecuting this inquiry is that afforded by the method of agreement by
which in fact through a comparison of all the known substances which
have the property of doubly refracting light it was ascertained that they
agree in the circumstance of being crystalline substances and though the
converse does not hold though all crystalline substances have not the
property of double refraction it was concluded with reason that there
is a real connexion between these two properties that either crystalline
structure or the cause which gives rise to that structure is one of the
conditions of double refraction
out of this employment of the method of agreement arises a peculiar
modification of that method which is sometimes of great avail in the
investigation of nature in cases similar to the above in which it is not
possible to obtain the precise pair of instances which our second canon
requiresinstances agreeing in every antecedent except a or in every
consequent except a we may yet be able by a double employment of the
method of agreement to discover in what the instances which contain a or
a differ from those which do not
if we compare various instances in which a occurs and find that they
all have in common the circumstance a and as far as can be observed no
other circumstance the method of agreement so far bears testimony to a
connexion between a and a in order to convert this evidence of
connexion into proof of causation by the direct method of difference we
ought to be able in some one of these instances as for example a b c to
leave out a and observe whether by doing so a is prevented now
supposing what is often the case that we are not able to try this
decisive experiment yet provided we can by any means discover what would
be its result if we could try it the advantage will be the same suppose
then that as we previously examined a variety of instances in which a
occurred and found them to agree in containing a so we now observe a
variety of instances in which a does not occur and find them agree in
not containing a which establishes by the method of agreement the same
connexion between the absence of a and the absence of a which was
before established between their presence as then it had been shown
that whenever a is present a is present so it being now shown that when
a is taken away a is removed along with it we have by the one
proposition a b c a b c by the other b c b c the positive and
negative instances which the method of difference requires
this method may be called the indirect method of difference or the joint
method of agreement and difference and consists in a double employment of
the method of agreement each proof being independent of the other and
corroborating it but it is not equivalent to a proof by the direct method
of difference for the requisitions of the method of difference are not
satisfied unless we can be quite sure either that the instances
affirmative of a agree in no antecedent whatever but a or that the
instances negative of a agree in nothing but the negation of a now if
it were possible which it never is to have this assurance we should not
need the joint method for either of the two sets of instances separately
would then be sufficient to prove causation this indirect method
therefore can only be regarded as a great extension and improvement of
the method of agreement but not as participating in the more cogent
nature of the method of difference the following may be stated as its
canon
third canon
if two or more instances in which the phenomenon occurs have only one
circumstance in common while two or more instances in which it does not
occur have nothing in common save the absence of that circumstance the
circumstance in which alone the two sets of instances differ is the
effect or cause or a necessary part of the cause of the phenomenon
we shall presently see that the joint method of agreement and difference
constitutes in another respect not yet adverted to an improvement upon
the common method of agreement namely in being unaffected by a
characteristic imperfection of that method the nature of which still
remains to be pointed out but as we cannot enter into this exposition
without introducing a new element of complexity into this long and
intricate discussion i shall postpone it to a subsequent chapter and
shall at once proceed to the statement of two other methods which will
complete the enumeration of the means which mankind possess for exploring
the laws of nature by specific observation and experience
 5 the first of these has been aptly denominated the method of residues
its principle is very simple subducting from any given phenomenon all the
portions which by virtue of preceding inductions can be assigned to
known causes the remainder will be the effect of the antecedents which
had been overlooked or of which the effect was as yet an unknown
quantity
suppose as before that we have the antecedents a b c followed by the
consequents a b c and that by previous inductions founded we will
suppose on the method of difference we have ascertained the causes of
some of these effects or the effects of some of these causes and are by
this means apprised that the effect of a is a and that the effect of b
is b subtracting the sum of these effects from the total phenomenon
there remains c which now without any fresh experiment we may know to
be the effect of c this method of residues is in truth a peculiar
modification of the method of difference if the instance a b c a b c
could have been compared with a single instance a b a b we should have
proved c to be the cause of c by the common process of the method of
difference in the present case however instead of a single instance a
b we have had to study separately the causes a and b and to infer from
the effects which they produce separately what effect they must produce
in the case a b c where they act together
of the two instances therefore which the method of difference
requiresthe one positive the other negativethe negative one or that
in which the given phenomenon is absent is not the direct result of
observation and experiment but has been arrived at by deduction as one
of the forms of the method of difference the method of residues partakes
of its rigorous certainty provided the previous inductions those which
gave the effects of a and b were obtained by the same infallible method
and provided we are certain that c is the only antecedent to which the
residual phenomenon c can be referred the only agent of which we had
not already calculated and subducted the effect but as we can never be
quite certain of this the evidence derived from the method of residues is
not complete unless we can obtain c artificially and try it separately or
unless its agency when once suggested can be accounted for and proved
deductively from known laws
even with these reservations the method of residues is one of the most
important among our instruments of discovery of all the methods of
investigating laws of nature this is the most fertile in unexpected
results often informing us of sequences in which neither the cause nor
the effect were sufficiently conspicuous to attract of themselves the
attention of observers the agent c may be an obscure circumstance not
likely to have been perceived unless sought for nor likely to have been
sought for until attention had been awakened by the insufficiency of the
obvious causes to account for the whole of the effect and c may be so
disguised by its intermixture with a and b that it would scarcely
have presented itself spontaneously as a subject of separate study of
these uses of the method we shall presently cite some remarkable
examples the canon of the method of residues is as follows
fourth canon
subduct from any phenomenon such part as is known by previous inductions
to be the effect of certain antecedents and the residue of the phenomenon
is the effect of the remaining antecedents
 6 there remains a class of laws which it is impracticable to ascertain
by any of the three methods which i have attempted to characterize
namely the laws of those permanent causes or indestructible natural
agents which it is impossible either to exclude or to isolate which we
can neither hinder from being present nor contrive that they shall be
present alone it would appear at first sight that we could by no means
separate the effects of these agents from the effects of those other
phenomena with which they cannot be prevented from coexisting in respect
indeed to most of the permanent causes no such difficulty exists since
though we cannot eliminate them as coexisting facts we can eliminate them
as influencing agents by simply trying our experiment in a local
situation beyond the limits of their influence the pendulum for example
has its oscillations disturbed by the vicinity of a mountain we remove
the pendulum to a sufficient distance from the mountain and the
disturbance ceases from these data we can determine by the method of
difference the amount of effect due to the mountain and beyond a certain
distance everything goes on precisely as it would do if the mountain
exercised no influence whatever which accordingly we with sufficient
reason conclude to be the fact
the difficulty therefore in applying the methods already treated of to
determine the effects of permanent causes is confined to the cases in
which it is impossible for us to get out of the local limits of their
influence the pendulum can be removed from the influence of the mountain
but it cannot be removed from the influence of the earth we cannot take
away the earth from the pendulum nor the pendulum from the earth to
ascertain whether it would continue to vibrate if the action which the
earth exerts upon it were withdrawn on what evidence then do we ascribe
its vibrations to the earths influence not on any sanctioned by the
method of difference for one of the two instances the negative instance
is wanting nor by the method of agreement for though all pendulums agree
in this that during their oscillations the earth is always present why
may we not as well ascribe the phenomenon to the sun which is equally a
coexistent fact in all the experiments it is evident that to establish
even so simple a fact of causation as this there was required some method
over and above those which we have yet examined
as another example let us take the phenomenon heat independently of all
hypothesis as to the real nature of the agency so called this fact is
certain that we are unable to exhaust any body of the whole of its heat
it is equally certain that no one ever perceived heat not emanating from
a body being unable then to separate body and heat we cannot effect
such a variation of circumstances as the foregoing three methods require
we cannot ascertain by those methods what portion of the phenomena
exhibited by any body are due to the heat contained in it if we could
observe a body with its heat and the same body entirely divested of heat
the method of difference would show the effect due to the heat apart from
that due to the body if we could observe heat under circumstances
agreeing in nothing but heat and therefore not characterized also by the
presence of a body we could ascertain the effects of heat from an
instance of heat with a body and an instance of heat without a body by
the method of agreement or we could determine by the method of difference
what effect was due to the body when the remainder which was due to the
heat would be given by the method of residues but we can do none of these
things and without them the application of any of the three methods to
the solution of this problem would be illusory it would be idle for
instance to attempt to ascertain the effect of heat by subtracting from
the phenomena exhibited by a body all that is due to its other
properties for as we have never been able to observe any bodies without a
portion of heat in them the effects due to that heat might form a part of
the very results which we were affecting to subtract in order that the
effect of heat might be shown by the residue
if therefore there were no other methods of experimental investigation
than these three we should be unable to determine the effects due to heat
as a cause but we have still a resource though we cannot exclude an
antecedent altogether we may be able to produce or nature may produce
for us some modification in it by a modification is here meant a change
in it not amounting to its total removal if some modification in the
antecedent a is always followed by a change in the consequent a the
other consequents b and c remaining the same or vice vers if
every change in a is found to have been preceded by some modification in
a none being observable in any of the other antecedents we may safely
conclude that a is wholly or in part an effect traceable to a or at
least in some way connected with it through causation for example in the
case of heat though we cannot expel it altogether from any body we can
modify it in quantity we can increase or diminish it and doing so we
find by the various methods of experimentation or observation already
treated of that such increase or diminution of heat is followed by
expansion or contraction of the body in this manner we arrive at the
conclusion otherwise unattainable by us that one of the effects of heat
is to enlarge the dimensions of bodies or what is the same thing in other
words to widen the distances between their particles
a change in a thing not amounting to its total removal that is a change
which leaves it still the same thing it was must be a change either in
its quantity or in some of its relations to other things of which
relations the principal is its position in space in the previous example
the modification which was produced in the antecedent was an alteration in
its quantity let us now suppose the question to be what influence the
moon exerts on the surface of the earth we cannot try an experiment in
the absence of the moon so as to observe what terrestrial phenomena her
annihilation would put an end to but when we find that all the variations
in the position of the moon are followed by corresponding variations in
the time and place of high water the place being always either the part
of the earth which is nearest to or that which is most remote from the
moon we have ample evidence that the moon is wholly or partially the
cause which determines the tides it very commonly happens as it does in
this instance that the variations of an effect are correspondent or
analogous to those of its cause as the moon moves further towards the
east the high water point does the same but this is not an indispensable
condition as may be seen in the same example for along with that high
water point there is at the same instant another high water point
diametrically opposite to it and which therefore of necessity moves
towards the west as the moon followed by the nearer of the tide waves
advances towards the east and yet both these motions are equally effects
of the moons motion
that the oscillations of the pendulum are caused by the earth is proved
by similar evidence those oscillations take place between equidistant
points on the two sides of a line which being perpendicular to the
earth varies with every variation in the earths position either in
space or relatively to the object speaking accurately we only know by
the method now characterized that all terrestrial bodies tend to the
earth and not to some unknown fixed point lying in the same direction in
every twentyfour hours by the earths rotation the line drawn from the
body at right angles to the earth coincides successively with all the
radii of a circle and in the course of six months the place of that
circle varies by nearly two hundred millions of miles yet in all these
changes of the earths position the line in which bodies tend to fall
continues to be directed towards it which proves that terrestrial gravity
is directed to the earth and not as was once fancied by some to a fixed
point of space
the method by which these results were obtained may be termed the method
of concomitant variations it is regulated by the following canon
fifth canon
whatever phenomenon varies in any manner whenever another phenomenon
varies in some particular manner is either a cause or an effect of that
phenomenon or is connected with it through some fact of causation
the last clause is subjoined because it by no means follows when two
phenomena accompany each other in their variations that the one is cause
and the other effect the same thing may and indeed must happen
supposing them to be two different effects of a common cause and by this
method alone it would never be possible to ascertain which of the
suppositions is the true one the only way to solve the doubt would be
that which we have so often adverted to viz by endeavouring to ascertain
whether we can produce the one set of variations by means of the other in
the case of heat for example by increasing the temperature of a body we
increase its bulk but by increasing its bulk we do not increase its
temperature on the contrary as in the rarefaction of air under the
receiver of an airpump we generally diminish it therefore heat is not
an effect but a cause of increase of bulk if we cannot ourselves
produce the variations we must endeavour though it is an attempt which
is seldom successful to find them produced by nature in some case in
which the preexisting circumstances are perfectly known to us
it is scarcely necessary to say that in order to ascertain the uniform
concomitance of variations in the effect with variations in the cause the
same precautions must be used as in any other case of the determination of
an invariable sequence we must endeavour to retain all the other
antecedents unchanged while that particular one is subjected to the
requisite series of variations or in other words that we may be
warranted in inferring causation from concomitance of variations the
concomitance itself must be proved by the method of difference
it might at first appear that the method of concomitant variations assumes
a new axiom or law of causation in general namely that every
modification of the cause is followed by a change in the effect and it
does usually happen that when a phenomenon a causes a phenomenon a any
variation in the quantity or in the various relations of a is uniformly
followed by a variation in the quantity or relations of a to take a
familiar instance that of gravitation the sun causes a certain tendency
to motion in the earth here we have cause and effect but that tendency
is towards the sun and therefore varies in direction as the sun varies
in the relation of position and moreover the tendency varies in
intensity in a certain numerical ratio to the suns distance from the
earth that is according to another relation of the sun thus we see that
there is not only an invariable connexion between the sun and the earths
gravitation but that two of the relations of the sun its position with
respect to the earth and its distance from the earth are invariably
connected as antecedents with the quantity and direction of the earths
gravitation the cause of the earths gravitating at all is simply the
sun but the cause of its gravitating with a given intensity and in a
given direction is the existence of the sun in a given direction and at a
given distance it is not strange that a modified cause which is in truth
a different cause should produce a different effect
although it is for the most part true that a modification of the cause is
followed by a modification of the effect the method of concomitant
variations does not however presuppose this as an axiom it only
requires the converse proposition that anything on whose modifications
modifications of an effect are invariably consequent must be the cause
or connected with the cause of that effect a proposition the truth of
which is evident for if the thing itself had no influence on the effect
neither could the modifications of the thing have any influence if the
stars have no power over the fortunes of mankind it is implied in the
very terms that the conjunctions or oppositions of different stars can
have no such power
although the most striking applications of the method of concomitant
variations take place in the cases in which the method of difference
strictly so called is impossible its use is not confined to those cases
it may often usefully follow after the method of difference to give
additional precision to a solution which that has found when by the
method of difference it has first been ascertained that a certain object
produces a certain effect the method of concomitant variations may be
usefully called in to determine according to what law the quantity or the
different relations of the effect follow those of the cause
 7 the case in which this method admits of the most extensive
employment is that in which the variations of the cause are variations of
quantity of such variations we may in general affirm with safety that
they will be attended not only with variations but with similar
variations of the effect the proposition that more of the cause is
followed by more of the effect being a corollary from the principle of
the composition of causes which as we have seen is the general rule of
causation cases of the opposite description in which causes change their
properties on being conjoined with one another being on the contrary
special and exceptional suppose then that when a changes in quantity
a also changes in quantity and in such a manner that we can trace the
numerical relation which the changes of the one bear to such changes of
the other as take place within our limits of observation we may then
with certain precautions safely conclude that the same numerical relation
will hold beyond those limits if for instance we find that when a is
double a is double that when a is treble or quadruple a is treble
or quadruple we may conclude that if a were a half or a third a would
be a half or a third and finally that if a were annihilated a would
be annihilated and that a is wholly the effect of a or wholly the
effect of the same cause with a and so with any other numerical relation
according to which a and a would vanish simultaneously as for instance
if a were proportional to the square of a if on the other hand a is
not wholly the effect of a but yet varies when a varies it is probably a
mathematical function not of a alone but of a and something else its
changes for example may be such as would occur if part of it remained
constant or varied on some other principle and the remainder varied in
some numerical relation to the variations of a in that case when a
diminishes a will seem to approach not towards zero but towards some
other limit and when the series of variations is such as to indicate what
that limit is if constant or the law of its variation if variable the
limit will exactly measure how much of a is the effect of some other and
independent cause and the remainder will be the effect of a or of the
cause of a
these conclusions however must not be drawn without certain precautions
in the first place the possibility of drawing them at all manifestly
supposes that we are acquainted not only with the variations but with the
absolute quantities both of a and a if we do not know the total
quantities we cannot of course determine the real numerical relation
according to which those quantities vary it is therefore an error to
conclude as some have concluded that because increase of heat expands
bodies that is increases the distance between their particles therefore
the distance is wholly the effect of heat and that if we could entirely
exhaust the body of its heat the particles would be in complete contact
this is no more than a guess and of the most hazardous sort not a
legitimate induction for since we neither know how much heat there is in
any body nor what is the real distance between any two of its particles
we cannot judge whether the contraction of the distance does or does not
follow the diminution of the quantity of heat according to such a
numerical relation that the two quantities would vanish simultaneously
in contrast with this let us consider a case in which the absolute
quantities are known the case contemplated in the first law of motion
viz that all bodies in motion continue to move in a straight line with
uniform velocity until acted upon by some new force this assertion is in
open opposition to first appearances all terrestrial objects when in
motion gradually abate their velocity and at last stop which accordingly
the ancients with their inductio per enumerationem simplicem imagined
to be the law every moving body however encounters various obstacles
as friction the resistance of the atmosphere c which we know by daily
experience to be causes capable of destroying motion it was suggested
that the whole of the retardation might be owing to these causes how was
this inquired into if the obstacles could have been entirely removed the
case would have been amenable to the method of difference they could not
be removed they could only be diminished and the case therefore
admitted only of the method of concomitant variations this accordingly
being employed it was found that every diminution of the obstacles
diminished the retardation of the motion and inasmuch as in this case
unlike the case of heat the total quantities both of the antecedent and
of the consequent were known it was practicable to estimate with an
approach to accuracy both the amount of the retardation and the amount of
the retarding causes or resistances and to judge how near they both were
to being exhausted and it appeared that the effect dwindled as rapidly
and at each step was as far on the road towards annihilation as the cause
was the simple oscillation of a weight suspended from a fixed point and
moved a little out of the perpendicular which in ordinary circumstances
lasts but a few minutes was prolonged in bordas experiments to more than
thirty hours by diminishing as much as possible the friction at the point
of suspension and by making the body oscillate in a space exhausted as
nearly as possible of its air there could therefore be no hesitation in
assigning the whole of the retardation of motion to the influence of the
obstacles and since after subducting this retardation from the total
phenomenon the remainder was an uniform velocity the result was the
proposition known as the first law of motion
there is also another characteristic uncertainty affecting the inference
that the law of variation which the quantities observe within our limits
of observation will hold beyond those limits there is of course in the
first instance the possibility that beyond the limits and in
circumstances therefore of which we have no direct experience some
counteracting cause might develop itself either a new agent or a new
property of the agents concerned which lies dormant in the circumstances
we are able to observe this is an element of uncertainty which enters
largely into all our predictions of effects but it is not peculiarly
applicable to the method of concomitant variations the uncertainty
however of which i am about to speak is characteristic of that method
especially in the cases in which the extreme limits of our observation are
very narrow in comparison with the possible variations in the quantities
of the phenomena any one who has the slightest acquaintance with
mathematics is aware that very different laws of variation may produce
numerical results which differ but slightly from one another within narrow
limits and it is often only when the absolute amounts of variation are
considerable that the difference between the results given by one law and
by another becomes appreciable when therefore such variations in the
quantity of the antecedents as we have the means of observing are small
in comparison with the total quantities there is much danger lest we
should mistake the numerical law and be led to miscalculate the
variations which would take place beyond the limits a miscalculation
which would vitiate any conclusion respecting the dependence of the effect
upon the cause that could be founded on those variations examples are
not wanting of such mistakes the formul says sir john herschel77
which have been empirically deduced for the elasticity of steam till
very recently and those for the resistance of fluids and other similar
subjects when relied on beyond the limits of the observations from which
they were deduced have almost invariably failed to support the
theoretical structures which have been erected on them
in this uncertainty the conclusion we may draw from the concomitant
variations of a and a to the existence of an invariable and exclusive
connexion between them or to the permanency of the same numerical
relation between their variations when the quantities are much greater or
smaller than those which we have had the means of observing cannot be
considered to rest on a complete induction all that in such a case can be
regarded as proved on the subject of causation is that there is some
connexion between the two phenomena that a or something which can
influence a must be one of the causes which collectively determine a
we may however feel assured that the relation which we have observed to
exist between the variations of a and a will hold true in all cases
which fall between the same extreme limits that is wherever the utmost
increase or diminution in which the result has been found by observation
to coincide with the law is not exceeded
the four methods which it has now been attempted to describe are the only
possible modes of experimental inquiry of direct induction 
posteriori as distinguished from deduction at least i know not nor am
able to imagine any others and even of these the method of residues as
we have seen is not independent of deduction though as it also requires
specific experience it may without impropriety be included among
methods of direct observation and experiment
these then with such assistance as can be obtained from deduction
compose the available resources of the human mind for ascertaining the
laws of the succession of phenomena before proceeding to point out
certain circumstances by which the employment of these methods is
subjected to an immense increase of complication and of difficulty it is
expedient to illustrate the use of the methods by suitable examples drawn
from actual physical investigations these accordingly will form the
subject of the succeeding chapter
chapter ix miscellaneous examples of the four methods
 1 i shall select as a first example an interesting speculation of one
of the most eminent of theoretical chemists professor liebig the object
in view is to ascertain the immediate cause of the death produced by
metallic poisons
arsenious acid and the salts of lead bismuth copper and mercury if
introduced into the animal organism except in the smallest doses destroy
life these facts have long been known as insulated truths of the lowest
order of generalization but it was reserved for liebig by an apt
employment of the first two of our methods of experimental inquiry to
connect these truths together by a higher induction pointing out what
property common to all these deleterious substances is the really
operating cause of their fatal effect
when solutions of these substances are placed in sufficiently close
contact with many animal products albumen milk muscular fibre and
animal membranes the acid or salt leaves the water in which it was
dissolved and enters into combination with the animal substance which
substance after being thus acted upon is found to have lost its tendency
to spontaneous decomposition or putrefaction
observation also shows in cases where death has been produced by these
poisons that the parts of the body with which the poisonous substances
have been brought into contact do not afterwards putrefy
and finally when the poison has been supplied in too small a quantity to
destroy life eschars are produced that is certain superficial portions
of the tissues are destroyed which are afterwards thrown off by the
reparative process taking place in the healthy parts
these three sets of instances admit of being treated according to the
method of agreement in all of them the metallic compounds are brought
into contact with the substances which compose the human or animal body
and the instances do not seem to agree in any other circumstance the
remaining antecedents are as different and even opposite as they could
possibly be made for in some the animal substances exposed to the action
of the poisons are in a state of life in others only in a state of
organization in others not even in that and what is the result which
follows in all the cases the conversion of the animal substance by
combination with the poison into a chemical compound held together by so
powerful a force as to resist the subsequent action of the ordinary causes
of decomposition now organic life the necessary condition of sensitive
life consisting in a continual state of decomposition and recomposition
of the different organs and tissues whatever incapacitates them for this
decomposition destroys life and thus the proximate cause of the death
produced by this description of poisons is ascertained as far as the
method of agreement can ascertain it
let us now bring our conclusion to the test of the method of difference
setting out from the cases already mentioned in which the antecedent is
the presence of substances forming with the tissues a compound incapable
of putrefaction and  fortiori incapable of the chemical actions which
constitute life and the consequent is death either of the whole
organism or of some portion of it let us compare with these cases other
cases as much resembling them as possible but in which that effect is
not produced and first many insoluble basic salts of arsenious acid
are known not to be poisonous the substance called alkargen discovered
by bunsen which contains a very large quantity of arsenic and approaches
very closely in composition to the organic arsenious compounds found in
the body has not the slightest injurious action upon the organism now
when these substances are brought into contact with the tissues in any
way they do not combine with them they do not arrest their progress to
decomposition as far therefore as these instances go it appears that
when the effect is absent it is by reason of the absence of that
antecedent which we had already good ground for considering as the
proximate cause
but the rigorous conditions of the method of difference are not yet
satisfied for we cannot be sure that these unpoisonous bodies agree with
the poisonous substances in every property except the particular one of
entering into a difficultly decomposable compound with the animal tissues
to render the method strictly applicable we need an instance not of a
different substance but of one of the very same substances in
circumstances which would prevent it from forming with the tissues the
sort of compound in question and then if death does not follow our case
is made out now such instances are afforded by the antidotes to these
poisons for example in case of poisoning by arsenious acid if hydrated
peroxide of iron is administered the destructive agency is instantly
checked now this peroxide is known to combine with the acid and form a
compound which being insoluble cannot act at all on animal tissues so
again sugar is a wellknown antidote to poisoning by salts of copper and
sugar reduces those salts either into metallic copper or into the red
suboxide neither of which enters into combination with animal matter the
disease called painters colic so common in manufactories of white lead
is unknown where the workmen are accustomed to take as a preservative
sulphuricacidlemonade a solution of sugar rendered acid by sulphuric
acid now diluted sulphuric acid has the property of decomposing all
compounds of lead with organic matter or of preventing them from being
formed
there is another class of instances of the nature required by the method
of difference which seem at first sight to conflict with the theory
soluble salts of silver such for instance as the nitrate have the same
stiffening antiseptic effect on decomposing animal substances as corrosive
sublimate and the most deadly metallic poisons and when applied to the
external parts of the body the nitrate is a powerful caustic depriving
those parts of all active vitality and causing them to be thrown off by
the neighbouring living structures in the form of an eschar the nitrate
and the other salts of silver ought then it would seem if the theory be
correct to be poisonous yet they may be administered internally with
perfect impunity from this apparent exception arises the strongest
confirmation which the theory has yet received nitrate of silver in
spite of its chemical properties does not poison when introduced into the
stomach but in the stomach as in all animal liquids there is common
salt and in the stomach there is also free muriatic acid these
substances operate as natural antidotes combining with the nitrate and
if its quantity is not too great immediately converting it into chloride
of silver a substance very slightly soluble and therefore incapable of
combining with the tissues although to the extent of its solubility it
has a medicinal influence through an entirely different class of organic
actions
the preceding instances have afforded an induction of a high order of
conclusiveness illustrative of the two simplest of our four methods
although not rising to the maximum of certainty which the method of
difference in its most perfect exemplification is capable of affording
for let us not forget the positive instance and the negative one which
the rigour of that method requires ought to differ only in the presence
or absence of one single circumstance now in the preceding argument
they differ in the presence or absence not of a single circumstance but
of a single substance and as every substance has innumerable
properties there is no knowing what number of real differences are
involved in what is nominally and apparently only one difference it is
conceivable that the antidote the peroxide of iron for example may
counteract the poison through some other of its properties than that of
forming an insoluble compound with it and if so the theory would fall to
the ground so far as it is supported by that instance this source of
uncertainty which is a serious hindrance to all extensive generalizations
in chemistry is however reduced in the present case to almost the lowest
degree possible when we find that not only one substance but many
substances possess the capacity of acting as antidotes to metallic
poisons and that all these agree in the property of forming insoluble
compounds with the poisons while they cannot be ascertained to agree in
any other property whatsoever we have thus in favour of the theory all
the evidence which can be obtained by what we termed the indirect method
of difference or the joint method of agreement and difference the
evidence of which though it never can amount to that of the method of
difference properly so called may approach indefinitely near to it
 2 let the object be78 to ascertain the law of what is termed
induced electricity to find under what conditions any electrified body
whether positively or negatively electrified gives rise to a contrary
electric state in some other body adjacent to it
the most familiar exemplification of the phenomenon to be investigated is
the following around the prime conductors of an electrical machine the
atmosphere to some distance or any conducting surface suspended in that
atmosphere is found to be in an electric condition opposite to that of
the prime conductor itself near and around the positive prime conductor
there is negative electricity and near and around the negative prime
conductor there is positive electricity when pith balls are brought near
to either of the conductors they become electrified with the opposite
electricity to it either receiving a share from the already electrified
atmosphere by conduction or acted upon by the direct inductive influence
of the conductor itself they are then attracted by the conductor to which
they are in opposition or if withdrawn in their electrified state they
will be attracted by any other oppositely charged body in like manner the
hand if brought near enough to the conductor receives or gives an
electric discharge now we have no evidence that a charged conductor can
be suddenly discharged unless by the approach of a body oppositely
electrified in the case therefore of the electrical machine it appears
that the accumulation of electricity in an insulated conductor is always
accompanied by the excitement of the contrary electricity in the
surrounding atmosphere and in every conductor placed near the former
conductor it does not seem possible in this case to produce one
electricity by itself
let us now examine all the other instances which we can obtain resembling
this instance in the given consequent namely the evolution of an
opposite electricity in the neighbourhood of an electrified body as one
remarkable instance we have the leyden jar and after the splendid
experiments of faraday in complete and final establishment of the
substantial identity of magnetism and electricity we may cite the magnet
both the natural and the electromagnet in neither of which is it
possible to produce one kind of electricity by itself or to charge one
pole without charging an opposite pole with the contrary electricity at
the same time we cannot have a magnet with one pole if we break a
natural loadstone into a thousand pieces each piece will have its two
oppositely electrified poles complete within itself in the voltaic
circuit again we cannot have one current without its opposite in the
ordinary electric machine the glass cylinder or plate and the rubber
acquire opposite electricities
from all these instances treated by the method of agreement a general
law appears to result the instances embrace all the known modes in which
a body can become charged with electricity and in all of them there is
found as a concomitant or consequent the excitement of the opposite
electric state in some other body or bodies it seems to follow that the
two facts are invariably connected and that the excitement of electricity
in any body has for one of its necessary conditions the possibility of a
simultaneous excitement of the opposite electricity in some neighbouring
body
as the two contrary electricities can only be produced together so they
can only cease together this may be shown by an application of the method
of difference to the example of the leyden jar it needs scarcely be here
remarked that in the leyden jar electricity can be accumulated and
retained in considerable quantity by the contrivance of having two
conducting surfaces of equal extent and parallel to each other through
the whole of that extent with a nonconducting substance such as glass
between them when one side of the jar is charged positively the other is
charged negatively and it was by virtue of this fact that the leyden jar
served just now as an instance in our employment of the method of
agreement now it is impossible to discharge one of the coatings unless
the other can be discharged at the same time a conductor held to the
positive side cannot convey away any electricity unless an equal quantity
be allowed to pass from the negative side if one coating be perfectly
insulated the charge is safe the dissipation of one must proceed pari
passu with that of the other
the law thus strongly indicated admits of corroboration by the method of
concomitant variations the leyden jar is capable of receiving a much
higher charge than can ordinarily be given to the conductor of an
electrical machine now in the case of the leyden jar the metallic
surface which receives the induced electricity is a conductor exactly
similar to that which receives the primary charge and is therefore as
susceptible of receiving and retaining the one electricity as the
opposite surface of receiving and retaining the other but in the machine
the neighbouring body which is to be oppositely electrified is the
surrounding atmosphere or any body casually brought near to the
conductor and as these are generally much inferior in their capacity of
becoming electrified to the conductor itself their limited power imposes
a corresponding limit to the capacity of the conductor for being charged
as the capacity of the neighbouring body for supporting the opposition
increases a higher charge becomes possible and to this appears to be
owing the great superiority of the leyden jar
a further and most decisive confirmation by the method of difference is
to be found in one of faradays experiments in the course of his
researches on the subject of induced electricity
since common or machine electricity and voltaic electricity may be
considered for the present purpose to be identical faraday wished to know
whether as the prime conductor develops opposite electricity upon a
conductor in its vicinity so a voltaic current running along a wire would
induce an opposite current upon another wire laid parallel to it at a
short distance now this case is similar to the cases previously examined
in every circumstance except the one to which we have ascribed the effect
we found in the former instances that whenever electricity of one kind was
excited in one body electricity of the opposite kind must be excited in a
neighbouring body but in faradays experiment this indispensable
opposition exists within the wire itself from the nature of a voltaic
charge the two opposite currents necessary to the existence of each other
are both accommodated in one wire and there is no need of another wire
placed beside it to contain one of them in the same way as the leyden jar
must have a positive and a negative surface the exciting cause can and
does produce all the effect which its laws require independently of any
electric excitement of a neighbouring body now the result of the
experiment with the second wire was that no opposite current was
produced there was an instantaneous effect at the closing and breaking of
the voltaic circuit electric inductions appeared when the two wires were
moved to and from one another but these are phenomena of a different
class there was no induced electricity in the sense in which this is
predicated of the leyden jar there was no sustained current running up
the one wire while an opposite current ran down the neighbouring wire and
this alone would have been a true parallel case to the other
it thus appears by the combined evidence of the method of agreement the
method of concomitant variations and the most rigorous form of the method
of difference that neither of the two kinds of electricity can be excited
without an equal excitement of the other and opposite kind that both are
effects of the same cause that the possibility of the one is a condition
of the possibility of the other and the quantity of the one an impassable
limit to the quantity of the other a scientific result of considerable
interest in itself and illustrating those three methods in a manner both
characteristic and easily intelligible79
 3 our third example shall be extracted from sir john herschels
discourse on the study of natural philosophy a work replete with
happilyselected exemplifications of inductive processes from almost every
department of physical science and in which alone of all books which i
have met with the four methods of induction are distinctly recognised
though not so clearly characterized and defined nor their correlation so
fully shown as has appeared to me desirable the present example is
described by sir john herschel as one of the most beautiful specimens
which can be cited of inductive experimental inquiry lying within a
moderate compass the theory of dew first promulgated by the late dr
wells and now universally adopted by scientific authorities the passages
in inverted commas are extracted verbatim from the discourse80
suppose dew were the phenomenon proposed whose cause we would know in
the first place we must determine precisely what we mean by dew what the
fact really is whose cause we desire to investigate we must separate
dew from rain and the moisture of fogs and limit the application of the
term to what is really meant which is the spontaneous appearance of
moisture on substances exposed in the open air when no rain or visible
wet is falling this answers to a preliminary operation which will be
characterized in the ensuing book treating of operations subsidiary to
induction81 the state of the question being fixed we come to the
solution
now here we have analogous phenomena in the moisture which bedews a cold
metal or stone when we breathe upon it that which appears on a glass of
water fresh from the well in hot weather that which appears on the inside
of windows when sudden rain or hail chills the external air that which
runs down our walls when after a long frost a warm moist thaw comes on
comparing these cases we find that they all contain the phenomenon which
was proposed as the subject of investigation now all these instances
agree in one point the coldness of the object dewed in comparison with
the air in contact with it but there still remains the most important
case of all that of nocturnal dew does the same circumstance exist in
this case is it a fact that the object dewed is colder than the air
certainly not one would at first be inclined to say for what is to
make it so but  the experiment is easy we have only to lay a
thermometer in contact with the dewed substance and hang one at a little
distance above it out of reach of its influence the experiment has been
therefore made the question has been asked and the answer has been
invariably in the affirmative whenever an object contracts dew it is
colder than the air
here then is a complete application of the method of agreement
establishing the fact of an invariable connexion between the deposition of
dew on a surface and the coldness of that surface compared with the
external air but which of these is cause and which effect or are they
both effects of something else on this subject the method of agreement
can afford us no light we must call in a more potent method we must
collect more facts or which comes to the same thing vary the
circumstances since every instance in which the circumstances differ is a
fresh fact and especially we must note the contrary or negative cases
ie where no dew is produced for a comparison between instances of
dew and instances of no dew is the condition necessary to bring the
method of difference into play
now first no dew is produced on the surface of polished metals but it
is very copiously on glass both exposed with their faces upwards and
in some cases the under side of a horizontal plate of glass is also
dewed here is an instance in which the effect is produced and another
instance in which it is not produced but we cannot yet pronounce as the
canon of the method of difference requires that the latter instance
agrees with the former in all its circumstances except one for the
differences between glass and polished metals are manifold and the only
thing we can as yet be sure of is that the cause of dew will be found
among the circumstances by which the former substance is distinguished
from the latter but if we could be sure that glass and the various other
substances on which dew is deposited have only one quality in common
and that polished metals and the other substances on which dew is not
deposited have also nothing in common but the one circumstance of not
having the one quality which the others have the requisitions of the
method of difference would be completely satisfied and we should
recognise in that quality of the substances the cause of dew this
accordingly is the path of inquiry which is next to be pursued
in the cases of polished metal and polished glass the contrast shows
evidently that the substance has much to do with the phenomenon
therefore let the substance alone be diversified as much as possible by
exposing polished surfaces of various kinds this done a scale of
intensity becomes obvious those polished substances are found to be most
strongly dewed which conduct heat worst while those which conduct well
resist dew most effectually the complication increases here is the
method of concomitant variations called to our assistance and no other
method was practicable on this occasion for the quality of conducting
heat could not be excluded since all substances conduct heat in some
degree the conclusion obtained is that cteris paribus the deposition
of dew is in some proportion to the power which the body possesses of
resisting the passage of heat and that this therefore or something
connected with this must be at least one of the causes which assist in
producing the deposition of dew on the surface
but if we expose rough surfaces instead of polished we sometimes find
this law interfered with thus roughened iron especially if painted over
or blackened becomes dewed sooner than varnished paper the kind of
surface therefore has a great influence expose then the same
material in very diversified states as to surface that is employ the
method of difference to ascertain concomitance of variations and
another scale of intensity becomes at once apparent those surfaces
which part with their heat most readily by radiation are found to
contract dew most copiously here therefore are the requisites for a
second employment of the method of concomitant variations which in this
case also is the only method available since all substances radiate heat
in some degree or other the conclusion obtained by this new application
of the method is that cteris paribus the deposition of dew is also in
some proportion to the power of radiating heat and that the quality of
doing this abundantly or some cause on which that quality depends is
another of the causes which promote the deposition of dew on the
substance
again the influence ascertained to exist of substance and surface
leads us to consider that of texture and here again we are presented
on trial with remarkable differences and with a third scale of intensity
pointing out substances of a close firm texture such as stones metals
c as unfavourable but those of a loose one as cloth velvet wool
eiderdown cotton c as eminently favourable to the contraction of
dew the method of concomitant variations is here for the third time
had recourse to and as before from necessity since the texture of no
substance is absolutely firm or absolutely loose looseness of texture
therefore or something which is the cause of that quality is another
circumstance which promotes the deposition of dew but this third cause
resolves itself into the first viz the quality of resisting the passage
of heat for substances of loose texture are precisely those which are
best adapted for clothing or for impeding the free passage of heat from
the skin into the air so as to allow their outer surfaces to be very
cold while they remain warm within and this last is therefore an
induction from fresh instances simply corroborative of a former
induction
it thus appears that the instances in which much dew is deposited which
are very various agree in this and so far as we are able to observe in
this only that they either radiate heat rapidly or conduct it slowly
qualities between which there is no other circumstance of agreement than
that by virtue of either the body tends to lose heat from the surface
more rapidly than it can be restored from within the instances on the
contrary in which no dew or but a small quantity of it is formed and
which are also extremely various agree so far as we can observe in
nothing except in not having this same property we seem therefore to
have detected the characteristic difference between the substances on
which dew is produced and those on which it is not produced and thus
have been realized the requisitions of what we have termed the indirect
method of difference or the joint method of agreement and difference the
example afforded of this indirect method and of the manner in which the
data are prepared for it by the methods of agreement and of concomitant
variations is the most important of all the illustrations of induction
afforded by this interesting speculation
we might now consider the question on what the deposition of dew depends
to be completely solved if we could be quite sure that the substances on
which dew is produced differ from those on which it is not in nothing
but in the property of losing heat from the surface faster than the loss
can be repaired from within and though we never can have that complete
certainty this is not of so much importance as might at first be
supposed for we have at all events ascertained that even if there be
any other quality hitherto unobserved which is present in all the
substances which contract dew and absent in those which do not this
other property must be one which in all that great number of substances
is present or absent exactly where the property of being a better radiator
than conductor is present or absent an extent of coincidence which
affords a strong presumption of a community of cause and a consequent
invariable coexistence between the two properties so that the property of
being a better radiator than conductor if not itself the cause almost
certainly always accompanies the cause and for purposes of prediction no
error is likely to be committed by treating it as if it were really such
reverting now to an earlier stage of the inquiry let us remember that we
had ascertained that in every instance where dew is formed there is
actual coldness of the surface below the temperature of the surrounding
air but we were not sure whether this coldness was the cause of dew or
its effect this doubt we are now able to resolve we have found that in
every such instance the substance must be one which by its own
properties or laws would if exposed in the night become colder than the
surrounding air the coldness therefore being accounted for independently
of the dew while it is proved that there is a connexion between the two
it must be the dew which depends on the coldness or in other words the
coldness is the cause of the dew
this law of causation already so amply established admits however of
efficient additional corroboration in no less than three ways first by
deduction from the known laws of aqueous vapour when diffused through air
or any other gas and though we have not yet come to the deductive method
we will not omit what is necessary to render this speculation complete it
is known by direct experiment that only a limited quantity of water can
remain suspended in the state of vapour at each degree of temperature and
that this maximum grows less and less as the temperature diminishes from
this it follows deductively that if there is already as much vapour
suspended as the air will contain at its existing temperature any
lowering of that temperature will cause a portion of the vapour to be
condensed and become water but again we know deductively from the
laws of heat that the contact of the air with a body colder than itself
will necessarily lower the temperature of the stratum of air immediately
applied to its surface and will therefore cause it to part with a portion
of its water which accordingly will by the ordinary laws of gravitation
or cohesion attach itself to the surface of the body thereby
constituting dew this deductive proof it will have been seen has the
advantage of proving at once causation as well as coexistence and it has
the additional advantage that it also accounts for the exceptions to the
occurrence of the phenomenon the cases in which although the body is
colder than the air yet no dew is deposited by showing that this will
necessarily be the case when the air is so undersupplied with aqueous
vapour comparatively to its temperature that even when somewhat cooled
by the contact of the colder body it can still continue to hold in
suspension all the vapour which was previously suspended in it thus in a
very dry summer there are no dews in a very dry winter no hoar frost
here therefore is an additional condition of the production of dew
which the methods we previously made use of failed to detect and which
might have remained still undetected if recourse had not been had to the
plan of deducing the effect from the ascertained properties of the agents
known to be present
the second corroboration of the theory is by direct experiment according
to the canon of the method of difference we can by cooling the surface
of any body find in all cases some temperature more or less inferior to
that of the surrounding air according to its hygrometric condition at
which dew will begin to be deposited here too therefore the causation
is directly proved we can it is true accomplish this only on a small
scale but we have ample reason to conclude that the same operation if
conducted in natures great laboratory would equally produce the effect
and finally even on that great scale we are able to verify the result
the case is one of those rare cases as we have shown them to be in which
nature works the experiment for us in the same manner in which we
ourselves perform it introducing into the previous state of things a
single and perfectly definite new circumstance and manifesting the effect
so rapidly that there is not time for any other material change in the
preexisting circumstances it is observed that dew is never copiously
deposited in situations much screened from the open sky and not at all in
a cloudy night but if the clouds withdraw even for a few minutes and
leave a clear opening a deposition of dew presently begins and goes on
increasing dew formed in clear intervals will often even evaporate
again when the sky becomes thickly overcast the proof therefore is
complete that the presence or absence of an uninterrupted communication
with the sky causes the deposition or nondeposition of dew now since a
clear sky is nothing but the absence of clouds and it is a known property
of clouds as of all other bodies between which and any given object
nothing intervenes but an elastic fluid that they tend to raise or keep
up the superficial temperature of the object by radiating heat to it we
see at once that the disappearance of clouds will cause the surface to
cool so that nature in this case produces a change in the antecedent by
definite and known means and the consequent follows accordingly a
natural experiment which satisfies the requisitions of the method of
difference82
the accumulated proof of which the theory of dew has been found
susceptible is a striking instance of the fulness of assurance which the
inductive evidence of laws of causation may attain in cases in which the
invariable sequence is by no means obvious to a superficial view
 4 the last example will have conveyed to any one by whom it has been
duly followed so clear a conception of the use and practical management
of three of the four methods of experimental inquiry as to supersede the
necessity of any further exemplification of them the remaining method
that of residues not having found any place either in this or in the two
preceding investigations i shall extract from sir john herschel some
examples of that method with the remarks by which they are introduced
it is by this process in fact that science in its present advanced
state is chiefly promoted most of the phenomena which nature presents
are very complicated and when the effects of all known causes are
estimated with exactness and subducted the residual facts are constantly
appearing in the form of phenomena altogether new and leading to the most
important conclusions
for example the return of the comet predicted by professor encke a
great many times in succession and the general good agreement of its
calculated with its observed place during any one of its periods of
visibility would lead us to say that its gravitation towards the sun and
planets is the sole and sufficient cause of all the phenomena of its
orbitual motion but when the effect of this cause is strictly calculated
and subducted from the observed motion there is found to remain behind a
residual phenomenon which would never have been otherwise ascertained
to exist which is a small anticipation of the time of its reappearance
or a diminution of its periodic time which cannot be accounted for by
gravity and whose cause is therefore to be inquired into such an
anticipation would be caused by the resistance of a medium disseminated
through the celestial regions and as there are other good reasons for
believing this to be a vera causa an actually existing antecedent
it has therefore been ascribed to such a resistance
m arago having suspended a magnetic needle by a silk thread and set it
in vibration observed that it came much sooner to a state of rest when
suspended over a plate of copper than when no such plate was beneath it
now in both cases there were two ver caus antecedents known to
exist why it should come at length to rest viz the resistance of the
air which opposes and at length destroys all motions performed in it
and the want of perfect mobility in the silk thread but the effect of
these causes being exactly known by the observation made in the absence of
the copper and being thus allowed for and subducted a residual
phenomenon appeared in the fact that a retarding influence was exerted by
the copper itself and this fact once ascertained speedily led to the
knowledge of an entirely new and unexpected class of relations this
example belongs however not to the method of residues but to the method
of difference the law being ascertained by a direct comparison of the
results of two experiments which differed in nothing but the presence or
absence of the plate of copper to have made it exemplify the method of
residues the effect of the resistance of the air and that of the rigidity
of the silk should have been calculated  priori from the laws obtained
by separate and foregone experiments
unexpected and peculiarly striking confirmations of inductive laws
frequently occur in the form of residual phenomena in the course of
investigations of a widely different nature from those which gave rise to
the inductions themselves a very elegant example may be cited in the
unexpected confirmation of the law of the development of heat in elastic
fluids by compression which is afforded by the phenomena of sound the
inquiry into the cause of sound had led to conclusions respecting its mode
of propagation from which its velocity in the air could be precisely
calculated the calculations were performed but when compared with fact
though the agreement was quite sufficient to show the general correctness
of the cause and mode of propagation assigned yet the whole velocity
could not be shown to arise from this theory there was still a residual
velocity to be accounted for which placed dynamical philosophers for a
long time in a great dilemma at length laplace struck on the happy idea
that this might arise from the heat developed in the act of that
condensation which necessarily takes place at every vibration by which
sound is conveyed the matter was subjected to exact calculation and the
result was at once the complete explanation of the residual phenomenon
and a striking confirmation of the general law of the development of heat
by compression under circumstances beyond artificial imitation
many of the new elements of chemistry have been detected in the
investigation of residual phenomena thus arfwedson discovered lithia by
perceiving an excess of weight in the sulphate produced from a small
portion of what he considered as magnesia present in a mineral he had
analysed it is on this principle too that the small concentrated
residues of great operations in the arts are almost sure to be the lurking
places of new chemical ingredients witness iodine brome selenium and
the new metals accompanying platina in the experiments of wollaston and
tennant it was a happy thought of glauber to examine what everybody else
threw away83
almost all the greatest discoveries in astronomy says the same
author84 have resulted from the consideration of residual phenomena of
a quantitative or numerical kind it was thus that the grand discovery
of the precession of the equinoxes resulted as a residual phenomenon from
the imperfect explanation of the return of the seasons by the return of
the sun to the same apparent place among the fixed stars thus also
aberration and nutation resulted as residual phenomena from that portion
of the changes of the apparent places of the fixed stars which was left
unaccounted for by precession and thus again the apparent proper motions
of the stars are the observed residues of their apparent movements
outstanding and unaccounted for by strict calculation of the effects of
precession nutation and aberration the nearest approach which human
theories can make to perfection is to diminish this residue this caput
mortuum of observation as it may be considered as much as practicable
and if possible to reduce it to nothing either by showing that
something has been neglected in our estimation of known causes or by
reasoning upon it as a new fact and on the principle of the inductive
philosophy ascending from the effect to its cause or causes
the disturbing effects mutually produced by the earth and planets upon
each others motions were first brought to light as residual phenomena by
the difference which appeared between the observed places of those bodies
and the places calculated on a consideration solely of their gravitation
towards the sun it was this which determined astronomers to consider the
law of gravitation as obtaining between all bodies whatever and therefore
between all particles of matter their first tendency having been to
regard it as a force acting only between each planet or satellite and the
central body to whose system it belonged again the catastrophists in
geology be their opinion right or wrong support it on the plea that
after the effect of all causes now in operation has been allowed for
there remains in the existing constitution of the earth a large residue of
facts proving the existence at former periods either of other forces or
of the same forces in a much greater degree of intensity to add one more
example those who assert what no one has ever shewn any real ground for
believing that there is in one human individual one sex or one race of
mankind over another an inherent and inexplicable superiority in mental
faculties could only substantiate their proposition by subtracting from
the differences of intellect which we in fact see all that can be traced
by known laws either to the ascertained differences of physical
organization or to the differences which have existed in the outward
circumstances in which the subjects of the comparison have hitherto been
placed what these causes might fail to account for would constitute a
residual phenomenon which and which alone would be evidence of an
ulterior original distinction and the measure of its amount but the
assertors of such supposed differences have not provided themselves with
these necessary logical conditions of the establishment of their doctrine
the spirit of the method of residues being it is hoped sufficiently
intelligible from these examples and the other three methods having been
so aptly exemplified in the inductive processes which produced the theory
of dew we may here close our exposition of the four methods considered
as employed in the investigation of the simpler and more elementary order
of the combinations of phenomena85
chapter x of plurality of causes and of the intermixture of effects
 1 in the preceding exposition of the four methods of observation and
experiment by which we contrive to distinguish among a mass of coexistent
phenomena the particular effect due to a given cause or the particular
cause which gave birth to a given effect it has been necessary to
suppose in the first instance for the sake of simplification that this
analytical operation is encumbered by no other difficulties than what are
essentially inherent in its nature and to represent to ourselves
therefore every effect on the one hand as connected exclusively with a
single cause and on the other hand as incapable of being mixed and
confounded with any other coexistent effect we have regarded a b c d e
the aggregate of the phenomena existing at any moment as consisting of
dissimilar facts a b c d and e for each of which one and
only one cause needs be sought the difficulty being only that of
singling out this one cause from the multitude of antecedent
circumstances a b c d and e
if such were the fact it would be comparatively an easy task to
investigate the laws of nature but the supposition does not hold in
either of its parts in the first place it is not true that the same
phenomenon is always produced by the same cause the effect a may
sometimes arise from a sometimes from b and secondly the effects of
different causes are often not dissimilar but homogeneous and marked out
by no assignable boundaries from one another a and b may produce not a
and b but different portions of an effect a the obscurity and
difficulty of the investigation of the laws of phenomena is singularly
increased by the necessity of adverting to these two circumstances
intermixture of effects and plurality of causes to the latter being the
simpler of the two considerations we shall first direct our attention
it is not true then that one effect must be connected with only one
cause or assemblage of conditions that each phenomenon can be produced
only in one way there are often several independent modes in which the
same phenomenon could have originated one fact may be the consequent in
several invariable sequences it may follow with equal uniformity any
one of several antecedents or collections of antecedents many causes may
produce motion many causes may produce some kinds of sensation many
causes may produce death a given effect may really be produced by a
certain cause and yet be perfectly capable of being produced without it
 2 one of the principal consequences of this fact of plurality of causes
is to render the first of the inductive methods that of agreement
uncertain to illustrate that method we supposed two instances a b c
followed by a b c and a d e followed by a d e from these instances
it might be concluded that a is an invariable antecedent of a and even
that it is the unconditional invariable antecedent or cause if we could
be sure that there is no other antecedent common to the two cases that
this difficulty may not stand in the way let us suppose the two cases
positively ascertained to have no antecedent in common except a the
moment however that we let in the possibility of a plurality of causes
the conclusion fails for it involves a tacit supposition that a must
have been produced in both instances by the same cause if there can
possibly have been two causes those two may for example be c and e the
one may have been the cause of a in the former of the instances the
other in the latter a having no influence in either case
suppose for example that two great artists or great philosophers that
two extremely selfish or extremely generous characters were compared
together as to the circumstances of their education and history and the
two cases were found to agree only in one circumstance would it follow
that this one circumstance was the cause of the quality which
characterized both those individuals not at all for the causes which may
produce any type of character are innumerable and the two persons might
equally have agreed in their character though there had been no manner of
resemblance in their previous history
this therefore is a characteristic imperfection of the method of
agreement from which imperfection the method of difference is free for
if we have two instances a b c and b c of which b c gives b c and a
being added converts it into a b c it is certain that in this instance
at least a was either the cause of a or an indispensable portion of
its cause even though the cause which produces it in other instances may
be altogether different plurality of causes therefore not only does not
diminish the reliance due to the method of difference but does not even
render a greater number of observations or experiments necessary two
instances the one positive and the other negative are still sufficient
for the most complete and rigorous induction not so however with the
method of agreement the conclusions which that yields when the number of
instances compared is small are of no real value except as in the
character of suggestions they may lead either to experiments bringing
them to the test of the method of difference or to reasonings which may
explain and verify them deductively
it is only when the instances being indefinitely multiplied and varied
continue to suggest the same result that this result acquires any high
degree of independent value if there are but two instances a b c and a d
e although these instances have no antecedent in common except a yet as
the effect may possibly have been produced in the two cases by different
causes the result is at most only a slight probability in favour of a
there may be causation but it is almost equally probable that there was
only a coincidence but the oftener we repeat the observation varying the
circumstances the more we advance towards a solution of this doubt for
if we try a f g a h k c all unlike one another except in containing
the circumstance a and if we find the effect a entering into the result
in all these cases we must suppose one of two things either that it is
caused by a or that it has as many different causes as there are
instances with each addition therefore to the number of instances the
presumption is strengthened in favour of a the inquirer of course will
not neglect if an opportunity present itself to exclude a from some one
of these combinations from a h k for instance and by trying h k
separately appeal to the method of difference in aid of the method of
agreement by the method of difference alone can it be ascertained that a
is the cause of a but that it is either the cause or another effect of
the same cause may be placed beyond any reasonable doubt by the method of
agreement provided the instances are very numerous as well as
sufficiently various
after how great a multiplication then of varied instances all agreeing
in no other antecedent except a is the supposition of a plurality of
causes sufficiently rebutted and the conclusion that a is the effect of
a divested of the characteristic imperfection and reduced to a virtual
certainty this is a question which we cannot be exempted from answering
but the consideration of it belongs to what is called the theory of
probability which will form the subject of a chapter hereafter it is
seen however at once that the conclusion does amount to a practical
certainty after a sufficient number of instances and that the method
therefore is not radically vitiated by the characteristic imperfection
the result of these considerations is only in the first place to point
out a new source of inferiority in the method of agreement as compared
with other modes of investigation and new reasons for never resting
contented with the results obtained by it without attempting to confirm
them either by the method of difference or by connecting them deductively
with some law or laws already ascertained by that superior method and in
the second place we learn from this the true theory of the value of mere
number of instances in inductive inquiry the plurality of causes is the
only reason why mere number is of any importance the tendency of
unscientific inquirers is to rely too much on number without analysing
the instances without looking closely enough into their nature to
ascertain what circumstances are or are not eliminated by means of them
most people hold their conclusions with a degree of assurance proportioned
to the mere mass of the experience on which they appear to rest not
considering that by the addition of instances to instances all of the
same kind that is differing from one another only in points already
recognised as immaterial nothing whatever is added to the evidence of the
conclusion a single instance eliminating some antecedent which existed in
all the other cases is of more value than the greatest multitude of
instances which are reckoned by their number alone it is necessary no
doubt to assure ourselves by a repetition of the observation or
experiment that no error has been committed concerning the individual
facts observed and until we have assured ourselves of this instead of
varying the circumstances we cannot too scrupulously repeat the same
experiment or observation without any change but when once this assurance
has been obtained the multiplication of instances which do not exclude
any more circumstances would be entirely useless were it not for the
plurality of causes
it is of importance to remark that the peculiar modification of the
method of agreement which as partaking in some degree of the nature of
the method of difference i have called the joint method of agreement and
difference is not affected by the characteristic imperfection now pointed
out for in the joint method it is supposed not only that the instances
in which a is agree only in containing a but also that the instances
in which a is not agree only in not containing a now if this be so a
must be not only the cause of a but the only possible cause for if
there were another as for example b then in the instances in which a
is not b must have been absent as well as a and it would not be true
that these instances agree only in not containing a this therefore
constitutes an immense advantage of the joint method over the simple
method of agreement it may seem indeed that the advantage does not
belong so much to the joint method as to one of its two premisses if
they may be so called the negative premiss the method of agreement
when applied to negative instances or those in which a phenomenon does
not take place is certainly free from the characteristic imperfection
which affects it in the affirmative case the negative premiss it might
therefore be supposed could be worked as a simple case of the method of
agreement without requiring an affirmative premiss to be joined with it
but although this is true in principle it is generally altogether
impossible to work the method of agreement by negative instances without
positive ones it is so much more difficult to exhaust the field of
negation than that of affirmation for instance let the question be what
is the cause of the transparency of bodies with what prospect of success
could we set ourselves to inquire directly in what the multifarious
substances which are not transparent agree but we might hope much
sooner to seize some point of resemblance among the comparatively few and
definite species of objects which are transparent and this being
attained we should quite naturally be put upon examining whether the
absence of this one circumstance be not precisely the point in which all
opaque substances will be found to resemble
the joint method of agreement and difference therefore or as i have
otherwise called it the indirect method of difference because like the
method of difference properly so called it proceeds by ascertaining how
and in what the cases where the phenomenon is present differ from those
in which it is absent is after the direct method of difference the most
powerful of the remaining instruments of inductive investigation and in
the sciences which depend on pure observation with little or no aid from
experiment this method so well exemplified in the speculation on the
cause of dew is the primary resource so far as direct appeals to
experience are concerned
 3 we have thus far treated plurality of causes only as a possible
supposition which until removed renders our inductions uncertain and
have only considered by what means where the plurality does not really
exist we may be enabled to disprove it but we must also consider it as a
case actually occurring in nature and which as often as it does occur
our methods of induction ought to be capable of ascertaining and
establishing for this however there is required no peculiar method
when an effect is really producible by two or more causes the process for
detecting them is in no way different from that by which we discover
single causes they may first be discovered as separate sequences by
separate sets of instances one set of observations or experiments shows
that the sun is a cause of heat another that friction is a source of it
another that percussion another that electricity another that chemical
action is such a source or secondly the plurality may come to light in
the course of collating a number of instances when we attempt to find
some circumstance in which they all agree and fail in doing so we find
it impossible to trace in all the cases in which the effect is met with
any common circumstance we find that we can eliminate all the
antecedents that no one of them is present in all the instances no one
of them indispensable to the effect on closer scrutiny however it
appears that though no one is always present one or other of several
always is if on further analysis we can detect in these any common
element we may be able to ascend from them to some one cause which is the
really operative circumstance in them all thus it might and perhaps
will be discovered that in the production of heat by friction
percussion chemical action c the ultimate source is one and the same
but if as continually happens we cannot take this ulterior step the
different antecedents must be set down provisionally as distinct causes
each sufficient of itself to produce the effect
we here close our remarks on the plurality of causes and proceed to the
still more peculiar and more complex case of the intermixture of effects
and the interference of causes with one another a case constituting the
principal part of the complication and difficulty of the study of nature
and with which the four only possible methods of directly inductive
investigation by observation and experiment are for the most part as
will appear presently quite unequal to cope the instrument of deduction
alone is adequate to unravel the complexities proceeding from this source
and the four methods have little more in their power than to supply
premisses for and a verification of our deductions
 4 a concurrence of two or more causes not separately producing each
its own effect but interfering with or modifying the effects of one
another takes place as has already been explained in two different
ways in the one which is exemplified by the joint operation of different
forces in mechanics the separate effects of all the causes continue to be
produced but are compounded with one another and disappear in one total
in the other illustrated by the case of chemical action the separate
effects cease entirely and are succeeded by phenomena altogether
different and governed by different laws
of these cases the former is by far the more frequent and this case it is
which for the most part eludes the grasp of our experimental methods
the other and exceptional case is essentially amenable to them when the
laws of the original agents cease entirely and a phenomenon makes its
appearance which with reference to those laws is quite heterogeneous
when for example two gaseous substances hydrogen and oxygen on being
brought together throw off their peculiar properties and produce the
substance called water in such cases the new fact may be subjected to
experimental inquiry like any other phenomenon and the elements which
are said to compose it may be considered as the mere agents of its
production the conditions on which it depends the facts which make up
its cause
the effects of the new phenomenon the properties of water for
instance are as easily found by experiment as the effects of any other
cause but to discover the cause of it that is the particular
conjunction of agents from which it results is often difficult enough in
the first place the origin and actual production of the phenomenon are
most frequently inaccessible to our observation if we could not have
learned the composition of water until we found instances in which it was
actually produced from oxygen and hydrogen we should have been forced to
wait until the casual thought struck some one of passing an electric spark
through a mixture of the two gases or inserting a lighted taper into it
merely to try what would happen further even if we could have
ascertained by the method of agreement that oxygen and hydrogen were
both present when water is produced no experimentation on oxygen and
hydrogen separately no knowledge of their laws could have enabled us
deductively to infer that they would produce water we require a specific
experiment on the two combined
under these difficulties we should generally have been indebted for our
knowledge of the causes of this class of effects not to any inquiry
directed specifically towards that end but either to accident or to the
gradual progress of experimentation on the different combinations of which
the producing agents are susceptible if it were not for a peculiarity
belonging to effects of this description that they often under some
particular combination of circumstances reproduce their causes if water
results from the juxtaposition of hydrogen and oxygen whenever this can be
made sufficiently close and intimate so on the other hand if water
itself be placed in certain situations hydrogen and oxygen are reproduced
from it an abrupt termination is put to the new laws and the agents
reappear separately with their own properties as at first what is called
chemical analysis is the process of searching for the causes of a
phenomenon among its effects or rather among the effects produced by the
action of some other causes upon it
lavoisier by heating mercury to a high temperature in a close vessel
containing air found that the mercury increased in weight and became what
was then called red precipitate while the air on being examined after
the experiment proved to have lost weight and to have become incapable
of supporting life or combustion when red precipitate was exposed to a
still greater heat it became mercury again and gave off a gas which did
support life and flame thus the agents which by their combination
produced red precipitate namely the mercury and the gas reappear as
effects resulting from that precipitate when acted upon by heat so if we
decompose water by means of iron filings we produce two effects rust and
hydrogen now rust is already known by experiments upon the component
substances to be an effect of the union of iron and oxygen the iron we
ourselves supplied but the oxygen must have been produced from the water
the result therefore is that water has disappeared and hydrogen and
oxygen have appeared in its stead or in other words the original laws of
these gaseous agents which had been suspended by the superinduction of
the new laws called the properties of water have again started into
existence and the causes of water are found among its effects
where two phenomena between the laws or properties of which considered in
themselves no connexion can be traced are thus reciprocally cause and
effect each capable in its turn of being produced from the other and
each when it produces the other ceasing itself to exist as water is
produced from oxygen and hydrogen and oxygen and hydrogen are reproduced
from water this causation of the two phenomena by one another each
being generated by the others destruction is properly transformation
the idea of chemical composition is an idea of transformation but of a
transformation which is incomplete since we consider the oxygen and
hydrogen to be present in the water as oxygen and hydrogen and capable
of being discovered in it if our senses were sufficiently keen a
supposition for it is no more grounded solely on the fact that the
weight of the water is the sum of the separate weights of the two
ingredients if there had not been this exception to the entire
disappearance in the compound of the laws of the separate ingredients
if the combined agents had not in this one particular of weight
preserved their own laws and produced a joint result equal to the sum of
their separate results we should never probably have had the notion now
implied by the words chemical composition and in the fact of water
produced from hydrogen and oxygen and hydrogen and oxygen produced from
water as the transformation would have been complete we should have seen
only a transformation
in these cases then when the heteropathic effect as we called it in a
former chapter86 is but a transformation of its cause or in other
words when the effect and its cause are reciprocally such and mutually
convertible into each other the problem of finding the cause resolves
itself into the far easier one of finding an effect which is the kind of
inquiry that admits of being prosecuted by direct experiment but there
are other cases of heteropathic effects to which this mode of
investigation is not applicable take for instance the heteropathic laws
of mind that portion of the phenomena of our mental nature which are
analogous to chemical rather than to dynamical phenomena as when a
complex passion is formed by the coalition of several elementary impulses
or a complex emotion by several simple pleasures or pains of which it is
the result without being the aggregate or in any respect homogeneous with
them the product in these cases is generated by its various factors
but the factors cannot be reproduced from the product just as a youth can
grow into an old man but an old man cannot grow into a youth we cannot
ascertain from what simple feelings any of our complex states of mind are
generated as we ascertain the ingredients of a chemical compound by
making it in its turn generate them we can only therefore discover
these laws by the slow process of studying the simple feelings themselves
and ascertaining synthetically by experimenting on the various
combinations of which they are susceptible what they by their mutual
action upon one another are capable of generating
 5 it might have been supposed that the other and apparently simpler
variety of the mutual interference of causes where each cause continues
to produce its own proper effect according to the same laws to which it
conforms in its separate state would have presented fewer difficulties to
the inductive inquirer than that of which we have just finished the
consideration it presents however so far as direct induction apart
from deduction is concerned infinitely greater difficulties when a
concurrence of causes gives rise to a new effect bearing no relation to
the separate effects of those causes the resulting phenomenon stands
forth undisguised inviting attention to its peculiarity and presenting
no obstacle to our recognising its presence or absence among any number of
surrounding phenomena it admits therefore of being easily brought under
the canons of induction provided instances can be obtained such as those
canons require and the nonoccurrence of such instances or the want of
means to produce them artificially is the real and only difficulty in
such investigations a difficulty not logical but in some sort physical
it is otherwise with cases of what in a preceding chapter has been
denominated the composition of causes there the effects of the separate
causes do not terminate and give place to others thereby ceasing to form
any part of the phenomenon to be investigated on the contrary they still
take place but are intermingled with and disguised by the homogeneous
and closely allied effects of other causes they are no longer a b
c d e existing side by side and continuing to be separately
discernible they are  a  a 12 b  b 2 b c some of
which cancel one another while many others do not appear distinguishably
but merge in one sum forming altogether a result between which and the
causes whereby it was produced there is often an insurmountable difficulty
in tracing by observation any fixed relation whatever
the general idea of the composition of causes has been seen to be that
although two or more laws interfere with one another and apparently
frustrate or modify one anothers operation yet in reality all are
fulfilled the collective effect being the exact sum of the effects of the
causes taken separately a familiar instance is that of a body kept in
equilibrium by two equal and contrary forces one of the forces if acting
alone would carry it in a given time a certain distance to the west the
other if acting alone would carry it exactly as far towards the east and
the result is the same as if it had been first carried to the west as far
as the one force would carry it and then back towards the east as far as
the other would carry it that is precisely the same distance being
ultimately left where it was found at first
all laws of causation are liable to be in this manner counteracted and
seemingly frustrated by coming into conflict with other laws the
separate result of which is opposite to theirs or more or less
inconsistent with it and hence with almost every law many instances in
which it really is entirely fulfilled do not at first sight appear to
be cases of its operation at all it is so in the example just adduced a
force in mechanics means neither more nor less than a cause of motion
yet the sum of the effects of two causes of motion may be rest again a
body solicited by two forces in directions making an angle with one
another moves in the diagonal and it seems a paradox to say that motion
in the diagonal is the sum of two motions in two other lines motion
however is but change of place and at every instant the body is in the
exact place it would have been in if the forces had acted during alternate
instants instead of acting in the same instant saving that if we suppose
two forces to act successively which are in truth simultaneous we must of
course allow them double the time it is evident therefore that each
force has had during each instant all the effect which belonged to it
and that the modifying influence which one of two concurrent causes is
said to exercise with respect to the other may be considered as exerted
not over the action of the cause itself but over the effect after it is
completed for all purposes of predicting calculating or explaining
their joint result causes which compound their effects may be treated as
if they produced simultaneously each of them its own effect and all these
effects coexisted visibly
since the laws of causes are as really fulfilled when the causes are said
to be counteracted by opposing causes as when they are left to their own
undisturbed action we must be cautious not to express the laws in such
terms as would render the assertion of their being fulfilled in those
cases a contradiction if for instance it were stated as a law of nature
that a body to which a force is applied moves in the direction of the
force with a velocity proportioned to the force directly and to its own
mass inversely when in point of fact some bodies to which a force is
applied do not move at all and those which do move are from the very
first retarded by the action of gravity and other resisting forces and
at last stopped altogether it is clear that the general proposition
though it would be true under a certain hypothesis would not express the
facts as they actually occur to accommodate the expression of the law to
the real phenomena we must say not that the object moves but that it
tends to move in the direction and with the velocity specified we
might indeed guard our expression in a different mode by saying that
the body moves in that manner unless prevented or except in so far as
prevented by some counteracting cause but the body does not only move in
that manner unless counteracted it tends to move in that manner even
when counteracted it still exerts in the original direction the same
energy of movement as if its first impulse had been undisturbed and
produces by that energy an exactly equivalent quantity of effect this
is true even when the force leaves the body as it found it in a state of
absolute rest as when we attempt to raise a body of three tons weight
with a force equal to one ton for if while we are applying this force
wind or water or any other agent supplies an additional force just
exceeding two tons the body will be raised thus proving that the force
we applied exerted its full effect by neutralizing an equivalent portion
of the weight which it was insufficient altogether to overcome and if
while we are exerting this force of one ton upon the object in a direction
contrary to that of gravity it be put into a scale and weighed it will
be found to have lost a ton of its weight or in other words to press
downwards with a force only equal to the difference of the two forces
these facts are correctly indicated by the expression tendency all laws
of causation in consequence of their liability to be counteracted
require to be stated in words affirmative of tendencies only and not of
actual results in those sciences of causation which have an accurate
nomenclature there are special words which signify a tendency to the
particular effect with which the science is conversant thus pressure
in mechanics is synonymous with tendency to motion and forces are not
reasoned on as causing actual motion but as exerting pressure a similar
improvement in terminology would be very salutary in many other branches
of science
the habit of neglecting this necessary element in the precise expression
of the laws of nature has given birth to the popular prejudice that all
general truths have exceptions and much unmerited distrust has thence
accrued to the conclusions of science when they have been submitted to
the judgment of minds insufficiently disciplined and cultivated the rough
generalizations suggested by common observation usually have exceptions
but principles of science or in other words laws of causation have not
what is thought to be an exception to a principle to quote words used
on a different occasion is always some other and distinct principle
cutting into the former some other force which impinges87 against the
first force and deflects it from its direction there are not a law and
an exception to that law the law acting in ninetynine cases and the
exception in one there are two laws each possibly acting in the whole
hundred cases and bringing about a common effect by their conjunct
operation if the force which being the less conspicuous of the two is
called the disturbing force prevails sufficiently over the other force
in some one case to constitute that case what is commonly called an
exception the same disturbing force probably acts as a modifying cause in
many other cases which no one will call exceptions
thus if it were stated to be a law of nature that all heavy bodies fall
to the ground it would probably be said that the resistance of the
atmosphere which prevents a balloon from falling constitutes the balloon
an exception to that pretended law of nature but the real law is that
all heavy bodies tend to fall and to this there is no exception not
even the sun and moon for even they as every astronomer knows tend
towards the earth with a force exactly equal to that with which the earth
tends towards them the resistance of the atmosphere might in the
particular case of the balloon from a misapprehension of what the law of
gravitation is be said to prevail over the law but its disturbing
effect is quite as real in every other case since though it does not
prevent it retards the fall of all bodies whatever the rule and the
socalled exception do not divide the cases between them each of them is
a comprehensive rule extending to all cases to call one of these
concurrent principles an exception to the other is superficial and
contrary to the correct principles of nomenclature and arrangement an
effect of precisely the same kind and arising from the same cause ought
not to be placed in two different categories merely as there does or does
not exist another cause preponderating over it88
 6 we have now to consider according to what method these complex
effects compounded of the effects of many causes are to be studied how
we are enabled to trace each effect to the concurrence of causes in which
it originated and ascertain the conditions of its recurrence the
circumstances in which it maybe expected again to occur the conditions of
a phenomenon which arises from a composition of causes may be
investigated either deductively or experimentally
the case it is evident is naturally susceptible of the deductive mode of
investigation the law of an effect of this description is a result of the
laws of the separate causes on the combination of which it depends and is
therefore in itself capable of being deduced from these laws this is
called the method  priori the other or  posteriori method
professes to proceed according to the canons of experimental inquiry
considering the whole assemblage of concurrent causes which produced the
phenomenon as one single cause it attempts to ascertain that cause in
the ordinary manner by a comparison of instances this second method
subdivides itself into two different varieties if it merely collates
instances of the effect it is a method of pure observation if it
operates upon the causes and tries different combinations of them in
hopes of ultimately hitting the precise combination which will produce the
given total effect it is a method of experiment
in order more completely to clear up the nature of each of these three
methods and determine which of them deserves the preference it will be
expedient conformably to a favourite maxim of lord chancellor eldon to
which though it has often incurred philosophical ridicule a deeper
philosophy will not refuse its sanction to clothe them in
circumstances we shall select for this purpose a case which as yet
furnishes no very brilliant example of the success of any of the three
methods but which is all the more suited to illustrate the difficulties
inherent in them let the subject of inquiry be the conditions of health
and disease in the human body or for greater simplicity the conditions
of recovery from a given disease and in order to narrow the question
still more let it be limited in the first instance to this one inquiry
is or is not some particular medicament mercury for instance a remedy
for that disease
now the deductive method would set out from known properties of mercury
and known laws of the human body and by reasoning from these would
attempt to discover whether mercury will act upon the body when in the
morbid condition supposed in such a manner as to restore health the
experimental method would simply administer mercury in as many cases as
possible noting the age sex temperament and other peculiarities of
bodily constitution the particular form or variety of the disease the
particular stage of its progress c remarking in which of these cases
it produced a salutary effect and with what circumstances it was on those
occasions combined the method of simple observation would compare
instances of recovery to find whether they agreed in having been preceded
by the administration of mercury or would compare instances of recovery
with instances of failure to find cases which agreeing in all other
respects differed only in the fact that mercury had been administered or
that it had not
 7 that the last of these three modes of investigation is applicable to
the case no one has ever seriously contended no conclusions of value on
a subject of such intricacy ever were obtained in that way the utmost
that could result would be a vague general impression for or against the
efficacy of mercury of no avail for guidance unless confirmed by one of
the other two methods not that the results which this method strives to
obtain would not be of the utmost possible value if they could be
obtained if all the cases of recovery which presented themselves in an
examination extending to a great number of instances were cases in which
mercury had been administered we might generalize with confidence from
this experience and should have obtained a conclusion of real value but
no such basis for generalization can we in a case of this description
hope to obtain the reason is that which we have so often spoken of as
constituting the characteristic imperfection of the method of agreement
plurality of causes supposing even that mercury does tend to cure the
disease so many other causes both natural and artificial also tend to
cure it that there are sure to be abundant instances of recovery in
which mercury has not been administered unless indeed the practice be
to administer it in all cases on which supposition it will equally be
found in the cases of failure
when an effect results from the union of many causes the share which each
has in the determination of the effect cannot in general be great and the
effect is not likely even in its presence or absence still less in its
variations to follow even approximatively any one of the causes
recovery from a disease is an event to which in every case many
influences must concur mercury may be one such influence but from the
very fact that there are many other such it will necessarily happen that
although mercury is administered the patient for want of other
concurring influences will often not recover and that he often will
recover when it is not administered the other favourable influences being
sufficiently powerful without it neither therefore will the instances
of recovery agree in the administration of mercury nor will the instances
of failure agree in its nonadministration it is much if by multiplied
and accurate returns from hospitals and the like we can collect that
there are rather more recoveries and rather fewer failures when mercury is
administered than when it is not a result of very secondary value even as
a guide to practice and almost worthless as a contribution to the theory
of the subject
 8 the inapplicability of the method of simple observation to ascertain
the conditions of effects dependent on many concurring causes being thus
recognised we shall next inquire whether any greater benefit can be
expected from the other branch of the  posteriori method that which
proceeds by directly trying different combinations of causes either
artificially produced or found in nature and taking notice what is their
effect as for example by actually trying the effect of mercury in as
many different circumstances as possible this method differs from the one
which we have just examined in turning our attention directly to the
causes or agents instead of turning it to the effect recovery from the
disease and since as a general rule the effects of causes are far more
accessible to our study than the causes of effects it is natural to think
that this method has a much better chance of proving successful than the
former
the method now under consideration is called the empirical method and in
order to estimate it fairly we must suppose it to be completely not
incompletely empirical we must exclude from it everything which partakes
of the nature not of an experimental but of a deductive operation if for
instance we try experiments with mercury upon a person in health in order
to ascertain the general laws of its action upon the human body and then
reason from these laws to determine how it will act upon persons affected
with a particular disease this may be a really effectual method but this
is deduction the experimental method does not derive the law of a complex
case from the simpler laws which conspire to produce it but makes its
experiments directly upon the complex case we must make entire
abstraction of all knowledge of the simpler tendencies the modi
operandi of mercury in detail our experimentation must aim at obtaining
a direct answer to the specific question does or does not mercury tend to
cure the particular disease
let us see therefore how far the case admits of the observance of those
rules of experimentation which it is found necessary to observe in other
cases when we devise an experiment to ascertain the effect of a given
agent there are certain precautions which we never if we can help it
omit in the first place we introduce the agent into the midst of a set
of circumstances which we have exactly ascertained it needs hardly be
remarked how far this condition is from being realized in any case
connected with the phenomena of life how far we are from knowing what are
all the circumstances which preexist in any instance in which mercury is
administered to a living being this difficulty however though
insuperable in most cases may not be so in all there are sometimes
though i should think never in physiology concurrences of many causes
in which we yet know accurately what the causes are but when we have got
clear of this obstacle we encounter another still more serious in other
cases when we intend to try an experiment we do not reckon it enough
that there be no circumstance in the case the presence of which is
unknown to us we require also that none of the circumstances which we do
know shall have effects susceptible of being confounded with those of the
agent whose properties we wish to study we take the utmost pains to
exclude all causes capable of composition with the given cause or if
forced to let in any such causes we take care to make them such that we
can compute and allow for their influence so that the effect of the given
cause may after the subduction of those other effects be apparent as a
residual phenomenon
these precautions are inapplicable to such cases as we are now
considering the mercury of our experiment being tried with an unknown
multitude or even let it be a known multitude of other influencing
circumstances the mere fact of their being influencing circumstances
implies that they disguise the effect of the mercury and preclude us from
knowing whether it has any effect or no unless we already knew what and
how much is owing to every other circumstance that is unless we suppose
the very problem solved which we are considering the means of solving we
cannot tell that those other circumstances may not have produced the whole
of the effect independently or even in spite of the mercury the method
of difference in the ordinary mode of its use namely by comparing the
state of things following the experiment with the state which preceded it
is thus in the case of intermixture of effects entirely unavailing
because other causes than that whose effect we are seeking to determine
have been operating during the transition as for the other mode of
employing the method of difference namely by comparing not the same case
at two different periods but different cases this in the present
instance is quite chimerical in phenomena so complicated it is
questionable if two cases similar in all respects but one ever occurred
and were they to occur we could not possibly know that they were so
exactly similar
anything like a scientific use of the method of experiment in these
complicated cases is therefore out of the question we can in the most
favourable cases only discover by a succession of trials that a certain
cause is very often followed by a certain effect for in one of these
conjunct effects the portion which is determined by any one of the
influencing agents is generally as we before remarked but small and it
must be a more potent cause than most if even the tendency which it
really exerts is not thwarted by other tendencies in nearly as many cases
as it is fulfilled
if so little can be done by the experimental method to determine the
conditions of an effect of many combined causes in the case of medical
science still less is this method applicable to a class of phenomena
more complicated than even those of physiology the phenomena of politics
and history there plurality of causes exists in almost boundless excess
and the effects are for the most part inextricably interwoven with one
another to add to the embarrassment most of the inquiries in political
science relate to the production of effects of a most comprehensive
description such as the public wealth public security public morality
and the like results liable to be affected directly or indirectly either
in plus or in minus by nearly every fact which exists or event which
occurs in human society the vulgar notion that the safe methods on
political subjects are those of baconian induction that the true guide is
not general reasoning but specific experience will one day be quoted as
among the most unequivocal marks of a low state of the speculative
faculties in any age in which it is accredited nothing can be more
ludicrous than the sort of parodies on experimental reasoning which one is
accustomed to meet with not in popular discussion only but in grave
treatises when the affairs of nations are the theme how it is asked
can an institution be bad when the country has prospered under it how
can such or such causes have contributed to the prosperity of one country
when another has prospered without them whoever makes use of an argument
of this kind not intending to deceive should be sent back to learn the
elements of some one of the more easy physical sciences such reasoners
ignore the fact of plurality of causes in the very case which affords the
most signal example of it so little could be concluded in such a case
from any possible collation of individual instances that even the
impossibility in social phenomena of making artificial experiments a
circumstance otherwise so prejudicial to directly inductive inquiry
hardly affords in this case additional reason of regret for even if we
could try experiments upon a nation or upon the human race with as little
scruple as m majendie tries them upon dogs or rabbits we should never
succeed in making two instances identical in every respect except the
presence or absence of some one indefinite circumstance the nearest
approach to an experiment in the philosophical sense which takes place in
politics is the introduction of a new operative element into national
affairs by some special and assignable measure of government such as the
enactment or repeal of a particular law but where there are so many
influences at work it requires some time for the influence of any new
cause upon national phenomena to become apparent and as the causes
operating in so extensive a sphere are not only infinitely numerous but
in a state of perpetual alteration it is always certain that before the
effect of the new cause becomes conspicuous enough to be a subject of
induction so many of the other influencing circumstances will have
changed as to vitiate the experiment
two therefore of the three possible methods for the study of phenomena
resulting from the composition of many causes being from the very nature
of the case inefficient and illusory there remains only the thirdthat
which considers the causes separately and computes the effect from the
balance of the different tendencies which produce it in short the
deductive or  priori method the more particular consideration of this
intellectual process requires a chapter to itself
chapter xi of the deductive method
 1 the mode of investigation which from the proved inapplicability of
direct methods of observation and experiment remains to us as the main
source of the knowledge we possess or can acquire respecting the
conditions and laws of recurrence of the more complex phenomena is
called in its most general expression the deductive method and consists
of three operations the first one of direct induction the second of
ratiocination and the third of verification
i call the first step in the process an inductive operation because there
must be a direct induction as the basis of the whole although in many
particular investigations the place of the induction may be supplied by a
prior deduction but the premisses of this prior deduction must have been
derived from induction
the problem of the deductive method is to find the law of an effect from
the laws of the different tendencies of which it is the joint result the
first requisite therefore is to know the laws of those tendencies the
law of each of the concurrent causes and this supposes a previous process
of observation or experiment upon each cause separately or else a
previous deduction which also must depend for its ultimate premisses on
observation or experiment thus if the subject be social or historical
phenomena the premisses of the deductive method must be the laws of the
causes which determine that class of phenomena and those causes are human
actions together with the general outward circumstances under the
influence of which mankind are placed and which constitute mans position
on the earth the deductive method applied to social phenomena must
begin therefore by investigating or must suppose to have been already
investigated the laws of human action and those properties of outward
things by which the actions of human beings in society are determined
some of these general truths will naturally be obtained by observation and
experiment others by deduction the more complex laws of human action
for example may be deduced from the simpler ones but the simple or
elementary laws will always and necessarily have been obtained by a
directly inductive process
to ascertain then the laws of each separate cause which takes a share in
producing the effect is the first desideratum of the deductive method to
know what the causes are which must be subjected to this process of
study may or may not be difficult in the case last mentioned this first
condition is of easy fulfilment that social phenomena depend on the acts
and mental impressions of human beings never could have been a matter of
any doubt however imperfectly it may have been known either by what laws
those impressions and actions are governed or to what social consequences
their laws naturally lead neither again after physical science had
attained a certain development could there be any real doubt where to
look for the laws on which the phenomena of life depend since they must
be the mechanical and chemical laws of the solid and fluid substances
composing the organised body and the medium in which it subsists together
with the peculiar vital laws of the different tissues constituting the
organic structure in other cases really far more simple than these it
was much less obvious in what quarter the causes were to be looked for as
in the case of the celestial phenomena until by combining the laws of
certain causes it was found that those laws explained all the facts which
experience had proved concerning the heavenly motions and led to
predictions which it always verified mankind never knew that those were
the causes but whether we are able to put the question before or not
until after we have become capable of answering it in either case it
must be answered the laws of the different causes must be ascertained
before we can proceed to deduce from them the conditions of the effect
the mode of ascertaining those laws neither is nor can be any other than
the fourfold method of experimental inquiry already discussed a few
remarks on the application of that method to cases of the composition of
causes are all that is requisite
it is obvious that we cannot expect to find the law of a tendency by an
induction from cases in which the tendency is counteracted the laws of
motion could never have been brought to light from the observation of
bodies kept at rest by the equilibrium of opposing forces even where the
tendency is not in the ordinary sense of the word counteracted but only
modified by having its effects compounded with the effects arising from
some other tendency or tendencies we are still in an unfavourable
position for tracing by means of such cases the law of the tendency
itself it would have been difficult to discover the law that every body
in motion tends to continue moving in a straight line by an induction
from instances in which the motion is deflected into a curve by being
compounded with the effect of an accelerating force notwithstanding the
resources afforded in this description of cases by the method of
concomitant variations the principles of a judicious experimentation
prescribe that the law of each of the tendencies should be studied if
possible in cases in which that tendency operates alone or in
combination with no agencies but those of which the effect can from
previous knowledge be calculated and allowed for
accordingly in the cases unfortunately very numerous and important in
which the causes do not suffer themselves to be separated and observed
apart there is much difficulty in laying down with due certainty the
inductive foundation necessary to support the deductive method this
difficulty is most of all conspicuous in the case of physiological
phenomena it being impossible to separate the different agencies which
collectively compose an organised body without destroying the very
phenomena which it is our object to investigate
    following life in creatures we dissect
we lose it in the moment we detect
and for this reason i am inclined to the opinion that physiology is
embarrassed by greater natural difficulties and is probably susceptible
of a less degree of ultimate perfection than even the social science
inasmuch as it is possible to study the laws and operations of one human
mind apart from other minds much less imperfectly than we can study the
laws of one organ or tissue of the human body apart from the other organs
or tissues
it has been judiciously remarked that pathological facts or to speak in
common language diseases in their different forms and degrees afford in
the case of physiological investigation the most available equivalent to
experimentation properly so called inasmuch as they often exhibit to us a
definite disturbance in some one organ or organic function the remaining
organs and functions being in the first instance at least unaffected it
is true that from the perpetual actions and reactions which are going on
among all parts of the organic economy there can be no prolonged
disturbance in any one function without ultimately involving many of the
others and when once it has done so the experiment for the most part
loses its scientific value all depends on observing the early stages of
the derangement which unfortunately are of necessity the least marked
if however the organs and functions not disturbed in the first instance
become affected in a fixed order of succession some light is thereby
thrown upon the action which one organ exercises over another and we
occasionally obtain a series of effects which we can refer with some
confidence to the original local derangement but for this it is necessary
that we should know that the original derangement was local if it was
what is termed constitutional that is if we do not know in what part of
the animal economy it took its rise or the precise nature of the
disturbance which took place in that part we are unable to determine
which of the various derangements was cause and which effect which of
them were produced by one another and which by the direct though perhaps
tardy action of the original cause
besides natural pathological facts we can produce pathological facts
artificially we can try experiments even in the popular sense of the
term by subjecting the living being to some external agent such as the
mercury of our former example as this experimentation is not intended to
obtain a direct solution of any practical question but to discover
general laws from which afterwards the conditions of any particular
effect may be obtained by deduction the best cases to select are those of
which the circumstances can be best ascertained and such are generally
not those in which there is any practical object in view the experiments
are best tried not in a state of disease which is essentially a
changeable state but in the condition of health comparatively a fixed
state in the one unusual agencies are at work the results of which we
have no means of predicting in the other the course of the accustomed
physiological phenomena would it may generally be presumed remain
undisturbed were it not for the disturbing cause which we introduce
such with the occasional aid of the method of concomitant variations
the latter not less encumbered than the more elementary methods by the
peculiar difficulties of the subject are our inductive resources for
ascertaining the laws of the causes considered separately when we have it
not in our power to make trial of them in a state of actual separation
the insufficiency of these resources is so glaring that no one can be
surprised at the backward state of the science of physiology in which
indeed our knowledge of causes is so imperfect that we can neither
explain nor could without specific experience have predicted many of the
facts which are certified to us by the most ordinary observation
fortunately we are much better informed as to the empirical laws of the
phenomena that is the uniformities respecting which we cannot yet decide
whether they are cases of causation or mere results of it not only has
the order in which the facts of organization and life successively
manifest themselves from the first germ of existence to death been found
to be uniform and very accurately ascertainable but by a great
application of the method of concomitant variations to the entire facts of
comparative anatomy and physiology the conditions of organic structure
corresponding to each class of functions have been determined with
considerable precision whether these organic conditions are the whole of
the conditions and indeed whether they are conditions at all or mere
collateral effects of some common cause we are quite ignorant nor are we
ever likely to know unless we could construct an organized body and try
whether it would live
under such disadvantages do we in cases of this description attempt the
initial or inductive step in the application of the deductive method to
complex phenomena but such fortunately is not the common case in
general the laws of the causes on which the effect depends may be
obtained by an induction from comparatively simple instances or at the
worst by deduction from the laws of simpler causes so obtained by simple
instances are meant of course those in which the action of each cause
was not intermixed or interfered with or not to any great extent by
other causes whose laws were unknown and only when the induction which
furnished the premisses to the deductive method rested on such instances
has the application of such a method to the ascertainment of the laws of a
complex effect been attended with brilliant results
 2 when the laws of the causes have been ascertained and the first
stage of the great logical operation now under discussion satisfactorily
accomplished the second part follows that of determining from the laws
of the causes what effect any given combination of those causes will
produce this is a process of calculation in the wider sense of the term
and very often involves processes of calculation in the narrowest sense
it is a ratiocination and when our knowledge of the causes is so perfect
as to extend to the exact numerical laws which they observe in producing
their effects the ratiocination may reckon among its premisses the
theorems of the science of number in the whole immense extent of that
science not only are the highest truths of mathematics often required to
enable us to compute an effect the numerical law of which we already
know but even by the aid of those highest truths we can go but a little
way in so simple a case as the common problem of three bodies gravitating
towards one another with a force directly as their mass and inversely as
the square of the distance all the resources of the calculus have not
hitherto sufficed to obtain any general solution but an approximate one
in a case a little more complex but still one of the simplest which arise
in practice that of the motion of a projectile the causes which affect
the velocity and range for example of a cannonball may be all known and
estimated the force of the gunpowder the angle of elevation the density
of the air the strength and direction of the wind but it is one of the
most difficult of mathematical problems to combine all these so as to
determine the effect resulting from their collective action
besides the theorems of number those of geometry also come in as
premisses where the effects take place in space and involve motion and
extension as in mechanics optics acoustics astronomy but when the
complication increases and the effects are under the influence of so many
and such shifting causes as to give no room either for fixed numbers or
for straight lines and regular curves as in the case of physiological
to say nothing of mental and social phenomena the laws of number and
extension are applicable if at all only on that large scale on which
precision of details becomes unimportant and although these laws play a
conspicuous part in the most striking examples of the investigation of
nature by the deductive method as for example in the newtonian theory of
the celestial motions they are by no means an indispensable part of every
such process all that is essential in it is reasoning from a general law
to a particular case that is determining by means of the particular
circumstances of that case what result is required in that instance to
fulfil the law thus in the torricellian experiment if the fact that air
has weight had been previously known it would have been easy without any
numerical data to deduce from the general law of equilibrium that the
mercury would stand in the tube at such a height that the column of
mercury would exactly balance a column of the atmosphere of equal
diameter because otherwise equilibrium would not exist
by such ratiocinations from the separate laws of the causes we may to a
certain extent succeed in answering either of the following questions
given a certain combination of causes what effect will follow and what
combination of causes if it existed would produce a given effect in the
one case we determine the effect to be expected in any complex
circumstances of which the different elements are known in the other case
we learn according to what lawunder what antecedent conditionsa given
complex effect will occur
 3 but it may here be asked are not the same arguments by which the
methods of direct observation and experiment were set aside as illusory
when applied to the laws of complex phenomena applicable with equal force
against the method of deduction when in every single instance a
multitude often an unknown multitude of agencies are clashing and
combining what security have we that in our computation  priori have
taken all these into our reckoning how many must we not generally be
ignorant of among those which we know how probable that some have been
overlooked and even were all included how vain the pretence of summing
up the effects of many causes unless we know accurately the numerical law
of eacha condition in most cases not to be fulfilled and even when
fulfilled to make the calculation transcends in any but very simple
cases the utmost power of mathematical science with its most modern
improvements
these objections have real weight and would be altogether unanswerable
if there were no test by which when we employ the deductive method we
might judge whether an error of any of the above descriptions had been
committed or not such a test however there is and its application forms
under the name of verification the third essential component part of the
deductive method without which all the results it can give have little
other value than that of guesswork to warrant reliance on the general
conclusions arrived at by deduction these conclusions must be found on
careful comparison to accord with the results of direct observation
wherever it can be had if when we have experience to compare with them
this experience confirms them we may safely trust to them in other cases
of which our specific experience is yet to come but if our deductions
have led to the conclusion that from a particular combination of causes a
given effect would result then in all known cases where that combination
can be shown to have existed and where the effect has not followed we
must be able to show or at least to make a probable surmise what
frustrated it if we cannot the theory is imperfect and not yet to be
relied upon nor is the verification complete unless some of the cases in
which the theory is borne out by the observed result are of at least
equal complexity with any other cases in which its application could be
called for
it needs scarcely be observed thatif direct observation and collation
of instances have furnished us with any empirical laws of the effect
whether true in all observed cases or only true for the most partthe
most effectual verification of which the theory could be susceptible would
be that it led deductively to those empirical laws that the
uniformities whether complete or incomplete which were observed to exist
among the phenomena were accounted for by the laws of the causeswere
such as could not but exist if those be really the causes by which the
phenomena are produced thus it was very reasonably deemed an essential
requisite of any true theory of the causes of the celestial motions that
it should lead by deduction to keplers laws which accordingly the
newtonian theory did
in order therefore to facilitate the verification of theories obtained
by deduction it is important that as many as possible of the empirical
laws of the phenomena should be ascertained by a comparison of instances
conformably to the method of agreement as well as it must be added that
the phenomena themselves should be described in the most comprehensive as
well as accurate manner possible by collecting from the observation of
parts the simplest possible correct expressions for the corresponding
wholes as when the series of the observed places of a planet was first
expressed by a circle then by a system of epicycles and subsequently by
an ellipse
it is worth remarking that complex instances which would have been of no
use for the discovery of the simple laws into which we ultimately analyse
their phenomena nevertheless when they have served to verify the
analysis become additional evidence of the laws themselves although we
could not have got at the law from complex cases still when the law got
at otherwise is found to be in accordance with the result of a complex
case that case becomes a new experiment on the law and helps to confirm
what it did not assist to discover it is a new trial of the principle in
a different set of circumstances and occasionally serves to eliminate
some circumstance not previously excluded and the exclusion of which
might require an experiment impossible to be executed this was strikingly
conspicuous in the example formerly quoted in which the difference
between the observed and the calculated velocity of sound was ascertained
to result from the heat extricated by the condensation which takes place
in each sonorous vibration this was a trial in new circumstances of the
law of the development of heat by compression and it added materially to
the proof of the universality of that law accordingly any law of nature
is deemed to have gained in point of certainty by being found to explain
some complex case which had not previously been thought of in connexion
with it and this indeed is a consideration to which it is the habit of
scientific inquirers to attach rather too much value than too little
to the deductive method thus characterised in its three constituent
parts induction ratiocination and verification the human mind is
indebted for its most conspicuous triumphs in the investigation of nature
to it we owe all the theories by which vast and complicated phenomena are
embraced under a few simple laws which considered as the laws of those
great phenomena could never have been detected by their direct study we
may form some conception of what the method has done for us from the case
of the celestial motions one of the simplest among the greater instances
of the composition of causes since except in a few cases not of primary
importance each of the heavenly bodies may be considered without
material inaccuracy to be never at one time influenced by the attraction
of more than two bodies the sun and one other planet or satellite making
with the reaction of the body itself and the tangential force as i see
no objection to calling the force generated by the bodys own motion and
acting in the direction of the tangent89 only four different agents on
the concurrence of which the motions of that body depend a much smaller
number no doubt than that by which any other of the great phenomena of
nature is determined or modified yet how could we ever have ascertained
the combination of forces on which the motions of the earth and planets
are dependent by merely comparing the orbits or velocities of different
planets or the different velocities or positions of the same planet
notwithstanding the regularity which manifests itself in those motions in
a degree so rare among the effects of a concurrence of causes although
the periodical recurrence of exactly the same effect affords positive
proof that all the combinations of causes which occur at all recur
periodically we should not have known what the causes were if the
existence of agencies precisely similar on our own earth had not
fortunately brought the causes themselves within the reach of
experimentation under simple circumstances as we shall have occasion to
analyse further on this great example of the method of deduction we
shall not occupy any time with it here but shall proceed to that
secondary application of the deductive method the result of which is not
to prove laws of phenomena but to explain them
chapter xii of the explanation of laws of nature
 1 the deductive operation by which we derive the law of an effect from
the laws of the causes of which the concurrence gives rise to it may be
undertaken either for the purpose of discovering the law or of explaining
a law already discovered the word explanation occurs so continually and
holds so important a place in philosophy that a little time spent in
fixing the meaning of it will be profitably employed
an individual fact is said to be explained by pointing out its cause
that is by stating the law or laws of causation of which its production
is an instance thus a conflagration is explained when it is proved to
have arisen from a spark falling into the midst of a heap of combustibles
and in a similar manner a law or uniformity in nature is said to be
explained when another law or laws are pointed out of which that law
itself is but a case and from which it could be deduced
 2 there are three distinguishable sets of circumstances in which a law
of causation may be explained from or as it also is often expressed
resolved into other laws
the first is the case already so fully considered an intermixture of
laws producing a joint effect equal to the sum of the effects of the
causes taken separately the law of the complex effects is explained by
being resolved into the separate laws of the causes which contribute to
it thus the law of the motion of a planet is resolved into the law of
the tangential force which tends to produce an uniform motion in the
tangent and the law of the centripetal force which tends to produce an
accelerating motion towards the sun the real motion being a compound of
the two
it is necessary here to remark that in this resolution of the law of a
complex effect the laws of which it is compounded are not the only
elements it is resolved into the laws of the separate causes together
with the fact of their coexistence the one is as essential an ingredient
as the other whether the object be to discover the law of the effect or
only to explain it to deduce the laws of the heavenly motions we require
not only to know the law of a rectilineal and that of a gravitative force
but the existence of both these forces in the celestial regions and even
their relative amount the complex laws of causation are thus resolved
into two distinct kinds of elements the one simpler laws of causation
the other in the aptly selected language of dr chalmers collocations
the collocations consisting in the existence of certain agents or powers
in certain circumstances of place and time we shall hereafter have
occasion to return to this distinction and to dwell on it at such a
length as dispenses with the necessity of further insisting on it here
the first mode then of the explanation of laws of causation is when the
law of an effect is resolved into the various tendencies of which it is
the result and into the laws of those tendencies
 3 a second case is when between what seemed the cause and what was
supposed to be its effect further observation detects an immediate link
a fact caused by the antecedent and in its turn causing the consequent
so that the cause at first assigned is but the remote cause operating
through the intermediate phenomenon a seemed the cause of c but it
subsequently appeared that a was only the cause of b and that it is b
which was the cause of c for example mankind were aware that the act of
touching an outward object caused a sensation it was however at last
discovered that after we have touched the object and before we
experience the sensation some change takes place in a kind of thread
called a nerve which extends from our outward organs to the brain
touching the object therefore is only the remote cause of our sensation
that is not the cause properly speaking but the cause of the causethe
real cause of the sensation is the change in the state of the nerve
future experience may not only give us more knowledge than we now have of
the particular nature of this change but may also interpolate another
link between the contact for example of the object with our outward
organs and the production of the change of state in the nerve there may
take place some electric phenomenon or some phenomenon of a nature not
resembling the effects of any known agency hitherto however no such
intermediate link has been discovered and the touch of the object must be
considered provisionally at least as the proximate cause of the
affection of the nerve the sequence therefore of a sensation of touch
on contact with an object is ascertained not to be an ultimate law it is
resolved as the phrase is into two other lawsthe law that contact
with an object produces an affection of the nerve and the law that an
affection of the nerve produces sensation
to take another example the more powerful acids corrode or blacken
organic compounds this is a case of causation but of remote causation
and is said to be explained when it is shown that there is an intermediate
link namely the separation of some of the chemical elements of the
organic structure from the rest and their entering into combination with
the acid the acid causes this separation of the elements and the
separation of the elements causes the disorganization and often the
charring of the structure so again chlorine extracts colouring matters
whence its efficacy in bleaching and purifies the air from infection
this law is resolved into the two following laws chlorine has a powerful
affinity for bases of all kinds particularly metallic bases and hydrogen
such bases are essential elements of colouring matters and contagious
compounds which substances therefore are decomposed and destroyed by
chlorine
 4 it is of importance to remark that when a sequence of phenomena is
thus resolved into other laws they are always laws more general than
itself the law that a is followed by c is less general than either of
the laws which connect b with c and a with b this will appear from very
simple considerations
all laws of causation are liable to be counteracted or frustrated by the
nonfulfilment of some negative condition the tendency therefore of b
to produce c may be defeated now the law that a produces b is equally
fulfilled whether b is followed by c or not but the law that a produces c
by means of b is of course only fulfilled when b is really followed by c
and is therefore less general than the law that a produces b it is also
less general than the law that b produces c for b may have other causes
besides a and as a produces c only by means of b while b produces c
whether it has itself been produced by a or by anything else the second
law embraces a greater number of instances covers as it were a greater
space of ground than the first
thus in our former example the law that the contact of an object causes
a change in the state of the nerve is more general than the law that
contact with an object causes sensation since for aught we know the
change in the nerve may equally take place when from a counteracting
cause as for instance strong mental excitement the sensation does not
follow as in a battle where wounds are often received without any
consciousness of receiving them and again the law that change in the
state of a nerve produces sensation is more general than the law that
contact with an object produces sensation since the sensation equally
follows the change in the nerve when not produced by contact with an
object but by some other cause as in the wellknown case when a person
who has lost a limb feels the same sensation which he has been accustomed
to call a pain in the limb
not only are the laws of more immediate sequence into which the law of a
remote sequence is resolved laws of greater generality than that law is
but as a consequence of or rather as implied in their greater
generality they are more to be relied on there are fewer chances of
their being ultimately found not to be universally true from the moment
when the sequence of a and c is shown not to be immediate but to depend
on an intervening phenomenon then however constant and invariable the
sequence of a and c has hitherto been found possibilities arise of its
failure exceeding those which can affect either of the more immediate
sequences a b and b c the tendency of a to produce c may be defeated
by whatever is capable of defeating either the tendency of a to produce b
or the tendency of b to produce c it is therefore twice as liable to
failure as either of those more elementary tendencies and the
generalization that a is always followed by c is twice as likely to be
found erroneous and so of the converse generalization that c is always
preceded and caused by a which will be erroneous not only if there should
happen to be a second immediate mode of production of c itself but
moreover if there be a second mode of production of b the immediate
antecedent of c in the sequence
the resolution of the one generalization into the other two not only
shows that there are possible limitations of the former from which its
two elements are exempt but shows also where these are to be looked for
as soon as we know that b intervenes between a and c we also know that if
there be cases in which the sequence of a and c does not hold these are
most likely to be found by studying the effects or the conditions of the
phenomenon b
it appears then that in the second of the three modes in which a law may
be resolved into other laws the latter are more general that is extend
to more cases and are also less likely to require limitation from
subsequent experience than the law which they serve to explain they are
more nearly unconditional they are defeated by fewer contingencies they
are a nearer approach to the universal truth of nature the same
observations are still more evidently true with regard to the first of the
three modes of resolution when the law of an effect of combined causes is
resolved into the separate laws of the causes the nature of the case
implies that the law of the effect is less general than the law of any of
the causes since it only holds when they are combined while the law of
any one of the causes holds good both then and also when that cause acts
apart from the rest it is also manifest that the complex law is liable to
be oftener unfulfilled than any one of the simpler laws of which it is the
result since every contingency which defeats any of the laws prevents so
much of the effect as depends on it and thereby defeats the complex law
the mere rusting for example of some small part of a great machine
often suffices entirely to prevent the effect which ought to result from
the joint action of all the parts the law of the effect of a combination
of causes is always subject to the whole of the negative conditions which
attach to the action of all the causes severally
there is another and a still stronger reason why the law of a complex
effect must be less general than the laws of the causes which conspire to
produce it the same causes acting according to the same laws and
differing only in the proportions in which they are combined often
produce effects which differ not merely in quantity but in kind the
combination of a centripetal with a projectile force in the proportions
which obtain in all the planets and satellites of our solar system gives
rise to an elliptical motion but if the ratio of the two forces to each
other were slightly altered it is demonstrable that the motion produced
would be in a circle or a parabola or an hyperbola and it has been
surmised that in the case of some comets one of these is really the fact
yet the law of the parabolic motion would be resolvable into the very same
simple laws into which that of the elliptical motion is revolved namely
the law of the permanence of rectilineal motion and the law of
gravitation if therefore in the course of ages some circumstance were
to manifest itself which without defeating the law of either of those
forces should merely alter their proportion to one another such as the
shock of a comet or even the accumulating effect of the resistance of the
medium in which astronomers have been led to surmise that the motions of
the heavenly bodies take place the elliptical motion might be changed
into a motion in some other conic section and the complex law that the
heavenly motions take place in ellipses would be deprived of its
universality though the discovery would not at all detract from the
universality of the simpler laws into which that complex law is resolved
the law in short of each of the concurrent causes remains the same
however their collocations may vary but the law of their joint effect
varies with every difference in the collocations there needs no more to
show how much more general the elementary laws must be than any of the
complex laws which are derived from them
 5 besides the two modes which have been treated of there is a third
mode in which laws are resolved into one another and in this it is
selfevident that they are resolved into laws more general than
themselves this third mode is the subsumption as it has been called
of one law under another or what comes to the same thing the gathering
up of several laws into one more general law which includes them all the
most splendid example of this operation was when terrestrial gravity and
the central force of the solar system were brought together under the
general law of gravitation it had been proved antecedently that the earth
and the other planets tend to the sun and it had been known from the
earliest times that terrestrial bodies tend towards the earth these were
similar phenomena and to enable them both to be subsumed under one law
it was only necessary to prove that as the effects were similar in
quality so also they as to quantity conform to the same rules this was
first shown to be true of the moon which agreed with terrestrial objects
not only in tending to a centre but in the fact that this centre was the
earth the tendency of the moon towards the earth being ascertained to
vary as the inverse square of the distance it was deduced from this by
direct calculation that if the moon were as near to the earth as
terrestrial objects are and the tangential force were suspended the moon
would fall towards the earth through exactly as many feet in a second as
those objects do by virtue of their weight hence the inference was
irresistible that the moon also tends to the earth by virtue of its
weight and that the two phenomena the tendency of the moon to the earth
and the tendency of terrestrial objects to the earth being not only
similar in quality but when in the same circumstances identical in
quantity are cases of one and the same law of causation but the tendency
of the moon to the earth and the tendency of the earth and planets to the
sun were already known to be cases of the same law of causation and thus
the law of all these tendencies and the law of terrestrial gravity were
recognized as identical or in other words were subsumed under one
general law that of gravitation
in a similar manner the laws of magnetic phenomena have recently been
subsumed under known laws of electricity it is thus that the most general
laws of nature are usually arrived at we mount to them by successive
steps for to arrive by correct induction at laws which hold under such
an immense variety of circumstances laws so general as to be independent
of any varieties of space or time which we are able to observe requires
for the most part many distinct sets of experiments or observations
conducted at different times and by different people one part of the law
is first ascertained afterwards another part one set of observations
teaches us that the law holds good under some conditions another that it
holds good under other conditions by combining which observations we find
that it holds good under conditions much more general or even
universally the general law in this case is literally the sum of all
the partial ones it is the recognition of the same sequence in different
sets of instances and may in fact be regarded as merely one step in the
process of elimination that tendency of bodies towards one another which
we now call gravity had at first been observed only on the earths
surface where it manifested itself only as a tendency of all bodies
towards the earth and might therefore be ascribed to a peculiar
property of the earth itself one of the circumstances namely the
proximity of the earth had not been eliminated to eliminate this
circumstance required a fresh set of instances in other parts of the
universe these we could not ourselves create and though nature had
created them for us we were placed in very unfavourable circumstances for
observing them to make these observations fell naturally to the lot of a
different set of persons from those who studied terrestrial phenomena and
had indeed been a matter of great interest at a time when the idea of
explaining celestial facts by terrestrial laws was looked upon as the
confounding of an indefeasible distinction when however the celestial
motions were accurately ascertained and the deductive processes performed
from which it appeared that their laws and those of terrestrial gravity
corresponded those celestial observations became a set of instances which
exactly eliminated the circumstance of proximity to the earth and proved
that in the original case that of terrestrial objects it was not the
earth as such that caused the motion or the pressure but the
circumstance common to that case with the celestial instances namely the
presence of some great body within certain limits of distance
 6 there are then three modes of explaining laws of causation or
which is the same thing resolving them into other laws first when the
law of an effect of combined causes is resolved into the separate laws of
the causes together with the fact of their combination secondly when
the law which connects any two links not proximate in a chain of
causation is resolved into the laws which connect each with the
intermediate links both of these are cases of resolving one law into two
or more in the third two or more are resolved into one when after the
law has been shown to hold good in several different classes of cases we
decide that what is true in each of these classes of cases is true under
some more general supposition consisting of what all those classes of
cases have in common we may here remark that this last operation involves
none of the uncertainties attendant on induction by the method of
agreement since we need not suppose the result to be extended by way of
inference to any new class of cases different from those by the
comparison of which it was engendered
in all these three processes laws are as we have seen resolved into
laws more general than themselves laws extending to all the cases which
the former extend to and others besides in the first two modes they are
also resolved into laws more certain in other words more universally
true than themselves they are in fact proved not to be themselves laws
of nature the character of which is to be universally true but results
of laws of nature which may be only true conditionally and for the most
part no difference of this sort exists in the third case since here the
partial laws are in fact the very same law as the general one and any
exception to them would be an exception to it too
by all the three processes the range of deductive science is extended
since the laws thus resolved may be thenceforth deduced demonstratively
from the laws into which they are resolved as already remarked the same
deductive process which proves a law or fact of causation if unknown
serves to explain it when known
the word explanation is here used in its philosophical sense what is
called explaining one law of nature by another is but substituting one
mystery for another and does nothing to render the general course of
nature other than mysterious we can no more assign a why for the more
extensive laws than for the partial ones the explanation may substitute a
mystery which has become familiar and has grown to seem not mysterious
for one which is still strange and this is the meaning of explanation in
common parlance but the process with which we are here concerned often
does the very contrary it resolves a phenomenon with which we are
familiar into one of which we previously knew little or nothing as when
the common fact of the fall of heavy bodies is resolved into a tendency of
all particles of matter towards one another it must be kept constantly in
view therefore that in science those who speak of explaining any
phenomenon mean or should mean pointing out not some more familiar but
merely some more general phenomenon of which it is a partial
exemplification or some laws of causation which produce it by their joint
or successive action and from which therefore its conditions may be
determined deductively every such operation brings us a step nearer
towards answering the question which was stated in a previous chapter as
comprehending the whole problem of the investigation of nature viz what
are the fewest assumptions which being granted the order of nature as it
exists would be the result what are the fewest general propositions from
which all the uniformities existing in nature could be deduced
the laws thus explained or resolved are sometimes said to be accounted
for but the expression is incorrect if taken to mean anything more than
what has been already stated in minds not habituated to accurate
thinking there is often a confused notion that the general laws are the
causes of the partial ones that the law of general gravitation for
example causes the phenomenon of the fall of bodies to the earth but to
assert this would be a misuse of the word cause terrestrial gravity is
not an effect of general gravitation but a case of it that is one
kind of the particular instances in which that general law obtains to
account for a law of nature means and can mean nothing more than to
assign other laws more general together with collocations which laws and
collocations being supposed the partial law follows without any
additional supposition
chapter xiii miscellaneous examples of the explanation of laws of nature
 1 some of the most remarkable instances which have occurred since the
great newtonian generalization of the explanation of laws of causation
subsisting among complex phenomena by resolving them into simpler and
more general laws are to be found among the speculations of liebig in
organic chemistry these speculations though they have not yet been
sufficiently long before the world to entitle us positively to assume that
no wellgrounded objection can be made to any part of them afford
however so admirable an example of the spirit of the deductive method
that i may be permitted to present some specimens of them here
it had been observed in certain cases that chemical action is as it
were contagious that is to say a substance which would not of itself
yield to a particular chemical attraction the force of the attraction
not being sufficient to overcome cohesion or to destroy some chemical
combination in which the substance was already held will nevertheless do
so if placed in contact with some other body which is in the act of
yielding to the same force nitric acid for example does not dissolve
pure platinum which may be boiled with this acid without being oxidized
by it even when in a state of such fine division that it no longer
reflects light but the same acid easily dissolves silver now if an
alloy of silver and platinum be treated with nitric acid the acid does
not as might naturally be expected separate the two metals dissolving
the silver and leaving the platinum it dissolves both the platinum as
well as the silver becomes oxidized and in that state combines with the
undecomposed portion of the acid in like manner copper does not
decompose water even when boiled in dilute sulphuric acid but an alloy
of copper zinc and nickel dissolves easily in this acid with evolution
of hydrogen gas these phenomena cannot be explained by the laws of what
is termed chemical affinity they point to a peculiar law by which the
oxidation which one body suffers causes another in contact with it to
submit to the same change and not only chemical composition but chemical
decomposition is capable of being similarly propagated the peroxide of
hydrogen a compound formed by hydrogen with a greater amount of oxygen
than the quantity necessary to form water is held together by a chemical
attraction of so weak a nature that the slightest circumstance is
sufficient to decompose it and it even though very slowly gives off
oxygen and is reduced to water spontaneously being i presume decomposed
by the tendency of its oxygen to absorb heat and assume the gaseous
state now it has been observed that if this decomposition of the
peroxide of hydrogen takes place in contact with some metallic oxides as
those of silver and the peroxides of lead and manganese it superinduces
a corresponding chemical action upon those substances they also give
forth the whole or a portion of their oxygen and are reduced to the metal
or to the protoxide although they do not undergo this change
spontaneously and there is no chemical affinity at work to make them do
so other similar phenomena are mentioned by liebig now no other
explanation he observes of these phenomena can be given than that a
body in the act of combination or decomposition enables another body with
which it is in contact to enter into the same state
here therefore is a law of nature of great simplicity but which owing
to the extremely special and limited character of the phenomena in which
alone it can be detected experimentally because in them alone its
results are not intermixed and blended with those of other laws had been
very little recognised by chemists and no one could have ventured on
experimental evidence to affirm it as a law common to all chemical
action owing to the impossibility of a rigorous employment of the method
of difference where the properties of different kinds of substance are
involved an impossibility which we noticed and characterized in a
previous chapter90 now this extremely special and apparently precarious
generalization has in the hands of liebig been converted by a masterly
employment of the deductive method into a law pervading all nature in
the same way as gravitation assumed that character in the hands of newton
and has been found to explain in the most unexpected manner numerous
detached generalizations of a more limited kind reducing the phenomena
concerned in those generalizations into mere cases of itself
the contagious influence of chemical action is not a powerful force and
is only capable of overcoming weak affinities we may therefore expect
to find it principally exemplified in the decomposition of substances
which are held together by weak chemical forces now the force which holds
a compound substance together is generally weaker the more compound the
substance is and organic products are the most compound substances known
those which have the most complex atomic constitution it is therefore
upon such substances that the selfpropagating power of chemical action is
likely to exert itself in the most marked manner accordingly first it
explains the remarkable laws of fermentation and some of those of
putrefaction a little leaven that is dough in a certain state of
chemical action impresses a similar chemical action upon the whole
lump the contact of any decaying substance occasions the decay of
matter previously sound again yeast is a substance actually in a process
of decomposition from the action of air and water evolving carbonic acid
gas sugar is a substance which from the complexity of its composition
has no great energy of coherence in its existing form and is capable of
being easily converted by combination with the elements of water into
carbonic acid and alcohol now the mere presence of yeast the mere
proximity of a substance of which the elements are separating from each
other and combining with the elements of water causes sugar to undergo
the same change giving out carbonic acid gas and becoming alcohol it is
not the elements contained in the yeast which do this an aqueous
infusion of yeast may be mixed with a solution of sugar and preserved in
vessels from which the air is excluded without either experiencing the
slightest change neither does the insoluble residue of the yeast after
being treated with water possess the power of exciting fermentation
here we have the method of difference it is not the yeast itself
therefore it is the yeast in a state of decomposition the sugar which
would not decompose and oxidize by the mere presence of oxygen and water
is induced to do so when another oxidation is at work in the midst of it
by the same principle liebig is enabled to explain many cases of malaria
the pernicious influence of putrid substances a variety of poisons
contagious diseases and other phenomena of all substances those
composing the animal body are the most complex in their composition and
are in the least stable condition of union the blood in particular is
the most unstable compound known it is therefore not surprising that
gaseous or other substances in the act of undergoing the chemical changes
which constitute for instance putrefaction should when brought into
contact with the tissues by respiration or otherwise and still more when
introduced by inoculation into the blood itself impress upon some of the
particles a chemical action similar to its own which is propagated in
like manner to other particles until the whole system is placed in a
state of chemical action more or less inconsistent with the chemical
conditions of vitality
of the three modes in which we observed in the last chapter that the
resolution of a special law into more general ones may take place this
speculation exemplifies the second the laws explained are such as this
that yeast puts sugar into a state of fermentation between the remote
cause the presence of yeast and the consequent fermentation of the
sugar there has been interpolated a proximate cause the chemical action
between the particles of the yeast and the elements of air and water the
special law is thus resolved into two others more general than itself
the first that yeast is decomposed by the presence of air and water the
second that matter undergoing chemical action has a tendency to produce
similar chemical action in other matter in contact with it but while the
investigation thus aptly exhibits the second mode of the resolution of a
complex law it no less happily exemplifies the third the subsumption of
special laws under a more general law by gathering them up into one more
comprehensive expression which includes them all for the curious fact of
the contagious nature of chemical action is only raised into a law of
all chemical action by these very investigations just as the newtonian
attraction was only recognised as a law of all matter when it was found to
explain the phenomena of terrestrial gravity previously to liebigs
investigations the property in question had only been observed in a few
special cases of chemical action but when his deductive reasonings have
established that innumerable effects produced upon weak compounds by
substances none of whose known peculiarities would account for their
having such a power might be explained by considering the supposed
special property to exist in all those cases these numerous
generalizations on separate substances are brought together into one law
of chemical action in general the peculiarities of the various substances
being in fact eliminated just as the newtonian deduction eliminated
from the instances of terrestrial gravity the circumstance of proximity to
the earth
 2 another speculation of the same chemist which if it should
ultimately be found to agree with all the facts of the extremely
complicated phenomenon to which it relates will constitute one of the
finest examples of the deductive method on record is his theory of
respiration
the facts of respiration or in other words the special laws which it is
attempted to explain from and resolve into more general ones are that
the blood in passing through the lungs absorbs oxygen and gives out
carbonic acid gas changing thereby its colour from a blackish purple to a
brilliant red the absorption and exhalation are evidently chemical
phenomena and the carbon of the carbonic acid must have been derived from
the body that is must have been absorbed by the blood from the
substances with which it came into contact in its passage through the
organism required to find the intermediate linksthe precise nature of
the two chemical actions which take place first the absorption of the
carbon or of the carbonic acid by the blood in its circulation through
the body next the excretion of the carbon or the exchange of the
carbonic acid for oxygen in its passage through the lungs
dr liebig believes himself to have found the solution of this vexata
qustio in a class of chemical actions in which scarcely any less acute
and penetrating inquirer would have thought of looking for it
blood is composed of two parts the serum and the globules the serum
absorbs and holds in solution carbonic acid in great quantity but has no
tendency either to part with it or to absorb oxygen the globules
therefore are concluded to be the portion of the blood which is operative
in respiration these globules contain a certain quantity of iron which
from chemical tests is inferred to be in the state of oxide
dr liebig recognised in the known chemical properties of the oxides of
iron laws which if followed out deductively would lead to the
prediction of the precise series of phenomena which respiration exhibits
there are two oxides of iron a protoxide and a peroxide in the arterial
blood the iron is in the form of peroxide in the venous blood we have no
direct evidence which of the oxides is present but the considerations to
be presently stated lead to the conclusion that it is the protoxide as
arterial and venous blood are in a perpetual state of alternate conversion
into one another the question arises in what circumstances the protoxide
of iron is capable of being converted into the peroxide and vice vers
now the protoxide readily combines with oxygen in the presence of water
forming the hydrated peroxide these conditions it finds in passing
through the lungs it derives oxygen from the air and finds water in the
blood itself this would already explain one portion of the phenomena of
respiration but the arterial blood in quitting the lungs is charged
with hydrated peroxide in what manner is the peroxide brought back to its
former state
the chemical conditions for the reduction of the hydrated peroxide into
the state of protoxide are precisely those which the blood meets with in
circulating through the body namely contact with organic compounds
hydrated peroxide of iron when treated with organic compounds where no
sulphur is present gives forth oxygen and water which oxygen attracting
the carbon from the organic substance becomes carbonic acid while the
peroxide being reduced to the state of protoxide combines with the
carbonic acid and becomes a carbonate now this carbonate needs only come
again into contact with oxygen and water to be decomposed the carbonic
acid being given off and the protoxide by the absorption of oxygen and
water becoming again the hydrated peroxide
the mysterious chemical phenomena connected with respiration can now by a
beautiful deductive process be completely explained the arterial blood
containing iron in the form of hydrated peroxide passes into the
capillaries where it meets with the decaying tissues receiving also in
its course certain nonazotised but highly carbonised animal products in
particular the bile in these it finds the precise conditions required for
decomposing the peroxide into oxygen and the protoxide the oxygen
combines with the carbon of the decaying tissues and forms carbonic acid
which though insufficient in amount to neutralize the whole of the
protoxide combines with a portion onefourth of it and returns in the
form of a carbonate along with the other threefourths of the protoxide
through the venous system into the lungs there it again meets with oxygen
and water the free protoxide becomes hydrated peroxide the carbonate of
protoxide parts with its carbonic acid and by absorbing oxygen and water
enters also into the state of hydrated peroxide the heat evolved in the
transition from protoxide to peroxide as well as in the previous
oxidation of the carbon contained in the tissues is considered by liebig
as the cause which sustains the temperature of the body but into this
portion of the speculation we need not enter91
this example displays the second mode of resolving complex laws by the
interpolation of intermediate links in the chain of causation and some of
the steps of the deduction exhibit cases of the first mode that which
infers the joint effect of two or more causes from their separate effects
but to trace out in detail these exemplifications may be left to the
intelligence of the reader the third mode is not employed in this
example since the simpler laws into which those of respiration are
resolved the laws of the chemical action of the oxides of iron were laws
already known and do not acquire any additional generality from their
employment in the present case
 3 the property which salt possesses of preserving animal substances
from putrefaction is resolved by liebig into two more general laws the
strong attraction of salt for water and the necessity of the presence of
water as a condition of putrefaction the intermediate phenomenon which is
interpolated between the remote cause and the effect can here be not
merely inferred but seen for it is a familiar fact that flesh upon which
salt has been thrown is speedily found swimming in brine
the second of the two factors as they may be termed into which the
preceding law has been resolved the necessity of water to putrefaction
itself affords an additional example of the resolution of laws the law
itself is proved by the method of difference since flesh completely dried
and kept in a dry atmosphere does not putrefy as we see in the case of
dried provisions and human bodies in very dry climates a deductive
explanation of this same law results from liebigs speculations the
putrefaction of animal and other azotised bodies is a chemical process by
which they are gradually dissipated in a gaseous form chiefly in that of
carbonic acid and ammonia now to convert the carbon of the animal
substance into carbonic acid requires oxygen and to convert the azote
into ammonia requires hydrogen which are the elements of water the
extreme rapidity of the putrefaction of azotised substances compared with
the gradual decay of nonazotised bodies such as wood and the like by
the action of oxygen alone he explains from the general law that
substances are much more easily decomposed by the action of two different
affinities upon two of their elements than by the action of only one
the purgative effect of salts with alkaline bases when administered in
concentrated solutions is explained from the two following principles
animal tissues such as the stomach do not absorb concentrated
solutions of alkaline salts and such solutions do dissolve the solids
contained in the intestines the simpler laws into which the complex law
is here resolved are the second of the two foregoing principles combined
with a third namely that the peristaltic contraction acts easily upon
substances in a state of solution the negative general proposition that
animal substances do not absorb these salts contributes to the
explanation by accounting for the absence of a counteracting cause
namely absorption by the stomach which in the case of other substances
possessed of the requisite chemical properties interferes to prevent them
from reaching the substances which they are destined to dissolve
 4 from the foregoing and similar instances we may see the importance
when a law of nature previously unknown has been brought to light or when
new light has been thrown upon a known law by experiment of examining all
cases which present the conditions necessary for bringing that law into
action a process fertile in demonstrations of special laws previously
unsuspected and explanations of others already empirically known
for instance faraday discovered by experiment that voltaic electricity
could be evolved from a natural magnet provided a conducting body were
set in motion at right angles to the direction of the magnet and this he
found to hold not only of small magnets but of that great magnet the
earth the law being thus established experimentally that electricity is
evolved by a magnet and a conductor moving at right angles to the
direction of its poles we may now look out for fresh instances in which
these conditions meet wherever a conductor moves or revolves at right
angles to the direction of the earths magnetic poles there we may expect
an evolution of electricity in the northern regions where the polar
direction is nearly perpendicular to the horizon all horizontal motions
of conductors will produce electricity horizontal wheels for example
made of metal likewise all running streams will evolve a current of
electricity which will circulate round them and the air thus charged with
electricity may be one of the causes of the aurora borealis in the
equatorial regions on the contrary upright wheels placed parallel to the
equator will originate a voltaic circuit and waterfalls will naturally
become electric
for a second example it has recently been found chiefly by the
researches of professor graham that gases have a strong tendency to
permeate animal membranes and diffuse themselves through the spaces which
such membranes inclose notwithstanding the presence of other gases in
those spaces proceeding from this general law and reviewing a variety of
cases in which gases lie contiguous to membranes we are enabled to
demonstrate or to explain the following more special laws 1st the human
or animal body when surrounded with any gas not already contained within
the body absorbs it rapidly such for instance as the gases of
putrefying matters which helps to explain malaria 2nd the carbonic acid
gas of effervescing drinks evolved in the stomach permeates its
membranes and rapidly spreads through the system where as suggested in
a former note it probably combines with the iron contained in the blood
3rd alcohol taken into the stomach passes into vapour and spreads through
the system with great rapidity which combined with the high
combustibility of alcohol or in other words its ready combination with
oxygen may perhaps help to explain the bodily warmth immediately
consequent on drinking spirituous liquors 4th in any state of the body
in which peculiar gases are formed within it these will rapidly exhale
through all parts of the body and hence the rapidity with which in
certain states of disease the surrounding atmosphere becomes tainted
5th the putrefaction of the interior parts of a carcase will proceed as
rapidly as that of the exterior from the ready passage outwards of the
gaseous products 6th the exchange of oxygen and carbonic acid in the
lungs is not prevented but rather promoted by the intervention of the
membrane of the lungs and the coats of the blood vessels between the blood
and the air it is necessary however that there should be a substance in
the blood with which the oxygen of the air may immediately combine
otherwise instead of passing into the blood it would permeate the whole
organism and it is necessary that the carbonic acid as it is formed in
the capillaries should also find a substance in the blood with which it
can combine otherwise it would leave the body at all points instead of
being discharged through the lungs
 5 the following is a deduction which confirms by explaining the old
but not undisputed empirical generalization that soda powders weaken the
human system these powders consisting of a mixture of tartaric acid with
bicarbonate of soda from which the carbonic acid is set free must pass
into the stomach as tartrate of soda now neutral tartrates citrates
and acetates of the alkalis are found in their passage through the
system to be changed into carbonates and to convert a tartrate into a
carbonate requires an additional quantity of oxygen the abstraction of
which must lessen the oxygen destined for assimilation with the blood on
the quantity of which the vigorous action of the human system partly
depends
the instances of new theories agreeing with and explaining old
empiricisms are innumerable all the just remarks made by experienced
persons on human character and conduct are so many special laws which
the general laws of the human mind explain and resolve the empirical
generalizations on which the operations of the arts have usually been
founded are continually justified and confirmed on the one hand or
corrected and improved on the other by the discovery of the simpler
scientific laws on which the efficacy of those operations depends the
effects of the rotation of crops of the various manures and other
processes of improved agriculture have been for the first time resolved
in our own day into known laws of chemical and organic action by davy and
liebig the processes of the medical art are even now mostly empirical
their efficacy is concluded in each instance from a special and most
precarious experimental generalization but as science advances in
discovering the simple laws of chemistry and physiology progress is made
in ascertaining the intermediate links in the series of phenomena and the
more general laws on which they depend and thus while the old processes
are either exploded or their efficacy in so far as real explained
better processes founded on the knowledge of proximate causes are
continually suggested and brought into use92 many even of the truths of
geometry were generalizations from experience before they were deduced
from first principles the quadrature of the cycloid is said to have been
first effected by measurement or rather by weighing a cycloidal card and
comparing its weight with that of a piece of similar card of known
dimensions
 6 to the foregoing examples from physical science let us add another
from mental the following is one of the simple laws of mind ideas of a
pleasurable or painful character form associations more easily and
strongly than other ideas that is they become associated after fewer
repetitions and the association is more durable this is an experimental
law grounded on the method of difference by deduction from this law
many of the more special laws which experience shows to exist among
particular mental phenomena may be demonstrated and explainedthe ease
and rapidity for instance with which thoughts connected with our
passions or our more cherished interests are excited and the firm hold
which the facts relating to them have on our memory the vivid
recollection we retain of minute circumstances which accompanied any
object or event that deeply interested us and of the times and places in
which we have been very happy or very miserable the horror with which we
view the accidental instrument of any occurrence which shocked us or the
locality where it took place and the pleasure we derive from any memorial
of past enjoyment all these effects being proportional to the sensibility
of the individual mind and to the consequent intensity of the pain or
pleasure from which the association originated it has been suggested by
the able writer of a biographical sketch of dr priestley in a monthly
periodical that the same elementary law of our mental constitution
suitably followed out would explain a variety of mental phenomena
hitherto inexplicable and in particular some of the fundamental
diversities of human character and genius associations being of two
sorts either between synchronous or between successive impressions and
the influence of the law which renders associations stronger in proportion
to the pleasurable or painful character of the impressions being felt
with peculiar force in the synchronous class of associations it is
remarked by the writer referred to that in minds of strong organic
sensibility synchronous associations will be likely to predominate
producing a tendency to conceive things in pictures and in the concrete
richly clothed in attributes and circumstances a mental habit which is
commonly called imagination and is one of the peculiarities of the
painter and the poet while persons of more moderate susceptibility to
pleasure and pain will have a tendency to associate facts chiefly in the
order of their succession and such persons if they possess mental
superiority will addict themselves to history or science rather than to
creative art this interesting speculation the author of the present work
has endeavoured on another occasion to pursue farther and to examine
how far it will avail towards explaining the peculiarities of the poetical
temperament it is at least an example which may serve instead of many
others to show the extensive scope which exists for deductive
investigation in the important and hitherto so imperfect science of mind
 7 the copiousness with which i have exemplified the discovery and
explanation of special laws of phenomena by deduction from simpler and
more general ones was prompted by a desire to characterize clearly and
place in its due position of importance the deductive method which in
the present state of knowledge is destined henceforth irrevocably to
predominate in the course of scientific investigation a revolution is
peaceably and progressively effecting itself in philosophy the reverse of
that to which bacon has attached his name that great man changed the
method of the sciences from deductive to experimental and it is now
rapidly reverting from experimental to deductive but the deductions which
bacon abolished were from premisses hastily snatched up or arbitrarily
assumed the principles were neither established by legitimate canons of
experimental inquiry nor the results tested by that indispensable element
of a rational deductive method verification by specific experience
between the primitive method of deduction and that which i have attempted
to characterize there is all the difference which exists between the
aristotelian physics and the newtonian theory of the heavens
it would however be a mistake to expect that those great
generalizations from which the subordinate truths of the more backward
sciences will probably at some future period be deduced by reasoning as
the truths of astronomy are deduced from the generalities of the newtonian
theory will be found in all or even in most cases among truths now
known and admitted we may rest assured that many of the most general
laws of nature are as yet entirely unthought of and that many others
destined hereafter to assume the same character are known if at all
only as laws or properties of some limited class of phenomena just as
electricity now recognised as one of the most universal of natural
agencies was once known only as a curious property which certain
substances acquired by friction of first attracting and then repelling
light bodies if the theories of heat cohesion crystallization and
chemical action are destined as there can be little doubt that they are
to become deductive the truths which will then be regarded as the
principia of those sciences would probably if now announced appear
quite as novel as the law of gravitation appeared to the cotemporaries of
newton possibly even more so since newtons law after all was but an
extension of the law of weightthat is of a generalization familiar from
of old and which already comprehended a not inconsiderable body of
natural phenomena the general laws of a similarly commanding character
which we still look forward to the discovery of may not always find so
much of their foundations already laid
these general truths will doubtless make their first appearance in the
character of hypotheses not proved nor even admitting of proof in the
first instance but assumed as premisses for the purpose of deducing from
them the known laws of concrete phenomena but this though their initial
cannot be their final state to entitle an hypothesis to be received as
one of the truths of nature and not as a mere technical help to the human
faculties it must be capable of being tested by the canons of legitimate
induction and must actually have been submitted to that test when this
shall have been done and done successfully premisses will have been
obtained from which all the other propositions of the science will
thenceforth be presented as conclusions and the science will by means of
a new and unexpected induction be rendered deductive

    1 in the later editions of archbishop whatelys logic and rhetoric

      me to be conveyed and which i still think inconsistent with the

      of logic has aided in reviving the important distinction treated of
      in the text proposes the term attributive as a substitute for
      connotative p 122 9th ed the expression is in itself
      appropriate but as it has not the advantage of being connected
      with any verb of so markedly distinctive a character as to
      connote it is not i think fitted to supply the place of the word
      connotative in scientific use
    9 it would be well if this degeneracy of language took place only in
      the hands of the untaught vulgar but some of the most remarkable
      instances are to be found in terms of art and among technically
      educated persons such as english lawyers felony for example is
      a law term with the sound of which all are familiar but there is
      no lawyer who would undertake to tell what a felony is otherwise
      than by enumerating the various offences which are so called
      originally the word felony had a meaning it denoted all offences
      the penalty of which included forfeiture of lands or goods but
      subsequent acts of parliament have declared various offences to be
      felonies without enjoining that penalty and have taken away the
      penalty from others which continue nevertheless to be called
      felonies insomuch that the acts so called have now no property
      whatever in common save that of being unlawful and punishable
   10 before quitting the subject of connotative names it is proper to
      observe that the first writer who in our own times has adopted
      from the schoolmen the word to connote mr mill in his analysis
      of the phenomena of the human mind employs it in a signification
      different from that in which it is here used he uses the word in a
      sense coextensive with its etymology applying it to every case in
      which a name while pointing directly to one thing which is
      consequently termed its signification includes also a tacit
      reference to some other thing in the case considered in the text
      that of concrete general names his language and mine are the
      converse of one another considering very justly the signification
      of the name to lie in the attribute he speaks of the word as
      noting the attribute and connoting the things possessing the
      attribute and he describes abstract names as being properly
      concrete names with their connotation dropped whereas in my view
      it is the denotation which would be said to be dropped what was
      previously connoted becoming the whole signification
      in adopting a phraseology at variance with that which so high an
      authority and one which i am less likely than any other person to
      undervalue has deliberately sanctioned i have been influenced by
      the urgent necessity for a term exclusively appropriated to express
      the manner in which a concrete general name serves to mark the
      attributes which are involved in its signification this necessity
      can scarcely be felt in its full force by any one who has not found
      by experience how vain is the attempt to communicate clear ideas on
      the philosophy of language without such a word it is hardly an
      exaggeration to say that some of the most prevalent of the errors
      with which logic has been infected and a large part of the
      cloudiness and confusion of ideas which have enveloped it would in
      all probability have been avoided if a term had been in common use
      to express exactly what i have signified by the term to connote
      and the schoolmen to whom we are indebted for the greater part of
      our logical language gave us this also and in this very sense for
      although some of their general expressions countenance the use of
      the word in the more extensive and vague acceptation in which it is
      taken by mr mill yet when they had to define it specifically as a
      technical term and to fix its meaning as such with that admirable
      precision which always characterizes their definitions they clearly
      explained that nothing was said to be connoted except forms which
      word may generally in their writings be understood as synonymous
      with attributes
      now if the word to connote so well suited to the purpose to
      which they applied it be diverted from that purpose by being taken
      to fulfil another for which it does not seem to me to be at all
      required i am unable to find any expression to replace it but such
      as are commonly employed in a sense so much more general that it
      would be useless attempting to associate them peculiarly with this
      precise idea such are the words to involve to imply c by
      employing these i should fail of attaining the object for which
      alone the name is needed namely to distinguish this particular
      kind of involving and implying from all other kinds and to assure
      to it the degree of habitual attention which its importance demands
   11 or rather all objects except itself and the percipient mind for
      as we shall see hereafter to ascribe any attribute to an object
      necessarily implies a mind to perceive it

   14 an attempt indeed has been made by reid and others to establish
      that although some of the properties we ascribe to objects exist
      only in our sensations others exist in the things themselves being
      such as cannot possibly be copies of any impression upon the senses
      and they ask from what sensations our notions of extension and
      figure have been derived the gauntlet thrown down by reid was taken
      up by brown who applying greater powers of analysis than had
      previously been applied to the notions of extension and figure
      showed clearly what are the sensations from which those notions are
      derived viz sensations of touch combined with sensations of a
      class previously too little adverted to by metaphysicians those
      which have their seat in our muscular frame whoever wishes to be

   22 few among the great names in mental science have met with a harder
      measure of justice from the present generation than locke the
      unquestioned founder of the analytic philosophy of mind but whose
      doctrines were first caricatured then when the reaction arrived
      cast off by the prevailing school even with contumely and who is
      now regarded by one of the conflicting parties in philosophy as an
      apostle of heresy and sophistry while among those who still adhere
      to the standard which he raised there has been a disposition in
      later times to sacrifice his reputation in favour of hobbes a great
      writer and a great thinker for his time but inferior to locke not
      only in sober judgment but even in profundity and original genius
      locke the most candid of philosophers and one whose speculations
      bear on every subject the strongest marks of having been wrought out
      from the materials of his own mind has been mistaken for an
      unworthy plagiarist while hobbes has been extolled as having
      anticipated many of his leading doctrines he did anticipate many of
      them and the present is an instance in what manner it was generally
      done they both rejected the scholastic doctrine of essences but
      locke understood and explained what these supposed essences really
      were hobbes instead of explaining the distinction between
      essential and accidental properties and between essential and
      accidental propositions jumped over it and gave a definition which
      suits at most only essential propositions and scarcely those as
      the definition of proposition in general
   23 the always acute and often profound author of an outline of
      sematology mr b h smart justly says locke will be much more
      intelligible if in the majority of places we substitute the
      knowledge of for what he calls the idea of  p 10 among the
      many criticisms on lockes use of the word idea this is the only
      one which as it appears to me precisely hits the mark and i quote
      it for the additional reason that it precisely expresses the point
      of difference respecting the import of propositions between my view
      and what i have spoken of as the conceptualist view of them where a
      conceptualist says that a name or a proposition expresses our idea
      of a thing i should generally say instead of our idea our
      knowledge or belief concerning the thing itself
   24 if we allow a differentia to what is not really a species for the
      distinction of kinds in the sense explained by us not being in any
      way applicable to attributes it of course follows that although
      attributes may be put into classes those classes can be admitted to
      be genera or species only by courtesy
   25 in the fuller discussion which archbishop whately has given to this
      subject in his later editions he almost ceases to regard the
      definitions of names and those of things as in any important sense
      distinct he seems 9th ed p 145 to limit the notion of a real
      definition to one which explains anything more of the nature of
      the thing than is implied in the name including under the word
      implied not only what the name connotes but everything which can
      be deduced by reasoning from the attributes connoted even this as
      he adds is usually called not a definition but a description and
      as it seems to me rightly so called a description i conceive
      can only be ranked among definitions when taken as in the case of
      the zoological definition of man to fulfil the true office of a
      definition by declaring the connotation given to a word in some
      special use as a term of science or art which special connotation
      of course would not be expressed by the proper definition of the
      word in its ordinary employment
      mr de morgan exactly reversing the doctrine of archbishop whately
      understands by a real definition one which contains less than the
      nominal definition provided only that what it contains is
      sufficient for distinction by real definition i mean such an
      explanation of the word be it the whole of the meaning or only
      part as will be sufficient to separate the things contained under
      that word from all others thus the following i believe is a
      complete definition of an elephant an animal which naturally drinks
      by drawing the water into its nose and then spirting it into its
      mouthformal logic p 36 mr de morgans general proposition
      and his example are at variance for the peculiar mode of drinking
      of the elephant certainly forms no part of the meaning of the word
      elephant it could not be said because a person happened to be
      ignorant of this property that he did not know what an elephant
      means
   26 in the only attempt which so far as i know has been made to refute
      the preceding argumentation it is maintained that in the first form
      of the syllogism
      a dragon is a thing which breathes flame
      a dragon is a serpent
      therefore some serpent or serpents breathe flame
      there is just as much truth in the conclusion as there is in the
      premisses or rather no more in the latter than in the former if
      the general name serpent includes both real and imaginary serpents
      there is no falsity in the conclusion if not there is falsity in
      the minor premiss
      let us then try to set out the syllogism on the hypothesis that
      the name serpent includes imaginary serpents we shall find that it
      is now necessary to alter the predicates for it cannot be asserted
      that an imaginary creature breathes flame in predicating of it such
      a fact we assert by the most positive implication that it is real
      and not imaginary the conclusion must run thus some serpent or
      serpents either do or are imagined to breathe flame and to prove
      this conclusion by the instance of dragons the premisses must be a
      dragon is imagined as breathing flame a dragon is a real or
      imaginary serpent from which it undoubtedly follows that there
      are serpents which are imagined to breathe flame but the major
      premiss is not a definition nor part of a definition which is all
      that i am concerned to prove
      let us now examine the other assertionthat if the word serpent
      stands for none but real serpents the minor premiss a dragon is a
      serpent is false this is exactly what i have myself said of the
      premiss considered as a statement of fact but it is not false as
      part of the definition of a dragon and since the premisses or one
      of them must be false the conclusion being so the real
      premiss cannot be the definition which is true but the statement
      of fact which is false
   27 few people i have said in another place have reflected how
      great a knowledge of things is required to enable a man to affirm
      that any given argument turns wholly upon words there is perhaps
      not one of the leading terms of philosophy which is not used in
      almost innumerable shades of meaning to express ideas more or less
      widely different from one another between two of these ideas a
      sagacious and penetrating mind will discern as it were intuitively
      an unobvious link of connexion upon which though perhaps unable to
      give a logical account of it he will found a perfectly valid
      argument which his critic not having so keen an insight into the
      things will mistake for a fallacy turning on the double meaning of
      a term and the greater the genius of him who thus safely leaps over
      the chasm the greater will probably be the crowing and vainglory
      of the mere logician who hobbling after him evinces his own
      superior wisdom by pausing on its brink and giving up as desperate
      his proper business of bridging it over

      mr de morgans formal logic or the calculus of inference
      necessary and probable a work published since the statement in
      the text was made far exceeds in elaborate minuteness lamberts
      treatise on the syllogism mr de morgans principal object is to
      bring within strict technical rules the cases in which a conclusion
      can be drawn from premisses of a form usually classed as particular
      he observes very justly that from the premisses most bs are cs
      most bs are as it may be concluded with certainty that some as are
      cs since two portions of the class b each of them comprising more
      than half must necessarily in part consist of the same individuals
      following out this line of thought it is equally evident that if we
      knew exactly what proportion the most in each of the premisses
      bear to the entire class b we could increase in a corresponding
      degree the definiteness of the conclusion thus if 60 per cent of b
      are included in c and 70 per cent in a 30 per cent at least must
      be common to both in other words the number of as which are cs
      and of cs which are as must be at least equal to 30 per cent of the
      class b proceeding on this conception of numerically definite
      propositions and extending it to such forms as these45 xs or
      more are each of them one of 70 ys or 45 xs or more are no
      one of them to be found among 70 ys and examining what inferences
      admit of being drawn from the various combinations which may be made
      of premisses of this description mr de morgan establishes
      universal formul for such inferences creating for that purpose not
      only a new technical language but a formidable array of symbols
      analogous to those of algebra
      since it is undeniable that inferences in the cases examined by mr
      de morgan can legitimately be drawn and that the ordinary theory
      takes no account of them i will not say that it was not worth while
      to show in detail how these also could be reduced to formulae as
      rigorous as those of aristotle what mr de morgan has done was
      worth doing once perhaps more than once as a school exercise but
      i question if its results are worth studying and mastering for any
      practical purpose the practical use of technical forms of reasoning
      is to bar out fallacies but the fallacies which require to be
      guarded against in ratiocination properly so called arise from the
      incautious use of the common forms of language and the logician
      must track the fallacy into that territory instead of waiting for
      it on a territory of his own while he remains among propositions
      which have acquired the numerical precision of the calculus of
      probabilities the enemy is left in possession of the only ground on
      which he can be formidable the quantification of the predicate
      an invention to which sir william hamilton attaches so much
      importance as to have raised an angry dispute with mr de morgan
      respecting its authorship appears to me i confess as an accession
      to the art of logic of singularly small value it is of course
      true that all men are mortal is equivalent to every man is
      some mortal but as mankind certainly will not be persuaded to
      quantify their predicates in common discourse they want a logic
      which will teach them to reason correctly with propositions in the
      usual form by furnishing them with a type of ratiocination to which
      propositions can be referred retaining that form not to mention
      that the quantification of the predicate instead of being a means
      of bringing out more clearly the meaning of the proposition
      actually leads the mind out of the proposition into another order
      of ideas for when we say all men are mortal we simply mean to
      affirm the attribute mortality of all men without thinking at all
      of the class mortal in the concrete or troubling ourselves about
      whether it contains any other beings or not it is only for some
      artificial purpose that we ever look at the proposition in the
      aspect in which the predicate also is thought of as a classname
      either including the subject only or the subject and something
      more

   32 it is hardly necessary to say that i am not contending for any such
      absurdity as that we actually ought to have known and considered
      the case of every individual man past present and future before
      affirming that all men are mortal although this interpretation has
      been strangely enough put upon the preceding observations there
      is no difference between me and archbishop whately or any other
      defender of the syllogism on the practical part of the matter i am
      only pointing out an inconsistency in the logical theory of it as
      conceived by almost all writers i do not say that a person who
      affirmed before the duke of wellington was born that all men are
      mortal knew that the duke of wellington was mortal but i do say
      that he asserted it and i ask for an explanation of the apparent
      logical fallacy of adducing in proof of the duke of wellingtons
      mortality a general statement which presupposes it finding no

   38 we might it is true insert this property into the definition of
      parallel lines framing the definition so as to require both that
      when produced indefinitely they shall never meet and also that

      meet the other but by doing this we by no means get rid of the

      presume can recall in imagination a colour or an odour with the
      same distinctness and accuracy with which almost every one can
      mentally reproduce an image of a straight line or a triangle to the
      extent however of their capabilities of accuracy our
      recollections of colours or of odours may serve as subjects of
      experimentation as well as those of lines and spaces and may yield
      conclusions which will be true of their external prototypes a
      person in whom either from natural gift or from cultivation the
      impressions of colour were peculiarly vivid and distinct if asked
      which of two blue flowers was of the darkest tinge though he might
      never have compared the two or even looked at them together might
      be able to give a confident answer on the faith of his distinct
      recollection of the colours that is he might examine his mental
      pictures and find there a property of the outward objects but in
      hardly any case except that of simple geometrical forms could this
      be done by mankind generally with a degree of assurance equal to
      that which is given by a contemplation of the objects themselves
      persons differ most widely in the precision of their recollection
      even of forms one person when he has looked any one in the face
      for half a minute can draw an accurate likeness of him from memory
      another may have seen him every day for six months and hardly know
      whether his nose is long or short but everybody has a perfectly
      distinct mental image of a straight line a circle or a rectangle
      and every one concludes confidently from these mental images to the
      corresponding outward things

   51 in his recent pamphlet p 81 dr whewell greatly attenuates the
      opinion here quoted reducing it to a surmise that if we could
      conceive the composition of bodies distinctly we might be able to
      see that it is necessary that the modes of their composition should
      be definite the passage in the text asserts that we already see
      or may and ought to see this necessity giving as the reason that
      no other mode of combination is conceivable that dr whewell should
      ever have made this statement is enough for the purposes of my
      illustration to what he now says i have nothing to object
      undoubtedly if we understood the ultimate molecular composition of
      bodies we might find that their combining with one another in
      definite proportions is in the present order of nature a
      necessary consequence of that molecular composition and has thus
      the only kind of necessity of which in my view of the subject any
      law of nature is susceptible but in that case the doctrine would
      be taken out of the class of axioms altogether it would be no
      longer an ultimate principle but a mere derivative law regarded as
      necessary not because selfevident but because demonstrable
   52 the quarterly review for june 1841 contains an article of great
      ability on dr whewells two great works the writer of which
      maintains on the subject of axioms the doctrine advanced in the
      text that they are generalizations from experience and supports
      that opinion by a line of argument strikingly coinciding with mine
      when i state that the whole of the present chapter was written
      before i had seen the article the greater part indeed before it
      was published it is not my object to occupy the readers attention
      with a matter so unimportant as the degree of originality which may
      or may not belong to any portion of my own speculations but to
      obtain for an opinion which is opposed to reigning doctrines the
      recommendation derived from a striking concurrence of sentiment
      between two inquirers entirely independent of one another i embrace
      the opportunity of citing from a writer of the extensive
      acquirements in physical and metaphysical knowledge and the capacity
      of systematic thought which the article evinces passages so
      remarkably in unison with my own views as the following
      the truths of geometry are summed up and embodied in its
      definitions and axioms let us turn to the axioms and what do we
      find a string of propositions concerning magnitude in the abstract
      which are equally true of space time force number and every
      other magnitude susceptible of aggregation and subdivision such
      propositions where they are not mere definitions as some of them
      are carry their inductive origin on the face of their
      enunciation those which declare that two straight lines cannot
      inclose a space and that two straight lines which cut one another
      cannot both be parallel to a third are in reality the only ones
      which express characteristic properties of space and these it will
      be worth while to consider more nearly now the only clear notion we
      can form of straightness is uniformity of direction for space in
      its ultimate analysis is nothing but an assemblage of distances and
      directions and not to dwell on the notion of continued
      contemplation ie mental experience as included in the very
      idea of uniformity nor on that of transfer of the contemplating
      being from point to point and of experience during such transfer
      of the homogeneity of the interval passed over we cannot even
      propose the proposition in an intelligible form to any one whose
      experience ever since he was born has not assured him of the fact
      the unity of direction or that we cannot march from a given point
      by more than one path direct to the same object is matter of
      practical experience long before it can by possibility become matter
      of abstract thought we cannot attempt mentally to exemplify the
      conditions of the assertion in an imaginary case opposed to it
      without violating our habitual recollection of this experience and
      defacing our mental picture of space as grounded on it what but
      experience we may ask can possibly assure us of the homogeneity of
      the parts of distance time force and measurable aggregates in
      general on which the truth of the other axioms depends as regards
      the latter axiom after what has been said it must be clear that the
      very same course of remarks equally applies to its case and that
      its truth is quite as much forced on the mind as that of the former
      by daily and hourly experience  including always be it
      observed in our notion of experience that which is gained by
      contemplation of the inward picture which the mind forms to itself
      in any proposed case or which it arbitrarily selects as an
      examplesuch picture in virtue of the extreme simplicity of these
      primary relations being called up by the imagination with as much
      vividness and clearness as could be done by any external impression
      which is the only meaning we can attach to the word intuition as
      applied to such relations
      and again of the axioms of mechanicsas we admit no such
      propositions other than as truths inductively collected from
      observation even in geometry itself it can hardly be expected
      that in a science of obviously contingent relations we should
      acquiesce in a contrary view let us take one of these axioms and
      examine its evidence for instance that equal forces
      perpendicularly applied at the opposite ends of equal arms of a
      straight lever will balance each other what but experience we may
      ask in the first place can possibly inform us that a force so
      applied will have any tendency to turn the lever on its centre at
      all or that force can be so transmitted along a rigid line
      perpendicular to its direction as to act elsewhere in space than
      along its own line of action surely this is so far from being
      selfevident that it has even a paradoxical appearance which is
      only to be removed by giving our lever thickness material
      composition and molecular powers again we conclude that the two
      forces being equal and applied under precisely similar
      circumstances must if they exert any effort at all to turn the
      lever exert equal and opposite efforts but what  priori
      reasoning can possibly assure us that they do act under precisely
      similar circumstances that points which differ in place are
      similarly circumstanced as regards the exertion of force that
      universal space may not have relations to universal forceor at all
      events that the organization of the material universe may not be
      such as to place that portion of space occupied by it in such
      relations to the forces exerted in it as may invalidate the
      absolute similarity of circumstances assumed or we may argue what
      have we to do with the notion of angular movement in the lever at
      all the case is one of rest and of quiescent destruction of force
      by force now how is this destruction effected assuredly by the
      counterpressure which supports the fulcrum but would not this
      destruction equally arise and by the same amount of counteracting
      force if each force simply pressed its own half of the lever
      against the fulcrum and what can assure us that it is not so
      except removal of one or other force and consequent tilting of the
      lever the other fundamental axiom of statics that the pressure on
      the point of support is the sum of the weights  is merely a
      scientific transformation and more refined mode of stating a coarse
      and obvious result of universal experience viz that the weight of
      a rigid body is the same handle it or suspend it in what position
      or by what point we will and that whatever sustains it sustains its
      total weight assuredly as mr whewell justly remarks no one
      probably ever made a trial for the purpose of showing that the
      pressure on the support is equal to the sum of the weights  but
      it is precisely because in every action of his life from earliest
      infancy he has been continually making the trial and seeing it made
      by every other living being about him that he never dreams of
      staking its result on one additional attempt made with scientific
      accuracy this would be as if a man should resolve to decide by
      experiment whether his eyes were useful for the purpose of seeing
      by hermetically sealing himself up for half an hour in a metal
      case
      on the paradox of universal propositions obtained by experience
      the same writer says if there be necessary and universal truths
      expressible in propositions of axiomatic simplicity and obviousness
      and having for their subjectmatter the elements of all our
      experience and all our knowledge surely these are the truths which
      if experience suggest to us any truths at all it ought to suggest
      most readily clearly and unceasingly if it were a truth
      universal and necessary that a net is spread over the whole surface
      of every planetary globe we should not travel far on our own
      without getting entangled in its meshes and making the necessity of
      some means of extrication an axiom of locomotion there is
      therefore nothing paradoxical but the reverse in our being led by
      observation to a recognition of such truths as general
      propositions coextensive at least with all human experience that
      they pervade all the objects of experience must ensure their
      continual suggestion by experience that they are true must
      ensure that consistency of suggestion that iteration of
      uncontradicted assertion which commands implicit assent and
      removes all occasion of exception that they are simple and admit
      of no misunderstanding must secure their admission by every mind
      a truth necessary and universal relative to any object of our
      knowledge must verify itself in every instance where that object is
      before our contemplation and if at the same time it be simple and
      intelligible its verification must be obvious the sentiment of
      such a truth cannot therefore but be present to our minds whenever
      that object is contemplated and must therefore make a part of the
      mental picture or idea of that object which we may on any occasion
      summon before our imagination all propositions therefore
      become not only untrue but inconceivable if  axioms be violated
      in their enunciation
      another high authority if indeed it be another authority may be
      cited in favour of the doctrine that axioms rest on the evidence of
      induction the axioms of geometry themselves may be regarded as in
      some sort an appeal to experience not corporeal but mental when
      we say the whole is greater than its part we announce a general
      fact which rests it is true on our ideas of whole and part but
      in abstracting these notions we begin by considering them as
      subsisting in space and time and body and again in linear and
      superficial and solid space again when we say the equals of
      equals are equal we mentally make comparisons in equal spaces
      equal times c so that these axioms however selfevident are
      still general propositions so far of the inductive kind that
      independently of experience they would not present themselves to
      the mind the only difference between these and axioms obtained from
      extensive induction is this that in raising the axioms of
      geometry the instances offer themselves spontaneously and without
      the trouble of search and are few and simple in raising those of
      nature they are infinitely numerous complicated and remote so
      that the most diligent research and the utmost acuteness are
      required to unravel their web and place their meaning in
      evidencesir j herschels discourse on the study of natural
      philosophy pp 95 96
   53 dr whewell thinks it improper to apply the term induction to any
      operation not terminating in the establishment of a general truth
      induction he says in p 15 of his pamphlet is not the same thing
      as experience and observation induction is experience or
      observation consciously looked at in a general form this
      consciousness and generality are necessary parts of that knowledge
      which is science and he objects p 8 to the mode in which the
      word induction is employed in this work as an undue extension of
      that term not only to the cases in which the general induction is
      consciously applied to a particular instance but to the cases in
      which the particular instance is dealt with by means of experience
      in that rude sense in which experience can be asserted of brutes
      and in which of course we can in no way imagine that the law is
      possessed or understood as a general proposition this use of the
      term he deems a confusion of knowledge with practical tendencies
      i disclaim as strongly as dr whewell can do the application of
      such terms as induction inference or reasoning to operations
      performed by mere instinct that is from an animal impulse without
      the exertion of any intelligence but i perceive no ground for
      confining the use of those terms to cases in which the inference is
      drawn in the forms and with the precautions required by scientific
      propriety to the idea of science an express recognition and
      distinct apprehension of general laws as such is essential but
      ninetenths of the conclusions drawn from experience in the course
      of practical life are drawn without any such recognition they are
      direct inferences from known cases to a case supposed to be
      similar i have endeavoured to shew that this is not only as
      legitimate an operation but substantially the same operation as
      that of ascending from known cases to a general proposition except
      that the latter process has one great security for correctness which
      the former does not possess in science the inference must
      necessarily pass through the intermediate stage of a general
      proposition because science wants its conclusions for record and
      not for instantaneous use but the inferences drawn for the guidance
      of practical affairs by persons who would often be quite incapable
      of expressing in unexceptionable terms the corresponding
      generalizations may and frequently do exhibit intellectual powers
      quite equal to any which have ever been displayed in science and if
      these inferences are not inductive what are they the limitation
      imposed on the term by dr whewell seems perfectly arbitrary
      neither justified by any fundamental distinction between what he
      includes and what he desires to exclude nor sanctioned by usage at
      least from the time of reid and stewart the principal legislators
      as far as the english language is concerned of modern metaphysical
      terminology

   59 dr whewell in his reply contests the distinction here drawn and
      maintains that not only different descriptions but different
      explanations of a phenomenon may all be true of the three theories
      respecting the motions of the heavenly bodies he says p 25
      undoubtedly all these explanations may be true and consistent with
      each other and would be so if each had been followed out so as to
      shew in what manner it could be made consistent with the facts and
      this was in reality in a great measure done the doctrine that the
      heavenly bodies were moved by vortices was successively modified so
      that it came to coincide in its results with the doctrine of an
      inversequadratic centripetal force when this point was reached
      the vortex was merely a machinery well or ill devised for
      producing such a centripetal force and therefore did not contradict
      the doctrine of a centripetal force newton himself does not appear
      to have been averse to explaining gravity by impulse so little is
      it true that if one theory be true the other must be false the
      attempt to explain gravity by the impulse of streams of particles
      flowing through the universe in all directions which i have
      mentioned in the philosophy is so far from being inconsistent
      with the newtonian theory that it is founded entirely upon it and
      even with regard to the doctrine that the heavenly bodies move by
      an inherent virtue if this doctrine had been maintained in any such
      way that it was brought to agree with the facts the inherent virtue
      must have had its laws determined and then it would have been found
      that the virtue had a reference to the central body and so the
      inherent virtue must have coincided in its effect with the
      newtonian force and then the two explanations would agree except
      so far as the word inherent was concerned and if such a part of
      an earlier theory as this word inherent indicates is found to be
      untenable it is of course rejected in the transition to later and
      more exact theories in inductions of this kind as well as in what
      mr mill calls descriptions there is therefore still no validity
      discoverable in the distinction which mr mill attempts to draw
      between descriptions like keplers law of elliptical orbits and
      other examples of induction
      if the doctrine of vortices had meant not that vortices existed
      but only that the planets moved in the same manner as if they had
      been whirled by vortices if the hypothesis had been merely a mode
      of representing the facts not an attempt to account for them if
      in short it had been only a description it would no doubt have
      been reconcileable with the newtonian theory the vortices however
      were not a mere aid to conceiving the motions of the planets but a
      supposed physical agent actively impelling them a material fact
      which might be true or not true but could not be both true and not
      true according to descartes theory it was true according to
      newtons it was not true dr whewell probably means that since the
      phrases centripetal and projectile force do not declare the nature
      but only the direction of the forces the newtonian theory does not
      absolutely contradict any hypothesis which may be framed respecting
      the mode of their production the newtonian theory regarded as a
      mere description of the planetary motions does not but the
      newtonian theory as an explanation of them does for in what does
      the explanation consist in ascribing those motions to a general law
      which obtains between all particles of matter and in identifying
      this with the law by which bodies fall to the ground a kind of
      motion which the vortices did not and as it was rectilineal could
      not explain the one explanation therefore absolutely excludes
      the other either the planets are not moved by vortices or they do
      not move by the law by which heavy bodies fall it is impossible
      that both opinions can be true as well might it be said that there
      is no contradiction between the assertions that a man died because
      somebody killed him and that he died a natural death
      so again the theory that the planets move by a virtue inherent in
      their celestial nature is incompatible with either of the two
      others either that of their being moved by vortices or that which
      regards them as moving by a property which they have in common with
      the earth and all terrestrial bodies dr whewell says that the
      theory of an inherent virtue agrees with newtons when the word
      inherent is left out which of course it would be he says if
      found to be untenable but leave that out and where is the
      theory the word inherent is the theory when that is omitted
      there remains nothing except that the heavenly bodies move by a
      virtue ie by a power of some sort
      if dr whewell is not yet satisfied any other subject will serve
      equally well to test his doctrine he will hardly say that there is
      no contradiction between the emission theory and the undulatory
      theory of light or that there can be both one and two
      electricities or that the hypothesis of the production of the
      higher organic forms by development from the lower and the
      supposition of separate and successive acts of creation are quite
      reconcileable or that the theory that volcanoes are fed from a
      central fire and the doctrines which ascribe them to chemical
      action at a comparatively small depth below the earths surface are
      consistent with one another and all true as far as they go
      if different explanations of the same fact cannot both be true
      still less surely can different predictions dr whewell quarrels
      on what ground it is not necessary to consider with the example i
      had chosen on this point and thinks an objection to an illustration
      a sufficient answer to a theory examples not liable to his
      objection are easily found if the proposition that conflicting
      predictions cannot both be true can be made clearer by any
      examples suppose the phenomenon to be a newlydiscovered comet and
      that one astronomer predicts its return once in every 300
      yearsanother once in every 400 can they both be right when
      columbus predicted that by sailing constantly westward he should in
      time return to the point from which he set out while others
      asserted that he could never do so except by turning back were both
      he and his opponents true prophets were the predictions which
      foretold the wonders of railways and steamships and those which
      averred that the atlantic could never be crossed by steam
      navigation nor a railway train propelled ten miles an hour both
      in dr whewells words true and consistent with one another
      dr whewell sees no distinction between holding contradictory
      opinions on a question of fact and merely employing different
      analogies to facilitate the conception of the same fact the case of
      different inductions belongs to the former class that of different
      descriptions to the latter
   60 of induction p 33
   61 but though it is a condition of the validity of every induction that
      there be uniformity in the course of nature it is not a necessary
      condition that the uniformity should pervade all nature it is
      enough that it pervades the particular class of phenomena to which
      the induction relates an induction concerning the motions of the
      planets or the properties of the magnet would not be vitiated
      though we were to suppose that wind and weather are the sport of
      chance provided it be assumed that astronomical and magnetic
      phenomena are under the dominion of general laws otherwise the
      early experience of mankind would have rested on a very weak
      foundation for in the infancy of science it could not be said to be
      known that all phenomena are regular in their course
      neither would it be correct to say that every induction by which we
      infer any truth implies the general fact of uniformity as
      foreknown even in reference to the kind of phenomena concerned it
      implies either that this general fact is already known or that
      we may now know it as the conclusion the duke of wellington is
      mortal drawn from the instances a b and c implies either that we
      have already concluded all men to be mortal or that we are now
      entitled to do so from the same evidence a vast amount of confusion
      and paralogism respecting the grounds of induction would be
      dispelled by keeping in view these simple considerations

   64 dr whewell of induction p 16 will not allow these and similar
      erroneous opinions to be called inductions inasmuch as such
      superstitious fancies were not collected from the facts by seeking
      a law of their occurrence but were suggested by an imagination of
      the anger of superior powers shown by such deviations from the
      ordinary course of nature i conceive the question to be not in
      what manner these notions were at first suggested but by what
      evidence they have from time to time been supposed to be
      substantiated if the believers in these erroneous opinions had been
      put on their defence they would have referred to experience to the
      comet which preceded the assassination of julius csar or to
      oracles and other prophecies known to have been fulfilled it is by
      such appeals to facts that all analogous superstitions even in our
      day attempt to justify themselves the supposed evidence of
      experience is what really gives them their hold on the mind i quite
      admit that the influence of such coincidences would not be what it
      is if strength were not lent to it by an antecedent presumption
      but this is not peculiar to such cases preconceived notions of
      probability form part of the explanation of many other cases of
      belief on insufficient evidence the  priori prejudice does not
      prevent the erroneous opinion from being sincerely regarded as a
      legitimate conclusion from experience but is on the contrary the
      very thing which predisposes the mind to that interpretation of
      experience
      thus much in defence of the sort of examples objected to but it
      would be easy to produce instances equally adapted to the purpose
      and in which no antecedent prejudice is at all concerned for many
      ages says archbishop whately all farmers and gardeners were
      firmly convincedand convinced of their knowing it by
      experiencethat the crops would never turn out good unless the seed
      were sown during the increase of the moon this was induction but
      bad induction just as a vicious syllogism is reasoning but bad
      reasoning
   65 the assertion that any and every one of the conditions of a
      phenomenon may be and is on some occasions and for some purposes
      spoken of as the cause has been disputed by an intelligent reviewer
      of this work prospective review for february 1850 who
      maintains that we always apply the word cause rather to that
      element in the antecedents which exercises force and which would
      tend at all times to produce the same or a similar effect to that
      which under certain conditions it would actually produce and he
      says that every one would feel the expression that the cause of
      a surprise was the sentinels being off his post to be incorrect
      but that the allurement or force which drew him off his post
      might be so called because in doing so it removed a resisting power
      which would have prevented the surprise i cannot think that it
      would be wrong to say that the event took place because the
      sentinel was absent and yet right to say that it took place because
      he was bribed to be absent since the only direct effect of the
      bribe was his absence the bribe could be called the remote cause of
      the surprise only on the supposition that the absence was the
      proximate cause nor does it seem to me that any one who had not a
      theory to support would use the one expression and reject the
      other
      the reviewer observes that when a person dies of poison his
      possession of bodily organs is a necessary condition but that no
      one would ever speak of it as the cause i admit the fact but i
      believe the reason to be that the occasion could never arise for so
      speaking of it for when in the inaccuracy of common discourse we
      are led to speak of some one condition of a phenomenon as its cause
      the condition so spoken of is always one which it is at least
      possible that the hearer may require to be informed of the
      possession of bodily organs is a known condition and to give that
      as the answer when asked the cause of a persons death would not
      supply the information sought once conceive that a doubt could
      exist as to his having bodily organs or that he were to be compared
      with some being who had them not and cases may be imagined in which
      it might be said that his possession of them was the cause of his
      death if faust and mephistopheles together took poison it might be
      said that faust died because he was a human being and had a body
      while mephistopheles survived because he was a spirit
      it is for the same reason that no one as the reviewer remarks
      calls the cause of a leap the muscles or sinews of the body
      though they are necessary conditions nor the cause of a
      selfsacrifice the knowledge which was necessary for it nor the
      cause of writing a book that a man has time for it which is a
      necessary condition these conditions besides that they are
      antecedent states and not proximate antecedent events and are
      therefore never the conditions in closest apparent proximity to the
      effect are all of them so obviously implied that it is hardly
      possible there should exist that necessity for insisting on them
      which alone gives occasion for speaking of a single condition as if
      it were the cause wherever this necessity exists in regard to some
      one condition and does not exist in regard to any other i conceive
      that it is consistent with usage when scientific accuracy is not
      aimed at to apply the name cause to that one condition if the only
      condition which can be supposed to be unknown is a negative
      condition the negative condition may be spoken of as the cause it
      might be said that a person died for want of medical advice though
      this would not be likely to be said unless the person was already
      understood to be ill and in order to indicate that this negative
      circumstance was what made the illness fatal and not the weakness
      of his constitution or the original virulence of the disease it
      might be said that a person was drowned because he could not swim
      the positive condition namely that he fell into the water being
      already implied in the word drowned and here let me remark that
      his falling into the water is in this case the only positive
      condition all the conditions not expressly or virtually included in
      this as that he could not swim that nobody helped him and so
      forth are negative yet if it were simply said that the cause of a
      mans death was falling into the water there would be quite as
      great a sense of impropriety in the expression as there would be if
      it were said that the cause was his inability to swim because
      though the one condition is positive and the other negative it
      would be felt that neither of them was sufficient without the
      other to produce death
      with regard to the assertion that nothing is termed the cause
      except the element which exerts active force i waive the question
      as to the meaning of active force and accepting the phrase in its
      popular sense i revert to a former example and i ask would it be
      more agreeable to custom to say that a man fell because his foot
      slipped in climbing a ladder or that he fell because of his
      weightfor his weight and not the motion of his foot was the
      active force which determined his fall if a person walking out in a
      frosty day stumbled and fell it might be said that he stumbled
      because the ground was slippery or because he was not sufficiently
      careful but few people i suppose would say that he stumbled
      because he walked yet the only active force concerned was that
      which he exerted in walking the others were mere negative
      conditions but they happened to be the only ones which there could
      be any necessity to state for he walked most likely in exactly
      his usual manner and the negative conditions made all the
      difference again if a person were asked why the army of xerxes
      defeated that of leonidas he would probably say because they were
      a thousand times the number but i do not think he would say it was
      because they fought although that was the element of active force
      the reviewer adds there are some conditions absolutely passive
      and yet absolutely necessary to physical phenomena viz the
      relations of space and time and to these no one ever applies the
      word cause without being immediately arrested by those who hear
      him even from this statement i am compelled to dissent few
      persons would feel it incongruous to say for example that a secret
      became known because it was spoken of when a b was within hearing
      which is a condition of space or that the cause why one of two
      particular trees is taller than the other is that it has been
      longer planted which is a condition of time
   66 there are a few exceptions for there are some properties of objects
      which seem to be purely preventive as the property of opaque
      bodies by which they intercept the passage of light this as far
      as we are able to understand it appears an instance not of one
      cause counteracting another by the same law whereby it produces its
      own effects but of an agency which manifests itself in no other way
      than in defeating the effects of another agency if we knew on what
      other relations to light or on what peculiarities of structure
      opacity depends we might find that this is only an apparent not a
      real exception to the general proposition in the text in any case
      it needs not affect the practical application the formula which
      includes all the negative conditions of an effect in the single one
      of the absence of counteracting causes is not violated by such
      cases as this though if all counteracting agencies were of this
      description there would be no purpose served by employing the
      formula since we should still have to enumerate specially the
      negative conditions of each phenomenon instead of regarding them as
      implicitly contained in the positive laws of the various other
      agencies in nature
   67 i use the words straight line for brevity and simplicity in
      reality the line in question is not exactly straight for from the
      effect of refraction we actually see the sun for a short interval
      during which the opaque mass of the earth is interposed in a direct
      line between the sun and our eyes thus realizing though but to a
      limited extent the coveted desideratum of seeing round a corner
   68 the reviewer of dr whewell in the quarterly review
   69 to the universality which mankind are agreed in ascribing to the law
      of causation there is one claim of exception one disputed case
      that of the human will the determinations of which a large class
      of metaphysicians are not willing to regard as following the causes
      called motives according to as strict laws as those which they
      suppose to exist in the world of mere matter this controverted
      point will undergo a special examination when we come to treat
      particularly of the logic of the moral sciences book vi ch 2
      in the meantime i may remark that these metaphysicians who it must
      be observed ground the main part of their objection on the supposed
      repugnance of the doctrine in question to our consciousness seem to
      me to mistake the fact which consciousness testifies against what
      is really in contradiction to consciousness they would i think on
      strict selfexamination find to be the application to human
      actions and volitions of the ideas involved in the common use of the
      term necessity which i agree with them in objecting to but if they
      would consider that by saying that a persons actions necessarily
      follow from his character all that is really meant for no more is
      meant in any case whatever of causation is that he invariably
      does act in conformity to his character and that any one who
      thoroughly knew his character could certainly predict how he would
      act in any supposable case they probably would not find this
      doctrine either contrary to their experience or revolting to their
      feelings and no more than this is contended for by any one but an
      asiatic fatalist
   70 unless we are to consider as such the following statement by one of
      the writers quoted in the text in the case of mental exertion the
      result to be accomplished is preconsidered or meditated and is
      therefore known  priori or before experiencebowens lowell
      lectures on the application of metaphysical and ethical science to
      the evidence of religion boston 1849 this is merely saying that
      when we will a thing we have an idea of it but to have an idea of
      what we wish to happen does not imply a prophetic knowledge that it
      will happen perhaps it will be said that the first time we
      exerted our will when we had of course no experience of any of the
      powers residing in us we nevertheless must already have known that
      we possessed them since we cannot will that which we do not
      believe to be in our power but the impossibility is perhaps in the
      words only and not in the facts for we may desire what we do not
      know to be in our power and finding by experience that our bodies
      move according to our desire we may then and only then pass
      into the more complicated mental state which is termed will
      after all even if we had an instinctive knowledge that our actions
      would follow our will this as brown remarks would prove nothing
      as to the nature of causation our knowing previous to experience
      that an antecedent will be followed by a certain consequent would
      not prove the relation between them to be anything more than
      antecedence and consequence

   74 in combating the theory that volition is the universal cause i
      have purposely abstained from one of the strongest positive
      arguments against itthat volitions themselves obey causes and even
      external causes namely the inducements or motives which
      determine the will to act because an objector might say that to
      employ this argument would be begging the question against the
      freedom of the will though it is not begging the question to affirm
      a doctrine referring elsewhere for the proof of it i am unwilling
      without necessity to build any part of my reasoning on a proposition
      which i am aware that those opposed to me in the present discussion
      do not admit
   75 i omit for simplicity to take into account the effect in this
      latter case of the diminution of pressure in diminishing the flow
      of water through the drain which evidently in no way affects the
      truth or applicability of the principle
   76 unless indeed the consequent was generated not by the antecedent
      but by the means we employed to produce the antecedent as however
      these means are under our power there is so far a probability that
      they are also sufficiently within our knowledge to enable us to
      judge whether that could be the case or not

   79 this view of the necessary coexistence of opposite excitements
      involves a great extension of the original doctrine of two
      electricities the early theorists assumed that when amber was
      rubbed the amber was made positive and the rubber negative to the
      same degree but it never occurred to them to suppose that the
      existence of the amber charge was dependent on an opposite charge in
      the bodies with which the amber was contiguous while the existence
      of the negative charge on the rubber was equally dependent on a
      contrary state of the surfaces that might accidentally be confronted
      with it that in fact in a case of electrical excitement by
      friction four charges were the minimum that could exist but this
      double electrical action is essentially implied in the explanation
      now universally adopted in regard to the phenomena of the common
      electric machine

   82 i must however remark that this example which seems to militate
      against the assertion we made of the comparative inapplicability of
      the method of difference to cases of pure observation is really one
      of those exceptions which according to a proverbial expression
      prove the general rule for this case in which nature in her
      experiment seems to have imitated the type of the experiments made
      by man she has only succeeded in producing the likeness of mans
      most imperfect experiments namely those in which though he
      succeeds in producing the phenomenon he does so by employing
      complex means which he is unable perfectly to analyse and can form
      therefore no sufficient judgment what portion of the effects may be
      due not to the supposed cause but to some unknown agency of the
      means by which that cause was produced in the natural experiment
      which we are speaking of the means used was the clearing off a
      canopy of clouds and we certainly do not know sufficiently in what
      this process consists or on what it depends to be certain 
      priori that it might not operate upon the deposition of dew
      independently of any thermometric effect at the earths surface
      even therefore in a case so favourable as this to natures
      experimental talents her experiment is of little value except in
      corroboration of a conclusion already attained through other means

   85 dr whewell in his reply expresses a very unfavourable opinion of
      the utility of the four methods as well as of the aptness of the
      examples by which i have attempted to illustrate them his words are
      these pp 446
      upon these methods the obvious thing to remark is that they take
      for granted the very thing which is most difficult to discover the
      reduction of the phenomena to formul such as are here presented to
      us when we have any set of complex facts offered to us for
      instance those which were offered in the cases of discovery which i
      have mentionedthe facts of the planetary paths of falling bodies
      of refracted rays of cosmical motions of chemical analysis and
      when in any of these cases we would discover the law of nature
      which governs them or if any one chooses so to term it the
      feature in which all the cases agree where are we to look for our
      a b c and a b c nature does not present to us the cases in
      this form and how are we to reduce them to this form you say
      when we find the combination of a b c with a b c and a b d with
      a b d then we may draw our inference granted but when and where
      are we to find such combinations even now that the discoveries are
      made who will point out to us what are the a b c and a b c
      elements of the cases which have just been enumerated who will tell
      us which of the methods of inquiry those historically real and
      successful inquiries exemplify who will carry these formul through
      the history of the sciences as they have really grown up and shew
      us that these four methods have been operative in their formation
      or that any light is thrown upon the steps of their progress by
      reference to these formul
      he adds that in this work the methods have not been applied to a
      large body of conspicuous and undoubted examples of discovery
      extending along the whole history of science which ought to have
      been done in order that the methods might be shown to possess the
      advantage which he claims as belonging to his own of being those
      by which all great discoveries in science have really been
      madep 66
      there is a striking similarity between the objections here made
      against canons of induction and what was alleged in the last
      century by as able men as dr whewell against the acknowledged
      canon of ratiocination those who protested against the aristotelian
      logic said of the syllogism what dr whewell says of the inductive
      methods that it takes for granted the very thing which is most
      difficult to discover the reduction of the argument to formul such
      as are here presented to us the grand difficulty they said is to
      obtain your syllogism not to judge of its correctness when
      obtained on the matter of fact both they and dr whewell are
      right the greatest difficulty in both cases is first that of
      obtaining the evidence and next of reducing it to the form which
      tests its conclusiveness but if we try so to reduce it without
      knowing to what we are not likely to make much progress it is a
      more difficult thing to solve a geometrical problem than to judge
      whether a proposed solution is correct but if people were not able
      to judge of the solution when found they would have little chance
      of finding it and it cannot be pretended that to judge of an
      induction when found is perfectly easy is a thing for which aids
      and instruments are superfluous for erroneous inductions false
      inferences from experience are quite as common on some subjects
      much commoner than true ones the business of inductive logic is to
      provide rules and models such as the syllogism and its rules are
      for ratiocination to which if inductive arguments conform those
      arguments are conclusive and not otherwise this is what the four
      methods profess to be and what i believe they are universally
      considered to be by experimental philosophers who had practised all
      of them long before any one sought to reduce the practice to theory
      the assailants of the syllogism had also anticipated dr whewell in
      the other branch of his argument they said that no discoveries were
      ever made by syllogism and dr whewell says or seems to say that
      none were ever made by the four methods of induction to the former
      objectors archbishop whately very pertinently answered that their
      argument if good at all was good against the reasoning process
      altogether for whatever cannot be reduced to syllogism is not
      reasoning and dr whewells argument if good at all is good
      against all inferences from experience in saying that no
      discoveries were ever made by the four methods he affirms that none
      were ever made by observation and experiment for assuredly if any
      were it was by one or other of those methods
      this difference between us accounts for the dissatisfaction which my
      examples give him for i did not select them with a view to satisfy
      any one who required to be convinced that observation and experiment
      are modes of acquiring knowledge i confess that in the choice of
      them i thought only of illustration and of facilitating the
      conception of the methods by concrete instances if it had been my
      object to justify the processes themselves as means of
      investigation there would have been no need to look far off or
      make use of recondite or complicated instances as a specimen of a
      truth ascertained by the method of agreement i might have chosen
      the proposition dogs bark this dog and that dog and the other
      dog answer to a b c a d e a f g the circumstance of being a dog
      answers to a barking answers to a as a truth made known by the

      such familiar experimental processes are not regarded as inductions
      by dr whewell but they are perfectly homogeneous with those by
      which even on his own shewing the pyramid of science is supplied
      with its base in vain he attempts to escape from this truth by
      laying the most arbitrary restrictions on the choice of examples
      admissible as instances of induction they must neither be such as
      are still matter of discussion p 47 nor must any of them be
      drawn from mental and social subjects p 53 nor from ordinary
      observation and practical life pp 1115 they must be taken
      exclusively from the generalizations by which scientific thinkers
      have ascended to great and comprehensive laws of natural phenomena
      now it is seldom possible in these complicated inquiries to go
      much beyond the initial steps without calling in the instrument of
      deduction and the temporary aid of hypotheses as i myself in
      common with dr whewell have maintained against the purely
      empirical school since therefore such cases could not conveniently
      be selected to illustrate the principles of mere observation and
      experiment dr whewell takes advantage of their absence to
      represent the experimental methods as serving no purpose in
      scientific investigation forgetting that if those methods had not
      supplied the first generalizations there would have been no
      materials for his own conception of induction to work upon
      his challenge however to point out which of the four methods are
      exemplified in certain important cases of scientific inquiry is
      easily answered the planetary paths as far as they are a case of
      induction at all see on this point the second chapter of the
      present book fall under the method of agreement the law of
      falling bodies namely that they describe spaces proportional to
      the squares of the times was historically a deduction from the
      first law of motion but the experiments by which it was verified
      and by which it might have been discovered were examples of the
      method of agreement and the apparent variation from the true law
      caused by the resistance of the air was cleared up by experiments
      in vacuo constituting an application of the method of difference
      the law of refracted rays the constancy of the ratio between the
      sines of incidence and of refraction for each refracting substance
      was ascertained by direct measurement and therefore by the method
      of agreement the cosmical motions were determined by highly
      complex processes of thought in which deduction was predominant
      but the methods of agreement and of concomitant variations had a
      large part in establishing the empirical laws every case without
      exception of chemical analysis constitutes a well marked example
      of the method of difference to any one acquainted with the
      subjectsto dr whewell himself there would not be the smallest
      difficulty in setting out the a b c and a b c elements of these
      cases
      if discoveries are ever made by observation and experiment without
      deduction the four methods are methods of discovery but even if
      they were not methods of discovery it would not be the less true
      that they are the sole methods of proof and in that character even
      the results of deduction are amenable to them the great
      generalizations which begin as hypotheses must end by being proved
      and are in reality as will be shown hereafter proved by the four
      methods now it is with proof as such that logic is principally
      concerned this distinction has indeed no chance of finding favour
      with dr whewell for it is the peculiarity of his system not to
      recognise in cases of induction any necessity for proof if after
      assuming an hypothesis and carefully collating it with facts
      nothing is brought to light inconsistent with it that is if
      experience does not disprove it he is content at least until a
      simpler hypothesis equally consistent with experience presents
      itself if this be induction doubtless there is no necessity for
      the four methods but to suppose that it is so appears to me a
      radical misconception of the nature of the evidence of physical
      truths

   91 as corroborating the opinion that the protoxide of iron in the
      venous blood is only partially carbonated the fact has been
      suggested that the system shows great readiness to absorb an extra
      quantity of carbonic acid as furnished in effervescing drinks in
      such cases the acid must combine with something and that something
      is not improbably the free protoxide it would be worth ascertaining
      whether the protoxide itself or its carbonate has the greatest
      facility in absorbing oxygen and turning itself into hydrated
      peroxide in the lungs if the carbonate then the beneficial effect
      on the animal economy of drinks which give an artificial supply of
      carbonic acid to the system would be to that extent deductively
      established
   92 it was an old generalization in surgery that tight bandaging had a
      tendency to prevent or dissipate local inflammation this sequence
      being in the progress of physiological knowledge resolved into
      more general laws led to the important surgical invention made by
      dr arnott the treatment of local inflammation and tumours by means
      of an equable pressure produced by a bladder partially filled with
      air the pressure by keeping back the blood from the part prevents
      the inflammation or the tumour from being nourished in the case
      of inflammation it removes the stimulus which the organ is unfit
      to receive in the case of tumours by keeping back the nutritive
      fluid it causes the absorption of matter to exceed the supply and
      the diseased mass is gradually absorbed and disappear
