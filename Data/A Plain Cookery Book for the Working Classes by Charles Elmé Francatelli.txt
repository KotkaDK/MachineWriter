introduction
my object in writing this little book is to show you how you may prepare
and cook your daily food so as to obtain from it the greatest amount of
nourishment at the least possible expense and thus by skill and
economy add at the same time to your comfort and to your
comparatively slender means the recipes which it contains will afford
sufficient variety from the simple everyday fare to more tasty dishes
for the birthday christmasday or other festive occasions
in order to carry out my instructions properly a few utensils will be
necessary industry good health and constant employment have in many
instances i trust enabled those whom i now address to lay by a little
sum of money a portion of this will be well spent in the purchase of
the following articlesa cookingstove with an oven at the side or
placed under the grate which should be so planned as to admit of the
fire being open or closed at will by this contrivance much heat and
fuel are economized there should also be a boiler at the back of the
grate by this means you would have hot water always ready at hand the
advantage of which is considerable such poor mens cookingstoves
exist on a large scale in all modernbuilt lodginghouses also a
threegallon iron pot with a lid to it a onegallon saucepan a
twoquart ditto a fryingpan a gridiron and a strong tin bakingdish
here is a list of the cost prices at which the abovenamed articles as
well as a few others equally necessary may be obtained of all

to those of my readers who from sickness or other hindrance have not
money in store i would say strive to lay by a little of your weekly
wages to purchase these things that your families may be well fed and
your homes made comfortable
and now a few words on baking your own bread i assure you if you would
adopt this excellent practice you would not only effect a great saving
in your expenditure but you would also insure a more substantial and
wholesome kind of food it would be free from potato rice bean or pea
flour and alum all of which substances are objectionable in the
composition of bread the only utensil required for breadmaking would
be a tub or trough capable of working a bushel or two of flour this
tub would be useful in brewing for which you will find in this book
plain and easy directions
i have pointed out the necessity of procuring these articles for cooking
purposes and with the injunction to use great care in keeping them
thoroughly clean i will at once proceed to show you their value in a
course of practical and economical cookery the soundness and plainness
of which i sincerely hope you will all be enabled to test in your own
homes
cookery book
no 1 boiled beef
this is an economical dinner especially where there are many mouths to
feed buy a few pounds of either salt brisket thick or thin flank or
buttock of beef these pieces are always to be had at a low rate let us
suppose you have bought a piece of salt beef for a sundays dinner
weighing about five pounds at 612d per pound that would come to
2s 812d two pounds of common flour 4d to be made into suet
pudding or dumplings and say 812d for cabbages parsnips and
potatoes altogether 3s 9d this would produce a substantial dinner
for ten persons in family and would moreover as children do not
require much meat when they have pudding admit of there being enough
left to help out the next days dinner with potatoes
no 2 how to boil beef
put the beef into your three or four gallon pot three parts filled with
cold water and set it on the fire to boil remove all the scum that
rises to the surface and then let it boil gently on the hob when the
meat has boiled an hour and is about half done add the parsnips in a
net and at the end of another half hour put in the cabbages also in a
net a piece of beef weighing five or six pounds will require about two
hours gentle boiling to cook it thoroughly the dumplings may of
course be boiled with the beef etc i may here observe that the
dumplings and vegetables with a small quantity of the meat would be
allsufficient for the childrens meal
no 3 economical pot liquor soup
a thrifty housewife will not require that i should tell her to save the
liquor in which the beef has been boiled i will therefore take it for
granted that the next day she carefully removes the grease which will
have become set firm on the top of the broth into her fat pot this
must be kept to make a piecrust or to fry potatoes or any remains of
vegetables onions or fish the liquor must be tasted and if it is
found to be too salt some water must be added to lessen its saltness
and render it palatable the pot containing the liquor must then be
placed on the fire to boil and when the scum rises to the surface it
should be removed with a spoon while the broth is boiling put as many
piledup tablespoonfuls of oatmeal as you have pints of liquor into a
basin mix this with cold water into a smooth liquid batter and then
stir it into the boiling soup season with some pepper and a good pinch
of allspice and continue stirring the soup with a stick or spoon on the
fire for about twenty minutes you will then be able to serve out a
plentiful and nourishing meal to a large family at a cost of not more
than the price of the oatmeal
no 4 potato soup for six persons
peel and chop four onions and put them into a gallon saucepan with two
ounces of dripping fat or butter or a bit of fat bacon add rather
better than three quarts of water and set the whole to boil on the fire
for ten minutes then throw in four pounds of peeled and slicedup
potatoes pepper and salt and with a wooden spoon stir the soup on the
fire for about twentyfive minutes by which time the potatoes will be
done to a pulp and the soup ready for dinner or breakfast
no 5 pea soup for six persons
cut up two and ahalf pounds of pickled pork or some pork cuttings or
else the same quantity of scrag end of neck of mutton or leg of beef
and put any one of these kinds of meat into a pot with a gallon of
water three pints of split or dried peas previously soaked in cold
water overnight two carrots four onions and a head of celery all
chopped small season with pepper but no salt as the pork if pork
is used will season the soup sufficiently set the whole to boil very
gently for at least three hours taking care to skim it occasionally
and do not forget that the peas etc must be stirred from the bottom
of the pot now and then from three to four hours gentle boiling will
suffice to cook a good mess of this most excellent and satisfying soup
if fresh meat is used for this purpose salt must be added to season it
dried mint may be strewn over the soup when eaten
no 6 onion soup for six persons
chop fine six onions and fry them in a gallon saucepan with two ounces
of butter or dripping fat stirring them continuously until they become
of a very light colour then add six ounces of flour or oatmeal and
moisten with three quarts of water season with pepper and salt and
stir the soup while boiling for twenty minutes and when done pour it
out into a pan or bowl containing slices of bread
no 7 broth made from bones for soup
fresh bones are always to be purchased from butchers at about a farthing
per pound they must be broken up small and put into a boilingpot with
a quart of water to every pound of bones and being placed on the fire
the broth must be well skimmed seasoned with pepper and salt a few
carrots onions turnips celery and thyme and boiled very gently for
six hours it is then to be strained off and put back into the pot
with any bits of meat or gristle which may have fallen from the bones
the bones left are still worth a farthing per pound and can be sold to
the bonedealers let this broth be thickened with peasemeal or
oatmeal in the proportion of a large tablespoonful to every pint of
broth and stirred over the fire while boiling for twentyfive minutes
by which time the soup will be done it will be apparent to all good
housewives that with a little trouble and good management a savoury
and substantial meal may thus be prepared for a mere trifle
no 8 thick milk for breakfast
milk buttermilk or even skimmilk will serve for this purpose to
every pint of milk mix a piledup tablespoonful of flour and stir the
mixture while boiling on the fire for ten minutes season with a little
salt and eat it with bread or a boiled potato this kind of food is
well adapted for the breakfast of women and children and is far
preferable to a sloppy mess of tea which comes to more money
no 9 oatmeal porridge for six persons
to five pints of skim or buttermilk add a couple of onions chopped
fine and set them to boil on the fire meanwhile mix six
tablespoonfuls of oatmeal with a pint of milk or water very smoothly
pour it into the boiling milk and onions and stir the porridge on the
fire for ten minutes season with salt to taste
no 10 oxcheek soup
an oxcheek is always to be bought cheap let it be thoroughly washed in
several waters place it whole in a three gallon boilingpot filled up
with water and set it to boil on the fire skim it well season with
carrots turnips onions celery allspice pepper and salt and allow
the whole to boil very gently by the side of the hob for about three
hours and ahalf by which time the oxcheek etc will be done quite
tender the cheek must then be taken out on to a dish the meat removed
from the bone and after being cut up in pieces put back into the soup
again next mix smoothly twelve ounces of flour with a quart of cold
water pour this into the soup and stir the whole on the fire keeping
it boiling for about twentyfive minutes longer when it will be ready
for dinner one oxcheek properly managed will by attending to the
foregoing instructions furnish an ample quantity of substantial and
nutritious food equal to the wants of a large family for three days
consumption
no 11 sheepshead broth
get the butcher to split the sheeps head into halves wash these clean
and put them into a boilingpot with two gallons of water set this on
the fire to boil skim it well add carrots turnips onions leeks
celery thyme or winter savory season with pepper and salt add a pint
of patna rice or scotch barley and all the whole to keep gently
boiling by the side of the fire for three hours adding a little water
to make up for the deficiency in quantity occasioned by boiling
no 12 cowheel broth
put a couple of cowheels into a boilingpot with a pound of rice a
dozen leeks washed free from grit and cut into pieces and some coarsely
chopped parsley fill up with six quarts of water set the whole to boil
on the fire skim it well season with thyme pepper and salt and
allow the whole to boil very gently on the hob for about two hours you
will thus provide a savoury meal at small cost
no 13 bacon and cabbage soup
when it happens that you have a dinner consisting of bacon and cabbages
you invariably throw away the liquor in which they have been boiled or
at the best give it to the pigs if you possess any this is wrong for
it is easy to turn it to a better account for your own use by paying
attention to the following instructions vizput your piece of bacon
on to boil in a pot with two gallons more or less according to the
number you have to provide for of water when it has boiled up and has
been well skimmed add the cabbages kale greens or sprouts whichever
may be used well washed and split down and also some parsnips and
carrots season with pepper but no salt as the bacon will season the
soup sufficiently and when the whole has boiled together very gently
for about two hours take up the bacon surrounded with the cabbage
parsnips and carrots leaving a small portion of the vegetables in the
soup and pour this into a large bowl containing slices of bread eat
the soup first and make it a rule that those who eat most soup are
entitled to the largest share of bacon
no 14 stewed leg of beef
four pounds of leg or shin of beef cost about one shilling cut this
into pieces the size of an egg and fry them of a brown colour with a
little dripping fat in a good sized saucepan then shake in a large
handful of flour add carrots and onions cut up in pieces the same as
the meat season with pepper and salt moisten with water enough to
cover in the whole stir the stew on the fire till it boils and then
set it on the hob to continue boiling very gently for about an hour and
a half and you will then be able to enjoy an excellent dinner
no 15 cocky leeky
i hope that at some odd times you may afford yourselves an old hen or
cock and when this occurs this is the way in which i recommend that it
be cooked vizfirst pluck draw singe off the hairs and tie the
fowl up in a plump shape next put it into a boilingpot with a gallon
of water and a pound of patna rice a dozen leeks cut in pieces some
peppercorns and salt to season boil the whole very gently for three
hours and divide the fowl to be eaten with the soup which will prove
not only nourishing but invigorating to the system
no 16 roast fowl and gravy
let us hope that at christmas or some other festive season you may
have to dress a fowl or turkey for your dinner on such occasions i
would recommend the following methodfirst draw the fowl reserving
the gizzard and liver to be tucked under the wings truss the fowl with
skewers and tie it to the end of a skein of worsted which is to be
fastened to a nail stuck in the chimneypiece so that the fowl may
dangle rather close to the fire in order to roast it baste the fowl
while it is being roasted with butter or some kind of grease and when
nearly done sprinkle it with a little flour and salt and allow the
fowl to attain a bright yellowbrown colour before you take it up then
place it on its dish and pour some brown gravy over it
no 17 this is the brown gravy for the fowl
chop up an onion and fry it with a sprig of thyme and a bit of butter
and when it is brown add a good teaspoonful of moist sugar and a drop
of water and boil all together on the fire until the water is reduced
and the sugar begins to bake of a dark brown colour it must then be
stirred on the fire for three minutes longer after which moisten it
with halfapint of water add a little pepper and salt boil all
together for five minutes and strain the gravy over the fowl etc
no 18 bread sauce for a roast fowl
chop a small onion or shalot fine and boil it in a pint of milk for
five minutes then add about ten ounces of crumb of bread a bit of
butter pepper and salt to season stir the whole on the fire for ten
minutes and eat this bread sauce with roast fowl or turkey
no 19 egg sauce for roast fowls etc
boil two or three eggs for about eight minutes remove the shells cut
up each egg into about ten pieces of equal size and put them into some
buttersauce made as followsviz knead two ounces of flour with one
ounce andahalf of butter add halfapint of water pepper and salt to
season and stir the sauce on the fire until it begins to boil then mix
in the pieces of chopped hardboiled eggs
no 20 pork chops grilled or broiled
score the rind of each chop by cutting through the rind at distances of
halfaninch apart season the chops with pepper and salt and place
them on a clean gridiron over a clear fire to broil the chops must be
turned over every two minutes until they are done this will take about
fifteen minutes the chops are then to be eaten plain or if
convenient with brown gravy made as shown in no 17
no 21 sharp sauce for broiled meats
chop fine an onion and a pennyworth of mixed pickles put these into a
saucepan with halfagill of vinegar a teaspoonful of mustard a small
bit of butter a large tablespoonful of breadraspings and pepper and
salt to season boil all together on the fire for at least six minutes
then add a gill of water and allow the sauce to boil again for ten
minutes longer this sauce will give an appetizing relish to the
coarsest meats or fish when broiled or fried and also when you are
intending to make any cold meat into a hash or stew in the latter case
the quantity of water and raspings must be doubled
no 22 roast veal stuffed
a piece of the shoulder breast or chumpend of the loin of veal is
the cheapest part for you and whichever of these pieces you may happen
to buy should be seasoned with the following stuffingto eight ounces
of bruised crumb of bread add four ounces of chopped suet shalot
thyme marjoram and winter savory all chopped fine two eggs pepper
and salt to season mix all these ingredients into a firm compact kind
of paste and use this stuffing to fill a hole or pocket which you will
have cut with a knife in some part of the piece of veal taking care to
fasten it in with a skewer if you intend roasting the veal and should
not possess what is called a bottlejack nor even a dutch oven in that
case the veal should be suspended by and fastened to the end of a
twisted skein of worsted made fast at the upper end by tying it to a
large nail driven into the centre of the mantelpiece for that purpose
this contrivance will enable you to roast the veal by dangling it before
your fire the exact time for cooking it must depend upon its weight a
piece of veal weighing four pounds would require rather more than an
hour to cook it thoroughly before your small fire
no 23 veal cutlets and bacon
you may sometimes have a chance to purchase a few trimmings or cuttings
of veal or a small piece from the chump end of the loin which you can
cut up in thin slices and after seasoning them with pepper and salt
and rolling them in flour they are to be fried in the fat that remains
from some slices of bacon which you shall have previously fried and
after placing the fried veal and bacon in its dish shake a
tablespoonful of flour in the fryingpan add a few drops of ketchup or
vinegar and a gill of water stir all together on the fire to boil for
five minutes and pour this sauce over the cutlets a dish of cutlets of
any kind of meat may be prepared as above
no 24 a pudding made of small birds
industrious and intelligent boys who live in the country are mostly
well up in the cunning art of catching small birds at odd times during
the winter months so my young friends when you have been so fortunate
as to succeed in making a good catch of a couple of dozen of birds you
must first pluck them free from feathers cut off their heads and claws
and pick out their gizzards from their sides with the point of a small
knife and then hand the birds over to your mother who by following
these instructions will prepare a famous pudding for your dinner or
supper first fry the birds whole with a little butter shalot
parsley thyme and winter savory all chopped small pepper and salt to
season and when the birds are half done shake in a small handful of
flour add rather better than a gill of water stir the whole on the
fire while boiling for ten minutes and when the stew of birds is nearly
cold pour it all into a goodsized pudding basin which has been
readylined with either a suet and flour crust or else a
drippingcrust cover the pudding in with a piece of the paste and
either bake or boil it for about an hour andahalf
no 25 baked pigs head
split the pigs head into halves sprinkle them with pepper and salt
and lay them with the rind part uppermost upon a bed of sliced onions in
a baking dish next bruise eight ounces of stale breadcrumb and mix it
with four ounces of chopped suet twelve sage leaves chopped fine
pepper and salt to season and sprinkle this seasoning all over the
surface of the pigs head add one ounce of butter and a gill of vinegar
to the onions and bake the whole for about an hour andahalf basting
the pigs head occasionally with the liquor
no 26 baked goose
pluck and pick out all the stubble feathers thoroughly clean draw the
goose cut off the head and neck and also the feet and wings which
must be scalded to enable you to remove the pinion feathers from the
wings and the rough skin from the feet split and scrape the inside of
the gizzard and carefully cut out the gall from the liver these
giblets well stewed as shown in no 62 will serve to make a pie for
another days dinner next stuff the goose in manner following
vizfirst put six potatoes to bake in the oven or even in a dutch
oven and while they are being baked chop six onions with four apples
and twelve sage leaves and fry these in a saucepan with two ounces of
butter pepper and salt when the whole is slightly fried mix it with
the pulp of the six baked potatoes and use this very nice stuffing to
fill the inside of the goose the goose being stuffed place it upon an
iron trivet in a baking dish containing peeled potatoes and a few
apples add halfapint of water pepper and salt shake some flour over
the goose and bake it for about an hour and ahalf
no 27 baked sucking pig
let the pig be stuffed in the same manner as directed for a goose as
shown in the preceding number score it all over crosswise rub some
grease or butter upon it place it upon a trivet in a dish containing
peeled potatoes and a few sliced onions season with pepper and salt
add halfapint of water and bake the pig for about two hours basting
it frequently with its own dripping or a bit of butter tied up in a
piece of muslin
no 28 baked or roast ducks
these are to be dressed in the same way as directed for dressing geese
no 29 how to make the most of a pig after it is killed
cottagers sometimes feed a pig for their own consumption and
therefore in the hope that many of you may have it in your power to do
so i will give you proper instructions as to the best way to make the
most of it first when the pig is killed should the hair or bristles
be wet wipe them dry with a wisp of hay or straw and having laid it on
the ground upon a narrow bed of dry straw three inches in thickness and
laid some loose straw all over it set fire to it and as the upper
straw burns out lay on another covering of loose straw and by the
time this has burnt out all the hairs of the upper part of the pig will
probably be singed off if not burn a little more straw upon the
remaining parts and on turning the pig over should it be found that
any of the hairs yet remain let them be singed off with a lighted wisp
of straw throw a pail of water over the pig and scrape it clean and
dry with an old knife the next thing to be done is to insert a stout
stick pointed at the ends into the hocks of the hind legs fasten a
strong cord to the stick and hoist up the pig so as to enable you to
stand up and finish your work with ease to yourself with a sharp knife
rip up the belly and stretch out the flaps with two sticks to enable
you to throw in some water to cleanse the pigs inside having first
removed the guts etc hang up the pluck to cool and also the
chitterlings and loose fat and after thoroughly wiping the pig let
it hang in the draught to become quite cold you then split the pig in
halves commencing between the hind quarters and when this is done
first cut off the hocks then the hams and the head next cleverly
remove slicing away what is called the spareribthat is the lean
meat about the ribsreaching up about four inches toward the breast
part and lay the spareribs aside to be sold or reserved for your own
use the head may be baked as shown in no 25 the sparerib may be
dressed as in no 27
no 30 how to cure hams
to six pounds of common salt add four ounces of saltpetre eight ounces
of treacle two ounces of salprunella winter savory bayleaves thyme
marjoram and a good tablespoonful of allspice bruise all these things
well together and thoroughly rub them over and into the hams with
very clean hands the rubbingin must be repeated four or five
successive mornings and the hams must remain in this pickle for ten
days longer
no 31 how to smoke hams
when the hams have been well pickled as shown in the preceding number
they must be pressed between boards with heavy stones to render them
flat the hams should remain in press for twentyfour hours and at the
end of that time must be well rubbed all over with peasemeal mixed with
a little salt they are then to be smoked in a close shed or in the
chimney burning for that purpose some branches of juniper or any other
wood and some sawdust the smoking must last five days the hams when
sufficiently smoked must be kept in a cool place they will not be ripe
for cooking before six months after their curing remember that a couple

that it must be turned over on the trivet every twenty minutes and that
you must be careful to baste it all over now and then with the fat which
runs from it into the dish using a spoon for that purpose it would be
very economical if when you have baked meat for dinner you were always
to make a yorkshire pudding to be baked under it there are baking
dishes made with a parting down the middle which just suit this purpose

when you happen to have a clear fire the steaks may be cooked on a
gridiron over the fire the steaks must be turned on the gridiron every

of the meat while broiling that the juices are not allowed to run off
in waste but are reabsorbed by the meat when the steaks are cooked
rub them over with a small bit of butter season with pepper and salt a
little chopped shalot sprinkled over steaks imparts an extra relish
no 79 mutton chops or steaks
mutton chops properly speaking are an expensive affair but what i
recommend you to buy is the chump end of the loin of mutton which is

these be broiled in the same manner as recommended for beefsteaks

prepare an ox kidney as shown in no 67 and use this to fill a good
sized pudding basin which you shall have previously lined with a

of the paste on the top fasten it by pressing the two edges of the
paste together tie the pudding up in a cloth and take care to place
the bottom of the puddingbasin downward in the pot in which it is to be
boiled it will take about two hours to boil a good sized pudding of
this kind when you take it out of the pot be very careful not to run
the fork through the crust and pay great attention how you handle the
pudding while removing the cloth so as not to spill or waste the gravy
it contains as that would go very far towards spoiling the pudding you
have had all the trouble to prepare
no 81 hashed meats
i strongly recommend that you never allow yourselves to be persuaded
that cold meat dinners are cheap dinners just the reverse of this
assumption is the fact and let me tell you that those who make the
former assertion do so only because they know no better and as an
excuse for their idleness i am well aware that in your homes it is not
a common everyday occurrence for you to dress a large joint of meat
from which enough would be left for one or more days dinner but still
it may and does sometimes occur that you have cold meat at your
disposal upon which you may exercise your knowledge in domestic
economy besides some of you who are living close to noblemen and
gentlemens mansions in the country or otherwise may perhaps stand a
chance of now and then receiving a donation of this kind and whenever
you have any cold meat i advise you to cook it up into stews of the
various kinds described in this work or else make it into a hash as
follows first chop two onions fine and put them to boil with pepper
and salt and a pint of water in a saucepan for ten minutes then throw
in the meat cut in thin slices mixed with a little flour boil all
together gently for ten minutes longer and pour the hash into a dish
containing either some ready boiled potatoes or else some slices of
toasted bread

two inches square put these into a saucepan containing skim milk or

the whole together divide this paste into twelve equal parts roll each

sausages in it wet the edge of the paste to fasten the sausage securely
in it and as you finish off each sausage dumpling drop it gently into
a large enough saucepan containing plenty of boiling water and when
the whole are finished allow them to boil gently by the side of the
fire for one hour and then take up the dumplings with a spoon free from
water on to a dish and eat them while they are hot

minutes or half an hour
no 86 roast pork
let us suppose or rather hope that you may sometimes have a leg of
pork to cook for your dinner it will eat all the better if it is scored
all over by cutting the rind or rather slitting it crosswise at short
distances with the point of a sharp knife it is to be well sprinkled
all over with salt and allowed to absorb the seasoning during some
hours previously to its being cooked prepare some stuffing as
followschop six onions and twelve sage leaves fine fry these with a
bit of butter pepper and salt for five minutes then add six ounces
of bread soaked in water stir all together on the fire for five
minutes and use this stuffing to fill up a hole or pocket which you
will make by running the point of a knife down between the rind and the
flesh of the joint of pork secure this by sewing it up or else fasten
it securely in with a small wooden skewer or twig the joint of pork so
far prepared must then be placed upon a trivet in a bakingdish
containing plenty of peeled potatoes and if possible a few apples for
the children add half a pint of water pepper and salt and if the
joint happens to be a leg it will require about two hours to bake it

slices fry it on both sides and dish it up round some cabbages or any
dressed vegetables ready to hand which must be chopped up seasoned

it does sometimes happen that when you are living in the country in the
neighbourhood of considerate gentlefolks who possess game preserves

poor cottagers in their vicinity and when you are so fortunate as to
have a hare given to you this is the way to cook itfirst cut the
hare up into pieces of equal size then cut up a pound of bacon into
small squares and fry these in a saucepan for five minutes next add

peeled potatoes and by the time that these are done the dinner will be
ready and this is the way in which to make the most of this excellent
and economical dinner first take up the bacon and having placed it on
its dish garnish it round with the cabbages carrots parsnips and
potatoes and then add some pieces of crust or thin slices of bread to
the liquor in which the bacondinner has been cooked and this will
furnish you with a good wholesome soup with which to satisfy the first
peremptory call of your healthy appetites
no 90 economical vegetable pottage
in france and also in many parts of europe the poorer classes but very
seldom taste meat in any form the chief part of their scanty food
consists of bread vegetables and more especially of their soup which
is mostly if not entirely made of vegetables or as is customary on
the southern coasts of france italy and spain more generally of
fish for making which kinds of soup see nos 4 6 118 etc
the most common as well as the easiest method for making a good mess of
cheap and nutritious soup is the followingif you are five or six in
family put a threegallon pot on the fire rather more than half full of
water add four ounces of butter pepper and salt and small sprigs of
winter savory thyme and parsley and when this has boiled throw in
any portion or quantity as may best suit your convenience of such of
the following vegetables as your garden can affordany kind of
cabbages cleaned and split carrots turnips parsnips broad beans
french beans peas broccoli red cabbages vegetable marrow young
potatoes a few lettuce some chervil and a few sprigs of mint allow
all this to simmer by the side of the hob for about two hours and then
after taking up the more considerable portion of the whole vegetables on
to a dish eat one half or as much as you may require of the soup with
bread in it and make up your dinner with the whole vegetables and more
bread the remainder will serve for the next day let me persuade you
my friends to try and persevere in adopting this very desirable kind of
food when in your power for your ordinary fare i of course intend
this remark more particularly for the consideration of such of my
readers as are or may be located in the country and who may have a
little garden of their own
no 91 how to make a fish curry

powder all over the fish put the lid on the saucepan and set the
whole on the hob of a moderate fire or in the oven if you have one to
remain simmering for about half an hour the curry will then be ready to
be eaten with wellboiled rice
no 92 this is the way to boil rice
i recommend you to buy patna rice as it is the cheapest it is best to
soak it in water overnight as it then requires less time to boil it
and moreover when soaked the rice becomes lighter from the fact that
the grains separate more readily while boiling put the rice on to boil
in plenty of cold water stirring it from the bottom of the saucepan
occasionally while it is boiling fast when the grains separate at the
ends and thus appear to form the letter x the rice will be done it
requires about half an hours gentle boiling when the rice is done
drain it in a colander and place it before the fire stirring it now
and then with a fork

boil remove the dirty scum from the surface of the sugar and after
allowing it to boil for ten minutes pour it in equal proportions into
the jar or jars containing the fruits and place them in a moderate heat
to bake slowly for three hours at least when boiling the sugar for this
purpose remember that it is most prudent to use a saucepan capable of
containing double the quantity as sugar is very liable to boil over and
waste when the fruit is nearly dissolved the raisinet will be done it
must then be removed to a cool place until it has become thoroughly cold
and partially set firm the jars should then be tied down with thick
paper or bladder and kept in the cellar for winter use either for
making puddings or tarts or for spreading on bread for the children
no 107 currant jam
ingredients twelve pounds of picked currants either red black or
white or if agreeable mixed eight pounds of raw sugar three pints

no 112 to make elder wine
ingredients two gallons of elderberries two quarts of damsons eight
pounds of raw sugar at 412d per pound two gallons of water two
ounces of ginger one ounce of cloves and half a pint of fresh yeast
to make this quantity of elder wine you must have a copper a tub a
large canvas or loose flannel bag and a fivegallon barrel first
crush the elderberries and damsons thoroughly in the pot or copper in
which they are to be boiled then add the water and keep stirring all
together as it boils until the fruit is well dissolved then use a
wooden bowl or a basin to pour the whole into a loose flannel bag
steadily fixed across two stout sticks resting safely on two chairs
or if you have one a large coarse sieve instead when all the liquor
has passed through into the tub put the dregs back into the copper to
be boiled up with a couple of quarts of water and then to be strained
to the other liquor the next part of the process is to put the whole of
the elderberry juice back into the clean pot or copper with the sugar
and the spice well bruised with a hammer stir all together on the
fire and allow the wine to boil gently for half an hour then pour it
into the clean tub to cool the halfpint of yeast must then be added
and thoroughly mixed by stirring at the end of two days skim off the
yeast which by that time will have risen to the surface the elder
wine must now be put into the barrel and kept in the cellar with the
bunghole left open for a fortnight at the end of this time a stiff
brown paper should be pasted over the bunghole and after standing for
a month or six weeks the wine will be ready for use to be obliged to
buy all the ingredients for making elder wine would render it a matter
of great difficultyperhaps in some cases an impossibility but
remember that when living in the country where in some parts
elderberries grow in the hedgerows you may have them for the trouble
of gathering them in which case the elder wine would be cheaper and
more easily within your means
no 113 vegetable porridge
scrape and peel the following vegetablessix carrots six turnips six
onions three heads of celery and three parsnips slice up all these
very thinly and put them into a twogallon pot with four ounces of

the fire for two hours at the end of this time the vegetables will be
done to a pulp and the whole must be rubbed through a colander with a
wooden spoon and afterwards put back into the pot and stirred over the
fire to make it hot for dinner
no 114 pumpkin porridge
i am aware that pumpkins are not generally grown in this country as an
article of food for the poorer classes and more is the pity for they
require but little trouble to rear and yield an abundance of nutritious
and cooling food at a small cost the chief reason for the short
supply is i imagine the want of knowledge for turning the pumpkin to
good account as an article of food i am now about to supply easy
instruction to convey that knowledge to whomsoever may stand in need of
it peel and slice up as much pumpkin as will produce about eight ounces
for each person and put this into a boiling pot with two ounces of
butter and a quart of water set the whole to boil very gently on the
fire until the pumpkin is reduced to a pulp and then add halfapint
of buttermilk or skim milk to every person who is to partake of the
porridge you then stir the porridge over the fire for about fifteen
minutes longer taking care that it does not boil over season with salt
and a little nutmeg and eat it with toasted bread for breakfast or any
other meal
no 115 ricemilk for six persons
put one pound of patna rice into a boiling pot with two ounces of
butter two quarts of water a small bit of cinnamon or lemonpeel and
a little salt put the lid on and set the rice to boil very gently
indeed close to the hob until the rice is done quite soft this will
take about one hour and a quarter then add three pints of skim milk
and after having stirred the ricemilk over the fire for ten minutes
longer it may be sweetened with a little honey or sugar and will
produce an excellent breakfast for at least six persons
no 116 knuckle of veal and rice
a small knuckle or scragend of neck of veal is sometimes to be
purchased very cheap i will therefore suppose that you may once in a
way provide such a thing and this is the way you should cook it to the
best advantage put the knuckle of veal into a boiling pot with a pound
of bacon two pounds of rice six onions three carrots cut in pieces
some peppercorns and salt in moderation on account of the bacon add
three or four quarts of water and set the whole to stew very gently
over a moderate fire for about three hours this will produce a good
substantial dinner for at least ten persons
no 117 irish stew
inferior parts of any kind of meat make a good irish stew let the meat
be cut in pieces the size of an egg well rubbed all over with pepper
and salt and placed in a goodsized pot or saucepan add peeled onions
in the proportion of six to the pound of meat and enough water just to
cover in the whole next set the stew on the fire to boil very gently
for an hour and ahalf then add such quantity of peeled and split
potatoes as you may think will suffice for the number of persons about
to dine off the stew and put the whole back on the fire to boil briskly
until the potatoes are thoroughly done soft the irish stew will then be
ready to eat
no 118 fish soup
codfish cuttings dutch plaice skate dabs haddocks codsheads
codstails or any freshwater fish you may happen to catch when
fishing conger eels cut in slices and almost any kind of fish which
may come within reach of your means are all more or less fit for making
a good mess of soup for a meal first chop fine some onions and put
them into a pot with enough water to furnish about half a pint for each
person to be provided for and set this on the fire to boil for ten
minutes then add your pieces of fish of about four ounces each season
with thyme pepper and salt and boil the soup for about fifteen
minutes longer when it will be ready for dinner some wellboiled
potatoes will prove a welcome addition to this soup
notethis kind of fish soup will prove the more advantageous near
the seacoast where inferior kinds of fish are always very cheap
no 119 soused mackerel
when mackerel are to be bought at six for a shilling this kind of fish
forms a cheap dinner on such occasions the mackerel must be placed
heads and tails in an earthen dish or pan seasoned with chopped onions
black pepper a pinch of allspice and salt add sufficient vinegar and
water in equal proportions to cover the fish bake in your own oven if
you possess one or send them to the bakers
noteherrings sprats or any other cheap fish are soused in the
same manner
no 120 a dinner of red herrings
the cheaper sort of red herrings are always too salty and unpleasantly
strongflavoured and are therefore an indifferent kind of food unless
due precaution is taken to soak them in water for an hour before they
are cooked first soak the red herrings in water for an hour wipe and
split them down the back toast or broil them on both sides for two or
three minutes and having placed them on a dish put a bit of butter and
some chopped onion upon each herring pour a little vinegar over all
and this will make a cheap and savoury dish to be eaten with wellboiled
potatoes
no 121 to fry fish
for this purpose you must have some kind of fat either lard butter or
dripping fat would be excellent but they must be bought and cost a
little money true but then if you can afford yourselves a bit of
meat occasionally by dint of good thrift you should save the fat from
the boiled meat or the dripping from your baked meats and thus furnish
yourselves with fat for frying your fish twice aweek and let me tell
you that by introducing fish as an occasional part of your daily food
your health as well as your pockets would feel the benefit of such a
system of economy suppose then that you have bought some cheap kind
of fish such as herrings large flounders plaice small soles or any
other small or flat fish first of all let the fish be washed and wiped
dry and rubbed all over with a little flour next put about two ounces
of fat free from water in a fryingpan on the fire and as soon as it
is hot put the fish in to fry one or two at a time according to their
size as unless they have room enough in the fryingpan they do not fry
well this must be carefully attended to and when the fish is a little
browned on one side turn it over with a tin fishslice that it may be
fried on the other side also and as soon as done place the fried fish
on a dish and then fry the others when all your fish are fried with
what fat remains in the pan fry some onions and place them round the
fish and by way of adding an extra relish to your meal just throw a
few tablespoonfuls of vinegar some pepper and salt into the
fryingpan give it a boil up and pour this round the fish
no 122 salt fish with parsnips
salt fish must always be well soaked in plenty of cold water the whole
of the night before it is required for the following days dinner the
salt fish must be put on to boil in plenty of cold water without any
salt and when thoroughly done should be welldrained free from any
water and placed on a dish with plenty of wellboiled parsnips some
sauce may be poured over the fish which is to be made as follows
vizmix two ounces of butter with three ounces of flour pepper and
salt a small glassful of vinegar and a good halfpint of water stir
this on the fire till it boils a few hardboiled eggs chopped up and
mixed in this sauce would render the dish more acceptable
no 123 baked fish
wash and wipe the fish and lay it heads and tails in a bakingdish
the bottom of which has been spread all over with a little butter or
dripping add a little vinegar and water and when procurable some
mushroom ketchup season with chopped onions and parsley shake plenty
of raspings of bread all over the top of the fish and bake it in your
oven or send it to the bakers
no 124 baked cods head
first make some stuffing with one pound of bruised crumb of bread
mixed with six ounces of chopped suet two eggs chopped parsley onions
and thyme and seasoned with pepper and salt put this stuffing inside
the cods head and place it in a bakingdish with two ounces of butter
a gill of vinegar and a pint and a half of water spread a little of
the butter all over the cods head and then a thick coating of
breadraspings all over it bake it for an hour in the oven a few
oysters would be an improvement
no 125 bouillabaisse soup
put the following ingredients into a saucepan to boil on the firefour
onions and six tomatoes or red loveapples cut in thin slices some
thyme and winter savory a little saladoil a wineglassful of vinegar
pepper and salt and a pint of water to each person when the soup has
boiled fifteen minutes throw in your fish cut in pieces or slices
and as soon as the fish is done eat the soup with some crusts of
bread or toast in it all kinds of fish suit this purpose
no 126 to boil fish
put the fish on in sufficient water to cover it add a small handful of
salt and providing that the fish is not larger than mackerel soles
or whiting it will be cooked by the time that the water boils yet it
is always best to try whether it requires to boil a little longer as
underdone fish is unwholesome boiled fish requires some kind of sauce
try the following viz
no 127 parsley sauce
chop a handful of parsley and mix it in a stewpan with two ounces of
butter two ounces of flour pepper and salt moisten with half a pint
of water and a tablespoonful of vinegar stir the parsleysauce on the
fire till it boils and then pour it over the fish drained free from
water on its dish
no 128 anchovy sauce
mix two ounces of butter with two ounces of flour in a saucepan add a
spoonful of essence of anchovy and half a pint of water stir the sauce
on the fire till it boils
no 129 baked skate
chop three onions and fry them of a lightbrown colour in two ounces of
butter then add half a pint of vinegar pepper and salt and allow the
whole to boil on the fire for five minutes put the skate in a baking
dish pour the sauce over it and also just enough water to reach to its
surface strew a thick coating of breadraspings on the fish and bake
it for an hour and a half at rather moderate heat
no 130 how to brew your own beer
the first preparatory step towards brewing is to gather your necessary
plant together in proper working order and thoroughly clean your plant
or utensils must consist of the following articles viza
thirtygallon copper two coolingtubs capable of holding each about
thirty gallons a mashtub of sufficient size to contain fiftyfour
gallons and another tub of smaller size called an underback a bucket
or pail a wooden handbowl a large wooden funnel a mashstirrer four
scraped long stout sticks a goodsized loosewrought wicker basket for
straining the beer and another small bowlshaped wicker basket called
a tapwaist to fasten inside the mashtub on to the inner end of the
spigot and faucet to keep back the grains when the wort is being run
off out of the mashtub you will also require some beer barrels a
couple of brass or metal cocks some ventpegs and some bungs i do not
pretend to assert that the whole of the foregoing articles are
positively indispensable for brewing your own beer i merely enumerate
what is most proper to be used leaving the manner and means of
replacing such of these articles as may be out of your reach very much
to your intelligence in contriving to use such as you possess or can
borrow from a neighbour instead spring water from its hardness is
unfit for brewing fresh fallen rain water caught in clean tubs or
water fetched from a brook or river are best adapted for brewing as
from the fact of their being free from all calcareous admixture their
consequent softness gives them the greater power to extract all the
goodness and strength from the malt and hops
in order to ensure having good wholesome beer it is necessary to
calculate your brewing at the rate of two bushels of malt and two pounds
of hops to fiftyfour gallons of water these proportions well
managed will produce three kilderkins of good beer i recommend that
you should use malt and hops of the best quality only as their
plentiful yield of beneficial substance fully compensates for their
somewhat higher price a thin shell well filled up plump with the
interior flour and easily bitten asunder is a sure test of good
quality in malt superior hops are known by their light greenishyellow
tinge of colour and also by their bright dry yet somewhat gummy feel
to the touch without their having any tendency to clamminess the day
before brewing let all your tackle be well scrubbed and rinsed clean
the copper wiped out and all your tubs and barrels half filled with
cold water to soak for a few hours so as to guard against any chance
of leakage and afterwards emptied and set to dry in the open air
weather permitting or otherwise before the fire fasten the tapwaist
inside the mashtub to the inner end of the faucet and spigot taking
care to place the mashtub in an elevated position resting upon two
benches or stools early in the dawn of morning light the fire under
your copper filled with water overnight and as soon as it boils
with it fill the mashtub rather more than threeparts full and as soon
as the first heat of the water has subsided and you find that you are
able to bear your fingers drawn slowly through it without experiencing
pain you must then throw in the malt stirring it about for ten minutes
or so then lay some sticks across the mashtub and cover it with sacks
or blankets and allow it to steep for three hours at the end of the
three hours let off the wort from the mashtub into the underbacktub
which has been previously placed under the spigot and faucet ready to
receive it pouring the first that runs out back into the mash until
the wort runs free from grains etc now put the hops into the
underbacktub and let the wort run out upon them your copper having
been refilled and boiled again while the mash is in progress you must
now pour sufficient boiling water into the grains left in the mashtub
to make up your quantity of fiftyfour gallons and when this second
mashing shall have also stood some two hours let it be drawn off and
afterwards mixed with the first batch of wort and boil the whole at two
separate boilings with the hops equally divided each lot to be allowed
to boil for an hour and ahalf after it has commenced boiling the beer
is now to be strained through the loose wicker basket into your cooling
tubs and pans the more you have of these the better the beer from its
cooling quickly and when the beer has cooled to the degree of water
which has stood in the house in summertime for some hours let it all
be poured into your two or three largest tubs keeping back a couple or
three quarts in a pan with which to mix a pint of good yeast and a
tablespoonful of common salt stir this mixture well together keep it
in rather a warm part of the house and in the course of half an hour or
so it will work up to the top of the basin or pan this worked beer
must now be equally divided between the two or three tubs containing the
bulk of the beer and is to be well mixed in by ladling it about with a
wooden handbowl for a couple of minutes this done cover over the beer
with sacks or blankets stretched upon sticks across the tubs and leave
them in this state for fortyeight hours the next thing to be seen to
is to get your barrels placed in proper order and position for being
filled and to this end attend strictly to the following directions
vizfirst skim off the scum which is yeast from the top or surface
of the tubs and next draw off the beer through the spigot and with
the wooden funnel placed in the bunghole proceed to fill up the

this hollow add thereto two quarts of warm water and work in with
these as much of the flour as will serve to make a soft smooth kind of
batter strew this over with just enough flour to hide it then cover up
the trough with its lid or with a blanket to keep all warm and when
the leaven has risen sufficiently to cause the flour to crack all over
its surface throw in a handful of salt work all together add just
enough lukewarm soft water to enable you to work the whole into a firm
compact dough and after having kneaded this with your fists until it
becomes stiff and comparatively tough shake a little flour over it and
again cover it in with a blanket to keep it warm in order to assist its
fermentation if properly managed the fermentation will be accomplished
in rather less than half an hour meanwhile that the bread is being thus
far prepared you will have heated your oven to a satisfactory degree of
heat with a sufficient quantity of dry small wood faggots and when
all the wood is burnt sweep out the oven clean and free from all ashes

peel split and cut the potatoes into slices of equal thickness say
the thickness of two penny pieces and as they are cut out of hand let
them be dropped into a pan of cold water when about to fry the
potatoes first drain them on a clean cloth and dab them all over in
order to absorb all moisture while this has been going on you will
have made some kind of fat entirely free from water or gravy such as
lard for instance very hot in a fryingpan and into this drop your
prepared potatoes only a good handful at a time as if you attempt to
fry too many at once instead of being crisp as they should be the
potatoes will fry flabby and consequently will be unappetising as soon
as the first lot is fried in a satisfactory manner drain them from the
fat with a skimmer or spoon and then fry the remainder and when all
are fried shake a little salt over them

no 153 white haricot beans
in france haricot beans form a principal part in the staple articles of
food for the workingclasses and indeed for the entire population it
is much to be desired that some effectual means should be adopted for
the purpose of introducing and encouraging the use of this most
excellent vegetable among the people of england as a general article of
daily food more especially in the winter if this desideratum could be
accomplished its beneficial result would go far to assist in rendering
us in a measure independent of the potato crop which of late years
has proved so uncertain i am aware that haricot beans as well as
lentils as at present imported and retailed as a mere luxury to such as
possess cooks who know how to dress them might lead to the rejection of
my proposal that they should or could be adopted as food by the
people but i see no reason why haricot beans should not be imported to
this country in such quantities as would enable the importers to retail
them at a somewhat similar low price as that in which they are sold at
in france in that case they would become cheap enough to come within
the reach of the poorest and under the impression that this wish of
mine may be eventually realized i will here give you instructions how

pith and put the rind into a jug pare off all the white pith from

and may be safely given in cases of fever

the purpose lemons instead of oranges

slice up thinly three or four apples without peeling them and boil
them in a very clean saucepan with a quart of water and a little sugar
until the slices of apples are become soft the apple water must then be
strained through a piece of clean muslin or rag into a jug this
pleasant beverage should be drunk when cold it is considered beneficial
in aiding to allay scorbutic eruptions
no 208 how to make a soothing drink for coughs

linseed half an ounce shave the roots very thinly put them and the
linseed into a clean earthen pot with one quart of hot water cover with

a quart of water and a little orange or lemon rind boil this gently
for about ten minutes and then strain it through muslin into a jug

no 210 camomile tea
put about thirty flowers into a jug pour a pint of boiling water upon
them cover up the tea and when it has stood about ten minutes pour it

no 212 sage or marygold tea
put a dozen sage leaves into a teapot pour boiling water upon them
and after allowing the tea to stand for five or ten minutes it may be
drunk with sugar and milk in the same way and instead of the cheaper
kinds of teas which are sold for foreign teas but which are too often
composed of some kind of leaf more or less resembling the real plant
without any of its genuine fragrance and are from their spurious and
almost poisonous nature calculated to produce evil to all who consume
them besides the drawback of their being expensive articles
teas made from sage leaves dried mint marygolds and more
particularly the leaf of the black currant tree form a very pleasant as
well as wholesome kind of beverage and if used in equal proportions
would be found to answer very well as a most satisfactory substitute for
bad and expensive tea
no 213 how to stew red cabbages
the use of the red cabbage in this country is confined to its being
pickled almost raw and eaten in that detestable and injurious state
whereby its antiscorbutic powers are annulled
the red cabbage when merely boiled with bacon or with a little butter
and salt is both nutritious and beneficial in a medicinal point of
view inasmuch as that it possesses great virtue in all scorbutic and
dartrous affections on the continent it is customary to administer it
in such cases in the form of a syrup and also in a gelatinized state
the red cabbage stewed in the following manner will be found a very
tasty dishslice up the red cabbage rather thin wash it well drain
it and then put it into a saucepan with a little dripping or butter a

of moist sugar and half an ounce of citric acid or one pint of lemon
juice boil all together until reduced to a thick syrupthat is when

for any length of time if bottled and corked down tight and kept in a
cool place a teaspoonful taken occasionally will soon relieve the most
troublesome cough

currant jam or preserved black currant juice instead of the juice of
freshgathered currants

economical and substantial soup for distribution to the poor
i am well aware from my own experience that the charitable custom of
distributing wholesome and nutritious soup to poor families living in
the immediate neighbourhood of noblemen and gentlemens mansions in the
country already exists to a great extent yet it is certainly
desirable that this excellent practice should become more generally
adopted especially during the winter months when their scanty means of
subsistence but insufficiently yield them food adequate in quantity to
sustain the powers of life in a condition equal to their hard labour to
afford the industrious welldeserving poor a little assistance in this
way would call forth their gratitude to the givers and confer a
blessing on the needy the want of knowing how to properly prepare the
kind of soup best adapted to the purpose has no doubt in a great
measure militated against its being more generally bestowed throughout
the kingdom and it is in order to supply that deficient knowledge that
i have determined on giving easy instructions for its preparation
no 239 how to prepare a large quantity of good soup for the poor
it is customary with most large families while living in the country
to kill at least some portion of the meat consumed in their households
and without supposing for a moment that any portion of this is ever
wasted i may be allowed to suggest that certain parts such as sheeps
heads plucks shanks and scragends might very well be spared towards
making a good mess of soup for the poor the bones left from cooked
joints first baked in a brisk oven for a quarter of an hour and
afterwards boiled in a large copper of water for six hours would
readily prepare a gelatinized foundation broth for the soup the bones
when sufficiently boiled to be taken out and thus supposing that your
copper is already part filled with the broth made from bones all the
grease having been removed from the surface add any meat you may have
cut up in pieces of about four ounces weight garnish plentifully with
carrots celery onions some thyme and ground allspice wellsoaked
split peas barley or rice and as the soup boils up skim it well
occasionally season moderately with salt and after about four hours
gentle and continuous boiling the soup will be ready for distribution
it was the custom in families where i have lived as cook to allow a
pint of this soup served out with the pieces of meat in it to as many
as the recipients families numbered and the soup was made for
distribution twice every week during winter
no 240 another method for making economical soup
in households where large joints of salt beef or pork are cooked
almost daily for the family the liquor in which they have been boiled
should be saved all grease removed therefrom and put into the copper
with a plentiful supply of carrots parsnips celery and onions all
cut in small pieces the whole boiled and well skimmed till the
vegetables are done the soup is then to be thickened with either
oatmeal peasemeal or indian corn meal seasoned with pepper and ground
allspice and stirred continuously until it boils up again it must then
be skimmed and the best pieces of meat selected from the stockpot
should be kept in careful reserve to be added to the soup and allowed
to boil therein for half an hour longer
no 241 how to make fish soup in large quantities for distribution to
the poor
this kind of soup it will be easily understood is applicable only on
the seacoast and wherever fish is to be had very cheap chop fine a
dozen onions some thyme and winter savory and put these into a
copper or some large pot with about six gallons of water one pound of
butter pepper and salt enough to season allow the whole to boil for
ten minutes then thicken the broth with about four pounds of oatmeal
peasemeal or flour stir the soup continuously until it boils and then
throw in about fifteen pounds of fish cut up in onepound size pieces
and also some chopped parsley boil all together until the fish is done
and then serve out the soup to the recipients all kinds of fish except
sprats herrings and pilchards are equally well adapted for making
fish soup but codfish cods heads skate eels etc and all
glutinous fish suit the purpose best

genuine mustard
the lancet by its resumed inquiries upon the subject of adulterations
has again called attention of the public to a variety of articles of
daily use
to mustard great prominence has been given from the fact that
thirtythree samples were examined the report states that four only
were found to be genuine of which two samples were of the
manufacture of j and j colman being respectively colmans genuine
london mustard warranted pure and colmans brown mustard warranted
pure
we also learn that manufactured mustard extends from the pure and
genuine to the injurious combination exposed in the lancet see
27th sample examined to which disclosure the attention of medical men
is invited whether practising privately or in hospitals and
infirmaries when prescribing mustard as a remedial agent the fact is
also equally important to the vendor and his customer the public
and further as to qualitythe lancet in substance reports that
genuine mustard will be as varied in strength pungency and
flavour as are the known differences between the finest and most
inferior qualities of seed it results then that genuine does not
necessarily imply high quality
j and j colman submit that in their pure mustards nothing that
known skill and improved machinery can obtain from finest seed remains
unsecured and whether for prompt and specific medical effects or as
a table condiment these mustards are equally valuable
j and j colman offer to the public not only genuine and pure
mustard in the highest perfection but also their other varieties of
mustard condiments known as double superfine superfine fine
etc in which delicacy flavour and strength will be found in
agreeable combination these mustards may be obtained of any grocer
chemist or italian warehouseman in the kingdom and when sold in tins
or packets j and j colmans trade mark the bulls head is a
guarantee upon which the public may rely

                     consumption in all its stages
        coughs whooping cough asthma bronchitis fever ague
          diphtheria hysteria rheumatism diarrhoea spasms
            colic renal and uterine diseases are immediately
                         relieved by a dose of
                             chlorodyne
                            trade mark
discovered and named by dr j collis browne mrcsl exarmy
medical staff
the question asked by invalids families and households is what is the
best medicine to give in the above diseases and what to have always
ready medical testimony the reply of thousands of sufferers and
invalids is confirmatory of the invaluable relief afforded by this
remedy above all others
chlorodyne is a liquid taken in drops according to age it invariably
relieves pain of whatever kind creates a calm refreshing sleep allays
irritation of the nervous system when all other remedies fail leaving
no bad effects like opium or laudanum and can be taken when none other
can be tolerated its value in saving life in infancy is not easily
estimated a few drops will subdue the irritation of teething prevent
and arrest convulsions cure whooping cough spasms and flatus at once
among invalids it allays the pain of neuralgia rheumatism gout etc
it soothes the weary achings of consumption relieves the soreness of
the chest cough and expectoration and cures all chest affections
such as asthma bronchitis palpitation etc it checks diarrhoea
alvine discharges or spasms and colics of the intestines etc
the extensive demand for this remedy known as dr j collis brownes
chlorodyne by the medical profession hospitals dispensariescivil
military and navaland families especially guarantees that this
statement of its extreme importance and value is a bona fide one and
worthy the attention of all
extracts of medical opinions
from w vesalius pettigrew mdi have no hesitation in stating that
i have never met with any medicine so efficacious as an antispasmodic
and sedative i have used it in consumption asthma diarrhoea and
other diseases and am most perfectly satisfied with the results
from dr mmilman of new galloway scotlandi consider it the most
valuable medicine known
g hayward esq surgeon stowonyewoldi am now using dr j
collis brownes chlorodyne with marvellous good effects in allaying
inveterate sickness in pregnancy
dr mgrigor croft late army staff saysit is a most valuable
medicine
j c baker esq md bidefordit is without doubt the most
valuable and certain anodyne we have
dr gibbon army medical staff calcuttatwo doses completely cured
me of diarrhoea
from g v ridout esq surgeon eghamas an astringent in severe
diarrhoea and an antispasmodic in colic with cramps in the abdomen
the relief is instantaneous as a sedative in neuralgia and ticdoloreux
its effects were very remarkable in uterine affections i have found it
extremely valuable
cautionbeware of spurious compounds or imitations of chlorodyne

brown  polsons
patent corn flour
being first of the kind manufactured in the united kingdom and france
it is in both countries not only
the original
but is indisputably the only article of the kind which by its own
merit and the simple publicity of its uses has been adopted by the
best families as an invariable table delicacy it is prepared by a
process to which long experience has given the greatest perfection and
from grain carefully selected from the choicest european crops these
advantages are so appreciable that its quality has by comparison been
preferred to all others and
the lancet
in a notice given july 24 1858 states this is superior to anything
of the kind knownan opinion indisputably confirmed by scientific
tests and public appreciation
the illustrated london news
and
the leisure hour
have given most interesting notices accompanied by engravings
explanatory of the process of manufacture and dr lankester frs
