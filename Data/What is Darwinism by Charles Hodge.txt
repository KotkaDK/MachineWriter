what is darwinism
this is a question which needs an answer great confusion and diversity
of opinion prevail as to the real views of the man whose writings have
agitated the whole world scientific and religious if a man says he is
a darwinian many understand him to avow himself virtually an atheist
while another understands him as saying that he adopts some harmless
form of the doctrine of evolution this is a great evil
it is obviously useless to discuss any theory until we are agreed as to
what that theory is the question therefore what is darwinism must
take precedence of all discussion of its merits
the great fact of experience is that the universe exists the great
problem which has ever pressed upon the human mind is to account for its
existence what was its origin to what causes are the changes we
witness around us to be referred as we are a part of the universe
these questions concern ourselves what are the origin nature and
destiny of man professor huxley is right in saying the question of
questions for mankindthe problem which underlies all others and is
more interesting than any otheris the ascertainment of the place which
man occupies in nature and of his relation to the universe of things
whence our race has come what are the limits of our power over nature
and of natures power over us to what goal are we tending are the
problems which present themselves anew and with undiminished interest to
every man born into the world1 mr darwin undertakes to answer these
questions he proposes a solution of the problem which thus deeply
concerns every living man darwinism is therefore a theory of the
universe at least so far as the living organisms on this earth are
concerned this being the case it may be well to state in few words
the other prevalent theories on this great subject that the points of
agreement and of difference between them and the views of mr darwin may
be the more clearly seen
the scriptural solution of the problem of the universe
that solution is stated in words equally simple and sublime in the
beginning god created the heavens and the earth we have here first
the idea of god the word god has in the bible a definite meaning it
does not stand for an abstraction for mere force for law or ordered
sequence god is a spirit and as we are spirits we know from
consciousness that god is 1 a substance 2 that he is a person
and therefore a selfconscious intelligent voluntary agent he can
say i we can address him as thou we can speak of him as he or him
this idea of god pervades the scriptures it lies at the foundation of
natural religion it is involved in our religious consciousness it
enters essentially into our sense of moral obligation it is inscribed
ineffaceably in letters more or less legible on the heart of every
human being the man who is trying to be an atheist is trying to free
himself from the laws of his being he might as well try to free himself
from liability to hunger or thirst
the god of the bible then is a spirit infinite eternal and
unchangeable in his being wisdom power holiness goodness and truth
as every theory must begin with some postulate this is the grand
postulate with which the bible begins this is the first point
the second point concerns the origin of the universe it is not eternal
either as to matter or form it is not independent of god it is not an
evolution of his being or his existence form he is extramundane as
well as antemundane the universe owes its existence to his will
thirdly as to the nature of the universe it is not a mere phenomenon
it is an entity having real objective existence or actuality this
implies that matter is a substance endowed with certain properties in
virtue of which it is capable of acting and of being acted upon these
properties being uniform and constant are physical laws to which as
their proximate causes all the phenomena of nature are to be referred
fourthly although god is extramundane he is nevertheless everywhere
present that presence is not only a presence of essence but also of
knowledge and power he upholds all things he controls all physical
causes working through them with them and without them as he sees
fit as we in our limited spheres can use physical causes to
accomplish our purposes so god everywhere and always coperates with
them to accomplish his infinitely wise and merciful designs
fifthly man a part of the universe is according to the scriptures as
concerns his body of the earth so far he belongs to the animal
kingdom as to his soul he is a child of god who is declared to be the
father of the spirits of all men god is a spirit and we are spirits
we are therefore of the same nature with god we are godlike so that
in knowing ourselves we know god no man conscious of his manhood can be
ignorant of his relationship to god as his father
the truth of this theory of the universe rests in the first place so
far as it has been correctly stated on the infallible authority of the
word of god in the second place it is a satisfactory solution of the
problem to be solved1 it accounts for the origin of the universe
2 it accounts for all the universe contains and gives a satisfactory
explanation of the marvellous contrivances which abound in living
organisms of the adaptations of these organisms to conditions external
to themselves and for those provisions for the future which on any
other assumption are utterly inexplicable 3 it is in conflict with
no truth of reason and with no fact of experience2 4 the
scriptural doctrine accounts for the spiritual nature of man and meets
all his spiritual necessities it gives him an object of adoration
love and confidence it reveals the being on whom his indestructible
sense of responsibility terminates the truth of this doctrine
therefore rests not only on the authority of the scriptures but on the
very constitution of our nature the bible has little charity for those
who reject it it pronounces them to be either derationalized or
demoralized or both

2 the two facts which are commonly urged as inconsistent with theism
are the existence of misery in the world and the occurrence of
undeveloped or useless organs as teeth in the jaws of the whale and
mamm on the breast of a man as to the former objection sin which is
the only real evil is accounted for by the voluntary apostasy of man
and as to undeveloped organs they are regarded as evidences of the great
plan of structure which can be traced in the different orders of
animals these unused organs weresays professor joseph le conte in
his interesting volume on religion and science new york 1874 p
54regarded as blunders in nature until it was discovered that use is
not the only end of design by further patient study of nature he
says came the recognition of another law beside usea law of order
underlying and conditioning the law of use organisms are indeed
contrived for use but according to a preordained plan of structure
which must not be violated it is of little moment whether this
explanation be considered satisfactory or not it would certainly be
irrational to refuse to believe that the eye was made for the purpose of
vision because we cannot tell why a man has mamm a man might as well
refuse to admit that there is any meaning in all the writings of plato
because there is a sentence in them which he cannot understand
the pantheistic theory
this has been one of the most widely diffused and persistent forms of
human thought on this whole subject it has been for thousands of years
not only the philosophy but the religion of india and to a great
extent of china it underlies all the forms of greek philosophy it
crept into the church concealed under the disguise of scriptural
terminology in the form of neoplatonism it was constantly reappearing
during the middle ages sometimes in a philosophical and sometimes a
mystical form it was revived by spinoza in the seventeenth century and
subsequently became dominant in the philosophy and literature of europe
it is coming up again some distinguished naturalists are swinging round
from one pole to the opposite from saying there is no god to teaching
that everything is god sometimes one and the same book in one half
teaches materialism in the other half idealism the one affirming that
everything is matter the other that matter is nothing but that
everything is mind and mind is god
the leading principles of the pantheistic theory are1 that there
is an infinite and absolute being of this being nothing can be affirmed
but actuality it is denied that it is conscious intelligent or
voluntary 2 it is subject to the blind necessity of selfevolution
or development 3 this development being necessary is constant from
everlasting to everlasting according to the braminical doctrine
indeed there are successive cycles of activity and repose each cycle
being measured by countless milliards of centuries according to the
moderns selfevolution being necessary there can be no repose so that
ohne welt kein gott 4 the finite is therefore the existence form
of the infinite all that is in the latter for the time being is in the
former all that is possible is actual 5 the finite is the infinite
or to use theistic language the world is god in the sense that all
the world is and contains is the form in which god at each successive
moment exists there is no power save only the power manifested in
the world no consciousness intelligence or voluntary activity but in
finite things and the aggregate of these is the power consciousness
intelligence and activity of god what we call sin is as much a form of
gods activity as what we call virtue in other words there is no such
thing as free agency in man no such thing as sin or responsibility
when a man dies he sinks into the abyss of being as a drop of water is
lost in the ocean 6 man is the highest form of gods existence god
is incarnate in the human race strauss says that what the church
teaches of christ is not true of any individual man but is true of
mankind or as feuerbach more concisely expresses it man alone is our
god the blasphemy of some of the german philosophers on this subject
is simply unutterable in india we see the practical operation of this
system when it takes hold on the people there the personification of
the infinite as evil the goddess kala is the most popular object of
worship
epicurean theory
epicurus assumed the existence of matter force and motionstoff und
kraft he held that all space was filled with molecules of matter in a
state of rapid motion in every direction these molecules were subject
to gravity and endowed with properties or forces one combination of
molecules gave rise to unorganized matter another to life another to
mind and from the various combinations guided by unintelligent
physical laws all the wonderful organisms of plants and animals have
arisen to these combinations also all the phenomena of life instinct
and intelligence in the world are to be referred this theory has been
adopted in our day by a large class of scientific men especially in
germany the modern advocates of the theory are immeasurably superior to
the ancient epicureans in their knowledge of astronomy botany zology
and biology but in their theory of the universe and in their mode of
accounting for all the phenomena of life and intelligence they are
precisely on the same level they have not added an idea to the system
which has ever been regarded as the opprobrium of human thought
bchner moleschott vogt hold that matter is eternal and
indestructible that matter and force are inseparable the one cannot
exist without the other what it is asked is motion without something
moving what is electricity without an electrified body what is
attraction without molecules attracting each other what is
contractibility without muscular fibre or secretion without a secreting
gland one combination of molecules exhibits the phenomena of life
another combination exhibits the phenomena of mind all this was taught
by the old heathen philosopher more than two thousand years ago that
this system denies the existence of god of mind as a thinking substance
distinct from matter and of the possibility of the conscious existence
of man after death are not inferences drawn by opponents but
conclusions openly avowed by its advocates
herbert spencers new philosophy
mr darwin calls spencer our great philosopher his is the speculating
mind of the new school of science this gives to his opinions special
interest although no one but himself is to be held responsible for his
peculiar views except so far as others see fit to avow them mr
spencer postulates neither mind nor matter he begins with force force
however is itself perfectly inscrutable all we know about it is that
it is that it is indestructible and that it is persistent
as to the origin of the universe he says there are three possible
suppositions 1st that it is selfexistent 2d that it is
selfcreated 3d that it is created by an external agency3 all these
he examines and rejects the first is equivalent to atheism by which
spencer understands the doctrine which makes space matter and force
eternal and the causes of all phenomena this he says assumes the idea
of selfexistence which is unthinkable the second theory he makes
equivalent to pantheism the precipitation of vapor he says into
cloud aids us in forming a symbolic conception of a selfevolved
universe but he adds really to conceive selfcreation is to
conceive potential existence passing into actual existence by some
inherent necessity which we cannot do p 32 the theistic theory
he says is equally untenable whoever agrees that the atheistic
hypothesis is untenable because it involves the impossible idea of
selfexistence must perforce admit that the theistic hypothesis is
untenable if it contains the same impossible idea p 38 the origin
of the universe is therefore a fact which cannot be explained it must
have had a cause and all we know is that its cause is unknowable and
inscrutable
when we turn to nature the result is the same everything is
inscrutable all we know is that there are certain appearances and that
where there is appearance there must be something that appears but what
that something is what is the noumenon which underlies the phenomenon
it is impossible for us to know in nature we find two orders of
phenomena or appearances the one objective or external the other
subjective in our consciousness there are an ego and a nonego a
subject and object these are not identical it is he says
rigorously impossible to conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only without at the same time conceiving a reality of which
they are appearances for appearance without reality is unthinkable
p 88 so far we can go there is a reality which is the cause of
phenomena further than that in that direction our ignorance is
profound he proves that space cannot be an entity an attribute or a
category of thought or a nonentity the same is true of time of
motion of matter of electricity light magnetism etc etc they all
resolve themselves into appearances produced by an unknown cause
as the question what is matter is a crucial one he dwells upon it in
various parts of his writings newtons theory of ultimate atoms
leibnitzs doctrine of monads and the dynamic theory of boscovich
which makes matter mere centres of force are all dismissed as
unthinkable it is not very clear in what sense that word is to be
taken sometimes it seems to mean meaningless at others
selfcontradictory or absurd at others inconceivable i e that of
which no conception or mental image can be formed at any rate it
implies what is unknowable and untenable the result is so far as
matter is concerned that we know nothing about it our conception of
matter he says reduced to its simplest shape is that of coexistent
positions that offer resistance as contrasted with our conception of
space in which the coexistent positions offer no resistance p 166
resistance however is a form of force and therefore on the
following page spencer says that forces standing in certain
correlations form the whole contents of our idea of matter
when we turn from the objective to the subjective from the external to
the inward world the result is still the same he agrees with hume in
saying that the contents of our consciousness is a series of impressions
and ideas he dissents however from that philosopher in saying that
that series is all we know he admits that impressions necessarily imply
that there is something that is impressed he starts the question what
is it that thinks and answers we do not know p 63 he admits that
the reality of individual personal minds the conviction of personal
existence is universal and perhaps indestructible nevertheless that
conviction cannot justify itself at the bar of reason nay reason is
found to reject it p 65 dean mansel says that consciousness gives
us a knowledge of self as a substance and not merely of its varying
states this however he says is absolutely negatived by the laws of
thought the fundamental condition to all consciousness emphatically
insisted upon by mr mansel in common with sir william hamilton and
others is the antithesis of subject and object what is the
corollary from this doctrine as bearing on the consciousness of self
the mental act in which self is known implies like every other mental
act a perceiving subject and a perceived object if then the object
perceived is self what is the subject that perceives or if it is the
true self which thinks what other self can it be that is thought of
clearly a true cognition of self implies a state in which the knowing
and the known are onein which subject and object are identified and
this mr mansel rightly holds to be the annihilation of both so that
the personality of which each is conscious and of which the existence
is to each a fact beyond all others the most certain is yet a thing
which cannot be known at all knowledge of it is forbidden by the very
nature of human thought pp 65 66
mr spencer does not seem to expect that any man will be shaken in his
conviction by any such argument as that when a man is conscious of
pain he is not to be puzzled by telling him that the pain is one thing
the object perceived and the self another thing the perceiving
subject he knows that the pain is a state of the self of which he is
conscious consciousness is a form of knowledge but knowledge of
necessity supposes an intelligent reality which knows a philosophy
which cannot be received until men cease to believe in their own
existence must be in extremis
mr spencers conclusion is that the universenature or the external
world with all its marvels and perpetual changesthe world of
consciousness with its ever varying states are impressions or
phenomena due to an inscrutable persistent force
as to the nature of this primal force or power he quotes abundantly and
approvingly from sir william hamilton and mr mansel to prove that it
is unknowable inconceivable unthinkable he however differs from
those distinguished writers in two points while admitting that we know
no more of the first cause than we do of a geometrical figure which is
at once a circle and a square yet we do know that it is actual for
this conviction we are not dependent on faith in the second place
hamilton and mansel taught that we know that the infinite cannot be a
person selfconscious intelligent and voluntary yet we are forced
by our moral constitution to believe it to be an intelligent person
this mr spencer denies let those he says who can believe that
there is eternal war between our intellectual faculties and our moral
obligations i for one admit of no such radical vice in the
constitution of things p 108 religion has always erred he
asserts in that while it teaches that the infinite being cannot be
known it insists on ascribing to it such and such attributes which of
course assumes that so far forth it is known we have no right he
contends to ascribe personality to the unknown reality or anything
else except that it is the cause of all that we perceive or experience
there may be a mode of being as much transcending intelligence and
will as these transcend mechanical motion to show the folly of
referring to the unknown the attributes of our own spirits he makes
the grotesque supposition that the tickings and other movements of a
watch constituted a kind of consciousness and that a watch possessed of
such a consciousness insisted on regarding the watchmakers actions as
determined like its own by springs and escapements p 111 the vast
majority of men instead of agreeing with mr spencer in this matter
will doubtless heartily each for himself join the german philosopher
jacobi in saying i confess to anthropomorphism inseparable from the
conviction that man bears the image of god and maintain that besides
this anthropomorphism which has always been called theism is nothing
but atheism or fetichism4
mr spencer therefore in accounting for the origin of the universe and
all its phenomena physical vital and mental rejects theism or the
doctrine of a personal god who is extramundane as well as antemundane
the creator and governor of all things he rejects pantheism which
makes the finite the existenceform of the infinite he rejects atheism
which he understands to be the doctrine of the eternity and
selfexistence of matter and force he contents himself with saying we
must acknowledge the reality of an unknown something which is the cause
of all thingsthe noumenon of all phenomena if science and religion
are to be reconciled the basis of the reconciliation must be this
deepest widest and most certain of all factsthat the power which
the universe manifests is utterly inscrutable p 46 the ultimate
of ultimates is force matter and motion as we know them are
differently conditioned manifestations of force if to use an
algebraic illustration we represent matter motion and force by the
symbols x y z then we may ascertain the values of x and y
in terms of z but the value of z can never be found z is the
unknown quantity which must forever remain unknown for the obvious
reason that there is nothing in which its value can be expressed pp
169 170
we have then no god but force atheist is everywhere regarded as a
term of reproach every man instinctively recoils from it even the
philosophers of the time of the french revolution repudiated the charge
of atheism because they believed in motion and motion being
inscrutable they believed in an inscrutable something i e in
force we doubt not mr spencer would indignantly reject the imputation
of atheism nevertheless in the judgment of most men the difference
between antitheist and atheist is a mere matter of orthography

hylozoic theory
this theory assumes the universe to be eternal there is nothing extra
or antemundane there is but one substance and that substance is
matter matter however has an active and passive principle life and
rationality are among its attributes or functions the universe
therefore is a living whole pervaded by a principle not only of life
but of intelligence this hylozoic doctrine some modern scientific men
as professor tyndall seem inclined to adopt they tell us that matter
is not the dead and degraded thing it is commonly regarded it is active
and transcendental what that means we do not know the word
transcendental is like a parabola in that there is no knowing where its
meaning ends to say that matter is transcendental is saying there is
no telling what it is up to this habit of using words which have no
definite meaning is very convenient to writers but very much the
reverse for readers some of the ancient stoics distinguished between
the active and passive principles in the world calling the one mind
the other matter these however were as intimately united as matter and
life in a plant or animal
theism in unscriptural forms
there are men who are constrained to admit the being of god who depart
from the scriptural doctrine as to his relation to the world according
to some god created matter and endowed it with certain properties and
then left it to itself to work out without any interference or control
on his part all possible results according to others he created not
only matter but life or living germs one or more from which without
any divine intervention all living organisms have been developed
others again refer not only matter and life but mind also to the act
of the creator but with creation his agency ceases he has no more to
do with the world than a shipbuilder has with the ship he has
constructed when it is launched and far off upon the ocean according
to all these views a creator is a mere deus ex machina an assumption
to account for the origin of the universe
another general view of gods relation to the world goes to the opposite
extreme instead of god doing nothing he does everything second causes
have no efficiency the laws of nature are said to be the uniform modes
of divine operation gravitation does not flow from the nature of
matter but is a mode of gods uniform efficiency what are called
chemical affinities are not due to anything in different kinds of
matter but god always acts in one way in connection with an acid and
in another way in connection with an alkali if a man places a particle
of salt or sugar on his tongue the sensation which he experiences is
not to be referred to the salt or sugar but to gods agency when this
theory is extended as it generally is by its advocates from the
external to the internal world the universe of matter and mind with
all their phenomena is a constant effect of the omnipresent activity of
god the minds of some men as remarked above are so constituted that
they can pass from the theory that god does nothing to the doctrine
that he does everything without seeing the difference mr russel
wallace the companion and peer of mr darwin devotes a large part of
his book on natural selection to prove that the organs of plants and
animals are formed by blind physical causes toward the close of the
volume he teaches that there are no such causes he asks the question
what is matter and answers nothing we know he says nothing but
force and as the only force of which we have any immediate knowledge
is mindforce the inference is that the whole universe is not merely
dependent on but actually is the will of higher intelligences or of
one supreme intelligence5 this is a transition from virtual
materialism to idealistic pantheism the effect of this admission on the
part of mr wallace on the theory of natural selection is what an
explosion of its boiler would be to a steamer in midocean which should
blow out its deck sides and bottom nothing would remain above water
the duke of argyll seems at times inclined to lapse into the same
doctrine science he says in the modern doctrine of conservation of
energy and the convertibility of forces is already getting a firm hold
of the idea that all kinds of force are but forms of manifestations of
one central force issuing from some one fountainhead of power sir john
herschel has not hesitated to say that it is but reasonable to regard
the force of gravitation as the direct or indirect result of a
consciousness or will existing somewhere and even if we cannot
certainly identify force in all its forms with the direct energies of
the one omnipresent and allpervading will it is at least in the
highest degree unphilosophical to assert the contraryto think or to
speak as if the forces of nature were either independent of or even
separate from the creators power6 the duke however in the general
tenor of his book does not differ from the common doctrine except in
one point he does not deny the efficiency of physical causes or
resolve them all into the efficiency of god but he teaches that god in
this world at least never acts except through those causes he applies
this doctrine even to miracles which he regards as effects produced by
second causes of which we are ignorant that is by some higher law of
nature the scriptures however teach that god is not thus bound that
he operates through second causes with them or without them as he
sees fit it is a purely arbitrary assumption that when christ raised
the dead healed the lepers or gave sight to the blind any second
cause intervened between the effect and the efficiency of his will what
physical law or uniformly acting force operated to make the axe float
at the command of the prophet or in that greatest of all miracles
the original creation of the world

mr darwins theory
we have not forgotten mr darwin it seemed desirable in order to
understand his theory to see its relation to other theories of the
universe and its phenomena with which it is more or less connected his
work on the origin of species does not purport to be philosophical in
this aspect it is very different from the cognate works of mr spencer
darwin does not speculate on the origin of the universe on the nature
of matter or of force he is simply a naturalist a careful and
laborious observer skillful in his descriptions and singularly candid
in dealing with the difficulties in the way of his peculiar doctrine he
set before himself a single problem namely how are the fauna and flora
of our earth to be accounted for in the solution of this problem he
assumes
1 the existence of matter although he says little on the subject its
existence however as a real entity is everywhere taken for granted
2 he assumes the efficiency of physical causes showing no disposition
to resolve them into mindforce or into the efficiency of the first
cause
3 he assumes also the existence of life in the form of one or more
primordial germs he does not adopt the theory of spontaneous
generation what life is he does not attempt to explain further than to
quote p 326 with approbation the definition of herbert spencer who
says life depends on or consists in the incessant action and
reaction of various forceswhich conveys no very definite idea
4 to account for the existence of matter and life mr darwin admits a
creator this is done explicitly and repeatedly nothing however is
said of the nature of the creator and of his relation to the world
further than is implied in the meaning of the word
5 from the primordial germ or germs mr darwin seems to have settled
down to the assumption of only one primordial germ all living
organisms vegetable and animal including man on our globe through
all the stages of its history have descended
6 as growth organization and reproduction are the functions of
physical life as soon as the primordial germ began to live it began
to grow to fashion organs however simple for its nourishment and
increase and for the reproduction in some way of living forms like
itself how all living things on earth including the endless variety of
plants and all the diversity of animalsinsects fishes birds the
ichthyosaurus the mastodon the mammoth and manhave descended from
the primordial animalcule he thinks may be accounted for by the
operation of the following natural laws viz
first the law of heredity or that by which like begets like the
offspring are like the parent
second the law of variation that is while the offspring are in all
essential characteristics like their immediate progenitor they
nevertheless vary more or less within narrow limits from their parent
and from each other some of these variations are indifferent some
deteriorations some improvements that is they are such as enable the
plant or animal to exercise its functions to greater advantage
third the law of over production all plants and animals tend to
increase in a geometrical ratio and therefore tend to overrun
enormously the means of support if all the seeds of a plant all the
spawn of a fish were to arrive at maturity in a very short time the
world could not contain them hence of necessity arises a struggle for
life only a few of the myriads born can possibly live
fourth here comes in the law of natural selection or the survival of
the fittest that is if any individual of a given species of plant or
animal happens to have a slight deviation from the normal type
favorable to its success in the struggle for life it will survive this
variation by the law of heredity will be transmitted to its offspring
and by them again to theirs soon these favored ones gain the
ascendency and the less favored perish and the modification becomes
established in the species after a time another and another of such
favorable variations occur with like results thus very gradually
great changes of structure are introduced and not only species but
genera families and orders in the vegetable and animal world are
produced mr darwin says he can set no limit to the changes of
structure habits instincts and intelligence which these simple laws
in the course of millions or milliards of centuries may bring into
existence he says we cannot comprehend what the figures 60000000
really imply and during this or perhaps a longer roll of years the
land and waters have everywhere teemed with living creatures all
exposed to the struggle for life and undergoing change p 354 mr
croll he tells us estimates that about sixty millions of years have
elapsed since the cambrian period but this judging from the small
amount of organic change since the commencement of the glacial period
seems a very short time for the many and the great mutations of life
which have certainly occurred since the cambrian formation and the
previous one hundred and forty million years can hardly be considered as
sufficient for the development of the varied forms of life which
certainly existed toward the close of the cambrian period p 379
years in this connection have no meaning we might as well try to give
the distance of the fixed stars in inches as astronomers are obliged to
take the diameter of the earths orbit as the unit of space so
darwinians are obliged to take a geological cycle as their unit of
duration
natural selection
as natural selection which works so slowly is a main element in mr
darwins theory it is necessary to understand distinctly what he means
by it on this point he leaves us no room for doubt on p 92 he says
this preservation of favorable variations and the destruction of
injurious variations i call natural selection or the survival of the
fittest owing to the struggle for life variations however slight
and from whatever cause proceeding if they be in any degree profitable
to the individuals of a species in their infinitely complex relations
to other organic beings and to their physical conditions of life will
tend to the preservation of such individuals and will generally be
inherited by their offspring the offspring also will thus have a better
chance of surviving for of the many individuals of any species which
are periodically born but a small number can survive i have called
this principle by which each slight variation if useful is preserved
by the term natural selection in order to mark its relation to mans
power of selection but the expression often used by mr herbert spencer
of the survival of the fittest is more accurate and sometimes is
equally convenient p 72 slow though the progress of selection may
be if feeble man can do so much by artificial selection i can see no
limit to the amount of change to the beauty and infinite complexity of
the coadaptations between all organic beings one with another and
with their physical conditions of life which may be effected in the
long course of time by natures power of selection or the survival of
the fittest p 125 it may be objected that if organic beings thus
tend to rise in the scale how is it that throughout the world a
multitude of the lowest forms still exist and how is it that in each
great class some forms are far more highly developed than others on
our theory the continuous existence of lowly forms offers no difficulty
for natural selection or the survival of the fittest does not
necessarily include progressive development it only takes advantage of
such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under its
complex relations of life geology tells us that some of the lowest
forms the infusoria and rhizopods have remained for an enormous period
in nearly their present state p 145 the fact of little or no
modification having been effected since the glacial period would be of
some avail against those who believe in an innate and necessary law of
development but is powerless against the doctrine of natural selection
or the survival of the fittest which implies only that variations or
individual differences of a favorable nature occasionally arise in a few
species and are then preserved p 149
this process of improvement under the law of natural selection includes
not only changes in the organic structure of animals but also in their
instincts and intelligence on entering on this part of his subject mr
darwin says i would premise that i have nothing to do with the origin
of the primary mental powers any more than i have with that of life
itself we are concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of
other mental qualities within the same class p 255 he shows that
even in a state of nature the instincts of animals of the same species
do in some degree vary and that they are transmitted by inheritance a
mastiff has imparted courage to a greyhound and a greyhound has
transmitted to a shepherddog a disposition to hunt hares among
sporting dogs the young of the pointer or retriever have been known to
point or to retrieve without instruction if he says it can be
shown that instincts do vary ever so little then i can see no
difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating
variations of instinct to any extent that was profitable it is thus as
i believe that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have
arisen p 257 he was rather unguarded in saying that he saw no
difficulty in accounting for the most wonderful instincts of animals he
admits that he has found very great difficulty he selects three cases
which he found it specially hard to deal with that of the cuckoo that
of the cellbuilding bee and of the slavemaking ant he devotes much
space and labor in endeavoring to show how the instinct of the bee for
example in the construction of its cell might have been gradually
acquired it is clear however that he was not able fully to satisfy
even his own mind for he admits that it will be thought that i have an
overweening confidence in the principle of natural selection when i do
not admit that such wonderful and well established facts do not
annihilate the theory p 290 this remark was made with special
reference to the instincts of the ant which he finds very hard to
account for he adds no doubt many instincts of very difficult
explanation could be opposed to the theory of natural selection cases
in which we cannot see how an instinct could possibly have originated
cases in which no intermediate gradations are known to exist cases of
instinct of such trifling importance that they could hardly have been
acted upon by natural selection cases of instincts almost identically
the same in animals so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot
account for their similarity by inheritance from a common progenitor
and consequently cannot believe that they were independently acquired
through natural selection i will not here enter on those cases but
will confine myself to one special difficulty which at first appeared to
me insuperable and actually fatal to the whole theory i allude to
neuters or sterile females in insect communities for these neuters
often differ widely in instinct and structure from both the males and
the fertile females and yet from being sterile they cannot propagate
their kind p 289 he is candid enough to say in conclusion i do
not pretend that the facts given in this chapter on instinct
strengthen in any great degree my theory but none of the cases of
difficulty to the best of my judgment annihilate it p 297 when it
is remembered that his theory is that slight variations occurring in an
individual advantageous to it not to its associates in the struggle
for life is perpetuated by inheritance it is no wonder that the case
of sterile ants gave him so much trouble accidental sterility is not
favorable to the individual and its being made permanent by
inheritance is out of the question for the sterile have no
descendants yet these sterile females are not degenerations they are
in general larger and more robust than their associates
we have thus seen that according to mr darwin all the infinite
variety of structure in plants and animals is due to the law of natural
selection on the principle of natural selection with divergence of
character he says it does not seem incredible that from some such
low and intermediate form both animals and plants have been developed
and if we admit this we must likewise admit that all the organized
beings which have ever lived on this earth may be descended from some
one primordial form p 573 we have seen also that he does not
confine his theory to organic structure but applies it to all the
instincts and all the forms of intelligence manifested by irrational
creatures nor does he stop there he includes man within the sweep of
the same law in the distant future i see open fields for far more
important researches psychology will be based on a new foundation that
of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by
gradation light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history
p 577
the distant future was near at hand in his introduction to his work
on the descent of man he says he had determined not to publish on
that subject as i thought that i should thus only add to the
prejudices against my views it seemed to me sufficient to indicate in
the first edition of my origin of species that by this work light
would be thrown on the origin of man and his history and this implies
that man must be included with other organic beings in any general
conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth now the
case wears a wholly different aspect when a naturalist like carl vogt
we shall see in what follows what kind of a witness he is ventures to
say in his address as president of the national institution of geneva
1869 personne en europe au moins nose plus soutenir la cration
indpendante et de toutes pices des espcesit is manifest that at
least a large number of naturalists must admit that species are the
modified descendants of other species and this especially holds good of
the younger and rising naturalists of the older and honored chiefs
in natural science many unfortunately are still opposed to evolution in
every form carl vogt would not write thus to him no man is honored
who does agree with him and any man who believes in god he execrates
in 1871 mr darwin ventured on the publication of his descent of man
in that work he endeavors to show that the proximate progenitor of man
is the ape he says there is less difference of structure between the
two than between the higher and lower forms of apes themselves not
only so but he attempts to show that the mental faculties of man are
derived by slight variations long continued from the measure of
intellect possessed by lower animals he even says that there is less
difference in intelligence between man and the higher mammals than
there is between the intelligence of the ant and that of the coccus
insects of the same class7
in like manner he teaches that mans moral nature has been evolved by
slow degrees from the social instincts common to many animals pp 68
94 the moral element thus derived he admits might lead to very
different lines of conduct if men he says were reared under the
same conditions as hivesbees there can hardly be a doubt that our
unmarried females would like the workerbees think it a sacred duty to
kill all their brothers and mothers would strive to kill their fertile
daughters and no one would think of interfering vol i p 70
lower animals especially the dog manifest love reverence fidelity
and obedience and it is from these elements that the religious
sentiment in man has been slowly evolved by a process of natural
selection vol i p 65
the grand conclusion is man body soul and spirit is descended from
a hairy quadruped furnished with a tail and pointed ears probably
arboreal in its habits and an inhabitant of the old world vol ii
p 372 mr darwin adds he who denounces these views as irreligious
is bound to explain why it is more irreligious to explain the origin of
man as a distinct species by descent from some lower form through the
laws of variation and natural selection than to explain the birth of
the individual through the laws of ordinary reproduction vol ii p
378

the sense in which mr darwin uses the word natural
we have not yet reached the heart of mr darwins theory the main idea
of his system lies in the word natural he uses that word in two
senses first as antithetical to the word artificial men can produce
very marked varieties as to structure and habits of animals this is
exemplified in the production of the different breeds of horses cattle
sheep and dogs and specially as mr darwin seems to think in the
case of pigeons of these he says the diversity of breeds is
something astonishing some have long and some very short bills some
have large feet some small some long necks others long wings and
tails while others have singularly short tails some have thirty and
even forty tailfeathers instead of the normal number of twelve or
fourteen they differ as much in instinct as they do in form some are
carriers some pouters some tumblers some trumpeters and yet all are
descendants of the rock pigeon which is still extant if then he
argues man in a comparatively short time has by artificial selection
produced all these varieties what might be accomplished on the
boundless scale of nature during the measureless ages of the geologic
periods
secondly he uses the word natural as antithetical to supernatural
natural selection is a selection made by natural laws working without
intention and design it is therefore opposed not only to artificial
selection which is made by the wisdom and skill of man to accomplish a
given purpose but also to supernatural selection which means either a
selection originally intended by a power higher than nature or which is
carried out by such power in using the expression natural selection
mr darwin intends to exclude design or final causes all the changes
in structure instinct or intelligence in the plants or animals
including man descended from the primordial germ or animalcule have
been brought about by unintelligent physical causes on this point he
leaves us in no doubt he defines nature to be the aggregate action and
product of natural laws and laws are the sequence of events as
ascertained by us it had been objected that he often uses teleological
language speaking of purpose intention contrivance adaptation etc
in answer to this objection he says it has been said that i speak of
natural selection as a power or deity but who objects to an author
speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the
planet he admits that in the literal sense of the words natural
selection is a false term but who ever objected to chemists speaking
of the elective affinities of various elementsand yet an acid cannot
strictly be said to elect the base with which it in preference
combines p 93 we have here an affirmation and a negation it is
affirmed that natural selection is the operation of natural laws
analogous to the action of gravitation and of chemical affinities it is
denied that it is a process originally designed or guided by
intelligence such as the activity which foresees an end and consciously
selects and controls the means of its accomplishment artificial
selection then is an intelligent process natural selection is not
there are in the animal and vegetable worlds innumerable instances of at
least apparent contrivance which have excited the admiration of men in
all ages there are three ways of accounting for them the first is the
scriptural doctrine namely that god is a spirit a personal
selfconscious intelligent agent that he is infinite eternal and
unchangeable in his being and perfections that he is ever present that
this presence is a presence of knowledge and power in the external
world there is always and everywhere indisputable evidence of the
activity of two kinds of force the one physical the other mental the
physical belongs to matter and is due to the properties with which it
has been endowed the other is the everywhere present and ever acting
mind of god to the latter are to be referred all the manifestations of
design in nature and the ordering of events in providence this
doctrine does not ignore the efficiency of second causes it simply
asserts that god overrules and controls them thus the psalmist says
i am fearfully and wonderfully made my substance was not hid from
thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought or embroidered
in the lower parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet
being imperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in
continuance were fashioned when as yet there were none of them he
who fashioned the eye shall not he see he that formed the ear shall
not he hear god makes the grass to grow and herbs for the children
of men he sends rain frost and snow he controls the winds and the
waves he determines the casting of the lot the flight of an arrow and
the falling of a sparrow this universal and constant control of god is
not only one of the most patent and pervading doctrines of the bible
but it is one of the fundamental principles of even natural religion
the second method of accounting for contrivances in nature admits that
they were foreseen and purposed by god and that he endowed matter with
forces which he foresaw and intended should produce such results but
here his agency stops he never interferes to guide the operation of
physical causes he does nothing to control the course of nature or the
events of history on this theory it may be said 1 that it is
utterly inconsistent with the scriptures 2 it does not meet the
religious and moral necessities of our nature it renders prayer
irrational and inoperative it makes it vain for a man in any emergency
to look to god for help 3 it is inconsistent with obvious facts we
see around us innumerable evidences of the constant activity of mind
this evidence of mind and of its operations according to lord brougham
and dr whewell is far more clear than that of the existence of matter
and of its forces if one or the other is to be denied it is the latter
rather than the former paley indeed says that if the construction of a
watch be an undeniable evidence of design it would be a still more
wonderful manifestation of skill if a watch could be made to produce
other watches and it may be added not only other watches but all
kinds of timepieces in endless variety so it has been asked if man
can make a telescope why cannot god make a telescope which produces
others like itself this is simply asking whether matter can be made to
do the work of mind the idea involves a contradiction for a telescope
to make a telescope supposes it to select copper and zinc in due
proportions and fuse them into brass to fashion that brass into
interentering tubes to collect and combine the requisite materials for
the different kinds of glass needed to melt them grind fashion and
polish them adjust their densities and focal distances etc etc a
man who can believe that brass can do all this might as well believe in
god the most credulous men in the world are unbelievers the great
napoleon could not believe in providence but he believed in his star
and in lucky and unlucky days
this banishing god from the world is simply intolerable and blessed be
his name impossible an absent god who does nothing is to us no god
christ brings god constantly near to us he said to his disciples
consider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap which have neither
storehouse nor barn and god feedeth them how much better are ye than
the fowls and which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one
cubit consider the lilies how they grow they toil not neither do they
spin and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these if then god so clothe the grass which is
today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven how much more
will he clothe you o ye of little faith and seek ye not what ye
shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind for
all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father
knoweth that ye have need of these things it may be said that christ
did not teach science true but he taught truth and science so
called when it comes in conflict with truth is what man is when he
comes in conflict with god
the advocates of these extreme opinions protest against being considered
irreligious herbert spencer says that his doctrine of an inscrutable
unintelligent unknown force as the cause of all things is a much more
religious doctrine than that of a personal intelligent and voluntary
being of infinite power and goodness matthew arnold holds that an
unconscious power which makes for right is a higher idea of god than
the jehovah of the bible christ says god is a spirit holbach thought
that he made a great advance on that definition when he said god is
motion
the third method of accounting for the contrivances manifested in the
organs of plants and animals is that which refers them to the blind
operation of natural causes they are not due to the continued
coperation and control of the divine mind nor to the original purpose
of god in the constitution of the universe this is the doctrine of the
materialists and to this doctrine we are sorry to say mr darwin
although himself a theist has given in his adhesion it is on this
account the materialists almost deify him
from what has been said it appears that darwinism includes three
distinct elements first evolution or the assumption that all organic
forms vegetable and animal have been evolved or developed from one or
a few primordial living germs second that this evolution has been
effected by natural selection or the survival of the fittest and
third and by far the most important and only distinctive element of his
theory that this natural selection is without design being conducted
by unintelligent physical causes neither the first nor the second of
these elements constitute darwinism nor do the two combined as to the
first namely evolution mr darwin himself in the historical sketch
prefixed to the fifth edition of his origin of species says that
lamarck in 1811 and more fully in 1815 taught that all species
including man are descended from other species he refers to some six
or eight other scientists as teaching the same doctrine this idea of
evolution was prominently presented and elaborated in the vestiges of
creation first published in 1844 ulrici professor in the university
of halle germany in his work gott und die natur says that the
doctrine of evolution took no hold on the minds of scientific men but
was positively rejected by the most eminent physiologists among whom he
mentions j mller k wagner bischoff hoffmann and others8 the
rev george henslow lecturer on botany at st bartholomews hospital
london himself a pronounced evolutionist says the theories of lamarck
and of the vestiges of creation have given place to that of mr
darwin and there are not wanting many symptoms of decay in the
acceptance even of his not only has he considerably modified his views
in later editions of the origin of species distinctly expressing the
opinion that he attributed too great influence to natural selection but
even men of science owen huxleyand at least in its application to
man wallace himselfare either opposed to it in great measure or
else give it but a qualified assent thus it has been the fate of all
theories of the development of living things to lapse into oblivion
evolution itself however will stand the same9 we find in the
transactions of the victoria institute a still more decided
repudiation of darwinism on the part of mr henslow he there says i
do not believe in darwins theory and have endeavored to refute it by
showing its utter impossibility10 he defines evolution by saying
it supposes all animals and plants that exist now or have ever
existed to have been produced through laws of generation from
prexisting animals and plants respectively that affinity amongst
organic beings implies or is due to community of descent and that the
degree of affinity between organisms is in proportion to their nearness
of generation or at least to the persistence of common characters
they being the products of originally the same parentage11 a man
therefore may be an evolutionist without being a darwinian it should
be mentioned that mr henslow expressly excludes man both as to body
and soul from the law of evolution
nor is the theory of natural selection the vital principle of mr
darwins theory unless the word natural be taken in a sense
antithetical to supernatural in the historical sketch just referred to
mr darwin not only says that he had been anticipated in teaching the
doctrine of evolution by lamarck and the author of the vestiges of
creation but that the theory of natural selection as the means of
accounting for evolution was not original with him he tells us that as
early as 1813 dr w c wells distinctly recognizes the principle of
natural selection and that mr patrick matthew in 1831 gives
precisely the same view of the origin of species as that propounded by
mr wallace and myself ideas are like seed they are often cast forth
and not finding a congenial soil produce no fruit to mr darwin is
undoubtedly due the elaboration and thoroughly scientific defence of the
theory of natural selection and to him is to be referred the deep and
widespread interest which it has excited

darwinism excludes teleology
it is however neither evolution nor natural selection which give
darwinism its peculiar character and importance it is that darwin
rejects all teleology or the doctrine of final causes he denies design
in any of the organisms in the vegetable or animal world he teaches
that the eye was formed without any purpose of producing an organ of
vision
although evidence on this point has already been adduced yet as it is
often overlooked at least in this country so that many men speak
favorably of mr darwins theory who are no more darwinians than they
are mussulmans and as it is this feature of his system which brings it
into conflict not only with christianity but with the fundamental
principles of natural religion it should be clearly established the
sources of proof on this point are1st mr darwins own writings 2d
the expositions of his theory given by its advocates 3d the character
of the objections urged by its opponents
the point to be proved is that it is the distinctive doctrine of mr
darwin that species owe their origin not to the original intention of
the divine mind not to special acts of creation calling new forms into
existence at certain epochs not to the constant and everywhere
operative efficiency of god guiding physical causes in the production
of intended effects but to the gradual accumulation of unintended
variations of structure and instinct securing some advantage to their
subjects
darwins own testimony
that such is mr darwins doctrine we prove from his own writings and
the first proof from that source is found in express declarations when
an idea pervades a book and constitutes its character detached passages
constitute a very small part of the evidence of its being inculcated in
the present case however such passages are sufficient to satisfy even
those who have not had occasion to read mr darwins books in referring
to the similarity of structure in animals of the same class he says
nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity
of pattern in members of the same class by utility or the doctrine of
final causes12
on the last page of his work he says it is interesting to
contemplate a tangled bank clothed with many plants of many kinds with
birds singing on the bushes with various insects flitting about and
with worms crawling through the damp earth and to reflect that these
elaborately constructed forms so different from each other and
dependent on each other in so complex a manner have all been produced
by laws acting around us these laws taken in the largest sense being
growth with reproduction variability from the indirect and direct
action of the conditions of life and from use and disuse a ratio of
increase so high as to lead to a struggle for life and as a consequence
to natural selection entailing divergence of character and extinction
of less improved forms thus from the war of nature from famine and
death the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving the
production of the higher animals directly follows there is a grandeur
in this view of life with its several powers having been originally
breathed by the creator into a few forms or into one and that whilst
this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity
from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most
wonderful have been and are being evolved p 579
in another of his works he asks did he god ordain that crop and
tailfeathers of the pigeon should vary in order that the fancier might
make his grotesque pouter and fantail breeds did he cause the frame
and mental qualities of the dog to vary in order that a breed might be
formed of indomitable ferocity with jaws fitted to pin down the bull
for mans brutal sport but if we give up the principle in one case if
we do not admit that the variations of the primeval dog were
intentionally guided in order for instance that the greyhound that
perfect image of symmetry and vigor might be formed no shadow of
reason can be assigned for the belief that variations alike in nature
and the results of the same general laws which have been the groundwork
through natural selection of the most perfectly adapted animals in the
world man included were intentionally and specially guided however
much we may wish it we can hardly follow professor asa gray in his
belief that variations have been led along certain beneficial lines as
a stream is led along useful lines of irrigation13
variations which by their gradual accumulation give rise to new
species genera families and orders are themselves step by step
accidental mr darwin sometimes says they happen by chance sometimes
he says they happen of necessity at others he says we are profoundly
ignorant of their causes these are only different ways of saying that
they are not intentional when a man lets anything fall from his hands
and says it was accidental he does not mean that it was causeless he
only means that it was not intentional and that is precisely what
darwin means when he says that species arise out of accidental
variations his whole book is an argument against teleology the whole
question is how are we to account for the innumerable varieties kinds
and genera of plants and animals including man were they intended or
did they arise from the gradual accumulations of unintentional
variations his answer to these questions is plain on page 245 he
says nothing at first can appear more difficult to believe than that
the more complex organs and instincts have been perfected not by means
superior to though analogous with human reason but by innumerable
slight variations each good for the individual possessor
nevertheless this difficulty though appearing to our imagination14
insuperably great cannot be considered real if we admit the following
propositions namely that all parts of the organizations and instincts
offer at least individual differences that there is a struggle for
existence which leads to the preservation of profitable deviations of
structure or instinct and lastly that gradations in the state of
perfection of each organ may have existed each good of its kind he
says over and over that if beauty or any variation of structure can be
shown to be intended it would annihilate his theory his doctrine is
that such unintended variations which happen to be useful in the
struggle for life are preserved on the principle of the survival of
the fittest he urges the usual objections to teleology derived from
undeveloped or useless organs as webfeet in the upland goose and
frigatebird which never swim
what however perhaps more than anything makes clear his rejection of
design is the manner in which he deals with the complicated organs of
plants and animals why dont he say they are the product of the divine
intelligence if god made them it makes no difference so far as the
question of design is concerned how he made them whether at once or by
a process of evolution but instead of referring them to the purpose of
god he laboriously endeavors to prove that they may be accounted for
without any design or purpose whatever
to suppose he says that the eye with all its inimitable
contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances for
admitting different degrees of light and for the correction of
spherical and chromatic aberration could have been formed by natural
selection seems i freely confess absurd in the highest degree p
222 nevertheless he attempts to explain the process it is scarcely
possible he says to avoid comparing the eye with the telescope we
know that this instrument has been perfected by the long continued
efforts of the highest of human intellects and we naturally infer that
the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process but may not
this inference be presumptuous have we any right to assume that the
creator works by intellectual powers like those of man if we must
compare the eye to an optical instrument we ought in imagination to
take a thick layer of transparent tissue with spaces filled with fluid
and with a nerve sensitive to light beneath and then suppose every part
of this layer to be continually changing slowly in density so as to
separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses placed at
different distances from each other and with the surfaces of each layer
slowly changing in form further we must suppose that there is a power
represented by natural selection or the survival of the fittest always
intently watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers and
carefully preserving each which under varied circumstances tends to
produce a distinct image we must suppose each new state of the
instrument to be multiplied by the million each to be preserved until a
better is produced and the old ones to be all destroyed in living
bodies variations will cause the slight alterations generation will
multiply them almost infinitely and natural selection will pick out
with unerring skill each improvement15 p 226 let this process
he says go on for millions of years and we shall at last have a
perfect eye
it would be absurd to say anything disrespectful of such a man as mr
darwin and scarcely less absurd to indulge in any mere extravagance of
language yet we are expressing our own experience when we say that we
regard mr darwins books the best refutation of mr darwins theory he
constantly shuts us up to the alternative of believing that the eye is a
work of design or the product of the unintended action of blind physical
causes to any ordinarily constituted mind it is absolutely impossible
to believe that it is not a work of design darwin himself it is
evident dear as his theory is can hardly believe it it is
indispensable he says to arrive at a just conclusion as to the
formation of the eye that the reason should conquer the imagination
but i have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any
degree of hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to
so startling an extent p 225
it will be observed that every step in his account of the formation of
the eye is an arbitrary assumption we must first assume a thick layer
of tissue then that the tissue is transparent then that it has
cavities filled with fluid that beneath the tissue is a nerve sensitive
to light then that the fluid is constantly varying in density and
thickness that its surfaces are constantly changing their contour that
its different portions are ever shifting their relative distances that
every favorable change is seized upon and rendered permanentthus
after millions of years we may get an eye as perfect as that of an
eagle in like manner we may suppose a man to sit down to account for
the origin and contents of the bible assuming as his working
hypothesis that it is not the product of mind either human or divine
but that it was made by a typesetting machine worked by steam and
picking out type haphazard in this way in a thousand years one
sentence might be produced in another thousand a second and in ten
thousand more the two might get together in the right position thus in
the course of millions of years the bible might have been produced
with all its historical details all its elevated truths all its
devout and sublime poetry and above all with the delineation of the
character of christ the greek idea tn iden the ideal of majesty
and loveliness before which the whole world believing and unbelieving
perforce bows down in reverence and when reason has sufficiently
subdued the imagination to admit all this then by the same theory we
may account for all the books in all languages in all the libraries in
the world thus we should have darwinism applied in the sphere of
literature this is the theory which we are told is to sweep away
christianity and the church
mr darwin gives the same unsatisfactory account of the marvellous
contrivances in the vegetable world in one species of orchids the
labellum or lower lip is hollowed into a great bucket continually filled
with water secreted from two horns which stand above it when the
bucket is sufficiently filled the water flows out through a pipe or
spout on one side the bees which crowd into the flower for sake of the
nectar jostle each other so that some fall into the water and their
wings becoming wet they are unable to fly and are obliged to crawl
through the spout in doing this they come in contact with the pollen
which adhering to their backs is carried off to other flowers this
complicated contrivance by which the female plants are fertilized has
according to the theory been brought about by the slow process of
natural selection or survival of the fittest
still more wonderful is the arrangement in another species of orchids
when the bee begins to gnaw the labellum he unavoidably touches a
tapering projection which when touched transmits a vibration which
ruptures a membrane which sets free a spring by which a mass of pollen
is shot with unerring aim over the back of the bee who then departs
on his errand of fertilization
a very large class of plants are fertilized by means of insects these
flowers are beautiful not for the sake of beautyfor that mr darwin
says would annihilate his theorybut those which happen to be
beautiful attract insects and thus become fertilized and perpetuated
while the plainer ones are neglected and perish so with regard to
birds the females are generally plain because those of bright colors
are so exposed during the period of incubation that they are destroyed
by their enemies in like manner male birds are usually adorned with
brilliant plumage this is accounted for on the ground that they are
more attractive and thus they propagate their race while the plainer
ones have few or no descendants thus all design is studiously and
laboriously excluded from every department of nature
the preceding pages contain only a small part of the evidence furnished
by mr darwins own writings that his doctrine involves the denial of
all final causes the whole drift of his books is to prove that all the
organs of plants and animals all their instincts and mental endowments
may be accounted for by the blind operation of natural causes without
any intention purpose or coperation of god this is what professor
huxley and others call the creative idea to which the widespread
influence of his writings is to be referred

14 what can the word imagination mean in this sentence if it does
not mean common sense
15 mr darwins habit of personifying nature has given as his friend
mr wallace says his readers a good deal of trouble he defines nature
to be the aggregate of physical forces and in the single passage
quoted he speaks of natural selection as intently watching picking
out with unerring skill and carefully preserving it is true he
tells us this is all to be understood metaphorically
testimony of the advocates of the theory
it is time to turn to the exposition of darwinism by its avowed
advocates in proof of the assertion that it excludes all teleology
the first of these witnesses is mr alfred russel wallace himself a
distinguished naturalist mr darwin informs his readers that as early
as 1844 he had collected his material and worked out his theory but
had not published it to the world although it had been communicated to
some of his friends in 1858 he received a memoir from mr wallace who
was then studying the natural history of the malay archipelago from
that memoir he learnt that mr wallace had arrived at almost exactly
the same conclusions as i he himself have on the origin of species
this led to the publishing his book on that subject contemporaneously
with mr wallaces memoir there has been no jealousy or rivalry between
these gentlemen mr wallace gracefully acknowledges the priority of mr
darwins claim and attributes to him the credit of having elaborated
and sustained it in a way to secure for it universal attention these
facts are mentioned in order to show the competency of mr wallace as a
witness as to the true character of darwinism
mr wallace in the theory of natural selection devotes a chapter to
the consideration of the objections urged by the duke of argyll in his
work on the reign of law against that theory those objections are
principally two first that design necessarily implies an intelligent
designer and second that beauty not being an advantage to its
possessor in the struggle for life cannot be accounted for on the
principle of the survival of the fittest the duke he says maintains
that contrivance and beauty indicate the constant supervision and
interference of the creator and cannot possibly be explained by the
unassisted action of any combination of laws now mr darwins work
he adds has for its main object to show that all the phenomena of
living thingsall their wonderful organs and complicated structures
their infinite variety of form size and color their intricate and
involved relations to each othermay have been produced by the action
of a few general laws of the simplest kind laws which are in most cases
mere statements of admitted facts p 265 those laws are those with
which we are familiar heredity variations over production struggle
for life survival of the fittest it is probable he says that
these primary facts or laws are but results of the very nature of life
and of the essential properties of organized and unorganized matter mr
herbert spencer in his first principles and in his biology has i
think made us able to understand how this may be but at present we
may accept these simple laws without going further back and the
question then is whether the variety the harmony the contrivance and
the beauty we perceive can have been produced by the action of these
laws alone or whether we are required to believe in the incessant
interference and direct action of the mind and will of the creator p
26716 mr wallace says that the duke of argyll maintains that god
has personally applied general laws to produce effects which those laws
are not in themselves capable of producing that the universe alone with
all its laws intact would be a sort of chaos without variety without
harmony without design without beauty that there is not and
therefore we may presume that there could not be any selfdeveloping
power in the universe i believe on the contrary that the universe is
so constituted as to be selfregulating that as long it contains life
the forms under which that life is manifested have an inherent power of
adjustment to each other and to their surroundings and that this
adjustment necessarily leads to the greatest amount of variety and
beauty and enjoyment because it does depend on general laws and not on
a continual supervision and rearrangement of details p 268 the
strange springs and traps and pitfalls found in the flowers of orchids
cannot he says be necessary per se since exactly the same end is
gained in ten thousand other flowers which do not possess them is it
not then an extraordinary idea to imagine the creator of the universe
contriving the various complicated parts of these flowers as a mechanic
might contrive an ingenious toy or a difficult puzzle is it not a more
worthy conception that they are the results of those general laws which
were so cordinated at the first introduction of life upon the earth as
to result necessarily in the utmost possible development of varied
forms p 270 i for one he says cannot believe that the world
would come to chaos if left to law alone if any modification of
structure could be the result of law why not all if some
selfadaptations should arise why not others if any varieties of
color why not all the varieties we see no attempt is made to explain
this except by reference to the fact that purpose and contrivance
are everywhere visible and by an illogical deduction they could only
have arisen by the direct action of some mind because the direct action
of our minds produce similar contrivances but it is forgotten that
adaptation however produced must have the appearance of design p
28017 after referring to the fact that florists and breeders can
produce varieties in plants and animals so that whether they wanted a
bulldog to torture another animal a greyhound to catch a hare or a
bloodhound to hunt down their oppressed fellowcreatures the required
variations have always appeared he adds to be consistent our
opponents must maintain that every one of the variations that have
rendered possible the changes produced by man have been determined at
the right time and place by the creator every race produced by the
florist or breeder the dog or the pigeon fancier the ratcatcher the
sporting man or the slavehunter must have been provided for by
varieties occurring when wanted and as these variations were never
withheld it would prove that the sanction of an allwise and all
powerful being has been given to that which the highest human minds
consider to be trivial mean or debasing p 29018
the nebular hypothesis as propounded by la place proposed to account
for the origin of the universe by a process of evolution under the
control of mere physical forces that hypothesis has so far as
evolution is concerned been adopted by men who sincerely believe in god
and in the bible but they hold not only that god created matter and
endowed it with its properties but that he designed the universe and
so controlled the operation of physical laws that they accomplished his
purpose so there are christian men who believe in the evolution of one
kind of plants and animals out of earlier and simpler forms but they
believe that everything was designed by god and that it is due to his
purpose and power that all the forms of vegetable and animal life are
what they are but this is not the question what darwin and the
advocates of his theory deny is all design the organs even the most
complicated and wonderful were not intended they are said to be due to
the undirected and unintended operation of physical laws this is mr
wallaces argument he endeavors to show that it is unworthy of god that
he should be supposed to have contrived the mechanism of the orchids as
a mechanist contrives a curious puzzle
we recently heard prof joseph henry in a brief address say
substantially if i take brass glass and other materials and fuse
them the product is a slag this is what physical laws do if i take
those same materials and form them into a telescope that is what mind
does this is the whole question in a nutshell that design implies an
intelligent designer is a self evident truth every man believes it
and no man can practically disbelieve it even those naturalists who
theoretically deny it if they find in a cave so simple a thing as a
flint arrowhead are as sure that it was made by a man as they are of
their own existence and yet they want us to believe that an eagles eye
is the product of blind natural causes no combination of physical
forces ever made a ship or a locomotive it may indeed be said that
they are dead matter whereas plants and animals live but what is life
but one form of the organizing efficiency of god
mr wallace does not go as far as mr darwin he recoils from regarding
man either as to body or soul as the product of mere natural causes he
insists that a superior intelligence is necessary to account for man
p 359 this of course implies that the agency of no such higher
intelligence is admitted in the production of plants or of animals lower
than man
footnotes
16 the question is not as mr wallace says how has the creator
worked but it is as he himself states whether the essential
properties of matter have alone worked out all the wonders of creation
or whether they are to be referred to the mind and will of god it is
worthy of remark how messrs darwin and wallace refer to mr spencer as
their philosopher we have seen what spencers philosophy is
17 it is therefore clear that design is what mr darwin and mr
wallace repudiate
18 that god permits men in the use of the laws of nature to distil
alcohol and brew poisons does not prove that he approves of drunkenness
or murder
professor huxley
the second witness as to the character of mr darwins theory is
professor huxley we have some hesitation in including the name of this
distinguished naturalist among the advocates of darwinism19 on the
one hand in his essay on the origin of species printed in the
westminster review in 1860 and reprinted in his lay sermons
etc in 1870 he says there is no fault to be found with mr darwins
method but it is another thing whether he has fulfilled all the
conditions imposed by that method is it satisfactorily proved that
species may20 be originated by selection that none of the phenomena
exhibited by species are inconsistent with the origin of species in this
way if these questions can be answered in the affirmative mr darwins
view steps out of the rank of hypotheses into that of theories but so
long as the evidence at present adduced falls short of enforcing that
affirmative so long to our minds the new doctrine must be content to
remain among the formeran extremely valuable and in the highest
degree probable doctrine indeed the only extant hypothesis which is
worth anything in a scientific point of view but still a hypothesis
and not yet a theory of species after much consideration he adds
and assuredly with no bias against mr darwins views it is our clear
conviction that as the evidence now stands it is not absolutely proven
that a group of animals having all the characters exhibited by species
in nature has ever been originated by selection whether artificial or
natural21
again in his work on mans place in nature he expresses himself much
to the same effect a true physical cause is admitted to be such only
on one condition that it shall account for all the phenomena which come
within the range of its operation if it is inconsistent with any one
phenomenon it must be rejected if it fails to explain any one
phenomenon it is so far to be suspected though it may have a perfect
right to provisional acceptance our acceptance therefore of the
darwinian hypothesis must be provisional so long as one link in the
chain of evidence is wanting and so long as all the animals and plants
certainly produced by selective breeding from a common stock are
fertile and their progeny are fertile one with another that link will
be wanting for so long selective breeding will not be proved to be
competent to all that is required if it produce natural species22 in
immediate connection with the above passage there is another which
throws a clear light on professor huxleys cosmical views the whole
analogy of natural operations furnish so complete and crushing an
argument against the intervention of any but what are called secondary
causes in the production of all the phenomena of the universe that in
view of the intimate relations of man and the rest of the living world
and between the forces exerted by the latter and all other forces i can
see no reason for doubting that all are cordinate terms of natures
great progression from formless to formed from the inorganic to the
organic from blind force to conscious intellect and will23
ought not this to settle the matter are we to give up the bible and all
our hopes for the sake of an hypothesis that all living things
including man on the face of the earth are descended from a primordial
animalcule by natural selection when such a man as huxley who as
voltaire said of the prophet habbakuk is capable de tout says that
it has not been proved that any one species has thus originated
but on the other hand while he honestly admits that darwins doctrine
is a mere hypothesis and not a theory he has nevertheless written at
least three essays or reviews in its exposition and vindication he is
freely referred to on the continent of europe at least as an ardent
advocate of the doctrine and he quotes without protest such
designations of himself at any rate as he assures his readers that he
has no bias against mr darwins views as he has devoted much time and
attention to the subject and as he is one of the most prominent
naturalists of the age there can be no question as to his competency as
a witness as to what darwinism is
his testimony that mr darwins doctrine excludes all teleology or
final causes is explicit in his review of the criticisms on the
origin of species he says that when he first read mr darwins book
that which struck him most forcibly was the conviction that teleology
as commonly understood had received its deathblow at mr darwins
hands for the teleological argument runs thus an organ is precisely
fitted to perform a function or purpose therefore it was specially
constructed to perform that function in paleys famous illustration
the adaptation of all the parts of a watch to the function or purpose of
showing the time is held to be evidence that the watch was specially
contrived to that end on the ground that the only cause we know of
competent to produce such an effect as a watch which shall keep time is
a contriving intelligence adapting the means directly to that end24
this mr huxley tells us is precisely what darwin denies with
reference to the organs of plants and animals the eye was not formed
for the purpose of seeing or the ear for hearing it so happened that a
nerve became sensitive to light then in course of time it happened
that a transparent tissue came over it and thus in millions of years
an eye as we have seen above happened to be formed no such organ was
ever intended or designed by god or man an apparatus says professor
huxley thoroughly adapted to a particular purpose might be the result
of a method of trial and error worked by unintelligent agents as well
as by the application of means appropriate to the end by an intelligent
agent for the notion that every organism has been created as it is
and launched straight at a purpose mr darwin substitutes the
conception of something which may fairly be termed a method of trial
and error organisms vary incessantly of these variations the few meet
with surrounding conditions which suit them and thrive the many are
unsuited and become extinguished for the teleologist an organism
exists because it was made for the conditions in which it is found for
the darwinian an organism exists because out of many of its kind it
is the only one which has been able to persist in the conditions in
which it is found if we apprehend huxley further says the spirit
of the origin of species rightly then nothing can be more entirely
and absolutely opposed to teleology as it is commonly understood than
the darwinian theory p 303
it has already been stated that mr wallace does not apply the doctrine
of evolution to man neither does mr mivart a distinguished
naturalist who is a member of the latin church the manner in which
professor huxley speaks of these gentlemen shows how thoroughly in his
judgment mr darwin banishes god from his works mr wallace and mr
mivart are as stout evolutionists as mr darwin himself but mr wallace
denies that man can have been evolved from a lower animal by that
process of natural selection which he with mr darwin holds to be
sufficient for the evolution of all animals below man while mr mivart
admitting that natural selection has been one of the conditions of the
animals below man maintains that natural selection must even in their
case have been supplemented by some other causeof the nature of
which unfortunately he does not give us any idea thus mr mivart is
less of a darwinian than mr wallace for he has faith in the power of
natural selection but he is more of an evolutionist than mr wallace
because mr wallace thinks it necessary to call in an intelligent agent
a sort of supernatural sir john sebright to produce even the animal
frame of man while mr mivart requires no divine assistance till he
comes to mans soul25
in the academy for october 1869 there is a review by professor
huxley of dr haeckels natrlische schpfungsgeschichte in which he
says professor haeckel enlarges on the service which the origin of
species has done in favoring what he terms the causal or mechanical
view of living nature as opposed to the teleological or vitalistic
view and no doubt it is quite true the doctrine of evolution is the
most formidable of all the commoner and coarser forms of teleology
perhaps the most remarkable service to the philosophy of biology
rendered by mr darwin is the reconciliation of teleology and
morphology and the explanation of the facts of both which his view
offers
the teleology which supposes that the eye such as we see it in man or
in the higher vertebrata was made with the precise structure which it
exhibits to make the animal which possesses it to see has undoubtedly
received its deathblow but it is necessary to remember that there is a
higher teleology which is not touched by the doctrine of evolution but
is actually based on the fundamental proposition of evolution that
proposition is that the whole world living and not living is the
result of the mutual interaction according to definite laws of forces
possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity of the
universe was composed if this be true it is no less certain that the
existing world lay potentially in the cosmic vapor and that a
sufficient intelligence could from a knowledge of the properties of
that vapor have predicted say the state of fauna of great britain in
1869 with as much certainty as one can say what will happen to the
vapor of the breath on a cold winters day this is the doctrine of the
selfevolution of the universe we know not what may lie behind this in
mr huxleys mind but we are very sure that there is not an idea in the
above paragraph which epicurus of old and bchner vogt haeckel and
other materialisten von profession would not cheerfully adopt his
distinction between a higher and lower teleology is of no account in
this discussion what is the teleology to which he says mr darwin has
given the deathblow the extracts given above clearly show the eye
huxley says was not made for the purpose of seeing or the ear for the
purpose of hearing according to teleology he says each organism is
like a rifle bullet fired straight at a mark according to darwin
organisms are like grapeshot of which one hits something and the rest
fall wide26

19 mr huxley if we may judge from what he says of himself is
somewhat liable to be misunderstood he says he was fourteen years
laboring to resist the charge of positivism made against the class of
scientific men to which he belongs he also tells us in his letter to
professor tyndall prefixed to his volume of lay sermons and
addresses that the essay on the physical basis of life included in
that volume was intended as a protest from the philosophical side
against what is commonly called materialism it turned out however
that the public regarded it as an argument in favor of materialism this
we think was a very natural if not an unavoidable mistake on the part
of the public for in that essay he says that protoplasm or the
physical basis of life is a kind of matter common to all living
beings that the powers or faculties of all kinds of living matter
diverse as they may be in degree are substantially of the same kind
protoplasm as far as examined contains the four elementscarbon
hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen these are lifeless bodies but when
brought together under certain conditions they give rise to the still
more complex body protoplasm and this protoplasm exhibits the phenomena
of life there is no more reason he teaches for assuming the
existence of a mysterious something called vitality to account for vital
phenomena than there is for the assumption of something called aquasity
to account for the phenomena of water life is said to be the product
of a certain disposition of material molecules the matter of life is
composed of ordinary matter differing from it only in the manner in
which its atoms are aggregated i take it he says to be demonstrable
that it is utterly impossible to prove that anything whatever may not be
the effect of a material and necessary cause and that human logic is
equally incompetent to prove that any act is really spontaneous a
really spontaneous act is one which by the assumption has no cause
and the attempt to prove such a negative as this is on the face of the
matter absurd and while it is thus a philosophical impossibility to
demonstrate that any given phenomenon is not the effect of a material
cause any one who is acquainted with the history of science will admit
that its progress has in all ages meant and now more than ever means
the extension of what we call matter and causation and the concomitant
gradual banishment from all regions of human thought of what we call
spirit and spontaneity
20 it cannot escape the attention of any one that mr darwin mr
wallace professor huxley and all the other advocates or defenders of
darwinism do not pretend to prove anything more than that species may
be originated by selection not that there is no other satisfactory
account of their origin mr darwin admits that referring them to the
intention and efficiency of god accounts for everything but he says
that is not science

23 since writing the above paragraph our eye fell on the following
note on the 89th page of the duke of argyles reign of law which it
gives us pleasure to quote it seems that a writer in the spectator
had charged professor huxley with atheism in the number of that paper
for february 10 1866 the professor replies i do not know that i care
very much about popular odium so there is no great merit in saying that
if i really saw fit to deny the existence of a god i should certainly do
so for the sake of my own intellectual freedom and be the honest
atheist you are pleased to say i am as it happens however i cannot
take this position with honesty inasmuch as it is and always has been
a favorite tenet that atheism is as absurd logically speaking as
polytheism in the same paper he says the denying the possibility of
miracles seems to me quite as unjustifiable as speculative atheism how
this can be reconciled with the passages quoted above we are unable to
see

article mr huxley says elijahs great question will ye serve god or
baal choose ye is uttered audibly enough in the ears of every one of
us as we come to manhood let every man who tries to answer it seriously
ask himself whether he can be satisfied with the baal of authority and
with all the good things his worshippers are promised in this world and
the next if he can let him if he be so inclined amuse himself with
such scientific implements as authority tells him are safe and will not
cut his fingers but let him not imagine that he is or can be both a
true son of the church and a loyal soldier of science and on the
other hand if the blind acceptance of authority appear to him in its
true colors as mere private judgment in excelsis and if he have
courage to stand alone face to face with the abyss of the eternal and
unknowable let him be content once for all not only to renounce the
good things promised by infallibility but even to bear the bad things
which it prophesies content to follow reason and fact in singleness and
honesty of purpose wherever they may lead in the sure faith that a
hell of honest men will to him be more endurable than a paradise full of
angelic shams there can be no doubt that the apostle paul believed in
the infallibility of the scriptures imagine professor huxley calling
st paul to his face a sham what are all the huxleys who have ever
lived or ever can live to that one paul in power for good over human
thought character and destiny
professor huxley goes on in the next paragraph to say mr mivart
asserts that without belief in a personal god there is no religion
worthy of the name this is a matter of opinion but it may be
asserted with less reason to fear contradiction that the worship of a
personal god who on mr mivarts hypothesis must have used words
studiously calculated to deceive his creatures and worshippers is no
religion worthy of the name incredibile est deum illis verbis ad
populum fuisse locutum quibis deciperetur is a verdict in which for
once jesuit casuistry concurs with the healthy moral sense of all
mankind p 458 mr huxley calls believers in the scriptures and

bchner
dr louis bchner president of the medical association of
hessendarmstadt etc etc is not only a man of science but a popular
writer perhaps no book of its class in our day has been so widely
circulated as his volume on kraft und stoff matter and force it has
been translated into all the languages of europe he holds that matter
and force are inseparable there cannot be the one without the other
both are eternal and imperishable neither can be either increased or
diminished life originated spontaneously by the combination of
molecules of matter under favorable conditions all the phenomena of the
universe inorganic and organic whether physical vital or mental are
due to matter and its forces consequently there is no god no creation
no mind distinct from matter no conscious existence of man after death
all this is asserted in the most explicit terms dr bchner has
published a work on darwinism in two volumes darwins theory he says
is the most thoroughly naturalistic that can be imagined and far more
atheistic than that of his decried predecessor lamarck who admitted at
least a general law of progress and development whereas according to
darwin the whole development is due to the gradual summation of
innumerable minute and accidental operations27

carl vogt
in his preface to his work on the descent of man mr darwin quotes
this author as a high authority we see him elsewhere referred to as one
of the first physiologists of germany vogt devotes the concluding
lecture of the second volume of his work on man to the consideration
of darwinism he expresses his opinion of it after high commendation
in the following terms he says that it cannot be doubted that darwins
theory turns the creatorand his occasional intervention in the
revolutions of the earth and in the production of specieswithout any
hesitation out of doors inasmuch as it does not leave the smallest room
for the agency of such a being the first living germ being granted out
of it the creation develops itself progressively by natural selection
through all the geological periods of our planets by the simple law of
descentno new species arises by creation and none perishes by divine
annihilationthe natural course of things the process of evolution of
all organisms and of the earth itself is of itself sufficient for the
production of all we see thus man is not a special creation produced
in a different way and distinct from other animals endowed with an
individual soul and animated by the breath of god on the contrary man
is only the highest product of the progressive evolution of animal life
springing from the group of apes next below him28
after this no one can be surprised to hear him say that the pulpits of
the orthodox the confessionals of the priests the platforms of the
interior missions the presidential chairs of the consistories resound
with protestations against the assaults made by materialism and
darwinism against the very foundations of society p 286 this he
calls das wehgeschrei der moralisten the wail of the moralists the
designation moralists is a felicitous one as applied to the opponents
of vogt and his associates it distinguishes them as men who have not
lost their moral sense who refuse to limit their faith to what can be
proved by the five senses who bow to the authority of the law written

haeckel
dr ernst haeckel professor in the university of jena is said to stand
at the head of the living naturalists of germany his work on natural
history of creation contains a course of lectures delivered to the
professors students and citizens of jena it is therefore somewhat
popular in its character the ability of the writer is manifest on every
page the distinctness of his perceptions precision of language
perspicuity of style and the strength of his convictions give the
impression of a man fully master of his subject who has thought himself
through and is perfectly satisfied with the conclusions at which he has
arrived at the same time it is the impression of a man who is developed
only on one side who never looks within who takes no cognizance of the
wonders revealed in consciousness to whom the intuitions of reason and
of the conscience the sense of dependence on a will higher than our
ownthe sense of obligation and responsibility are of no accountin
short a man to whom the image of god enstamped on the soul of man is
invisible this being the case he that is least in the kingdom of
heaven is greater than he
haeckel admits that the title of his book natural creation i e
creation by natural laws is a contradiction he distinguishes
however between the creation of substance and the creation of form of
the former he says science knows nothing to the scientist matter is
eternal if any one chooses to assume that it was created by an
extramundane power haeckel says he will not object but that is a
matter of faith and where faith begins science ends the very
reverse of this is true science must begin with faith it cannot take a
single step without it how does haeckel know that his senses do not
deceive him how does he know that he can trust to the operations of his
intellect how does he know that things are as they appear how does he
know that the universe is not a great phantasmagoria as so many men
have regarded it and man the mere sport of chimeras he must believe in
the laws of belief impressed on his nature knowledge implies a mind
that knows and confidence in the act of knowing implies belief in the
laws of mind an inductive science of nature says president porter
presupposes a science of induction and a science of induction
presupposes a science of man29 haeckel however says faith is the
mere product of the poetic imagination science of the understanding
if its conclusions come into conflict with the creations of the
imagination the latter of course must give way30
he says there have ever been two conflicting theories of the universe
the one monistic the other dualistic the one admits of only one
substance matter the other of two matter and mind he prefers to call
the former monism rather than materialism because the latter term often
includes the idea of moral materialism i e the doctrine that
sensual pleasure is the end of life a doctrine he says much more
frequently held by princely churchmen than by men of science he
maintains however that all knowable nature is one that the same
eternal immutable ehernen brazen laws are active in the life of
animals and plants in the formation of crystals and the power of
steam in the whole sphere of biology zology and botany we have
therefore the right to hold fast the monistic and mechanical view
whether men choose to brand the system as materialism or not in this
sense all natural science with the law of causation at its head is
thoroughly materialistic p 32
the monistic theory he calls mechanical or causal as distinguished
from the dualistic theory which he calls teleological or vitalistic
according to the latter the vegetable and animal kingdoms are
considered as the products of a creative agency working with a definite
design in looking on an organism the conviction seems unavoidable that
so skilfully constructed a machine such a complicated working
apparatus as an organism is could be produced only by an agency
analogous to although far more perfect than the agency of man this
he says supposes the creator to be an organism analogous to man
although infinitely more perfect who contemplates his formative powers
lays the plan of the machine and then by the use of appropriate means
produces an effect answering to the preconceived plan however highly
the creator may be exalted this view involves the ascription to him of
human attributes in virtue of which he can form a plan and construct
organisms to correspond with it that is the view to which darwins
doctrine is directly opposed and of which agassiz is among
naturalists the most important advocate the famous work of agassiz
essay on classification which is in direct opposition to darwins
and appeared about the same time has carried out logically to the
utmost the absurd anthropomorphic doctrine of a creator p 17
the monistic theory is called mechanical and causal because it
supposes that all the phenomena of the universe organic and inorganic
vegetable and animal vital and mental are due to mechanical or
necessarily operating causes caus efficientes just as the dualistic
theory is called teleological or vitalistic because it refers natural
organisms to causes working for the accomplishment of a given end caus
finales p 67
the grand difficulty in the way of the mechanical or monistic theory was
the occurrence of innumerable organisms apparently at least indicative
of design to get over this difficulty haeckel says some who could not
believe in a creative and controlling mind adopted the idea of a
metaphysical ghost called vitality the grand service rendered by darwin
to science is that his theory enables us to account for the
appearances of design in nature without assuming final causes or a
mind working for a foreseen and intended end all that had appeared
before darwin he says failed to secure success and to meet with
general acceptance of the doctrine of the mechanical production of
vegetable and animal organisms this was accomplished by darwins
theory p 20
the precise difficulty which mr darwins doctrine has according to
haeckel enabled men of science to surmount is thus clearly stated on
p 633 it is that organs for a definite end should be produced by
undesigning or mechanical causes this difficulty is overcome by the
doctrine of evolution through the theory of descent we are for the
first time able to establish the monistic doctrine of the unity of
nature that a mechaniccausal explanation of the most complicated
organisms e g the formation and constitution of the organs of
sense have no more difficulty for the common understanding than the
mechanical explanation of any physical process as for example
earthquakes the direction of the winds or the currents of the sea we
thus arrive at the conviction of the last importance that all natural
bodies with which we are acquainted are equally endowed with life
gleichmssig belebt sind that the distinction between living and dead
matter does not exist when a stone is thrown into the air and falls by
certain laws to the ground or when a solution of salt forms a crystal
the result is neither more nor less a mechanical manifestation of life
than the flowering of a plant the generation or sensibility of animals
or the feelings or the mental activity of man in thus establishing the
monistic theory of nature lies the highest and most comprehensive merit
of the doctrine of descent as reformed by darwin p 21 as to the
much vaunted design in nature it is a reality only for those whose
views of animal and vegetable life are to the last degree superficial
any one who has gone deeper into the organization and vital activity of
animals and plants who has made himself familiar with the action and
reaction of vital phenomena and the socalled economy of nature comes
of necessity to the conclusion that design does not exist any more
than the vaunted goodness of the creator die vielgerhmte allgte des
schpfers p 17
professor huxley in his review of this work of haeckel already quoted
says i do not like to conclude without reminding the reader of my
entire concurrence with the general tenor and spirit of the work and of
my high estimate of its value if you take out of haeckels book its
doctrine of monism which he himself says means materialism it has no
tenor or spirit in it it is not however for us to say how far
professor huxley intended his indorsement to go
haeckel says that darwins theory of evolution leads inevitably to
atheism and materialism in this we think he is correct but we have
nothing to do with haeckels logic or with our own we make no charge
against mr darwin we cite haeckel merely as a witness to the fact that
darwinism involves the denial of final causes that it excludes all
intelligent design in the production of the organs of plants and
animals and even in the production of the soul and body of man this
first of german naturalists would occupy a strange position in the sight
of all europe if after lauding a book to the skies because it teaches
a certain doctrine it should turn out that the book taught no such
doctrine at all

the opponents of darwinism
the duke of argyll
when cultivated men undertake to refute a certain system it is to be
presumed that they give themselves the trouble to ascertain what that
system is as the advocates of mr darwins theory defend and applaud it
because it excludes design and as its opponents make that the main
ground of their objection to it there can be no reasonable doubt as to
its real character the question is how are the contrivances in nature
to be accounted for one answer is they are due to the purpose of god
mr darwin says they are due to the gradual and undesigned accumulation
of slight variations the dukes first objection to that doctrine is
that the evidence of design in the organs of plants and animals is so
clear that mr darwin himself cannot avoid using teleological language
he exhausts he says every form of words and of illustration by
which intention or mental purpose can be described contrivance
beautiful contrivance curious contrivance are expressions which
occur over and over again here is one sentence describing a particular
species of orchids the labellum is developed in order to attract
the lepidoptera and we shall soon see reason for supposing that the
nectar is purposely so lodged that it can be sucked only slowly in
order to give time for the curious chemical quality of the matter
setting hard and dry31 we have already seen that mr darwins
answer to this objection is that it is hard to keep from personifying
nature and that these expressions as used by him mean no more than
chemists mean when they speak of affinities and one element preferring
another
a second objection is that a variation would not be useful to the
individual in which it happens to occur unless other variations should
occur at the right time and in the right order and that the concurrence
of so many accidents as are required to account for the infinite
diversity of forms in plants and animals is altogether inconceivable
a third objection is that the variations often have no reference to the
organism of the animal itself but to other organisms take one
instance he says out of millions the poison of a deadly snakelet
us for a moment consider what that is it is a secretion of definite
chemical properties with reference not onlynot even mainlyto the
organism of the animal in which it is developed but specially to
another animal which it is intended to destroy how he asks will
the law of growth adjust a poison in one animal with such subtle
knowledge of the organization of the other that the deadly virus shall
in a few minutes curdle the blood benumb the nerves and rush in upon
the citadel of life there is but one explanation a mind having minute
and perfect knowledge of the structure of both has designed the one to
be capable of inflicting death upon the other this mental purpose and
resolve is the one thing which our intelligence perceives with direct
and intuitive recognition the method of creation by which this purpose
has been carried into effect is utterly unknown32
a fourth objection has reference to beauty according to mr darwin
flowers are not intentionally made beautiful but those which happen to
be beautiful attract insects and by their agency are fertilized and
survive male birds are not intentionally arrayed in bright colors but
those which happen to be so arrayed are attractive and thus become the
progenitors of their race against this explanation the duke earnestly
protests he refers to the gorgeous adorned class of hummingbirds of
which naturalists enumerate no less than four hundred and thirty
different species distinguished one from the other in general only by
their plumage now he asks what explanation does the law of natural
selection givei will not say of the origin but even of the
continuance of such specific varieties as these none whatever a crest
of topaz is no better in the struggle of existence than a crest of
sapphire a frill ending in spangles of the emerald is no better in the
battle of life than a frill ending in spangles of the ruby a tail is
not affected for the purposes of flight whether its marginal or its
central feathers are decorated with white it is impossible to bring
such varieties into any physical law known to us it has relation
however to a purpose which stands in close analogy with our knowledge
of purpose in the works of men mere beauty and mere variety for their
own sake are objects which we ourselves seek when we can make the
forces of nature subordinate to the attainment of them there seems to
be no conceivable reason why we should doubt or question that these are
ends and aims also in the forms given to living organisms when the
facts correspond with this view and with no other33
it will be observed that all these objections have reference to the
denial of teleology on the part of mr darwin if his theory admitted
that the organisms in nature were due to a divine purpose the
objections would be void of all meaning
there is a fifth objection according to darwins theory organs are
formed by the slow accumulation of unintended variations which happen
to be favorable to the subject of them in the struggle for life but in
many cases these organs instead of being favorable are injurious or
cumbersome until fully developed take the wing of a bird for example
in its rudimental state it is useful neither for swimming walking nor
flying now as darwin says it took millions of years to bring the eye
to perfection how long did it take to render a rudimental wing useful
it is no sufficient answer to say that these rudimental organs might
have been suited to the condition in which the animal existed during
the formative process this is perfectly arbitrary it has no basis of
fact there are but three kinds of locomotion that we know of in the
water on the ground and through the air for all these purposes a
halfformed wing would be an impediment
the duke devotes almost a whole chapter of his interesting book to the
consideration of contrivance in the machinery for flight the
conditions to secure regulated movement through the atmosphere are so
numerous so complicated and so conflicting that the problem never has
been solved by human ingenuity in the structure of the bird it is
solved to perfection as we are not writing a teleological argument but
only producing evidence that darwinism excludes teleology we cannot
follow the details which prove that the wing of the gannet or swift is
almost as wonderful and beautiful a specimen of contrivance as the eye
of the eagle

agassiz
every one knows that the illustrious agassiz over whose recent grave
the world stands weeping was from the beginning a pronounced and
earnest opponent of mr darwins theory he wrote as a naturalist and
therefore his objections are principally directed against the theory of
evolution which he regarded as not only destitute of any scientific
basis but as subversive of the best established facts in zology
nevertheless it is evident that his zeal was greatly intensified by his
apprehension that a theory which obliterates all evidence of the being
of god from the works of nature endangered faith in that great doctrine
itself the rev dr peabody in the discourse delivered on the occasion
of professor agassizs funeral said i cannot close this hasty and
inadequate yet fervent and hearty tribute without recalling to your
memory the reverent spirit in which he pursued his scientific labors
nearly forty years ago in his first great work on fossil fishes in
developing principles of classification he wrote in quotations an
invisible thread in all ages runs through this immense diversity
exhibiting as a general result that there is a continual progress in
development ending in man the four classes of vertebrates presenting
the intermediate steps and the invertebrates the constant accessory
accompaniment have we not here the manifestation of a mind as powerful
as prolific an act of intelligence as sublime as provident the marks
of goodness as infinite as wise the most palpable demonstration of the
existence of a personal god author of all this ruler of the universe
and the dispenser of all good this at least is what i read in the works
of creation and it was what he ever read and with profound awe and
adoration to this exalted faith he was inflexibly loyal the laws of
nature were to him the eternal word of god
his repugnance to darwinism grew in great part from his apprehension of
its atheistical tendencyan apprehension which i confess i cannot
share for i forget not that these theories now in the ascendent are
maintained by not a few devout christian men and while they appear to
me unproved and incapable of demonstration i could admit them without
parting with one iota of my faith in god and christ yet i cannot but
sympathize most strongly with him in the spirit in which he resisted
what seemed to him lesemajesty against the sovereign of the universe
nor was his a theoretical faith his whole life in its broad
philanthropy in its pervading spirit of service in its fidelity to
arduous trusts and duties and in its simplicity and truthfulness
bespoke one who was consciously fulfilling a mission from god to his
fellowmen
the words evolution and darwinism are so often in this country but
not in europe used interchangeably that it is conceivable that dr
peabody could retain his faith in god and yet admit the doctrine of
evolution but it is not conceivable that any man should adopt the main
element of mr darwins theory viz the denial of all final causes
and the assertion that since the first creation of matter and life god
has left the universe to the control of unintelligent physical causes
so that all the phenomena of the plants and animals all that is in man
and all that has ever happened on the earth is due to physical force
and yet retain his faith in christ on that theory there have been no
supernatural revelation no miracles christ is not risen and we are
yet in our sins it is not thus that this matter is regarded abroad the
christians of germany say that the only alternative these theories leave
us is heathenism or christianity heidenthum oder christenthum die
frage der zeit
janet
janet a professor of philosophy is the author of a book on the
materialism of bchner34 the greater part of the last chapter of his
work is devoted to darwinism he says dr bchner invoked darwins
book as a striking confirmation of his doctrine p 154 what
bchners doctrine is has been shown on a previous page the points of
coincidence between darwins system and his are that both regard mind
as a mere function of living matter and both refer all the organs and
organisms of living things to the unconscious unintelligent operation
of physical causes bchners way of accounting for complicated organs
was that the energy of the elements and forces of matter which in
their fated and accidental occurrence must have produced innumerable
forms which must needs limit each other mutually and correspond
apparently the one with the other as if they were made for that
purpose out of all those forms they only have survived which were
adapted in some manner to the conditions of the medium in which they
were placed p 30 this is very clumsy no wonder bchner preferred
darwins method the two systems are indeed exactly the same but mr
darwin has a much more winning way of presenting it
professor janet does not seem to have much objection to the doctrine of
evolution in itself it is the denial of teleology that he regards as
the fatal element of mr darwins theory according to us he says
the true stumblingblock of mr darwins theory the perilous and
slippery point is the passage from artificial to natural selection it
is when he wants to establish that a blind and designless nature has
been able to obtain by the occurrence of circumstances the same
results which man obtains by thoughtful and well calculated industry
p 174
towards the end of his volume he says we shall conclude by a general
observation notwithstanding the numerous objections we have raised
against mr darwins theory we do not declare ourselves hostile to a
system of which zologists are the only competent judges we are neither
for nor against the transmutation of species neither for nor against
the principle of natural selection the only positive conclusion of our
debate is this no principle hitherto known neither the action of
media nor habit nor natural selection can account for organic
adaptations without the intervention of the principle of finality
natural selection unguided submitted to the laws of a pure mechanism
and exclusively determined by accidents seems to me under another
name the chance proclaimed by epicurus equally barren equally
incomprehensible on the other hand natural selection guided beforehand
by a provident will directed towards a precise end by intentional laws
might be the means which nature has selected to pass from one stage of
being to another from one form to another to bring to perfection life
throughout the universe and to rise by a continuous process from the
monad to man now i ask mr darwin himself what interest has he in
maintaining that natural selection is not guidednot directed what
interest has he in substituting accidental causes for every final cause
i cannot see let him admit that in natural as well as in artificial
selection there may be a choice and direction his principle
immediately becomes much more fruitful than it was before his
hypothesis then whilst having the advantage of exempting science from
the necessity of introducing the personal and miraculous intervention of
god in the creation of each species yet would be free from the
banishing out of the universe an allprovident thought and of
submitting everything to blind and brute chance pp 198 199
professor janet asks far too much of mr darwin to ask him to give up
his denial of final causes is like asking the romanists to give up the
pope that principle is the life and soul of his system

34 the materialism of the present day a critique of dr bchners
system by paul janet member of the institute of france professor of
philosophy at the paris facult des lettres translated from the french
by gustave masson b a london and paris 1867
m flourens
m flourens recently dead was one of the earliest and most pronounced
opponents of darwinism he published in 1864 his examen du livre de m
darwin sur lorigine des espces his position as member of the
acadmie franaise and perpetual secretary of the acadmie des
sciences or institut de france vouch for his high rank among the
french naturalists his connection with the jardin des plantes gave him
enlarged opportunities for biological experiments the result of his own
experience as well as the experience of other observers was as he
expresses it his solemn conviction that species are fixed and not
transmutable no ingenuity of device could render hybrids fertile they
never establish an intermediate species it is therefore to the
doctrine of evolution his attention is principally directed
nevertheless he is no less struck by darwins way of excluding all
intelligence and design in his manner of speaking of nature on this
point he quotes the language of cuvier who says nature has been
personified living beings have been called the works of nature the
general bearing of these creatures to each other has become the laws of
nature it is thus while considering nature as a being endowed with
intelligence and will but in its power limited and secondary that it
may be said that she watches incessantly over the maintenance of her
work that she does nothing in vain and always acts by the most simple
means it is easy to see how puerile are those who give nature a
species of individual existence distinct from the creator and from the
law which he has impressed upon the movements and peculiarities of the
forms given by him to living things and which he makes to act upon
their bodies with a peculiar force and reason older writers says
flourens in speaking of nature gave to her inclinations intentions
and views and horrors of a vacuum and sports etc he says that one
of the principal objects of his book is to show how mr darwin has
deluded himself and perhaps others by a constant abuse of figurative
language he plays with nature as he pleases and makes her do
whatsoever he wishes when we remember that mr darwin defines nature
to be the aggregate of physical forces we see how in attributing
everything to nature he effectually excludes the supernatural
in his volume of lay sermons reviews etc professor huxley has a
very severe critique on m flourenss book he says little however in
reference to teleology except in one paragraph in which we read m
flourens cannot imagine an unconscious selection it is for him a
contradiction in terms huxleys answer is the winds and waves of the
bay of biscay have not much consciousness and yet they have with great
care selected from an infinity of masses of silex all grains of sand
below a certain size and have heaped them by themselves over a great
area a frosty night selects the hardy plants in a plantation from
among the tender ones as effectually as if the intelligence of the
gardener had been operative in cutting the weaker ones down35 if
this means anything it means that as the winds and waves of the bay of
biscay can make heaps of sand so similar unconscious agencies can if
you only give them time enough make an elephant or a man for this is
what mr darwin says natural selection has done

many of the dignitaries of the church of england and a large number of
distinguished men of different professions and denominations its
principal object is to investigate fully and impartially the most
important questions of philosophy and science but more especially those
that bear on the great truths revealed in holy scripture with the view
of defending these truths against the opposition of science falsely so
called the institute holds bimonthly meetings at which papers are
read on some important topic and then submitted to criticism and
discussion these papers many of which are very elaborate are
published in the transactions of the institute together with a full
report of the discussions to which they gave rise six volumes replete
with valuable and varied information have already been published
very considerable latitude of opinion is allowed hence we find in the
transactions papers for and against evolutionfor and against
darwinism it would be easy to quote extracts pertinent to our subject
more than enough to fill a volume much larger than the present we must
content ourselves with a few citations from the discussion on a paper in
favor of the credibility of darwinism36 and another in favor of the
doctrine of evolution37 in summing up the debates on these two
topics the chairman rev walter mitchell presented with great
clearness and force his reasons for regarding darwinism as incredible
and impossible in his protracted remarks he contrasts the scriptural
doctrine that of the vestiges of creation and that of darwin on the
origin of species he thus states the doctrine of the bible on the
subject if he says science be another name for real knowledge if
science be the pursuit of sound wisdom if science be the pursuit of
truth itself i say that man has no right to reject anything that is
true because it savors of god well what is this hypothesisolder than
that of darwinwhich does and does alone account for all the observed
facts or all that which we can read recorded in the book of nature it
is that god created all things very good that he made every vegetable
after its own kind that he made every animal after its own kind that
he allowed certain laws of variation but that he has ordained strict
though invisible and invincible barriers which prevent that variation
from running riot and which includes it within strict and well defined
limits this is a hypothesis which will account for all that we have
learnt from the works of nature it admits an intelligent being as the
author of all the works of creation animate as well as inanimate it
leaves no mysteries in the animate world unaccounted for there is one
thing which the animate as well as the inanimate world declares to
man one thing everywhere plainly recorded if we will only read it and
that is the impress of design the design of infinite wisdom any theory
which comes in with an attempt to ignore design as manifested in gods
creation is a theory i say which attempts to dethrone god this the
theory of darwin does endeavor to do if asked how our old theory
accounts for such uniformity of design in the midst of such perplexing
variety as we find in nature we reply that this can only be accounted
for on one admission that the whole is the work of one author built
according as it were to one style that it represents the unity of one
mind with the infinite power of adapting all its works in the most
perfect manner for the uses for which they were created whewell has
boldly maintained and he has never been controverted that all real
advances in the sciences of physiology and comparative anatomysuch as
that made by harvey in discovering the circulation of the bloodhave
been made by those who not only believed in the existence of design
everywhere manifested in the animate world but were led by that belief
to make their discoveries
when discussing the paper of mr henslow on evolution he says in
speaking of this paper i must commend the exceeding reverent tone in
which the author has discussed the subject and i should like to see all
such subjects discussed in a similar tone the view which mr henslow
brings forward however does not appear to be a very original one it
was the first view ever brought forward on the doctrine of evolution
and i was the first one to point out that the whole doctrine was one of
retrograde character the whole tone and character of this paper except
that which relates to the attributes and moral government of god38 is
nothing more or less than the same view of the doctrine of evolution
which created such a sensation in this country when that famous book
came out the vestiges of creation so far as i can understand the
arguments of mr darwin they have simply been an endeavor to eject out
of the idea of evolution the personal work of the deity his whole
endeavor has been to push the creator farther and farther back out of
view the most laborious part of darwins attempt at reasoningfor it
is not true reasoningthe most laborious part of his logic and
reasoning is intended to eliminate as perfectly as any of the
atheistical authors have endeavored to do the idea of design now
setting revelation aside the manner in which the unknown author of the
vestiges of creation treated this subject satisfactorily showed that
the doctrine of evolution was not in itself an atheistical doctrine nor
did it deny the existence of design so far as i could understand and
make out having carefully read the book at the time it came out and
afterwards and having carefully analyzed and compared it and mr
darwins book with each other so far as i could understand it the
doctrine of the author of the vestiges of creation was simply that
god created all things and that when he created matter he impressed on
it certain laws that matter being evolved according to those laws
should produce beings and organs mutually adapted to one another and to
the world and that every successive development which should be
produced was essentially foreseen foreknown and predetermined by the
deity his idea for instance of the evolution of an eye from a more
simple organ was that the ultimate eyemans eye for instancewas to
be a perfect optical instrument and that its perfection depended on the
previous design by the creator that at a certain period it should
appear in a body quite adapted for its purposes there is one
questionand not the only one but we must consider it as an important
questionwhether you can maintain a doctrine of evolution which shall
not be atheistical and which shall admit the great argument of design
that is one thing but the next thing is does such a doctrine as that
accord either with revelation or with the facts of science i do not
believe that it can be made to agree with what we believe to be the
revealed word of god and i do not believe that it has in the least
degree been proved that the doctrine is consistent with sound science
as to mr darwins theory it is obvious from the passages already
quoted that he considers its characteristic feature is not evolution
nor even natural selection but the denial of teleology or of
intelligent control mr darwin admits the original creation of one or a
few forms of life and mr mitchell in his comments on mr waringtons
defence of his theory asks why am i to limit the work of the creator
to the simultaneous or successive creations of ten or twelve
commencements of the animate creation why simply for the purpose of
evading the evidence of design as manifested in the adaptation of all
the organs of every animate creature to its wants which can only be
done by so incredible an hypothesis as that of mr darwin i say
fearlessly that any hypothesis which requires us to admit that the
formation of such complex organs as the eye the ear the heart the
brain with all their marvellous structures and mechanical adaptations
to the wants of the creatures possessing them so perfectly in harmony
too with the laws of inorganic matter affords no evidence of design
that such structures could be built up by gradual chance improvements
perpetuated by the law of transmission and perfected by the destruction
of creatures less favorably endowed is so incredible that i marvel to
find any thinking man capable of adopting it for a single moment it is
useless to multiply quotations darwinism is never brought up either
formally or incidentally that its exclusion of design in the formation
of living organisms is not urged as the main objection against the whole
theory

crudest and most uncritical attempts of the human mind to grasp the
system of nature but that in our day a system destitute of any shadow
of proof and supported merely by vague analogies and figures of speech
and by the arbitrary and artificial coherence of its own parts should
be accepted as philosophy and should find able adherents to string on
its thread of hypotheses our vast and weighty stores of knowledge is
surpassingly strange in many respects these speculations are
important and worthy the attention of thinking men they seek to
revolutionize the religious belief of the world and if accepted would
destroy most of the existing theology and philosophy they indicate
tendencies among scientific thinkers which though probably temporary
must before they disappear descend to lower strata and reproduce
themselves in grosser forms and with most serious effects on the whole
structure of society with one class of minds they constitute a sort of
religion which so far satisfies the craving for truth higher than those
which relate to immediate wants and pleasures with another and perhaps
larger class they are accepted as affording a welcome deliverance from
all scruples of conscience and fears of a hereafter in the domain of
science evolutionism has like tendencies it reduces the position of
man who becomes a descendant of inferior animals and a mere term in a
series whose end is unknown it removes from the study of nature the
ideas of final cause and purpose and the evolutionist instead of
regarding the world as a work of consummate plan skill and adjustment
approaches nature as he would a chaos of fallen rocks which may present
forms of castles and grotesque profiles of men and animals but they
are all fortuitous and without significance pp 317 318
taking then this broad view of the subject two great leading
alternatives are presented to us either man is an independent product
of the will of a higher intelligence acting directly or through the
laws and materials of his own institution and production or he has been
produced by an unconscious evolution from lower things it is true that
many evolutionists either unwilling to offend or not perceiving the
logical consequences of their own hypothesis endeavor to steer a middle
course and to maintain that the creator has proceeded by way of
evolution but the bare hard logic of spencer the greatest english
authority on evolution leaves no place for this compromise and shows
that the theory carried out to its legitimate consequences excludes
the knowledge of a creator and the possibility of his work we have
therefore to choose between evolution and creation bearing in mind
however that there may be a place in nature for evolution properly
limited as well as for other things and that the idea of creation by
no means excludes law and second causes p 321
it may be said that evolution may be held as a scientific doctrine in
connection with a modified belief in creation the work of actual
creation may have been limited to a few elementary types and evolution
may have done the rest evolutionists may still be theists we have
already seen that the doctrine as carried out to its logical
consequences excludes creation and theism it may however be shown
that even in its more modified form and when held by men who maintain
that they are not atheists it is practically atheistic because
excluding the idea of plan and design and resolving all things into the
action of unintelligent forces it is necessary to observe this because
it is the halfwayevolutionism which professes to have a creator
somewhere behind it that is most popular though it is if possible
more unphilosophical than that which professes to set out with absolute
and determined nonentity or from selfexisting stardust containing all
the possibilities of the universe
in reference to the objection of evolutionists that the origin of every
new species on the theistic doctrine supposes a miracle an
intervention of the divine efficiency without the agency of second
causes principal dawson asks what is the actual statement of the
theory of creation as it may be held by a modern man of science simply
this that all things have been produced by the supreme creative will
acting either directly or through the agency of the forces and material
of his own production p 340
he thus sums up his argument against the doctrine of evolution
specially in its application to man finally the evolutionist picture
wants some of the fairest lineaments of humanity and cheats us with the
semblance of man without the reality shave and paint your ape as you
may clothe him and set him up upon his feet still he fails greatly of
the human form divine and so it is with him morally and spiritually
as well we have seen that he wants the instinct of immortality the
love of god the mental and spiritual power of exercising dominion over
the earth the very agency by which he is evolved is of itself
subversive of all these higher properties the struggle for existence is
essentially selfish and therefore degrading even in the lower
animals it is a false assumption that its tendency is to elevate for
animals when driven to the utmost verge of the struggle for life
become depauperated and degraded the dog which spends its life in
snarling contention with its fellow curs for insufficient food will not
be a noble specimen of its race god does not so treat his creatures
there is far more truth to nature in the doctrine which represents him
as listening to the young ravens when they cry for food but as applied
to man the theory of the struggle for existence and survival of the
fittest though the most popular phase of evolutionism at present is
nothing less than the basest and most horrible of superstitions it
makes man not merely carnal but devilish it takes his lowest appetites
and propensities and makes them his god and creator his higher
sentiments and aspirations his selfdenying philanthropy his
enthusiasm for the good and true all the struggles and sufferings of
heroes and martyrs not to speak of that selfsacrifice which is the
foundation of christianity are in the view of the evolutionist mere
loss and waste failure in the struggle of life what does he give us in
exchange an endless pedigree of bestial ancestors without one gleam of
high and holy tradition to enliven the procession and for the future
the prospect that the poor mass of protoplasm which constitutes the sum
of our being and which is the sole gain of an indefinite struggle in
the past must soon be resolved again into inferior animals or dead
matter that men of thought and culture should advocate such a
philosophy argues either a strange mental hallucination or that the
higher spiritual nature has been wholly quenched within them it is one
of the saddest of many sad spectacles which our age presents p 395

relation of darwinism to religion
the consideration of that subject would lead into the wide field of the
relation between science and religion into that field we lack
competency and time to enter a few remarks however on the subject
may not be out of place those remarks we would fain make in a humble
way irenical there is need of an irenicum for the fact is painfully
notorious that there is an antagonism between scientific men as a class
and religious men as a class of course this opposition is neither felt
nor expressed by all on either side nevertheless whatever may be the
cause of this antagonism or whoever are to be blamed for it there can
be no doubt that it exists and that it is an evil
the first cause of the alienation in question is that the two parties
so to speak adopt different rules of evidence and thus can hardly
avoid arriving at different conclusions to understand this we must
determine what is meant by science and by scientific evidence science
according to its etymology is simply knowledge but usage has limited
its meaning in the first place not to the knowledge of facts or
phenomena merely but to their causes and relations it was said of
old greek hoti scienti fundamentum greek dioti fastigium no
amount of materials would constitute a building they must be duly
arranged so as to make a symmetrical whole no amount of disconnected
data can constitute a science those data must be systematized in their
relation to each other and to other things in the second place the
word is becoming more and more restricted to the knowledge of a
particular class of facts and of their relations namely the facts of
nature or of the external world this usage is not universal nor is it
fixed in germany especially the word wissenschaft is used of all
kinds of ordered knowledge whether transcendental or empirical so we
are accustomed to speak of mental moral social as well as of natural
science nevertheless the more restricted use of the word is very
common and very influential it is important that this fact should be
recognized in common usage a scientific man is distinguished specially
from a metaphysician the one investigates the phenomena of matter the
other studies the phenomena of mind according to the old distinction
between physics and metaphysics science therefore is the ordered
knowledge of the phenomena which we recognize through the senses a
scientific fact is a fact perceived by the senses scientific evidence
is evidence addressed to the senses at one of the meetings of the
victoria institute a visitor avowed his disbelief in the existence of
god when asked what kind of evidence would satisfy him he answered
just such evidence as i have of the existence of this tumbler which i
now hold in my hand the rev mr henslow says by science is meant the
investigation of facts and phenomena recognizable by the senses and of
the causes which have brought them into existence40 this is the main
root of the trouble if science be the knowledge of the facts perceived
by the senses and scientific evidence evidence addressed to the
senses then the senses are the only sources of knowledge any
conviction resting on any other ground than the testimony of the senses
must be faith darwin admits that the contrivances in nature may be
accounted for by assuming that they are due to design on the part of
god but he says that would not be science haeckel says that to
science matter is eternal if any man chooses to say it was created
well and good but that is a matter of faith and faith is imagination
ulrici quotes a distinguished german physiologist who believes in
vital as distinguished from physical forces but he holds to
spontaneous generation not as he admits because it has been proved
but because the admission of any higher power than nature is
unscientific41
it is inevitable that minds addicted to scientific investigation should
receive a strong bias to undervalue any other kind of evidence except
that of the senses i e scientific evidence we have seen that
those who give themselves up to this tendency come to deny god to deny
mind to deny even self it is true that the great majority of men
scientific as well as others are so much under the control of the laws
of their nature that they cannot go to this extreme the tendency
however of a mind addicted to the consideration of one kind of
evidence to become more or less insensible to other kinds of proof is
undeniable thus even agassiz as a zologist and simply on zological
grounds assumed that there were several zones between the ganges and
the atlantic ocean each having its own flora and fauna and inhabited
by races of men the same in kind but of different origins when told
by the comparative philologists that this was impossible because the
languages spoken through that wide region demonstrated that its
inhabitants must have had a common descent he could only answer that as
ducks quack everywhere he could not see why men should not everywhere
speak the same language
a still more striking illustration is furnished by dr lionel beale the
distinguished english physiologist he has written a book of three
hundred and eightyeight pages for the express purpose of proving that
the phenomena of life instinct and intellect cannot be referred to any
known natural forces he avows his belief that in nature mind governs
matter and in the existence of a neverchanging allseeing
powerdirecting and matterguiding omnipotence he avows his faith in
miracles and those miracles on which christianity is founded
nevertheless his faith in all these points is provisional he says that
a truly scientific man if the maintenance continuity and nature of
life on our planet should at some future time be fully explained without
supposing the existence of any such supernatural omnipotent influence
would be bound to receive the new explanation and might abandon the
old conviction42 that is all evidence of the truths of religion not
founded on nature and perceived by the senses amounts to nothing
now as religion does not rest on the testimony of the senses that is on
scientific evidence the tendency of scientific men is to ignore its
claims we speak only of tendency we rejoice to know or believe that in
hundreds or thousands of scientific men this tendency is counteracted
by their consciousness of manhoodthe conviction that the body is not
the manby the intuitions of the reason and the conscience and by the
grace of god no class of men stands deservedly higher in public
estimation than men of science who while remaining faithful to their
higher nature have enlarged our knowledge of the wonderful works of
god
a second cause of the alienation between science and religion is the
failure to make the due distinction between facts and the explanation of
those facts or the theories deduced from them no sound minded man
disputes any scientific fact religious men believe with agassiz that
facts are sacred they are revelations from god christians sacrifice to
them when duly authenticated their most cherished convictions that
the earth moves no religious man doubts when galileo made that great
discovery the church was right in not yielding at once to the evidence
of an experiment which it did not understand but when the fact was
clearly established no man sets up his interpretation of the bible in
opposition to it religious men admit all the facts connected with our
solar system all the facts of geology and of comparative anatomy and
of biology ought not this to satisfy scientific men must we also admit
their explanations and inferences if we admit that the human embryo
passes through various phases must we admit that man was once a fish
then a bird then a dog then an ape and finally what he now is if we
admit the similarity of structure in all vertebrates must we admit the
evolution of one from another and all from a primordial germ it is to
be remembered that the facts are from god the explanation from men and
the two are often as far apart as heaven and its antipode
these human explanations are not only without authority but they are
very mutable they change not only from generation to generation but
almost as often as the phases of the moon it is a fact that the planets
move once it was said that they were moved by spirits then by
vortexes now by selfevolved forces it is hard that we should be
called upon to change our faith with every new moon the same man
sometimes propounds theories almost as rapidly as the changes of the
kaleidoscope the amiable sir charles lyell englands most
distinguished geologist has published ten editions of his principles
of geology which so differ as to make it hard to believe that it is
the work of the same mind in all the editions up to the tenth he
looked upon geological facts and geological phenomena as proving the
fixity of species and their special creation in time in the tenth
edition just published he announces his change of opinion on this
subject and his conversion to the doctrine of development by law43
in the eighth edition of his work says dr bree sir charles lyell
the nestor of geologists to whom the present generation is more
indebted than to any other for all that is known of geology in its
advanced stage teaches that species have a real existence in nature
and that each was endowed at the time of its creation with the
attributes and organization by which it is now distinguished the
change on the part of this eminent geologist it is to be observed is a
mere change of opinion there was no change of the facts of geology
between the publication of the eighth and of the tenth edition of his
work neither was there any change in his knowledge of those facts all
the facts relied upon by evolutionists have long been familiar to
scientific men the whole change is a subjective one one year the
veteran geologist thinks the facts teach one thing another year he
thinks they teach another it is now the fact and it is feared it will
continue to be a fact that scientific men give the name of science to
their explanations as well as to the facts nay they are often and
naturally more zealous for their explanations than they are for the
facts the facts are gods the explanations are their own
the third cause of the alienation between religion and science is the
bearing of scientific men towards the men of culture who do not belong
to their own class when we in such connections speak of scientific
men we do not mean men of science as such but those only who avow or
manifest their hostility to religion there is an assumption of
superiority and often a manifestation of contempt those who call their
logic or their conjectures into question are stigmatized as
narrowminded bigots old women bible worshippers etc
professor huxleys advice to metaphysicians and theologians is to let
science alone this is his irenicum but do he and his associates let
metaphysics and religion alone they tell the metaphysician that his
vocation is gone there is no such thing as mind and of course no
mental laws to be established metaphysics are merged into physics
professor huxley tells the religious world that there is overwhelming
and crushing evidence scientific evidence of course that no event has
ever occurred on this earth which was not the effect of natural causes
hence there have been no miracles and christ is not risen44 he says
that the doctrine that belief in a personal god is necessary to any
religion worthy of the name is a mere matter of opinion tyndall
carpenter and henry thompson teach that prayer is a superstitious
absurdity herbert spencer whom they call their great philosopher
i e the man who does their thinking labors to prove that there
cannot be a personal god or human soul or self that moral laws are
mere generalizations of utility or as carl vogt says that self
respect and not the will of god is the ground and rule of moral
obligation if any protest be made against such doctrines we are told
that scientific truth cannot be put down by denunciation or as vogt
says by barking so doubtless the pharisees when our blessed lord
called them hypocrites and a generation of vipers and said ye compass
sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him
twofold more the child of hell than yourselves doubtless thought that
that was a poor way to refute their theory that holiness and salvation
were to be secured by churchmembership and churchrites nevertheless
as those words were the words of christ they were a thunderbolt which
reverberates through all time and space and still makes pharisees of
every name and nation tremble huxleys irenicum will not do men who
are assiduously poisoning the fountains of religion morality and
social order cannot be let alone
haeckels irenicum amounts to much the same as that of professor huxley
he forbids the right to speak on these vital subjects to all who are
not thoroughly versed in biology and who are not entirely emancipated
from the trammels of their long cherished traditional beliefs45 this
as the whole context shows means that a man in order to be entitled to
be heard on the evolution theory must be willing to renounce his faith
not only in the bible but in god in the soul in a future life and
become a monistic materialist46
it is very reasonable that scientific men in common with lawyers and
physicians and other professional men should feel themselves entitled
to be heard with special deference on subjects belonging to their
respective departments this deference no one is disposed to deny to men
of science but it is to be remembered that no department of human
knowledge is isolated one runs into and overlaps another we have
abundant evidence that the devotees of natural science are not willing
to confine themselves to the department of nature in the common sense
of that word they not only speculate but dogmatize on the highest
questions of philosophy morality and religion and further admitting
the special claims to deference on the part of scientific men other men
have their rights they have the right to judge of the consistency of
the assertions of men of science and of the logic of their reasoning
they have the right to set off the testimony of one or more experts
against the testimony of others and especially they have the right to
reject all speculations hypotheses and theories which come in
conflict with well established truths it is ground of profound
gratitude to god that he has given to the human mind intuitions which
are infallible laws of belief which men cannot disregard any more than
the laws of nature and also convictions produced by the spirit of god
which no sophistry of man can weaken these are barriers which no man
can pass without plunging into the abyss of outer darkness
if there be any truth in the preceding remarks then it is obvious that
there can be no harmony between science and religion until the evils
referred to be removed scientific men must come to recognize
practically and not merely in words that there are other kinds of
evidence of truth than the testimony of the senses they must come to
give due weight to the testimony of consciousness and to the intuitions
of the reason and conscience they must cease to require the deference
due to established facts to be paid to their speculations and
explanations and they must treat their fellowmen with due respect the
pharisees said to the man whose sight had been restored by christ thou
wast altogether born in sin and dost thou teach us men of science
must not speak thus they must not say to every objector thou art not
scientific and therefore hast no right to speak the true irenicum is
for all parties to give due heed to such words as these if any man
would be wise let him become a fool that he may be wise or these
be converted and become as little children or these the spirit of
truth shall guide you in all truth we are willing to hear this called
cant nevertheless these latter words fell from the lips of him who
spake as never man spake
so much and it is very little on the general question of the relation
of science to religion but what is to be thought of the special
relation of mr darwins theory to the truths of natural and revealed
religion we have already seen that darwinism includes the three
elements evolution natural selection and the denial of design in
nature these points however cannot now be considered separately
it is conceded that a man may be an evolutionist and yet not be an
atheist and may admit of design in nature but we cannot see how the
theory of evolution can be reconciled with the declarations of the
scriptures others may see it and be able to reconcile their allegiance
to science with their allegiance to the bible professor huxley as we
have seen pronounces the thing impossible as all error is antagonistic
to truth if the evolution theory be false it must be opposed to the
truths of religion so far as the two come into contact mr henslow
indeed says science and religion are not antagonistic because they are
in different spheres of thought this is often said by men who do not
admit that there is any thought at all in religion that it is merely a
matter of feeling the fact however is that religion is a system of
knowledge as well as a state of feeling the truths on which all
religion is founded are drawn within the domain of science the nature
of the first cause its relation to the world the nature of second
causes the origin of life anthropology including the origin nature
and destiny of man religion has to fight for its life against a large
class of scientific men all attempts to prevent her exercising her
right to be heard are unreasonable and vain
it should be premised that this paper was written for the single purpose
of answering the question what is darwinism the discussion of the
merits of the theory was not within the scope of the writer what
follows therefore is to be considered only in the light of a practical
conclusion
1 the first objection to the theory is its prim facie incredibility
that a single plant or animal should be developed from a mere cell is
such a wonder that nothing but daily observation of the fact could
induce any man to believe it let any one ask himself suppose this
fact was not thus familiar what amount of speculation of arguments
from analogies possibilities and probabilities could avail to produce
conviction of its truth but who can believe that all the plants and
animals which have ever existed upon the face of the earth have been
evolved from one such germ this is darwins doctrine we are aware that
this apparent impossibility is evaded by the believers in spontaneous
generation who hold that such germ cells may be produced anywhere and
at all times but this is not darwinism darwin wants us to believe that
all living things from the lowly violet to the giant redwoods of
california from the microscopic animalcule to the mastodon the
dinotheriummonsters the very description of which fill us with
horrorbats with wings twenty feet in breadth flying dragons
tortoises ten feet high and eighteen feet long etc etc came one and
all from the same primordial germ this demand is the more unreasonable
when we remember that these living creatures are not only so different
but are as to plants and animals directly opposed in their functions
the function of the plant as biologists express it is to produce
force that of the animal to expend it the plant in virtue of a power
peculiar to itself which no art or skill of man can imitate transmutes
dead inorganic matter into organic matter suited to the sustenance of
animal life and without which animals cannot live the gulf therefore
between the plant and animal would seem to be impassable
further the variations by which the change of species is effected are
so trifling as often to be imperceptible and their accumulation of them
so slow as to evade noticethe time requisite to accomplish any marked
change must be counted by millions or milliards of years here is
another demand on our credulity the apex is reached when we are told
that all these transmutations are effected by chance that is without
purpose or intention taking all these things into consideration we
think it may with moderation be said that a more absolutely
incredible theory was never propounded for acceptance among men
2 there is no pretence that the theory can be proved mr darwin does
not pretend to prove it he admits that all the facts in the case can be
accounted for on the assumption of divine purpose and control all that
he claims for his theory is that it is possible his mode of arguing is
that if we suppose this and that then it may have happened thus and so
amiable and attractive as the man presents himself in his writings it
rouses indignation in one class at least of his readers to see him by
such a mode of arguing reaching conclusions which are subversive of the
fundamental truths of religion
3 another fact cannot fail to attract attention when the theory of
evolution was propounded in 1844 in the vestiges of creation it was
universally rejected when proposed by mr darwin less than twenty
years afterward it was received with acclamation why is this the
facts are now what they were then they were as well known then as they
are now the theory so far as evolution is concerned was then just
what it is now how then is it that what was scientifically false in
1844 is scientifically true in 1864 when a drama is introduced in a
theatre and universally condemned and a little while afterward with a
little change in the scenery it is received with rapturous applause
the natural conclusion is that the change is in the audience and not in
the drama
there is only one cause for the fact referred to that we can think of
the vestiges of creation did not expressly or effectually exclude
design darwin does this is a reason assigned by the most zealous
advocates of his theory for their adoption of it this is the reason
given by bchner by haeckel and by vogt it is assigned also in
express terms by strauss the announcement of whose death has diffused a
feeling of sadness over all who were acquainted with his antecedents in
his last work the old faith and the new he admits that darwins
doctrine is a mere hypothesis that it leaves the main points
unexplained die hupt und cardinalpunkte noch unerklrt sind
nevertheless as he has shown how miracles may be excluded he is to be
applauded as one of the greatest benefactors of the human race p
177 by wunder or miracle strauss means any event for which natural
causes are insufficient to account we philosophers and critical
theologians he says have spoken well when we decreed the abolition
of miracles but our decree machtspruch remained without effect
because we could not show them to be unnecessary inasmuch as we were
unable to indicate any natural force to take their place darwin has
provided or indicated this natural force this process of nature he has
opened the door through which a happier posterity may eject miracles
forever then follows the sentence just quoted he who knows what
hangs on miracle will applaud darwin as one of the greatest benefactors
of the human race with strauss and others of his class miracles and
design are identical because one as well as the other assumes
supernatural agency he quotes helmholtz who says darwins theory
that adaptation in the formation of organisms may arise without the
intervention of intelligence by the blind operation of natural law
and then adds as helmholtz distinguishes the english naturalist as the
man who has banished design from nature so we have praised him as the
man who has done away with miracles both mean the same thing47
design is the miracleworker in nature which has put the world upside
down or as spinoza says has placed the last first the effect for the
cause and thus destroyed the very idea of nature design in nature
especially in the department of living organisms has ever been appealed
to by those who desire to prove that the world is not selfevolved but
the work of an intelligent creator p 211 on page 175 he refers to
those who ridicule darwin and yet are so far under the influence of the
spirit of the age as to deny miracles or the intervention of the creator
in the course of nature and says very well how do they account for
the origin of man and in general the development of the organic out of
the inorganic would they assume that the original man as such no
matter how rough and unformed but still a man sprang immediately out
of the inorganic out of the sea or the slime of the nile they would
hardly venture to say that then they must know that there is only the
choice between miracle the divine hand of the creator and darwin
what an alternative the creator or darwin in this however strauss is
right to banish design from nature as is done by darwins theory is
in the language of the rev walter mitchell virtually to dethrone the
creator
ludwig weis m d of darmstadt says it is at present the mode in
germany and of course in a measure here to glorify buddhism
strauss he adds says nature knows itself in man and in that he
expresses the thought which all idealism and all materialism make the
grand end to the same effect it is said in man the all comprehends
itself as conscious being comes to selfconsciousness or in man the
absolute knowledge wissen the act of knowing appears in the limits of
personality this was the doctrine of the buddhist and of the ancient
chinese thus as dr weis says in the nineteenth century of the
christian era philosophers and scientists have reached the point where
the chinese were two thousand years ago
the only way that is apparent for accounting for evolution being
rejected in 1844 and for its becoming a popular doctrine in 1866 is
that it happens to suit a prevailing state of mind it is a fact so far
as our limited knowledge extends that no one is willing to acknowledge
himself not simply an evolutionist but an evolutionist of the
darwinian school who is not either a materialist by profession or a
disciple of herbert spencer or an advocate of the philosophy of hume
there is another significant fact which goes to prove that the denial
of design which is the creative idea of darwinism is the main cause
of its popularity and success professor owen englands greatest
naturalist is a derivationist derivation and evolution are convertible
terms both include the denial that species are primordial or have each
a different origin and both imply that one species is formed out of
another and simpler form professor owen however although a
derivationist or evolutionist is a very strenuous antidarwinian he
differs from darwin as to two points first as to natural selection or
the survival of the fittest he says that is inconsistent with facts and
utterly insufficient to account for the origin of species he refers the
origin of species to an inherent tendency to change impressed on them
from the beginning and second he admits design he denies that the
succession and origin of species are due to chance and expresses his
belief in the constant operation of creative power in the formation of
species from the varied descendants of more generalized forms48 he
believes that all living things have been produced by such law of
variation in time their position and uses in the world having been
preordained by the creator49 professor owen says he has taught the
doctrine of derivation evolution for thirty years but it attracted
little attention as soon however as darwin leaves out design we have
a prairiefire a prairiefire happily does not continue very long
and while it lasts it burns up little else than stubble
4 all the evidence we have in favor of the fixedness of species is of
course evidence not only against darwinism but against evolution in
all its forms it would seem idle to discuss the question of the
mutability of species until satisfied what species is this unhappily
is a question which it is exceedingly difficult to answer not only do
the definitions given by scientific men differ almost indefinitely but
there is endless diversity in classification think of four hundred and
eighty species of hummingbirds haeckel says that one naturalist makes
ten another forty another two hundred and another one species of a
certain fossil and we have just heard that agassiz had collected eight
hundred species of the same fossil animal haeckel also says p 246
that there are no two zologists or any two botanists who agree
altogether in their classification mr darwin says no clear line of
demarcation has yet been drawn between species and subspecies and
varieties p 61 it is absolutely necessary therefore that a
distinction should be made between artificial and natural species no
man asserts the immutability of all those varieties of plants and
animals which naturalists for the convenience of classification may
call distinct species haeckel for example gives a list of twelve
species of man so any one may make fifty species of dogs or of horses
this is a mere artificial distinction which amounts to nothing there
is far greater difference between a pouter and a carrier pigeon than
between a caucasian and a mongolian to call the former varieties of the
same species and the latter distinct species is altogether arbitrary
nevertheless notwithstanding the arbitrary classifications of
naturalists it remains true that there are what professor dana calls
units of the organic world when individuals multiply from generation
to generation it is but a repetition of the primordial typeidea and
the true notion of the species is not in the resulting group but in
the idea or potential element which is the basis of every individual of
the group50 dr mortons definition of species as primordial
organic forms agrees with that given by professor dana and both agree
with the bible which says that god created plants and animals each
after its kind a primordial form is a form which was not evolved out of
some other form but which began to be in the formsubject to such
varieties as we see in the dog horse and manin which it continued
during the whole period of its existence
the criteria of these primordial forms or species of nature are 1
morphological animals however may approach very nearly in their
structure and yet belong to different species it is only when the
peculiarities of structure are indicative of specialty of design that
they form a safe ground of classification if the teeth of one animal
are formed to fit it to feed on flesh and those of another to fit it to
feed on plants if one has webbed feet and another not then in all
such cases difference of structure proves difference of kind 2
physiological that is the internal nature indicated by habits and
instincts furnishes another safe criterion 3 permanent fecundity
the progenitors of the same species reproduce their kind from generation
to generation the progeny of different species although nearly allied
do not it is a fixed law of nature that species never can be
annihilated except by all the individuals included in them dying out
and that new species cannot be produced every true species is
primordial it is this fact that is that no variety with the
essential characteristics of species has ever been produced that
forces as we saw above professor huxley to pronounce mr darwins
doctrine to be an unproved hypothesis species continue varieties if
let alone always revert to the normal type it requires the skill and
constant attention of man to keep them distinct
now that there are such forms in nature is proved not only from the
testimony of the great body of the most distinguished naturalists but
by all the facts in the case
first the fact that such species are known to have existed unchanged
through what geologists consider almost immeasurable periods of time
palontologists tell us that trilobites abounded from the primordial age
down to the carboniferous period that is as they suppose through
millions of years more wonderful still the little animals whose
remains constitute the chalk formations which are spread over large
areas of country and are sometimes a hundred feet thick are now at
work at the bottom of the atlantic principal dawson tells us with
regard to mollusks existing in a subfossil state in the postpliocene
clays of canada that after carefully studying about two hundred
species and of some of these many hundreds of specimens i have
arrived at the conclusion that they are absolutely unchanged here
again we have an absolute refusal on the part of all these animals to
admit that they are derived or have tended to sport into new
species51
on the previous page he says pictet catalogues ninetyeight species of
mammals which inhabited europe in the postglacial period of these
fiftyseven still exist unchanged and the remainder have disappeared
not one can be shown to have been modified into a new form though some
of them have been obliged by changes of temperature and other
conditions to remove into distant and now widely separated regions
a second fact which attests the primordial character and fixedness of
species is that every species as it first appears is not in a
transition state between one form and another but in the perfection of
its kind science has indeed discovered an ascending order in creation
which agrees marvellously with that given in the book of genesis first
vegetable productions then the moving creatures in the sea then
terrestrial animals and finally man naturalists who utterly reject
the scriptures as a divine revelation speak with the highest admiration
of the mosaic account of the creation as compared with any other
cosmogony of the ancient world while there is in general an ascending
series in these living forms each was perfect in its kind
agassiz says that fishes existed contemporaneously with species of all
the invertebrate subkingdoms in the taconic or subcambrian strata
this is the extreme limit of known geological strata in which life is
found to have existed as the evolution of one species out of another
requires according to darwin millions of years it is out of the
question to trace these animals beyond the strata in which their remains
are now found yet crabs or lobsters worms cuttlefish snails
jellyfish starfish oysters the polyps lived contemporaneously with
the first known vertebrate animals that ever came into beingall as
clearly defined by unmistakable ordinal or special characters as they
are at the present moment52
the foot of the horse is considered by zologists as one of the most
beautiful contrivances in nature the remains of this animal found in
what is called the pliocene period show the foot to have been as
perfect then as it is now
mr wallace says that man has existed on the earth a hundred thousand
years and that it is probable that he existed four hundred thousand
years ago of course we do not believe this we have little faith in the
chronology of science it gives no sure data for the calculation of
time hence we find them differing from four thousand to four hundred
thousand years as to the time required for certain formations the most
trustworthy geologists teach that all that is known of the antiquity of
man falls within the limits of biblical chronology the further
however darwinians push back the origin of man the stronger as
against them becomes the argument for the immutability of species the
earliest remains of man show that at his first appearance he was in
perfection the oldest known human skull is that called the engis
because found in the cave of engis in belgium of this skull professor
huxley says it may have belonged to an individual of one of the existing
races of men principal dawson who has a cast of it on the same shelf
with the skulls of some algonquin indians says it might be taken for
the skull of an american indian indeed dawson seems to think that
these fossil human remains go to show that the earliest men were better
developed than any of the extant races
thirdly the historical evidence accessible all goes to prove the
immutability of species the earliest historical records and the oldest
monuments prove that all extant animals were what they now are thousands
of years ago
fourthly the fact that hybrids cannot be perpetuated that no device of
man can produce a new species is proof that god has fixed limits which
cannot be passed this huxley himself admits to be an insuperable
objection so long as it exists he says darwins doctrine must be
content to remain a hypothesis it cannot pretend to the dignity of a
theory another fact of like import is that varieties artificially
produced if let alone uniformly revert to the simple typical form it
is only by the utmost care they can be kept distinct all the highly
prized varieties of horses cattle sheep pigeons etc without human
control would be merged each class into one with only the slight
differences occasioned by diversities of climate and other external
conditions if in the sight of man it is important that the words of a
book should be kept distinct it is equally evident that in the sight of
god it is no less important that the units of nature should not be
mixed in inextricable and indistinguishable confusion
fifthly the sudden appearance of new kinds of animals is another fact
which palontologists urge against the doctrine of evolution according
to the view of geologists great changes have at remote periods
occurred in the state of the earth continents have been submerged and
the bottom of the sea raised above the surface of the waters
corresponding changes have occurred in the state of the atmosphere
surrounding the globe and in the temperature of the earth accompanying
or following these revolutions new classes of plants and animals appear
adapted to the new condition of the earths surface whence do they
come they have as dawson expresses it neither fathers nor mothers
nothing precedes them from which they could be derived and nothing of
the same kind follows them they live through their appointed period
and then in a multitude of cases finally disappear and are in their
turn followed by new orders or kinds in other words the links or
connecting forms of this assumed regular succession or derivation are
not to be found this fact is so patent that hugh miller when arguing
against the doctrine of evolution as proposed in the vestiges of
creation says that the record in the rocks seems to have been written
for the very purpose of proving that such evolution is impossible
we have the explicit testimony of agassiz as a palontologist that the
facts of geology contradict the theory of the transmutation of species
this testimony has been repeatedly given and in various forms in the
last production of his pen he says as a palontologist i have from
the beginning stood aloof from this new theory of transmutation now so
widely admitted by the scientific world its doctrines in fact
contradict what the animal forms buried in the rocky strata of our earth
tell us of their own introduction and succession upon the surface of the
globe let us look now at the earliest vertebrates as known and
recorded in geological surveys they should of course if there is any
truth in the transmutation theory correspond with the lowest in rank or
standing what then are the earliest known vertebrates they are
selachians sharks and their allies and ganoids garpikes and the
like the highest of all living fishes structurally speaking he
closes the article from which these quotations are taken with the
assertion that there is no evidence of a direct descent of later from
earlier species in the geological succession of animals53 it will be
observed that agassiz is quoted not as to matters of theory but as to
matters of fact the only answer which evolutionists can make to this
argument is the imperfection of the geological record when asked
where are the immediate predecessors of these new species they answer
they have disappeared or have not yet been found when asked where
are their immediate successors the answer again is they have
disappeared54 this is an objection which mr darwin with his usual
candor virtually admits to be unanswerable we have already seen that
he says every one will admit that the geological record is imperfect
but very few can believe that it is so very imperfect as my theory
demands
such are some of the grounds on which geologists and palontologists of
the highest rank assert that the theory of evolution has not the
slightest scientific basis and they support their assertion with an
amount of evidence of which the above items are a miserable pittance
sixthly there is another consideration of decisive importance strauss
says there are three things which have been stumblingblocks in the way
of science first the origin of life second the origin of
consciousness third the origin of reason these are equivalent to the
gaps which principal dawson says exist in the theory of evolution he
states them thus 1 that between dead and living matter 2 that
between vegetable and animal life these are necessarily the converse
of each other the one deoxidizes and accumulates the other oxidizes
and expends 3 that between any species of plant or animal and any
other species it was this gap and this only which darwin undertook to
fill up by his great work on the origin of species but notwithstanding
the immense amount of material thus expended it yawns as wide as ever
since it must be admitted that no case has been ascertained in which an
individual of one species has transgressed the limits between it and
another species 4 another gap is between the nature of the animal
and the selfconscious reasoning and moral nature of man pp
325328
first as to the gap between death and life this is what dr stirling
calls the gulf of all gulfs which mr huxleys protoplasm is as
powerless to efface as any other material expedient that has ever been
suggested55 this gulf mr darwin does not attempt to bridge over he
admits that life owes its origin to the act of the creator this
however the most prominent of the advocates of darwinism say is giving
up the whole controversy if you admit the intervention of creative
power at one point you may as well admit it in any other if life owes
its origin to creative power why not species if the stupendous miracle
of creation be admitted there is no show of reason for denying
supernatural intervention in the operations of nature most darwinians
attempt to pass this gulf on the imaginary bridge of spontaneous
generation in other words they say there is no gulf there the
molecules of matter in one combination may as well exhibit the
phenomena of life as in other combinations any other kind of
phenomena the distinguished sir william thomson cannot trust himself to
that bridge dead matter he says cannot become living matter
without coming under the influence of matter previously alive this
seems to me as sure a teaching of science as the law of gravitation
i am ready to adopt as an article of scientific faith true through all
space and through all time that life proceeds from life and nothing
but life56 he refers the origin of life on this earth to falling
meteors which bring with them from other planets the germs of living
organisms and from those germs all the plants and animals with which
our world is now covered have been derived principal dawson thinks that
this was intended as irony but the whole tone of the address and
specially of the closing portion of it in which this idea is advanced
is far too serious to admit of such an explanation
no one can read the address referred to without being impressed and
even awed by the immensity and grandeur of the field of knowledge which
falls legitimately within the domain of science the perusal of that
discourse produces a feeling of humility analogous to the sense of
insignificance which every man experiences when he thinks of himself as
a speck on the surface of the earth which itself is but a speck in the
immensity of the universe and when a man of mere ordinary culture sees
sir william thomson surveying that field with a mastery of its details
and familiarity with all the recondite methods of its investigation he
feels as nothing in his presence yet this great man whom we cannot
help regarding with wonder is so carried away by the spirit of his
class as to say science is bound by the everlasting law of honor to
face fearlessly every problem which can fairly be brought before it if
a probable solution consistent with the ordinary course of nature can
be found we must not invoke an abnormal act of creative power and
therefore instead of invoking creative power he accounts for the
origin of life on earth by falling meteors how he accounts for its
origin in the places whence the meteors came he does not say yet sir
william thomson believes in creative power and in a subsequent page we
shall quote his explicit repudiation of the atheistic element in the
darwinian theory
strauss quotes duboisreymond a distinguished naturalist as teaching
that the first of these great problems viz the origin of life admits
of explanation on scientific i e in his sense materialistic
principles and even the third viz the origin of reason but the
second or the origin of consciousness he says is perfectly
inscrutable duboisreymond holds that the most accurate knowledge of
the essential organism reveals to us only matter in motion but between
this material movement and my feeling pain or pleasure experiencing a
sweet taste seeing red with the conclusion therefore i exist there
is a profound gulf and it remains utterly and forever inconceivable
why to a number of atoms of carbon hydrogen etc it should not be a
matter of indifference how they lie or how they move nor can we in any
wise tell how consciousness should result from their concurrent action
whether adds strauss these verba magistri are indeed the last word
on the subject time only can tell57 but if it is inconceivable not
to say absurd that senseconsciousness should consist in the motion of
molecules of matter or be a function of such molecules it can hardly
be less absurd to account for thought conscience and religious
feeling and belief on any such hypothesis it may be said that mr
darwin is not responsible for these extreme opinions that is very true
mr darwin is not a monist for in admitting creation he admits a
dualism as between god and the world neither is he a materialist
inasmuch as he assumes a supernatural origin for the infinitesimal
modicum of life and intelligence in the primordial animalcule from
which without divine purpose or agency all living things in the whole
history of our earth have descended all the innumerable varieties of
plants all the countless forms of animals with all their instincts and
faculties all the varieties of men with their intellectual endowments
and their moral and religious nature have according to darwin been
evolved by the agency of the blind unconscious laws of nature this
infinitesimal spark of supernaturalism in mr darwins theory would
inevitably have gone out of itself had it not been rudely and
contemptuously trodden out by his bolder and more logical successors
the grand and fatal objection to darwinism is this exclusion of design
in the origin of species or the production of living organisms by
design is meant the intelligent and voluntary selection of an end and
the intelligent and voluntary choice application and control of means
appropriate to the accomplishment of that end that design therefore
implies intelligence is involved in its very nature no man can
perceive this adaptation of means to the accomplishment of a
preconceived end without experiencing an irresistible conviction that
it is the work of mind no man does doubt it and no man can doubt it
darwin does not deny it haeckel does not deny it no darwinian denies
it what they do is to deny that there is any design in nature it is
merely apparent as when the wind of the bay of biscay as huxley says
selects the right kind of sand and spreads it in heaps upon the
plains but in thus denying design in nature these writers array
against themselves the intuitive perceptions and irresistible
convictions of all mankinda barrier which no man has ever been able
to surmount sir william thomson in the address already referred to
says i feel profoundly convinced that the argument of design has been
greatly too much lost sight of in recent zological speculations
reaction against the frivolities of teleology such as are to be found
not rarely in the notes of the learned commentators on paleys natural
theology has i believe had a temporary effect of turning attention
from the solid irrefragable argument so well put forward in that
excellent old book but overpowering proof of intelligence and
benevolent design lie all around us and if ever perplexities whether
metaphysical or scientific turn us away from them for a time they come
back upon us with irresistible force showing to us through nature the
influence of a free will and teaching us that all living beings depend
upon one everacting creator and ruler
it is impossible for even mr darwin inconsistent as it is with his
whole theory to deny all design in the constitution of nature what is
his law of heredity why should like beget like take two germ cells
one of a plant another of an animal no man by microscope or by
chemical analysis or by the magic power of the spectroscope can detect
the slightest difference between them yet the one infallibly develops
into a plant and the other into an animal take the germ of a fish and
of a bird and they are equally indistinguishable yet the one always
under all conditions develops into a fish and the other into a bird
why is this there is no physical force whether light heat
electricity or anything else which makes the slightest approximation
to accounting for that fact to say as stuart mill would say that it
is an ultimate fact and needs no explanation is to say that there may
be an effect without an adequate cause the venerable r e von baer
the first naturalist in russia of whom agassiz speaks in terms of such
affectionate veneration in the atlantic monthly for january 1874 has
written a volume dated dorpat 1873 and entitled zum streit ber den
darwinismus in that volume as we learn from a german periodical the
author says the darwinians lay great stress on heredity but what is
the law of heredity but a determination of something future is it not
in its nature in the highest degree teleological indeed is not the
whole faculty of reproduction intended to introduce a new lifeprocess
when a man looks at a dissected insect and examines its strings of eggs
and asks whence are they the naturalist of our day has no answer to
give but that they were of necessity gradually produced by the changes
in matter when it is further asked why are they there is it wrong to
say it is in order that when the eggs are mature and fertilized new
individuals of the same form should be produced
it is further to be considered that there are innumerable cases of
contrivance or evidence of design in nature to which the principle of
natural selection or the purposeless changes effected by unconscious
force cannot apply as for example the distinction of sex with all
that is therein involved but passing by such cases it may be asked
what would it avail to get rid of design in the vegetable and animal
kingdom while the whole universe is full of it that this ordered
cosmos is not from necessity or chance is almost a selfevident fact
not one man in a million of those who ever heard of god either does
doubt or can doubt it besides how are the cosmical relations of light
heat electricity to the constituent parts of the universe and
especially so far as this earth is concerned to vegetable and animal
life to be accounted for is this all chance work is it by chance that
light and heat cause plants to carry on their wonderful operations
transmuting the inorganic into the organic dead matter into living and
life sustaining matter is it without a purpose that water instead of
contracting expands at the freezing pointa fact to which is due that
the earth north of the tropic is habitable for man or beast it is no
answer to this question to say that a few other substances have the same
peculiarity when no good end that we can see is thereby accomplished
no man is so foolish as to deny that his eye was intended to enable him
to see because he cannot tell what the spleen was made for it is
however useless to dwell upon this subject if a man denies that there
is design in nature he can with quite as good reason deny that there is
any design in any or in all the works ever executed by man
the conclusion of the whole matter is that the denial of design in
nature is virtually the denial of god mr darwins theory does deny all
design in nature therefore his theory is virtually atheistical his
theory not he himself he believes in a creator but when that creator
millions on millions of ages ago did somethingcalled matter and a
living germ into existenceand then abandoned the universe to itself
to be controlled by chance and necessity without any purpose on his
part as to the result or any intervention or guidance then he is
virtually consigned so far as we are concerned to nonexistence it
has already been said that the most extreme of mr darwins admirers
adopt and laud his theory for the special reason that it banishes god
from the world that it enables them to account for design without
referring it to the purpose or agency of god this is done expressly by
bchner haeckel vogt and strauss the opponents of darwinism direct
their objections principally against this element of the doctrine this
as was stated by rev dr peabody was the main ground of the earnest
opposition of agassiz to the theory americas great botanist dr asa
gray avows himself an evolutionist but he is not a darwinian of that
point we have the clearest possible proof mr darwin after explicitly
denying that the variations which have resulted in the formation of the
most perfectly adapted animals in the world man included were
intentionally and specially guided adds however much we may wish it
we can hardly follow professor asa gray in his belief that variation
has been led along certain beneficial lines like a stream along
definite and useful lines of irrigation58 if mr darwin does not
agree with dr gray dr gray does not agree with mr darwin it is as
to the exclusion of design from the operations of nature that our
american differs from the english naturalist this is the vital point
the denial of final causes is the formative idea of darwins theory and
therefore no teleologist can be a darwinian
dr gray quotes from another writer the sentence it is a singular
fact that when we can find how anything is done our first conclusion
seems to be that god did not do it and then adds i agree with the
writer that this first conclusion is premature and unworthy i will add
deplorable through what faults of dogmatism on the one hand and
skepticism on the other it came to be so thought we need not here
consider let us hope and i confidently expect that it is not to last
that the religious faith which survived without a shock the notion of
the fixedness of the earth itself may equally outlast the notion of the
absolute fixedness of the species which inhabit it that in the future
even more than in the past faith in an order which is the basis of
science will notas it cannot reasonablybe dissevered from faith in
an ordainer which is the basis of religion59 we thank god for
that sentence it is the concluding sentence of dr grays address as
expresident of the american association for the advancement of
science delivered august 1872
dr gray goes further he says the proposition that the things and
events in nature were not designed to be so if logically carried out
is doubtless tantamount to atheism again to us a fortuitous cosmos
is simply inconceivable the alternative is a designed cosmos if mr
darwin believes that the events which he supposes to have occurred and
the results we behold around us were undirected and undesigned or if
the physicist believes that the natural forces to which he refers
phenomena are uncaused and undirected no argument is needed to show
that such belief is atheistic60
we have thus arrived at the answer to our question what is darwinism
it is atheism this does not mean as before said that mr darwin
himself and all who adopt his views are atheists but it means that his
theory is atheistic that the exclusion of design from nature is as dr
gray says tantamount to atheism
among the last words of strauss were these we demand for our universe
the same piety which the devout man of old demanded for his god in
the enormous machine of the universe amid the incessant whirl and hiss
of its jagged iron wheels amid the deafening crash of its ponderous
stamps and hammers in the midst of this whole terrific commotion man
a helpless and defenceless creature finds himself placed not secure
for a moment that on an imprudent motion a wheel may not seize and rend
him or a hammer crush him to a powder this sense of abandonment is at
first something awful61
among the last words of paul were these i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed
unto him against that day the time of my departure is at hand i
have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the
faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness
which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not
to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing

as he commonly calls it the descendence theory he dismisses the
objections derived from religion as unworthy of notice with the remark
that all glaube ist aberglaube all faith is superstition the
objections from a priori or intuitive truths are disposed of in an
equally summary manner by denying that there are any such truths and
asserting that all our knowledge is from the senses the objection that

the great theological work of the age
dr hodges theology
systematic theology
by charles hodge dd lld
of princeton theological seminary
complete in three volumes 8vo tinted paper price vols i and ii
450 vol iii 5
in these volumes are comprised the results of the lifelong labors and
investigations of one of the most eminent theologians of the age the
work covers the ground usually occupied by treatises on systematic
theology and adopts the commonly received divisions of the
subjecttheology vol i anthropology vol ii soteriology and
eschatology vol iii
the introduction is devoted to the consideration of preliminary matters
such as method or the principles which should guide the student of
theology and the different theories as to the source and standard of
our knowledge of divine things rationalism mysticism the roman
catholic doctrine of the rule of faith and the protestant doctrine on
that subject
the department of theology proper includes the origin of the idea of
god the being of god the antitheistic systems of atheism polytheism
materialism and pantheism the nature of god the divine attributes
the doctrines of the trinity the divinity of christ and of the holy
spirit the decrees of god creation providence and miracles
the department of anthropology includes the nature origin and
antiquity of man his primitive state and probation the fall the
effect of adams sin upon himself and upon his posterity the nature of
sin the different philosophical and theological theories on that
subject
soteriology includes the plan or purpose of god in reference to the
salvation of men the person and work of the redeemer his offices as
prophet priest and king the work of the holy spirit in applying the
redemption purchased by christ common and efficacious grace
regeneration faith justification sanctification the law or rule of
life and the means of grace
eschatology includes the state of the soul after death the second
coming of christ the resurrection of the body the general judgment and
end of the world and the doctrine concerning heaven and hell
the plan of the author is to state and vindicate the teachings of the
bible on these various subjects and to examine the antagonistic
doctrines of different classes of theologians his book therefore is
intended to be both didactic and elenchtic
the various topics are discussed with that close and keen analytical and
logical power combined with that simplicity lucidity and strength of
style which have already given dr hodge a worldwide reputation as a
controversialist and writer and as an investigator of the great
theological problems of the day

introduction though the production of a man of most profound and
extensive learning and knowledge of the world is not as much designed
for the professional scholar as for intelligent readers of all classes
who take an interest in the history of bygone ages and are inclined
there to seek information that may guide them safely through the
perplexing mazes of modern history
critical notices
     a work of the very highest merit its learning is exact and
     profound its narrative full of genius and skill its descriptions
     of men are admirably vivid we wish to place on record our opinion
     that dr mommsens is by far the best history of the decline and
     fall of the roman commonwealthlondon times
     since the days of niebuhr no work on roman history has appeared
     that combines so much to attract instruct and charm the reader
     its stylea rare quality in a german authoris vigorous
     spirited and animated professor mommsens work can stand a
     comparison with the noblest productions of modern historydr
     schmitz
     this is the best history of the roman republic taking the work on
     the wholethe authors complete mastery of his subject the
     variety of his gifts and acquirements his graphic power in the
     delineation of national and individual character and the vivid
     interest which he inspires in every portion of his book he is

another great historical work
the history of greece
by prof dr ernst curtius
translated by adolphus william ward ma fellow of st peters
college cambridge prof of history in owens college manchester
to be completed in four or five vols crown 8vo at 250 per volume
printed upon tinted paper uniform with mommsens history of rome and
the library edition of froudes history of england
vols i ii iii and iv now ready
curtius history of greece is similar in plan and purpose to mommsens
history of rome with which it deserves to rank in every respect as
one of the great masterpieces of historical literature avoiding the
minute details which overburden other similar works it groups together
in a very picturesque manner all the important events in the history of
this kingdom which has exercised such a wonderful influence upon the
worlds civilization the narrative of prof curtius work is flowing
and animated and the generalizations although bold are philosophical
and sound
critical notices
     professor curtius eminent scholarship is a sufficient guarantee
     for the trustworthiness of his history while the skill with which
     he groups his facts and his effective mode of narrating them
     combine to render it no less readable than sound professor curtius
     everywhere maintains the true dignity and impartiality of history
     and it is evident his sympathies are on the side of justice
     humanity and progresslondon athenum
     we can not express our opinion of dr curtius book better than by
     saying that it may be fitly ranked with theodor mommsens great
     worklondon spectator
     as an introduction to the study of grecian history no previous
     work is comparable to the present for vivacity and picturesque
     beauty while in sound learning and accuracy of statement it is not
     inferior to the elaborate productions which enrich the literature
     of the agen y daily tribune
     the history of greece is treated by dr curtius so broadly and
     freely in the spirit of the nineteenth century that it becomes in
     his hands one of the worthiest and most instructive branches of
     study for all who desire something more than a knowledge of
     isolated facts for their education this translation ought to
     become a regular part of the accepted course of reading for young
     men at college and for all who are in training for the free
     political life of our countryn y evening post
