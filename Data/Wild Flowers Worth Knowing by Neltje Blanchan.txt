preface
a still more popular edition of what has proved to the author to be a
surprisingly popular book has been prepared by the able hand of mr asa
don dickinson and is now offered in the hope that many more people will
find the wild flowers in natures garden all about us well worth
knowing for flowers have distinct objects in life and are everything
they are for the most justifiable of reasons ie the perpetuation
and the improvement of their species the means they employ to
accomplish these ends are so various and so consummately clever that in
learning to understand them we are brought to realize how similar they
are to the fundamental aims of even the human race indeed there are few
life principles that plants have not worked out satisfactorily the
problems of adapting oneself to ones environment of insuring healthy
families of starting ones children well in life of founding new
colonies in distant lands of the cooperative method of conducting
business as opposed to the individualistic of laying up treasure in the
bank for future use of punishing vice and rewarding virtuethese and
many other problems of mankind the flowers have worked out with the help
of insects through the ages to really understand what the wild flowers
are doing what the scheme of each one is besides looking beautiful is
to give one a broader sympathy with both man and nature and to add a
real interest and joy to life which cannot be too widely shared

wading into shallow water or standing on some muddy shore like a heron
this striking plant so often found in that birds haunts is quite as
decorative in a picture and happily far more approachable in life
indeed one of the comforts of botany as compared with bird study is
that we may get close enough to the flowers to observe their last
detail whereas the bird we have followed laboriously over hill and
dale through briers and swamps darts away beyond the range of
fieldglasses with tantalizing swiftness
while no single plant is yet thoroughly known to scientists in spite of
the years of study devoted by specialists to separate groups no plant
remains wholly meaningless when keppler discovered the majestic order
of movement of the heavenly bodies he exclaimed o god i think thy
thoughts after theethe expression of a discipleship every reverent
soul must be conscious of in penetrating be it ever so little a way
into the inner meaning of the humblest wayside weed
any plant which elects to grow in shallow water must be amphibious it
must be able to breathe beneath the surface as the fish do and also be
adapted to thrive without those parts that correspond to gills for
ponds and streams have an unpleasant way of drying up in summer
leaving it stranded on the shore this accounts in part for the
variable leaves on the arrowhead those underneath the water being
long and ribbonlike to bring the greatest possible area into contact
with the air with which the water is charged broad leaves would be
torn to shreds by the current through which grasslike blades glide
harmlessly but when this plant grows on shore having no longer use
for its lower ribbons it loses them and expands only broad
arrowshaped surfaces to the sunny air leaves to be supplied with
carbonic acid to assimilate and sunshine to turn off the oxygen and
store up the carbon into their system

a jollylooking preacher is jack standing erect in his particolored
pulpit with a soundingboard over his head but he is a gay deceiver a
wolf in sheeps clothing literally a brother to dragons an arrant
upstart an ingrate a murderer of innocent benefactors female
botanizing classes pounce upon it as they would upon a pious young
clergyman complains mr ellwanger a poor relation of the stately
calla lily one knows jack to be at a glance her lovely white robe
corresponding to his striped pulpit her bright yellow spadix to his
sleek reverence in the damp woodlands where his pulpit is erected
beneath leafy cathedral arches minute flies or gnats recently emerged
from maggots in mushrooms toadstools or decaying logs form the main
part of his congregation
now to drop the clerical simile let us peep within the sheathing
spathe or better still strip it off altogether doctor torrey states
that the darkstriped spathes are the fertile plants those with green
and whitish lines sterile within are smooth glossy columns and near
the base of each we shall find the true flowers minute affairs some
staminate others on distinct plants pistillate the berry bearers or
rarely both male and female florets seated on the same club as if
jacks elaborate plan to prevent selffertilization were not yet
complete plants may be detected in process of evolution toward their
ideals just as nations and men are doubtless when jacks mechanism is
perfected his guilt will disappear a little way above the florets the
club enlarges abruptly forming a projecting ledge that effectually
closes the avenue of escape for many a guileless victim a fungous gnat
enticed perhaps by the striped house of refuge from cold spring winds
and with a prospect of food below enters and slides down the inside
walls or the slippery colored column in either case descent is very
easy it is the return that is made so difficult if not impossible for
the tiny visitors squeezing past the projecting ledge the gnat finds
himself in a roomy apartment whose floorthe bottom of the pulpitis
dusted over with fine pollen that is if he is among staminate flowers
already mature to get some of that pollen with which the gnat
presently covers himself transferred to the minute pistillate florets
waiting for it in a distant chamber is of course jacks whole aim in
enticing visitors within his polished walls but what means are provided
for their escape their efforts to crawl upward over the slippery
surface only land them weak and discouraged where they started the
projecting ledge overhead prevents them from using their wings the
passage between the ledge and the spathe is far too narrow to permit
flight now if a gnat be persevering he will presently discover a gap
in the flap where the spathe folds together in front and through this
tiny opening he makes his escape only to enter another pulpit like the
trusted but too trusting messenger he is and leave some of the
vitalizing pollen on the fertile florets awaiting his coming
but suppose the fly small as he is is too large to work his way out
through the flap or too bewildered or stupid to find the opening or
too exhausted after his futile efforts to get out through the overhead
route to persevere or too weak with hunger in case of long detention in
a pistillate trap where no pollen is what then open a dozen of jacks
pulpits and in several at least dead victims will be foundpathetic
little corpses sacrificed to the imperfection of his executive system
had the flies entered mature spathes whose walls had spread outward and
away from the polished column flight through the overhead route might
have been possible however glad we may be to make every due allowance
for this sacrifice of the higher life to the lower as only a temporary
imperfection of mechanism incidental to the plants higher development
jacks present cruelty shocks us no less or it may be he will become
insectivorous like the pitcher plant in time he comes from a rascally
family anyhow his cousin the cuckoopint as is well known destroys
the winged messenger bearing its offspring to plant fresh colonies in a
distant bog because the decayed body of the bird acts as the best
possible fertilizer into which the seedling may strike its roots
in june and july the thickset club studded over with bright berries
becomes conspicuous to attract hungry woodland rovers in the hope that
the seeds will be dropped far from the parent plant the indians used to
boil the berries for food the farinaceous root corm they likewise
boiled or dried to extract the stinging blistering juice leaving an
edible little turnip however insipid and starchy

this despised relative of the stately calla lily proclaims spring in the
very teeth of winter being the first bold adventurer above ground when
the lovely hepatica the first flower worthy the name to appear is
still wrapped in her fuzzy furs the skunk cabbages dark incurved
horn shelters within its hollow tiny malodorous florets why is the
entire plant so foetid that one flees the neighborhood pervaded as it
is with an odor that combines a suspicion of skunk putrid meat and
garlic after investigating the carrionflower and the purple trillium
among others we learned that certain flies delight in foul odors
loathsome to higher organisms that plants dependent on these pollen
carriers woo them from long distances with a stench and in addition
sometimes try to charm them with color resembling the sort of meat it is
their special mission with the help of beetles and other scavengers of
nature to remove from the face of the earth in such marshy ground as
the skunk cabbage lives in many small flies and gnats live in embryo
under the fallen leaves during the winter but even before they are
warmed into active life the hivebees natives of europe and with
habits not perfectly adapted as yet to our flora are out after pollen
after the flowering time come the vivid green crowns of leaves that at
least please the eye lizards make their home beneath them and many a
yellowthroat taking advantage of the plants foul odor gladly puts up
with it herself and builds her nest in the hollow of the cabbage as a
protection for her eggs and young from fourfooted enemies cattle let
the plant alone because of the stinging acrid juices secreted by it
although such tender fresh bright foliage must be especially tempting
like the hellebores after a dry winter diet sometimes tiny insects
are found drowned in the wells of rain water that accumulate at the base
of the grooved leafstalks

grace of habit and the bright beauty of its long blue spikes of ragged

backwoodsmen will tell you that pickerels lay their eggs among the
leaves but so they do among the sedges arums wild rice and various
aquatic plants like many another fish bees and flies that congregate
about the blossoms to feed may sometimes fly too low and so give a
plausible reason for the pickerels choice of haunt each blossom lasts
but a single day the upper portion withering leaves the base of the
perianth to harden about the ovary and protect the solitary seed but as
the gradually lengthened spike keeps up an uninterrupted succession of
bloom for months more than ample provision is made for the perpetuation
of the racea necessity to any plant that refuses to thrive unless it
stands in water ponds and streams have an unpleasant habit of drying up
in summer and often the pickerel weed looks as brown as a bullrush
where it is stranded in the baked mud in august when seed falls on such
ground if indeed it germinates at all the young plant naturally
withers away
of the three kinds of blossoms one raises its stigma on a long style
reaching to the top of the flower a second form reaches its stigma only
halfway up and the third keeps its stigma in the bottom of the tube
the visiting bee gets his abdomen his chest and his tongue dusted with
pollen from long middlelength and short stamens respectively when he
visits another flower these parts of his body coming in contact with
the stigmas that occupy precisely the position where the stamens were in
other individuals he brushes off each lot of pollen just where it will

colonies of these dainty little lilies that so often grow beside
leaping brooks where and when the trout hide justify at least one of
their names but they have nothing in common with the violet or a dogs
tooth their faint fragrance rather suggests a tulip and as for the
bulb which in some of the lilykin has toothlike scales it is in this
case a smooth eggshaped corm producing little round offsets from its
base much fault is also found with another name on the plea that the
curiously mottled and delicately pencilled leaves bring to mind not a
snakes tongue but its skin as they surely do whoever sees the sharp
purplish point of a young plant darting above ground in earliest spring
however at once sees the fitting application of adders tongue but how
few recognize their plant friends at all seasons of the year
every one must have noticed the abundance of lowgrowing spring flowers
in deciduous woodlands where later in the year after the leaves
overhead cast a heavy shade so few blossoms are to be found because
their light is seriously diminished the thrifty adders tongue by

some weeks after the jubilant alert robins have returned from the
south the purple trillium unfurls its unattractive carrionscented
flower in the variable colors found in different regions one can
almost trace its evolution from green white and red to purple which
we are told is the course all flowers must follow to attain to blue
the white and pink forms however attractive to the eye are never more
agreeable to the nose than the reddishpurple ones bees and
butterflies with delicate appreciation of color and fragrance let the
blossom alone since it secretes no nectar and one would naturally
infer either that it can fertilize itself without insect aida theory
which closer study of its organs goes far to disproveor that the
carrionscent so repellent to us is in itself an attraction to certain
insects needful for crosspollination which are they beetles have been
observed crawling over the flower but without effecting any methodical
result one inclines to accept mr clarence m weeds theory of special
adaptation to the common green fleshflies lucilia carnicina which
would naturally be attracted to a flower resembling in color and odor a
raw beefsteak of uncertain age these little creatures seen in every
butcher shop throughout the summer the flower furnishes with a free
lunch of pollen in consideration of the transportation of a few grains
to another blossom absence of the usual floral attractions gives the
carrion flies a practical monopoly of the pollen food which no doubt
tastes as it smells
the sessileflowered wakerobin t sessile whose dark purple
purplishred or greenish blossom narrower of sepal and petals than the
preceding is seated in a whorl of three eggshaped sometimes blotched
leaves possesses a rather pleasant odor nevertheless it seems to have
no great attraction for insects the stigmas which are very large
almost touch the anthers surrounding them therefore the beetles which
one frequently sees crawling over them to feed on the pollen so jar
them no doubt as to selffertilize the flower but it is scarcely
probable these slow crawlers often transfer the grains from one blossom
to another a degraded flower like this has little need of color and
perfume one would suppose yet it may be even now slowly perfecting its

this gorgeous flower is thought by scientists to be all that it is for
the bees benefit which of course is its own also abundant moisture
from which to manufacture nectara prime necessity with most
irisescertainly is for our blue flag the large showy blossom cannot
but attract the passing bee whose favorite color according to sir john
lubbock it waves the bee alights on the convenient spreading
platform and guided by the dark veining and golden lines leading to
the nectar sips the delectable fluid shortly to be changed to honey
now as he raises his head and withdraws it from the nectary he must
rub it against the pollenladen anther above and some of the pollen
necessarily falls on the visitor as the sticky side of the plate
stigma just under the petallike division of the style faces away
from the anther which is below it in any case the flower is
marvellously guarded against fertilization from its own pollen the bee
flying off to another iris must first brush past the projecting lip of
the overarching style and leave on the stigmatic outer surface of the
plate some of the pollen brought from the first flower before reaching
the nectary thus crossfertilization is effected and darwin has shown
how necessary this is to insure the most vigorous and beautiful
offspring without this wonderful adaptation of the flower to the
requirements of its insect friends and of the insect to the needs of
the flower both must perish the former from hunger the latter because

stigma which is furnished with minute rigid sharply pointed papillae
all directed forward and placed there for the express purpose of
combing out the pollen he has brought from another flower on his back

because of the singular and exquisitely unerring adaptations of orchids
as a family to their insect visitors no group of plants has greater
interest for the botanist since darwin interpreted their marvellous
mechanism and gray his instant disciple revealed the hidden purposes
of our native american species no less wonderfully constructed than the
most costly exotic in a millionaires hothouse
a glance at the spur of this orchid one of the handsomest and most
striking of its clan and the heavy perfume of the flower would seem to
indicate that only a moth with a long proboscis could reach the nectar
secreted at the base of the threadlike passage butterflies attracted
by the conspicuous color sometimes hover about the showy spikes of
bloom but it is probable that to secure a sip all but possibly the
very largest of them must go to the smaller purplefringed orchis whose
shorter spur holds out a certain prospect of reward for in these two
cases as in so many others the flowers welcome for an insect is in
exact proportion to the length of its visitors tongue doubtless it is
one of the smaller sphinx moths such as we see at dusk working about
the evening primrose and other flowers deep of chalice and heavily
perfumed to guide visitors to their feast that is the great
purplefringed orchids benefactor since the length of its tongue is
perfectly adapted to its needs attracted by the showy broad lower
petal his wings ever in rapid motion the moth proceeds to unroll his
proboscis and drain the cup that is frequently an inch and a half deep
thrusting in his head either one or both of his large projecting eyes
are pressed against the sticky buttonshaped discs to which the pollen
masses are attached by a stalk and as he raises his head to depart
feeling that he is caught he gives a little jerk that detaches them
and away he flies with these still fastened to his eyes
even while he is flying to another flower that is to say in half a
minute the stalks of the pollen masses bend downward from the
perpendicular and slightly toward the centre or just far enough to
require the moth in thrusting his proboscis into the nectary to strike
the glutinous sticky stigma now withdrawing his head either or both
of the golden clubs he brought in with him will be left on the precise
spot where they will fertilize the flower sometimes but rarely we
catch a butterfly or moth from the smaller or larger purple orchids with
a pollen mass attached to his tongue instead of to his eyes this is
when he does not make his entrance from the exact centreas in these
flowers he is not obliged to doand in order to reach the nectary his
tongue necessarily brushes against one of the sticky anther sacs the
performance may be successfully imitated by thrusting some blunt point
about the size of a moths head a dull pencil or a knittingneedle
into the flower as an insect would enter withdraw the pencil and one
or both of the pollen masses will be found sticking to it and already
automatically changing their attitude in the case of the large
roundleaved orchis whose greenishwhite flowers are fertilized in a
similar manner by the sphinx moth the anther sacs converge like little
horns and their change of attitude while they are being carried to
fertilize another flower is quite as exquisitely exact

this last orchid of the season and perhaps the commonest of its
interesting tribe in the eastern united states at least bears flowers
that however insignificant in size are marvellous pieces of mechanism
to which such men as charles darwin and asa gray have devoted hours of
study and these two men particularly much correspondence
just as a woodpecker begins at the bottom of a tree and taps his way
upward so a bee begins at the lower and older flowers on a spike and
works up to the younger ones a fact on which this little orchid like
many another plant that arranges its blossoms in long racemes depends
let us not note for the present what happens in the older flowers but
begin our observations with the help of a powerful lens when the bee
has alighted on the spreading lip of a newly opened blossom toward the
top of the spire as nectar is already secreted for her in its
receptacle she thrusts her tongue through the channel provided to guide
it aright and by the slight contact with the furrowed rostellum it
splits and releases a boatshaped disk standing vertically on its stern
in the passage within the boat is an extremely sticky cement that
hardens almost instantly on exposure to the air the splitting of the
rostellum curiously enough never happens without insect aid but if a
bristle or needle be passed over it ever so lightly a stream of sticky
milky fluid exudes hardens and the boatshaped disk with pollen
masses attached may be withdrawn on the bristle just as the bee removes
them with her tongue each pollinium consists of two leaves of pollen
united for about half their length in the middle with elastic threads
as the pollinia are attached parallel to the disk they stick parallel
on the bees tongue yet she may fold up her proboscis under her head
if she choose without inconvenience from the pollen masses or without
danger of loosening them now having finished sucking the newlyopened
flowers at the top of the spike away she flies to an older flower at
the bottom of another one here a marvellous thing has happened the
passage which when the flower first expanded scarcely permitted a
bristle to pass has now widened through the automatic downward
movement of the column in order to expose the stigmatic surfaces to
contact with the pollen masses brought by the bee without the bees
help this orchid with a host of other flowers must disappear from the
face of the earth so very many species which have lost the power to
fertilize themselves now depend absolutely on these little pollen
carriers it is safe to say that should the bees perish one half our
flora would be exterminated with them on the slight downward movement
of the column in the ladies tresses then as well as on the bees
ministrations the fertilization of the flower absolutely depends if
the stigma of the lowest flower has already been fully fertilized says
darwin little or no pollen will be left on its dried surface but on
the next succeeding flower of which the stigma is adhesive large
sheets of pollen will be left then as soon as the bee arrives near the
summit of the spike she will withdraw fresh pollinia will fly to the
lower flowers on another plant and fertilize them and thus as she
goes her rounds and adds to her store of honey she continually
fertilizes fresh flowers and perpetuates the race of autumnal
spiranthes which will yield honey to future generations of bees

botanists term polygamous flowers ie some of them are perfect

are female naturally an insect like ourselves is first attracted to
the more beautiful male blossoms the pollen bearers and of course it
transfers the vitalizing dust to the dull pistillate flowers visited
later but the meadowrue which produces a superabundance of very
light dry pollen easily blown by the wind is often fertilized through

where the nectar is secreted just as they do in larkspurs dutchmans
breeches squirrel corn butter and eggs and other flowers whose deeply
hidden nectaries make dining too difficult for the little rogues
fragile butterflies absolutely dependent on nectar hover near our
showy wild columbine with its five tempting horns of plenty but sail
away again knowing as they do that their weak legs are not calculated
to stand the strain of an inverted position from a pendent flower nor
are their tongues adapted to slender tubes unless these may be entered
from above the tongues of both butterflies and moths bend readily only
when directed beneath their bodies it will be noticed that our
columbines funnelshaped tubes contract just below the point where the
nectar is secreteddoubtless to protect it from small bees when we see
the honeybee or the little wild beeshalictus chieflyon the
flower we may know they get pollen only
finally a rubythroated humming bird whirs into sight poising before a
columbine and moving around it to drain one spur after another until
the five are emptied he flashes like thought to another group of
inverted red cornucopias visits in turn every flower in the colony
then whirs away quite as suddenly as he came probably to him and no
longer to the outgrown bumblebee has the flower adapted itself the
european species wears blue the bees favorite color according to sir
john lubbock the nectar hidden in its spurs which are shorter
stouter and curved is accessible only to the largest bumblebees
there are no humming birds in europe our native columbine on the
contrary has longer contracted straight erect spurs most easily
drained by the rubythroat which like eugene field ever delights in
any color at all so long as its red
to help make the columbine conspicuous even the sepals become red but
the flower is yellow within it is thought to guide visitors to the
nectaries the stamens protrude like a golden tassel after the anthers
pass the still immature stigmas the pollen of the outer row ripens
ready for removal while the inner row of undeveloped stamens still acts
as a sheath for the stigmas owing to the pendent position of the
flower no pollen could fall on the latter in any case the columbine is
too highly organized to tolerate selffertilization when all the
stamens have discharged their pollen the styles then elongate and the
feathery stigmas opening and curving sidewise bring themselves at the
entrance of each of the five cornucopias just the position the anthers
previously occupied probably even the small bees collecting pollen
only help carry some from flower to flower but perhaps the largest
bumblebees and certainly the humming bird must be regarded as the
columbines legitimate benefactors caterpillars of one of the dusky

    the kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed

commentators differ as to which is the mustard of the parablethis
common black mustard or a rarer shrublike tree salvadora persica
with an equivalent arabic name a pungent odor and a very small seed
inasmuch as the mustard which is systematically planted for fodder by
old world farmers grows with the greatest luxuriance in palestine and
the comparison between the size of its seed and the plants great height
was already proverbial in the east when jesus used it evidence strongly
favors this wayside weed indeed the late doctor royle who endeavored
to prove that it was the shrub that was referred to finally found that
it does not grow in galilee
now there are two species which furnish the most powerfully pungent
condiment known to commerce but the tiny dark brown seeds of the black

there must always be something shocking in the sacrifice of the higher
life to the lower of the sensate to what we are pleased to call the
insensate although no one who has studied the marvellously intelligent
motives that impel a plants activities can any longer consider the
vegetable creation as lacking sensibility science is at length giving
us a glimmering of the meaning of the word universe teaching as it
does that all creatures in sharing the one life share in many of its
powers and differ from one another only in degree of possession not in
kind the transition from one socalled kingdom into another presumably
higher one is a purely arbitrary line marked by man and often
impossible to define the animalcule and the insectivorous plant know no
boundaries between the animal and the vegetable and who shall say that
the sundew or the bladderwort is not a higher organism than the amoeba
animated plants and vegetating animals parallel each other several
hundred carnivorous plants in all parts of the world have now been named
by scientists
it is well worth a journey to some spongy sphagnum bog to gather clumps
of pitcherplants which will furnish an interesting study to an entire
household throughout the summer while they pursue their nefarious
business in a shallow bowl on the veranda a modification of the petiole
forms a deep hollow pitcher having for its spout a modification of the
blade of the leaf usually the pitchers are half filled with water and
tiny drowned victims when we gather them some of this fluid must be
rain but the open pitcher secretes much juice too certain relatives
whose pitchers have hooded lids that keep out rain are nevertheless
filled with fluid on the pacific coast the golden jars of darlingtonia
californica with their overarching hoods are often so large and
watery as to drown small birds and field mice note in passing that
these otherwise dark prisons have translucent spots at the top whereas
our pitcherplant is lighted through its open transom
a sweet secretion within the pitchers rim which some say is
intoxicating others that it is an anesthetic invites insects to a
fatal feast it is a simple enough matter for them to walk into the
pitcher over the band of stiff hairs pointing downward like the withes
of a lobster pot that form an inner covering or to slip into the well
if they attempt crawling over its polished upper surface to fly upward
in a perpendicular line once their wings are wet is additionally
hopeless because of the hairs that guard the mouth of the trap and
so after vain attempts to fly or crawl out of the prison they usually
sink exhausted into a watery grave
when certain plants live in soil that is so poor in nitrogen compounds
that proteid formation is interfered with they have come to depend more
or less on a carnivorous diet the sundew actually digests its prey with
the help of a gastric juice similar to what is found in the stomach of
animals but the bladderwort and pitcherplants can only absorb in the
form of soup the products of their victims decay flies and gnats
drowned in these pitchers quickly yield their poor little bodies but
owing to the beetles hard shell covering many a rare specimen may be
rescued intact to add to a collection

only from the low savannas in north carolina to entertain the owners of
hothouses as it promptly closes the crushing trap at the end of its
sensitive leaves over a hapless fly and the common sundew that tinges
the peatbogs of three continents with its little reddish leaves belong
to a distinct class of carnivorous plants which actually masticate their
animal food depending upon it for nourishment as men do upon cattle
slaughtered in an abattoir darwins luminous account of these two
species alone which occupies more than three hundred absorbingly
interesting pages of his insectivorous plants should be read by
every one interested in these freaks of nature
when we go to some sunny cranberry bog to look for these sundews
nothing could be more innocent looking than the tiny plant its nodding
raceme of buds usually with only a solitary little blossom that opens
only in the sunshine at the top of the curve its leaves glistening
with what looks like dew though the midsummer sun may be high in the
heavens a little fly or gnat attracted by the bright jewels alights
on a leaf only to find that the clear drops more sticky than honey
instantly glue his feet that the pretty reddish hairs about him act
like tentacles reaching inward to imprison him within their slowly
closing embrace here is one of the horrors of the inquisition
operating in this land of liberty before our very eyes excited by the
struggles of the victim the sensitive hairs close only the faster
working on the same principle that a vines tendrils do when they come
in contact with a trellis more of the sticky fluid pours upon the
hapless fly plastering over his legs and wings and the pores on his
body through which he draws his breath slowly surely the leaf rolls
inward making a temporary stomach the cruel hairs bind the glue
suffocates and holds him fast death alone releases him and now the
leafs orgy begins moistening the fly with a fresh peptic fluid which
helps in the assimilation the plant proceeds to digest its food
curiously enough chemical analysis proves that this sundew secrets a
complex fluid corresponding almost exactly to the gastric juice in the
stomach of animals
darwin who fed these leaves with various articles found that they
could dissolve matter out of pollen seeds grass etc yet without a
human caterer how could a leaf turn vegetarian when a bit of any
undesirable substance such as chalk or wood was placed on the hairs
and excited them they might embrace it temporarily but as soon as the
mistake was discovered it would be dropped he also poisoned the plants

the middle ages when the great botanist was on one of his voyages
hearing his secretary highly extol the virtues of his diviningwand
he was willing to convince him of its insufficiency and for that
purpose concealed a purse of one hundred ducats under a ranunculus
which grew by itself in a meadow and bid the secretary find it if he
could the wand discovered nothing and linnaeuss mark was soon
trampled down by the company present so that when he went to finish
the experiment by fetching the gold himself he was utterly at a loss
where to find it the man with the wand assisted him and informed him
that it could not lie in the way they were going but quite the
contrary so they pursued the direction of the wand and actually dug
out the gold linnaeus said that another such experiment would be
sufficient to make a proselyte of him

why is the underside of the leaves so woolly not as a protection
against wingless insects crawling upward that is certain for such

from perspiring too freely doubtless these leaves of the steeple bush
like those of other plants that choose a similar habitat have woolly
hairs beneath as an absorbent to protect their pores from clogging with

these pores were filled with moisture from without how could they
possibly throw off the waste of the plant all plants are largely

no the bees happiness rests on her knowledge that only the
butterflies long tongues can honestly share with her the brimming wells

appreciate her rapture if we examine a little flower under the
magnifying glass we shall see why its structure places it in the pea
family bumblebees so depress the keel either when they sip or feed on
pollen that their heads and tongues get well dusted with the yellow
powder which they transfer to the stigmas of other flowers whereas the
butterflies are of doubtful value if not injurious since their long
slender tongues easily drain the nectar without depressing the keel
even if a few grains of pollen should cling to their tongues it would
probably be wiped off as they withdrew them through the narrow slit
where the petals nearly meet at the mouth of the flower bombus
terrestris delights in nipping holes at the base of the tube which
other pilferers also profit by our country is so much richer in

the north with their upper surface one facing northnorthwest and the
other northnortheast while the terminal leaflet escapes the chilling

vertical also but bending to either east or west until it comes in
contact with the vertical upper surface of either of the side leaflets

blossoms and seeds among the foliage of low shrubbery and plants in
shady lanes and woodside thickets we see the delicate drooping
clusters of lilac blossoms hanging where bees can readily discover them
and in pilfering their sweets transfer their pollen from flower to
flower but in case of failure to intercross these blossoms that are
dependent upon insect help to set fertile seed what then must the
plant run the risk of extinction selffertilization may be an evil
but failure to produce seed at all is surely the greatest one to guard
against such a calamity insignificant looking flowers that have no
petals to open for the enticing of insects but which fertilize
themselves with their own pollen produce abundant seed close to the
ground or under it then what need of the showy blossoms hanging in the
thicket above close inbreeding in the vegetable world as in the
animal ultimately produces degenerate offspring and although the showy
lilac blossoms of the wild peanut yield comparatively few

most of us many of these species bury their offspring below ground but
the woodsorrel bears its blind flowers nodding from the top of a
curved scape at the base of the plant where we can readily find them
by having no petals and other features assumed by an ordinary flower to
attract insects and chiefly in saving pollen they produce seed with
literally the closest economy it is estimated that the average blind
flower of the woodsorrel does its work with four hundred pollen grains

beauty of leaf and blossom is not the only attraction possessed by this

crossfertilization some members of the clan also bear blind flowers
which have been described in the account of the white woodsorrel even
the rudimentary leaves of the seedlings go to sleep at evening and
during the day are in constant movement up and down the stems too are
restless and as for the mature leaves every child knows how they droop
their three leaflets back to back against the stem at evening
elevating them to the perfect horizontal again by day extreme
sensitiveness to light has been thought to be the true explanation of so
much activity and yet this is not a satisfactory theory in many cases
it is certain that drooping leaves suffer far less from frost than those
whose upper surfaces are flatly exposed to the zenith this view that
the sleep of leaves saves them from being chilled at night by radiation
is darwins own supported by innumerable experiments and probably it
would have been advanced by linnaeus too since so many of his
observations in somnus plantarum verify the theory had the principle
of radiation been discovered in his day

sprengel who was the first to exalt flowers above the level of mere
botanical specimens had his attention led to the intimate relationship
existing between plants and insects by studying out the meaning of the
hairy corolla of the common wild geranium of germany g sylvaticum
being convinced as he wrote in 1787 that the wise author of nature
has not made even a single hair without a definite design a hundred
years before nehemias grew had said that it was necessary for pollen to
reach the stigma of a flower in order that it might set fertile seed
and linnaeus had to come to his aid with conclusive evidence to convince
a doubting world that this was true sprengel made the next step
forward but his writings lay neglected over seventy years because he
advanced the then incredible and only partially true statement that a
flower is fertilized by insects which carry its pollen from its anthers
to its stigma in spite of his discoveries that the hairs inside the
geraniums corolla protect its nectar from rain for the insects
benefit just as eyebrows keep perspiration from falling into the eye
that most flowers which secrete nectar have what he termed honey
guidesspots of bright color heavy veining or some such pathfinder
on the petalsin spite of the most patient and scientific research that
shed great light on natural selection a halfcentury before darwin
advanced the theory he left it for the author of the origin of
species to show that crossfertilizationthe transfer of pollen from
one blossom to another not from anthers to stigma of the same
floweris the great end to which so much marvellous mechanism is
chiefly adapted crossfertilized blossoms defeat selffertilized
flowers in the struggle for existence
no wonder sprengels theory was disproved by his scornful contemporaries
in the very case of his wild geranium which sheds its pollen before it
has developed a stigma to receive any therefore no insect that had not
brought pollen from an earlier bloom could possibly fertilize this
flower how amazing that he did not see this our common wild
cranesbill which also has lost the power to fertilize itself not
only ripens first the outer then the inner row of anthers but
actually drops them off after their pollen has been removed to overcome
the barest chance of selffertilization as the stigmas become receptive
this is the geraniums and many other flowers method to compel
crossfertilization by insects in cold stormy cloudy weather a
geranium blossom may remain in the male stage several days before
becoming female while on a warm sunny day when plenty of insects are
flying the change sometimes takes place in a few hours among others
the common sulphur or puddle butterfly that sits in swarms on muddy
roads and makes the clover fields gay with its bright little wings
pilfers nectar from the geranium without bringing its long tongue in
contact with the pollen neither do the smaller bees and flies which
alight on the petals necessarily come in contact with the anthers and
stigmas doubtless the larger bees are the flowers true benefactors
the socalled geraniums in cultivation are pelargoniums strictly

figures so prominently in european literature in france it has even
entered the political field since napoleons day yale university has
adopted the violet for its own especial flower although it is the
cornflower or bachelors button centaurea cyanus that is the true
yale blue sprengel who made a most elaborate study of the violet
condensed the result of his research into the following questions and
answers which are given here because much that he says applies to our
own native species which have been too little studied in the modern
scientific spirit
1 why is the flower situated on a long stalk which is upright but
curved downward at the free end in order that it may hang down which
firstly prevents rain from obtaining access to the nectar and
secondly places the stamens in such a position that the pollen falls
into the open space between the pistil and the free ends of the stamens
if the flower were upright the pollen would fall into the space
between the base of the stamen and the base of the pistil and would not
come in contact with the bee
2 why does the pollen differ from that of most other insectfertilized
flowers in most of such flowers the insects themselves remove the
pollen from the anthers and it is therefore important that the pollen
should not easily be detached and carried away by the wind in the
present case on the contrary it is desirable that it should be looser
and drier so that it may easily fall into the space between the stamens
and the pistil if it remained attached to the anther it would not be
touched by the bee and the flower would remain unfertilized
3 why is the base of the style so thin in order that the bee may be
more easily able to bend the style
4 why is the base of the style bent for the same reason the result
of the curvature is that the pistil is much more easily bent than would
be the case if the style were straight
5 finally why does the membranous termination of the upper filament
overlap the corresponding portions of the two middle stamens because
this enables the bee to move the pistil and thereby to set free the
pollen more easily than would be the case under the reverse
arrangement

violet v pubescens whose dark veined bright yellow petals gleam

equipped with basal leaves at flowering time which the downy species is

bloom a month

pontica of southern europe by the belgian horticulturists to whom we
owe the ghent azaleas the final triumphs of the hybridizer that
glorify the shrubberies on our own lawns today the azalea became the
national flower of flanders these hardy species lose their leaves in
winter whereas the hothouse varieties of a indica a native of china

it would be well if americans imitating the japanese in making
pilgrimages to scenes of supreme natural beauty visited the mountains
rocky woody hillsides ravines and treegirt uplands when the laurel
is in its glory when masses of its pink and white blossoms set among
the dark evergreen leaves flush the landscape like aurora and are
reflected from the pools of streams and the serene depths of mountain
lakes peter kalm a swedish pupil of linnaeus who travelled here early
in the eighteenth century was more impressed by its beauty than that of
any other flower he introduced the plant to europe where it is known
as kalmia and extensively cultivated on fine estates that are thrown
open to the public during the flowering season even a flower is not
without honor save in its own country we have only to prepare a border
of leaf mould take up the young plant without injuring the roots or
allowing them to dry hurry them into the ground and prune back the
bush a little to establish it in our gardens where it will bloom
freely after the second year lime in the soil and manure are fatal to
it as well as to rhododendrons and azaleas all they require is a mulch
of leaves kept on winter and summer that their fine fibrous roots may
never dry out
all the kalmias resort to a most ingenious device for compelling insect
visitors to carry their pollen from blossom to blossom a newlyopened
flower has its stigma erected where the incoming bee must leave on its
sticky surface the four minute orangelike grains carried from the
anther of another flower on the hairy underside of her body now each
anther is tucked away in one of the ten little pockets of the
saucershaped blossom and the elastic filaments are strained upward
like a bow after hovering above the nectary the bee has only to
descend toward it when her leg touching against one of the
hairtriggers of the spring trap pop goes the little anthergun
discharging pollen from its bores as it flies upward so delicately is
the mechanism adjusted the slightest jar or rough handling releases the
anthers but on the other hand should insects be excluded by a net
stretched over the plant the flowers will fall off and wither without
firing off their pollencharged guns at least this is true in the
great majority of tests as in the case of hothouse flowers no fertile
seed is set when nets keep away the laurels benefactors one has only
to touch the hairtrigger with the end of a pin to see how exquisitely
delicate is this provision for crossfertilization
however much we may be cautioned by the apiculturists against honey made
from laurel nectar the bees themselves ignore all warnings and
apparently without evil resultshappily for the flowers dependent upon
them and their kin mr frank r cheshire in bees and beekeeping
the standard english work on the subject writes during the celebrated
retreat of the ten thousand as recorded by xenophon in his anabasis
the soldiers regaled themselves upon some honey found near trebizonde
where were many beehives intoxication with vomiting was the result
some were so overcome he states as to be incapable of standing not a
soldier died but very many were greatly weakened for several days
tournefort endeavored to ascertain whether this account was corroborated
by anything ascertainable in the locality and had good reason to be
satisfied respecting it he concluded that the honey had been gathered
from a shrub growing in the neighborhood of trebizonde which is well
known there as producing the beforementioned effects it is now agreed
that the plants were species of rhododendron and azaleas lamberti
confirms xenophons account by stating that similar effects are produced
by honey of colchis where the same shrubs are common in 1790 even
fatal cases occurred in america in consequence of eating wild honey
which was traced to kalmia latifolia by an inquiry instituted under
direction of the american government

after the orchids no flowers show greater executive ability none have
adopted more ingenious methods of compelling insects to work for them
than the milkweeds wonderfully have they perfected their mechanism in
every part until no member of the family even attempts to fertilize
itself hence their triumphal vigorous march around the earth the
tribe numbering more than nineteen hundred species located chiefly in
those tropical and warm temperate regions that teem with the insects
whose cooperation they seek
commonest of all with us is this rank weed which possesses the dignity
of a rubber plant much more attractive to human eyes at least than
the dull pale brownishpink umbels of flowers are its exquisite silky
seedtufts but not so with insects knowing that the slightly fragrant
blossoms are rich in nectar bees wasps flies beetles and
butterflies come to feast now the visitor finding his alighting place
slippery his feet claw about in all directions to secure a hold just
as it was planned they should for in his struggles some of his feet
must get caught in the fine little clefts at the base of the flower his
efforts to extricate his foot only draw it into a slot at the end of
which lies a little darkbrown body in a newlyopened flower five of
these little bodies may be seen between the horns of the crown at equal
distances around it this tiny brown excrescence is hard and horny with
a notch in its face it is continuous with and forms the end of the slot
in which the visitors foot is caught into this he must draw his foot
or claw and finding it rather tightly held must give a vigorous jerk
to get it free attached to either side of the little horny piece is a
flattened yellow pollenmass and so away he flies with a pair of these
pollinia that look like tiny saddlebags dangling from his feet one
might think that such rough handling as many insects must submit to from
flowers would discourage them from making any more visits but the
desire for food is a mighty passion while the insect is flying off to
another blossom the stalk to which the saddlebags are attached twists
until it brings them together that when his feet get caught in other
slots they may be in the position to get broken off in his struggles
for freedom precisely where they will fertilize the stigmatic chambers
now the visitor flies away with the stalks alone sticking to his claws
bumblebees and hivebees have been caught with a dozen pollenmasses
dangling from a single foot outrageous imposition
better than any written description of the milkweed blossoms mechanism
is a simple experiment if you have neither time nor patience to sit in
the hot sun magnifyingglass in hand and watch for an unwary insect to
get caught take an ordinary housefly and hold it by the wings so that
it may claw at one of the newlyopened flowers from which no pollinia
have been removed it tries frantically to hold on and with a little
direction it may be led to catch its claws in the slots of the flower
now pull it gently away and you will find a pair of saddlebags slung
over his foot by a slender curved stalk if you are rarely skilful you
may induce your fly to withdraw the pollinia from all five slots on as
many of his feet and they are not to be thrown or scraped off let the
fly try as hard as he pleases you may now invite the fly to take a
walk on another flower in which he will probably leave one or more
pollinia in its stigmatic cavities
doctor kerner thought the milky juice in milkweed plants especially
abundant in the uppermost leaves and stems serves to protect the
flowers from useless crawling pilferers he once started a number of
ants to climb up a milky stalk when they neared the summit he noticed
that at each movement the terminal hooks of their feet cut through the
tender epiderm and from the little clefts the milky juice began to
flow bedraggling their feet and the hind part of thenbodies the ants
were much impeded in their movements he writes and in order to rid
themselves of the annoyance drew their feet through their mouths
their movements however which accompanied these efforts simply
resulted in making fresh fissures and fresh discharges of milky juice
so that the position of the ants became each moment worse and worse
many escaped by getting to the edge of a leaf and dropping to the
ground others tried this method of escape too late for the air soon
hardened the milky juice into a tough brown substance and after this
all the strugglings of the ants to free themselves from the viscid
matter were in vain natures methods of preserving a flowers nectar
for the insects that are especially adapted to fertilize it and of
punishing all useless intruders often shock us yet justice is ever
stern ever kind in the largest sense
if the asclepias really do kill some insects with their juice others
doubtless owe their lives to it among the protected insects are the
milkweed butterflies and their caterpillars which are provided with
secretions that are distasteful to birds and predaceous insects these
acrid secretions are probably due to the character of the plants upon
which the caterpillars feed says doctor holland in his beautiful and
invaluable butterfly book enjoying on this account immunity from
attack they have all in the process of time been mimicked by species
in other genera which have not the same immunity one cannot stay long
around a patch of milkweeds without seeing the monarch butterfly

fellow the borders and veins broadly black with two rows of white
spots on the outer borders and two rows of pale spots across the tip of

persians as told by their poet shiraz it was in the golden morning of
the early world when an angel sat weeping outside the closed gates of
paradise he had fallen from his high estate through loving a daughter
of earth nor was he permitted to enter again until she whom he loved
had planted the flowers of the forgetmenot in every corner of the
world he returned to earth and assisted her and together they went
hand in hand when their task was ended they entered paradise together
for the fair woman without tasting the bitterness of death became
immortal like the angel whose love her beauty had won when she sat by
the river twining forgetmenots in her hair
it was the golden ring around the forgetmenots centre that first led
sprengel to believe the conspicuous markings at the entrance of many
flowers served as pathfinders to insects this golden circle also
shelters the nectar from rain and indicates to the fly or bee just
where it must probe between stigma and anthers to touch them with
opposite sides of its tongue since it may probe from any point of the
circle it is quite likely that the side of the tongue that touched a
pollenladen anther in one flower will touch the stigma in the next
one visited and so crossfertilize it but forgetmenots are not
wholly dependent on insects when these fail a fully mature flower is
still able to set fertile seed by shedding its own pollen directly on

reverend men of old one is impressed with the striking similarity of
many customs recorded of both two of the most frequently used
ingredients in witches cauldrons were the vervain and the rue the
former probably derived its notoriety from the fact of its being sacred
to thor an honor which marked it out like other lightning plants as
peculiarly adapted for occult uses says mr thiselton dyer in his
folklore of plants although vervain therefore as the enchanters
plant was gathered by witches to do mischief in their incantations
yet as aubrey says it hinders witches from their will a
circumstance to which drayton further refers when he speaks of the
vervain as gainst witchcraft much avayling now we understand why
the children of shakespeares time hung vervain and dill with a
horseshoe over the door
in his eighth eclogue virgil refers to vervain as a charm to recover
lost love doubtless this was the verbena the herba sacra employed in

abundantly in southern europe while its specific name is said to have
been given it because it was so common in the neighborhood of thapsus
but whether the place of that name in africa or the sicilian town
mentioned by ovid and virgil is not certain strange that europeans
should labor under the erroneous impression that this mullein is native
to america whereas here it is only an immigrant from their own land

of what use is this feltlike covering to the plant the importance of
protecting the delicate sensitive active cells from intense light
draught or cold have led various plants to various practices none
more common however than to develop hairs on the epidermis of their

to coat it with felt as in this case where the hairs branch and
interlace fierce sunlight in the exposed dry situations where the
mullein grows prolonged drought which often occurs at flowering
season when the perpetuation of the species is at stake and the
intense cold which the exquisite rosettes formed by yearold plants must
endure through a winter before they can send up a flowerstalk the

chief interest to the structural botanist from the fact that a blossom
has a lip in the centre of the lower half of its corolla that an insect
must use as its landing place comes the necessity for the pistil to
occupy a central position naturally a fifth stamen would be only in
its way an encumbrance to be banished in time in the figwort for

a mere scale on the roof of the corolla tube in other lipped flowers
the useless organ has disappeared but in the beardtongue it goes
through a series of curious curves from the upper to the under side of

to the evolutionist ever on the lookout for connecting links the
lobelias form an interesting group because their corolla slit down the
upper side and somewhat flattened shows the beginning of the tendency
toward the strap or ray flowers that are nearly confined to the
composites of much later development of course than tubular single
blossoms next to massing their flowers in showy heads as the
composites do the lobelias have the almost equally advantageous plan of
crowding theirs along a stem so as to make a conspicuous advertisement
to attract the passing bee and to offer him the special inducement of
numerous feeding places close together

towering above the surrounding vegetation of lowlying meadows this
vigorous composite spreads clusters of soft fringy bloom that however
deep or pale of tint are ever conspicuous advertisements even when the
goldenrods sunflowers and asters enter into close competition for
insect trade slight fragrance which to the delicate perception of
butterflies is doubtless heavy enough the florets color and slender
tubular form indicate an adaptation to them and they are by far the
most abundant visitors which is not to say that longtongued bees and
flies never reach the nectar and transfer pollen for they do but an
excellent place for the butterfly collector to carry his net is to a
patch of joepye weed in september as the spreading stylebranches that
fringe each tiny floret are furnished with hairs for three quarters of
their length the pollen caught in them comes in contact with the
alighting visitor later the lower portion of the stylebranches that
is covered with stigmatic papillae along the edge emerges from the tube
to receive pollen carried from younger flowers when the visitor sips his
reward if the hairs still contain pollen when the stigmatic part of the
style is exposed insects selffertilize the flower and if in stormy
weather no insects are flying the flower is nevertheless able to
fertilize itself because the hairy fringe must often come in contact
with the stigmas of neighboring florets it is only when we study
flowers with reference to their motives and methods that we understand
why one is abundant and another rare composites long ago utilized many
principles of success in life that the triumphant anglosaxon carries

when these flowers transform whole acres into fields of the
clothofgold the slender wands swaying by every roadside and
purple asters add the final touch of imperial splendor to the autumn
landscape already glorious with gold and crimson is any parterre of
natures garden the world around more gorgeous than that portion of it
we are pleased to call ours within its limits eightyfive species of
goldenrod flourish while a few have strayed into mexico and south
america and only two or three belong to europe where many of ours
are tenderly cultivated in gardens as they would be here had not
nature been so lavish to name all these species or the asters the
sparrows and the warblers at sight is a feat probably no one living
can perform nevertheless certain of the commoner goldenrods have
welldefined peculiarities that a little field practice soon fixes in
the novices mind
along shady roadsides and in moist woods and thickets from august to
october the bluestemmed wreath or woodland goldenrod s caesia
sways an unbranched stem with a bluish bloom on it it is studded with
pale golden clusters of tiny florets in the axils of lanceshaped
featherveined leaves for nearly its entire length range from maine
ontario and minnesota to the gulf states none is prettier more
dainty than this common species
in rich woodlands and thicket borders we find the zigzag or
broadleaved goldenrod s latifoliaits prolonged angled stem
that grows as if waveringly uncertain of the proper direction to take
strung with small clusters of yellow florets somewhat after the manner
of the preceding species but its sawedged leaves are ovate sharply
tapering to a point and narrowed at the base into petioles it blooms
from july to september range from new brunswick to georgia and
westward beyond the mississippi
during the same blooming period and through a similar range our only
albino with an irishbull name the white goldenrod or more properly
silverrod s bicolor cannot be mistaken its creamwhite florets
also grow in little clusters from the upper axils of a usually simple
and hairy gray stem six inches to four feet high most of the heads are
crowded in a narrow terminal pyramidal cluster this plant approaches
more nearly the idea of a rod than its relatives the leaves which are
broadly oblong toward the base of the stem and narrowed into long
margined petioles are frequently quite hairy for the silverrod elects
to live in dry soil and its juices must be protected from heat and too
rapid transpiration
when crushed in the hand the dotted bright green lanceshaped
entire leaves of the sweet goldenrod or blue mountain tea s odora
cannot be mistaken for they give forth a pleasant anise scent the
slender simple smooth stem is crowned with a graceful panicle whose
branches have the florets seated all on one side dry soil new england

the wrinkleleaved or tall hairy goldenrod or bitterweed s
rugosa a perversely variable species its hairy stem perhaps only a
foot high or maybe more than seven feet its rough leaves broadly
oval to lanceshaped sharply sawedged few if any furnished with
footstems lifts a large compound and gracefully curved panicle whose
florets are seated on one side of its spreading branches sometimes the
stem branches at the summit one usually finds it blooming in dry soil
from july to november throughout a range extending from newfoundland and
ontario to the gulf states
the unusually beautiful spreading recurved branching panicle of bloom
borne by the early plume or sharptoothed goldenrod or yellowtop
s juncea so often dried for winter decoration may wave four feet
high but usually not more than two at the summit of a smooth rigid
stem toward the top narrow elliptical uncut leaves are seated on the
stalk below much larger leaves their sharp teeth slanting forward
taper into a broad petiole whose edges may be cut like fringe in dry
rocky soil this is perhaps the first and last goldenrod to bloom
having been found as early as june and sometimes lasting into november
range from north carolina and missouri very far north
perhaps the commonest of all the lovely clan east of the mississippi or
throughout a range extending from arizona and florida northward to
british columbia and new brunswick is the canada goldenrod or
yellowweed s canadensis surely every one must be familiar with
the large spreading denseflowered panicle with recurved sprays that
crowns a rough hairy stem sometimes eight feet tall or again only two
feet its lanceshaped acutely pointed triplenerved leaves are rough
and the lower ones sawedged from august to november one cannot fail to
find it blooming in dry soil
most brilliantly colored of its tribe is the lowgrowing gray or field
goldenrod or dyers weed s nemoralis the rich deep yellow of its
little spreading recurved and usually onesided panicles is admirably
set off by the ashy gray or often cottony stem and the hoary
grayishgreen leaves in the open sterile places where they arise from
july to november quebec and the northwest territory to the gulf states
  along the roadside like the flowers of gold
    that tawny incas for their gardens wrought
  heavy with sunshine droops the goldenrod
bewildered by the multitude of species and wondering at the enormous
number of representatives of many of them we cannot but inquire into
the cause of such triumphal conquest of a continent by a single genus
much is explained simply in the statement that goldenrods belong to the
vast order of compositae flowers in reality made up sometimes of
hundreds of minute florets united into a faradvanced socialistic
community having for its motto in union there is strength in the
first place such an association of florets makes a far more conspicuous
advertisement than a single flower one that can be seen by insects at a
great distance for most of the composite plants live in large colonies
each plant as well as each floret helping the others in attracting
their benefactors attention the facility with which insects are
enabled to collect both pollen and nectar makes the goldenrods
exceedingly popular restaurants finally the visits of insects are more
likely to prove effectual because any one that alights must touch
several or many florets and crosspollinate them simply by crawling
over a head the disk florets mostly contain both stamens and pistil
while the ray florets in one series are all male immense numbers of
wasps hornets bees flies beetles and bugs feast without effort
here indeed the budding entomologist might form a large collection of
hymenoptera diptera coleoptera and hemiptera from among the
visitors to a single field of goldenrod alone usually to be discovered
among the throng are the velvety black lytta or cantharis that
impostor waspbeetle the black and yellow wavybanded redlegged
locusttree borer and the painted clytus banded with yellow and
sable squeaking contentedly as he gnaws the florets that feed him
where the slender brown plumetipped wands etch their charming
outline above the snowcovered fields how the sparrows finches
buntings and juncos love to congregate of course helping to scatter
the seeds to the wind while satisfying their hunger on the swaying
downcurved stalks now that the leaves are gone some of the goldenrod
stems are seen to bulge as if a tiny ball were concealed under the bark
in spring a little winged tenant a fly will emerge from the gall that
has been his cradle all winter
blue and purple asters or starworts
aster
evolution teaches us that thistles daisies sunflowers asters and all
the triumphant horde of composites were once very different flowers from
what we see today through ages of natural selection of the fittest
among their ancestral types having finally arrived at the most
successful adaptation of their various parts to their surroundings in
the whole floral kingdom they are now overrunning the earth doubtless
the asters remote ancestors were simple green leaves around the vital
organs and depended upon the wind as the grasses doa most
extravagant methodto transfer their pollen then some rudimentary
flower changed its outer row of stamens into petals which gradually
took on color to attract insects and insure a more economical method of
transfer gardeners today take advantage of a blossoms natural
tendency to change stamens into petals when they wish to produce double
flowers as flowers and insects developed side by side and there came
to be a better and better understanding between them of each others
requirements mutual adaptation followed the flower that offered the
best advertisement as the composites do by its showy rays that
secreted nectar in tubular flowers where no useless insect could pilfer
it that fastened its stamens to the inside wall of the tube where they
must dust with pollen the underside of every insect unwittingly
crossfertilizing the blossom as he crawled over it that massed a great
number of these tubular florets together where insects might readily
discover them and feast with the least possible loss of timethis
flower became the winner in lifes race small wonder that our june
fields are white with daisies and the autumn landscape is glorified with
goldenrod and asters
since north america boasts the greater part of the two hundred and fifty
asters named by scientists and as variations in many of our common
species frequently occur the tyro need expect no easy task in
identifying every one he meets afield however the following are
possible acquaintances to every one
in dry shady places the large or broadleaved aster a
macrophyllus so called from its three or four conspicuous
heartshaped leaves on long petioles in a clump next the ground may be
more easily identified by these than by the pale lavender or violet
flowerheads of about sixteen rays each which crown its reddish angular
stem in august and september the disk turns reddish brown
much more branched and bushy is the common blue branching wood or
heartleaved aster a cordifolius whose generous masses of small
pale lavender flowerheads look like a mist hanging from one to five
feet above the earth in and about the woods and shady roadsides from
september even to december in favored places
by no means tardy the late purple aster socalled or purple daisy
a patens begins to display its purplishblue daisylike
flowerheads early in august and farther north may be found in dry
exposed places only until october rarely the solitary flowers that
are an inch across or more are a deep rich violet the twenty to
thirty rays which surround the disk curling inward to dry expose the
vaseshaped green shingled cups that terminate each little branch
the thick somewhat rigid oblong leaves tapering at the tip broaden
at the base to clasp the rough slender stalk range similar to the

long bladelike leaves usually very rough above and hairy along the
midrib beneath are seated on the stem
the lovely smooth or blue aster a laevis whose skyblue or violet
flowerheads about one inch broad are common through september and
october in dry soil and open woods has strongly clasping oblong
tapering leaves rough margined but rarely with a sawtooth toward the
top of the stem while those low down on it gradually narrow into
clasping wings
in dry sandy soil mostly near the coast from massachusetts to
delaware grows one of the loveliest of all this beautiful clan the
low showy or seaside purple aster a spectabilis the stiff
usually unbranched stem does its best in attaining a height of two feet
above the leaves are bladelike or narrowly oblong seated on the stem
whereas the tapering oval basal leaves are furnished with long
footstems as is customary with most asters the handsome bright

have from fifteen to thirty rays or only about half as many as the
familiar new england aster season august to november

have written familiar lines about the daisy extolled a quite different
flower from oursbellis perennis the little pink and white blossom
that hugs english turf as if it loved itthe true dayseye for it
closes at nightfall and opens with the dawn
now what is the secret of the large white daisys triumphal conquest
of our territory a naturalized immigrant from europe and asia how
could it so quickly take possession in the overcultivated old world
no weed can have half the chance for unrestricted colonizing that it has
in our vast unoccupied area most of our weeds are naturalized
foreigners not natives once released from the harder conditions of
struggle at home the seeds bring safely smuggled in among the ballast
of freight ships or hay used in packing they find life here easy
pleasant as if to make up for lost time they increase a thousandfold
if we look closely at a daisyand a lens is necessary for any but the
most superficial acquaintancewe shall see that far from being a
single flower it is literally a host in itself each of the socalled
white petals is a female floret whose open corolla has grown large
white and showy to aid its sisters in advertising for insect
visitorsa prominence gained only by the loss of its stamens the
yellow centre is composed of hundreds of minute tubular florets huddled
together in a green cup as closely as they can be packed inside each of
these tiny yellow tubes stand the stamens literally putting their heads
together as the pistil within the ring of stamens develops and rises
through their midst two little hair brushes on its tip sweep the pollen
from their anthers as a rounded brush would remove the soot from a lamp
chimney now the pollen is elevated to a point where any insect crawling
over the floret must remove it the pollen gone the pistil now spreads
its two arms that were kept tightly closed together while any danger of
selffertilization lasted their surfaces become sticky that pollen
brought from another flower may adhere to them notice that the pistils
in the white ray florets have no hair brushes on their tips because no
stamens being there there is no pollen to be swept out because daisies
are among the most conspicuous of flowers and have facilitated dining
for their visitors by offering them countless cups of refreshment that
may be drained with a minimum loss of time almost every insect on wings
alights on them sooner or later in short they run their business on
the principle of a cooperative department store immense quantities of
the most vigorous because crossfertilized seed being set in every
patch small wonder that our fields are white with daisiesa long and a
merry life to them

and as high as wide are mostly solitary at the ends of formidable
branches up which few crawling creatures venture but in the deep tube
of each floret there is nectar secreted for the flying visitor who can
properly transfer pollen from flower to flower such a one suffers no
inconvenience from the prickles but on the contrary finds a larger
feast saved for him because of them dense matted woollike hairs
that cover the bristling stems of most thistles make climbing mighty
unpleasant for ants which ever delight in pilfering sweets perhaps one
has the temerity to start upward
  fain would i climb yet fear i to fall
  if thy heart fail thee climb not at all
might be the ants passionate outburst to the thistle and the thistles
reply instead of a sir walter and queen elizabeth couplet long
lanceshaped deeply cleft sharply pointed and prickly dark green
leaves make the ascent almost unendurable nevertheless the ant
bravely mounts to where the bristlepointed overlapping scales of the
deep green cup hold the luscious flowers now his feet becoming
entangled in the cottony fibres wound about the scaly armor and a
bristling bodyguard thrusting spears at him in his struggles to escape
death happily releases him all this tragedy to insure the thistles
