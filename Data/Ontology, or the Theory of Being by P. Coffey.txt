preface
it is hoped that the present volume will supply a want that is really felt
by students of philosophy in our universitiesthe want of an english
textbook on general metaphysics from the scholastic standpoint it is the
authors intention to supplement his science of logic1 and the present
treatise on ontology by a volume on the theory of knowledge hence no
disquisitions on the latter subject will be found in these pages the
moderate realism of aristotle and the schoolmen is assumed throughout
in the domain of ontology there are many scholastic theories and
discussions which are commonly regarded by nonscholastic writers as
possessing nowadays for the student of philosophy an interest that is
merely historical this mistaken notion is probably due to the fact that
few if any serious attempts have yet been made to transpose these
questions from their medieval setting into the language and context of
contemporary philosophy perhaps not a single one of these problems is
really and in substance alien to presentday speculations the author has
endeavoured by his treatment of such characteristically medieval
discussions as those on potentia and actus essence and existence
individuation the theory of distinctions substance and accident nature
and person logical and real relations efficient and final causes to
show that the issues involved are in every instance as fully and keenly
debatedin an altered setting and a new terminologyby recent and living
philosophers of every school of thought as they were by st thomas and his
contemporaries in the golden age of medieval scholasticism and as the
purposes of a textbook demanded attention has been devoted to stating
the problems clearly to showing the significance and bearings of
discussions and solutions rather than to detailed analyses of arguments
at the same time it is hoped that the treatment is sufficiently full to be
helpful even to advanced students and to all who are interested in the
metaphysics of the schools for the convenience of the reader the more
advanced portions are printed in smaller type
the teaching of st thomas and the other great schoolmen of the middle
ages forms the groundwork of the book this corpus of doctrine is
scarcely yet accessible outside its latin sources as typical of the
fuller scholastic textbooks the excellent treatise of the spanish author
urraburu2 has been most frequently consulted much assistance has also
been derived from kleutgens philosophie der vorzeit3 a monumental
work which ought to have been long since translated into english and
finally the excellent treatise in the louvain cours de philosophie by
the present cardinal archbishop of mechlin4 has been consulted with
profit and largely followed in many places the writer freely and
gratefully acknowledges his indebtedness to these and other authors quoted
and referred to in the course of the present volume
general introduction
i reason of introductory chapterit is desirable that at some stage in
the course of his investigations the student of philosophy should be
invited to take a brief general survey of the work in which he is engaged
this purpose will be served by a chapter on the general aim and scope of
philosophy its distinctive characteristics as compared with other lines
of human thought and its relations to these latter such considerations
will at the same time help to define ontology thus introducing the
reader to the subjectmatter of the present volume
ii philosophy the name and the thingin the fifth book of ciceros
tusculan disputations we read that the terms philosophus and
philosophia were first employed by pythagoras who flourished in the
sixth century before christ that this ancient sage was modest enough to
call himself not a wise man but a lover of wisdom   and
his calling not a profession of wisdom but a search for wisdom however
despite the disclaimer the term philosophy soon came to signify
wisdom simply meaning by this the highest and most precious kind of
knowledge
now human knowledge has for its object everything that falls in any way
within human experience it has extensively a great variety in its
subjectmatter and intensively a great variety in its degrees of depth
and clearness and perfection individual facts of the past communicated
by human testimony form the raw materials of historical knowledge then
there are all the individual things and events that fall within ones own
personal experience moreover by the study of human language or
languages of works of the human mind and products of human genius and
skill we gain a knowledge of literature and of the artsthe fine
arts and the mechanical arts but not merely do we use our senses and
memory thus to accumulate an unassorted stock of informations about
isolated facts a miscellaneous mass of mental furniture which constitutes
the bulk of human knowledge in its least developed formcognitio
vulgaris the knowledge of the comparatively uneducated and
unreflecting classes of mankind we also use our reasoning faculty to
reflect compare classify these informations to interpret them to
reason about them to infer from them general truths that embrace
individual things and events beyond our personal experience we try to
explain them by seeking out their reasons and causes this mental
activity gradually converts our knowledge into scientific knowledge and
thus gives rise to those great groups of systematized truths called the
sciences as for example the physical and mathematical sciences the
elements of which usually form part of our early education these sciences
teach us a great deal about ourselves and the universe in which we live
there is no need to dwell on the precious services conferred upon mankind
by discoveries due to the progress of the various special sciences
mathematics as applied to engineering of all sorts astronomy the
physical sciences of light heat sound electricity magnetism etc
chemistry in all its branches physiology and anatomy as applied in
medicine and surgery all these undoubtedly contribute much to mans
bodily wellbeing but man has a mind as well as a body and he is
moreover a social being there are therefore other special
scienceshuman as distinct from physical sciencesin which man himself
is studied in his mental activities and social relations with his
fellowmen the sciences of social and political economy constitutional
and civil law government statesmanship etc furthermore man is a
moral being recognizing distinctions of good and bad right and wrong
pleasure and happiness duty and responsibility in his own conduct and
finally he is a religious being face to face with the fact that men
universally entertain views beliefs convictions of some sort or other
regarding mans subjection to and dependence on some higher power or
powers dwelling somehow or somewhere within or above the whole universe of
his direct and immediate experience there are therefore also sciences
which deal with these domains morality and religion here however the
domains are so extensive and the problems raised by their phenomena are
of such farreaching importance that the sciences which deal with them
can hardly be called special sciences but rather constituent portions of
the one wider and deeper general science which is what men commonly
understand nowadays by philosophy
the distinction between the special sciences on the one hand and
philosophy the general science on the other will help us to realize
more clearly the nature and scope of the latter the special sciences are
concerned with discovering the proximate reasons and causes of this
that and the other definite department in the whole universe of our
experience the subjectmatter of some of them is totally different from
that of others physiology studies the functions of living organisms
geology studies the formation of the earths crust or if two or more of
them investigate the same subjectmatter they do so from different
standpoints as when the zoologist and the physiologist study the same
type or specimen in the animal kingdom but the common feature of all is
this that each seeks only the reasons causes and laws which give a
proximate and partial explanation of the facts which it investigates
leaving untouched and unsolved a number of deeper and wider questions
which may be raised about the whence and whither and why not only
of the facts themselves but of the reasons causes and laws assigned by
the particular science in explanation of these facts
now it is those deeper and wider questions which can be answered only by
the discovery of the more remote and ultimate reasons and causes of
things that philosophy undertakes to investigate andas far as lies
within mans powerto answer no one has ever disputed the supreme
importance of such inquiries into the ultimate reasons and causes of
thingsinto such questions as these for instance what is the nature of
man himself has he in him a principle of life which is spiritual and
immortal what was his first origin on the earth whence did he come has
his existence any purpose and if so what whither does he tend what is
his destiny why does he distinguish between a right and a wrong in human
conduct what is the ultimate reason or ground of this distinction why
have men generally some form or other of religion why do men generally
believe in god is there really a god what is the origin of the whole
universe of mans experience of life in all its manifestations has the
universe any intelligible or intelligent purpose and if so what can the
human mind give a certain answer to any of these or similar questions
what about the nature and value of human knowledge itself what is its
scope and what are its limitations and since vast multitudes of men
believe that the human race has been specially enlightened by god
himself by divine revelation to know for certain what mans destiny is
and is specially aided by god himself by divine grace to work out this
destinythe question immediately arises what are the real relations
between reason alone on the one hand and reason enlightened by such
revelation on the other in other words between natural knowledge and
supernatural faith
now it will be admitted that the special sciences take us some distance
along the road towards an answer to such questions inasmuch as the truths
established by these sciences and even the wider hypotheses conceived
though not strictly verified in them furnish us with most valuable data
in our investigation of those questions similarly the alleged fact of a
divine revelation cannot be ignored by any man desirous of using all the
data available as helps towards their solution the revelation embodied in
christianity claims not merely to enlighten us in regard to many ultimate
questions which mankind would be able to answer without its assistance
but also to tell us about our destiny some truths of supreme import which
of ourselves we should never have been able to discover it is obvious
then that whether a man has been brought up from his infancy to believe
in the christian revelation or not his whole outlook on life will be
determined very largely by his belief or disbelief in its authenticity and
its contents similarly if he be a confucian or a buddhist or a
mohammedan his outlook will be in part determined by what he believes of
their teachings mans conduct in life has undoubtedly many determining
influences but it will hardly be denied that among them the predominant
influence is exerted by the views that he holds the things he believes to
be true concerning his own origin nature and destiny as well as the
origin nature and destiny of the universe in which he finds himself the
germans have an expressive term for that which in the absence of a more
appropriate term we may translate as a mans worldoutlook they call
it his weltanschauung now this worldoutlook is formed by each
individual for himself from his interpretation of his experience as a
whole it is not unusual to call this worldoutlook a mans philosophy
of life if we use the term philosophy in this wide sense it obviously
includes whatever light a man may gather from the special sciences and
whatever light he may gather from a divinely revealed religion if he
believes in such as well as the light his own reason may shed upon a
special and direct study of those ultimate questions themselves to which
we have just referred but we mention this wide sense of the term
philosophy merely to put it aside and to state that we use the term in
the sense more commonly accepted nowadays the sense in which it is
understood to be distinct from the special sciences on the one side and
from supernatural theology or the systematic study of divinely revealed
religion on the other philosophy is distinct from the special sciences
because while the latter seek the proximate the former seeks the ultimate
grounds reasons and causes of all the facts of human experience
philosophy is distinct from supernatural theology because while the former
uses the unaided power of human reason to study the ultimate questions
raised by human experience the latter uses reason enlightened by divine
revelation to study the contents of this revelation in all their bearings
on mans life and destiny
hence we arrive at this simple and widely accepted definition of
philosophy the science of all things through their ultimate reasons and
causes as discovered by the unaided light of human reason5 the first
part of this definition marks off philosophy from the special sciences
the second part marks it off from supernatural theology
    we must remember however that these three departments of
    knowledgescientific philosophical and revealedare not isolated
    from one another in any mans mind they overlap in their
    subjectmatter and though differing in their respective
    standpoints they permeate one another through and through the
    separation of the special sciences from philosophy though
    adumbrated in the speculations of ancient times and made more
    definite in the middle ages was completed only in modern times
    through the growth and progress of the special sciences
    themselves the line of demarcation between philosophy and
    supernatural theology must be determined by the proper relations
    between reason and faith and naturally these relations are a
    subject of debate between philosophers who believe in the
    existence of an authentic divine revelation and philosophers who
    do not it is the duty of the philosopher as such to determine by
    the light of reason whether a supreme being exists and whether a
    divine revelation to man is possible if he convinces himself of
    the existence of god he will have little difficulty in inferring
    the possibility of a divine revelation the fact of a divine
    revelation is a matter not for philosophical but for historical
    research now when a man has convinced himself of the existence of
    god and the fact of a divine revelationthe preambula fidei or
    prerequisite conditions of faith as they are calledhe must see
    that it is eminently reasonable for him to believe in the contents
    of such divine revelation he must see that the truths revealed by
    god cannot possibly trammel the freedom of his own reason in its
    philosophical inquiries into ultimate problems concerning man and
    the universe he must see that these truths may possibly act as
    beacons which will keep him from going astray in his own
    investigations knowing that truth cannot contradict truth he
    knows that if he reaches a conclusion really incompatible with any
    certainly revealed truth such conclusion must be erroneous and
    so he is obliged to reconsider the reasoning processes that led
    him to such a conclusion6 thus the position of the christian
    philosopher aided in this negative way by the truths of an
    authentic divine revelation has a distinct advantage over that of
    the philosopher who does not believe in such revelation and who
    tries to solve all ultimate questions independently of any light
    such revelation may shed upon them yet the latter philosopher as
    a rule not only regards the independent position which he
    himself takes up in the name of freedom of thought and freedom
    of research as the superior position but as the only one
    consistent with the dignity of human reason and he commonly
    accuses the christian philosopher of allowing reason to be
    enslaved in the shackles of dogma we can see at once the
    unfairness of such a charge when we remember that the christian
    philosopher has convinced himself on grounds of reason alone
    that god exists and has made a revelation to man his belief in a
    divine revelation is a reasoned belief a rationabile
    obsequium rom xii 1 and only if it were a blind belief
    unjustifiable on grounds of reason would the accusation referred
    to be a fair one the christian philosopher might retort that it
    is the unbelieving philosopher himself who really destroys
    freedom of thought and research by claiming for the latter what
    is really an abuse of freedom namely license to believe what
    reason shows to be erroneous but this countercharge would be
    equally unfair for the unbelieving philosopher does not claim any
    such undue license to believe what he knows to be false or to
    disbelieve what he knows to be true if he denies the fact or the
    possibility of a divine revelation and therefore pursues his
    philosophical investigations without any regard to the contents of
    such revelation it is because he has convinced himself on grounds
    of reason that such revelation is neither a fact nor a
    possibility he and the christian philosopher cannot both be
    right one of them must be wrong but as reasonable men they
    should agree to differ rather than hurl unjustifiable charges and
    countercharges at each other
    all philosophers who believe in the christian revelation and allow
    its authentic teachings to guide and supplement their own rational
    investigation into ultimate questions are keenly conscious of the
    consequent superior depth and fulness and certitude of christian
    philosophy as compared with all the other conflicting and
    fragmentary philosophies that mark the progress of human
    speculation on the ultimate problems of man and the universe down
    through the centuries they feel secure in the possession of a
    philosophia  perennis7 and none more secure than those of
    them who complete and confirm that philosophy by the only full and
    authentic deposit of divinely revealed truth which is to be found
    in the teaching of the catholic church
the history of philosophical investigation yields no one universally
received conception of what philosophy is nor would the definition given
above be unreservedly accepted windelband in his history of
philosophy8 instances the following predominant conceptions of
philosophy according to the chronological order in which they prevailed
a the systematic investigation of the problems raised by man and the
universe early grecian philosophy absence of differentiation of
philosophy from the special sciences b the practical art of human
conduct based on rational speculation later grecian philosophy distrust
in the value of knowledge and emphasis on practical guidance of conduct
c the helper and handmaid of the science of revealed truth ie
supernatural theology in the solution of ultimate problems the christian
philosophy of the fathers of the church and of the medieval schools down
to the sixteenth century universal recognition of the value of the
christian revelation as an aid to rational investigation d a purely
rational investigation of those problems going beyond the investigations
of the special sciences and either abstracting from or denying the value
of any light or aid from revelation differentiation of the domains of
science philosophy and theology modern philosophies from the sixteenth
to the nineteenth century excessive individualism and rationalism of
these as unnaturally divorced from recognition of and belief in divine
revelation and unduly isolated from the progressing positive sciences
e a critical analysis of the significance and scope and limitations of
human knowledge itself recent philosophies mainly concerned with
theories of knowledge and speculations on the nature of the cognitive
process and the reliability of its products
these various conceptions are interesting and suggestive much might be
said about them but not to any useful purpose in a brief introductory
chapter let us rather adopting the definition already set forth try
next to map out into its leading departments the whole philosophical
domain
iii divisions of philosophy speculative and practical philosophythe
general problem of classifying all the sciences built up by human thought
is a logical problem of no little complexity when one tries to work it out
in detail we refer to this general problem only to mention a widely
accepted principle on which it is usually approached and because the
division of philosophy itself is a section of the general problem the
principle in question is that sciences may be distinguished indeed by
partial or total diversity of subjectmatter but that such diversity is
not essential that diversity of standpoint is necessary and sufficient
to constitute distinct sciences even when these deal with one and the same
subjectmatter now applying this principle to philosophy we see firstly
that it has the same subjectmatter as all the special sciences taken
collectively but that it is distinct from all of them inasmuch as it
studies their data not from the standpoint of the proximate causes but
from the higher standpoint of the ultimate causes of these data and we
see secondly that philosophy having this one higher standpoint throughout
all its departments is one science that its divisions are only
material divisions that there is not a plurality of philosophies as there
is a plurality of sciences though there is a plurality of departments in
philosophy9 let us now see what these departments are
if we ask why people seek knowledge at all in any department we shall
detect two main impelling motives the first of these is simply the desire
to know trahimur omnes cupiditate sciendi the natural feeling of
wonder astonishment admiratio which accompanies our perception of
things and events prompts us to seek their causes to discover the
reasons which will make them intelligible to us and enable us to
understand them but while the possession of knowledge for its own sake
is thus a motive of research it is not the only motive we seek knowledge
in order to use it for the guidance of our conduct in life for the
orientation of our activities for the improvement of our condition
knowing that knowledge is power we seek it in order to make it minister
to our needs now in the degree in which it fulfils such ulterior
purposes or is sought for these purposes knowledge may be described as
practical in the degree in which it serves no ulterior end or is
sought for no ulterior end other than that of perfecting our minds it
may be described as speculative of course this latter purpose is in
itself a highly practical purpose nor indeed is there any knowledge
however speculative but has or at least is capable of having some
influence or bearing on the actual tenor and conduct of our lives and in
this sense all knowledge is practical still we can distinguish broadly
between knowledge which has no direct immediate bearing on our acts and
knowledge that has10 hence the possibility of distinguishing between
two great domains of philosophical knowledgetheoretical or speculative
philosophy and practical philosophy there are in fact two great
domains into which the data of all human experience may be divided and
for each distinct domain submitted to philosophical investigation there
will be a distinct department of philosophy a first domain is the order
realized in the universe independently of man a second is the order
which man himself realizes things therefore and acts the order
of the external universe the order of nature as it is called exists
independently of us we merely study it speculari  we do not
create it the other or practical order is established by our acts of
intelligence and will and by our bodily action on external things
under the direction of those faculties in the arts hence we have a
speculative or theoretical philosophy and a practical
philosophy11
iv departments of practical philosophy logic ethics and estheticsin
the domain of human activities to the right regulation of which practical
philosophy is directed we may distinguish two departments of mental
activity namely intellectual and volitional and besides these the
whole department of external executive or bodily activity in general
the right regulation of acts may be said to consist in directing them to
the realization of some ideal for all cognitive acts this ideal is the
true for all appetitive or volitional acts it is the good while for
all external operations it may be either the beautiful or the
usefulthe respective objects of the fine arts and the mechanical arts
or crafts
logic as a practical science studies the mental acts and processes
involved in discovering and proving truths and systematizing these into
sciences with a view to directing these acts and processes aright in the
accomplishment of this complex task hence it has for its subjectmatter
in a certain sense all the data of human experience or whatever can be
an object of human thought but it studies these data not directly or in
themselves or for their own sake but only in so far as our acts of
reason which form its direct object are brought to bear upon them in
all the other sciences we employ thought to study the various objects of
thought as things events realities and hence these may be called real
sciences scientiae reales while in logic we study thought itself and
even here not speculatively for its own sake or as a reality as we study
it for instance in psychology but practically as a process capable of
being directed towards the discovery and proof of truth and hence in
contradistinction to the other sciences as real we call logic the
rational science scientia rationalis scholastic philosophers express
this distinction by saying that while speculative philosophy studies
real being ens reale or the objects of direct thought objecta
primae intentionis mentis logic studies the being which is the product
of thought ens rationis or objects of reflex thought objecta
secundae intentionis mentis12 the mental processes involved in the
attainment of scientific truth are conception judgment and inference
moreover these processes have to be exercised methodically by the combined
application of analysis and synthesis or induction and deduction to the
various domains of human experience all these processes therefore and
the methods of their application constitute the proper subjectmatter of
logic it has been more or less a matter of debate since the days of
aristotle whether logic should be regarded as a department of
philosophical science proper or rather as a preparatory discipline an
instrument or organon of reasoningas the collection of aristotles own
logical treatises was calledand so as a vestibule or introduction to
philosophy and there is a similar difference of opinion as to whether or
not it is advisable to set down logic as the first department to be
studied in the philosophical curriculum such doubts arise from
differences of view as to the questions to be investigated in logic and
the point to which such investigations should be carried therein it is
possible to distinguish between a more elementary treatment of
thoughtprocesses with the avowedly practical aim of setting forth canons
of inference and method which would help and train the mind to reason and
investigate correctly and a more philosophical treatment of those
processes with the speculative aim of determining their ultimate
significance and validity as factors of knowledge as attaining to truth
as productive of science and certitude it is only the former field of
investigation that is usually accorded to logic nowadays and thus
understood logic ought to come first in the curriculum as a preparatory
training for philosophical studies accompanied however by certain
elementary truths from psychology regarding the nature and functions of
the human mind the other domain of deeper and more speculative
investigation was formerly explored in what was regarded as a second
portion of logical science under the title of critical logiclogica
critica in modern times this is regarded as a distinct department of
speculative philosophy under the various titles of epistemology
criteriology or the theory of knowledge
ethics or moral philosophy  mos mores morals conduct is
that department of practical philosophy which has for its subjectmatter
all human acts ie all acts elicited or commanded by the will of man
considered as a free rational and responsible agent and it studies human
conduct with the practical purpose of discovering the ultimate end or
object of this conduct and the principles whereby it must be regulated in
order to attain to this end ethics must therefore analyse and account for
the distinction of right and wrong or good and bad in human
conduct for its feature of morality it must examine the motives that
influence conduct pleasure wellbeing happiness duty obligation
moral law etc the supreme determining factor in all such considerations
will obviously be the ultimate end of man whatever this may be his
destiny as revealed by a study of his nature and place in the universe
now the nature of man is studied in psychology as are also the nature
conditions and effects of his free acts and the facilities dispositions
and forms of character consequent on these furthermore not only from the
study of man in psychology but from the study of the external universe in
cosmology we amass data from which in natural theology we establish the
existence of a supreme being we then prove in ethics that the last end of
man his highest perfection consists in knowing loving serving and
thus glorifying god both in this life and in the next hence we can see
how these branches of speculative philosophy subserve the practical
science of morals and since a mans interpretation of the moral
distinctionsas of right or wrong meritorious or blameworthy autonomous
or of obligationwhich he recognizes as pertaining to his own
actionssince his interpretation of these distinctions is so intimately
bound up with his religious outlook and beliefs it is at once apparent
that the science of ethics will be largely influenced and determined by
the system of speculative philosophy which inspires it whether this be
theism monism agnosticism etc no doubt the science of ethics must take
as its data all sorts of moral beliefs customs and practices prevalent at
any time among men but it is not a speculative science which would merely
aim at a posteriori inferences or inductive generalizations from these
data it is a practical normative science which aims at discovering the
truth as to what is the right and the wrong in human conduct and at
pointing out the right application of the principles arising out of this
truth hence it is of supreme importance for the philosopher of morals to
determine whether the human race has really been vouchsafed a divine
revelation and convincing himself that christianity contains such a
revelation to recognize the possibility of supplementing and perfecting
what his own natural reason can discover by what the christian religion
teaches about the end of man as the supreme determining principle of human
conduct not that he is to take the revealed truths of christianity as
principles of moral philosophy for these are the principles of the
supernatural  christian theology of human morals but that as a
christian philosopher ie a philosopher who recognizes the truth of
the christian revelation he should reason out philosophically a science
of ethics which so far as it goes will be in harmony with the moral
teachings of the christian religion and will admit of being perfected by
these this recognition as already remarked will not be a hindrance but
a help to him in exploring the wide domains of the individual domestic
social and religious conduct of man in determining on the basis of
theism established by natural reason the right moral conditions and
relations of mans conduct as an individual as a member of the family as
a member of the state and as a creature of god the nature source and
sanction of authority domestic social and religious of the dictate of
conscience of the natural moral law and of all positive law of the moral
virtues and vicesthese are all questions which the philosopher of ethics
has to explore by the use of natural reason and for the investigation of
which the christian philosopher of ethics is incomparably better equipped
than the philosopher who though possessing the compass of natural reason
ignores the beacon lights of divinely revealed truths
esthetics or the philosophy of the fine arts is that department of
philosophy which studies the conception of the beautiful and its
external expression in the works of nature and of man the arts
themselves of course whether concerned with the realization of the
useful or of the beautiful are distinct from sciences even from
practical sciences13 the technique itself consists in a skill
acquired by practiceby practice guided however by a set of practical
canons or rules which are the ripe fruit of experience14 but behind
every art there is always some background of more or less speculative
truth the conception of the useful however which underlies the
mechanical arts and crafts is not an ultimate conception calling for any
further analysis than it receives in the various special sciences and in
metaphysics but the conception of the beautiful does seem to demand a
special philosophical consideration on the subjective or mental side the
esthetic sense artistic taste the sentiment of the beautiful the
complex emotions accompanying such experience on the objective side the
elements or factors requisite to produce this experience the relation of
the esthetic to the moral of the beautiful to the good and the truethese
are all distinctly philosophical questions up to the present time
however their treatment has been divided between the other departments of
philosophypsychology cosmology natural theology general metaphysics
ethicsrather than grouped together to form an additional distinct
department
v departments of speculative philosophy metaphysicsthe philosophy
which studies the order realized in things apart from our activity
speculative philosophy has been variously divided up into separate
departments from the first origins of philosophical speculation
when we remember that all intellectual knowledge of things involves the
apprehension of general truths or laws about these things and that this
apprehension of intelligible aspects common to a more or less extensive
group of things involves the exercise of abstraction we can understand
how the whole domain of speculative knowledge whether scientific or
philosophical can be differentiated into certain layers or levels so to
speak according to various degrees of abstractness and universality in
the intelligible aspects under which the data of our experience may be
considered on this principle aristotle and the scholastics divided all
speculative knowledge into three great domains physics mathematics
and metaphysics with their respective proper objects change
quantity and being objects which are successively apprehended in
three great stages of abstraction traversed by the human mind in its
effort to understand and explain the universal order of things
and as a matter of fact perhaps the first great common and most obvious
feature which strikes the mind reflecting on the visible universe is the
feature of allpervading change  movement evolution progress
and regress growth and decay we see it everywhere in a variety of forms
mechanical or local change quantitative change qualitative change vital
change now the knowledge acquired by the study of things under this
common aspect is called physics here the mind abstracts merely from the
individualizing differences of this change in individual things and fixes
its attention on the great common sensible aspect itself of visible
change
but the mind can abstract even from the sensible changes that take place
in the physical universe and fix its attention on a static feature in
the changing things this static element   which the
intellect apprehends in material things as naturally inseparable from
them     is their quantity their extension in
space when the mind strips a material object of all its visible sensible
propertieson which its mechanical physical and chemical changes
dependthere still remains as an object of thought a something formed of
parts outside parts in three dimensions of space this abstract
quantity quantitas intelligibiliswhether as continuous or
discontinuous as magnitude or multitudeis the proper object of
mathematics
but the mind can penetrate farther still into the reality of the material
data which it finds endowed with the attributes of change and quantity it
can eliminate from the object of its thought even this latter or
mathematical attribute and seize on something still more fundamental the
very essence substance nature being itself of the thing the
underlying subject and root principle of all the things operations and
attributes is something deeper than any of these attributes something at
least mentally distinct from these latter     and
this something is the proper object of mans highest speculative
knowledge which aristotle called    philosophia prima
the first or fundamental or deepest philosophy15
but he gave this latter order of knowledge another very significant title
he called it theology or theological science   by a
denomination derived a potiori parte from its nobler part its
culmination in the knowledge of god let us see how for aristotle first
philosophy is the science of being and its essential attributes16
here the mind apprehends its object as static or abstracted from change
and as immaterial or abstracted from quantity the fundamental attribute
of material realityas    now it is the substance
nature or essence of the things of our direct and immediate experience
that forms the proper object of this highest science but in these things
the substance nature or essence is not found in real and actual
separation from the material attributes of change and quantity it is
considered separately from these only by an effort of mental
abstraction even the nature of man himself is not wholly immaterial nor
is the spiritual principle in man his soul entirely exempt from material
conditions hence in so far as first philosophy studies the being of the
things of our direct experience its object is immaterial only
negatively or by mental abstraction but does this study bring within
the scope of our experience any being or reality that is positively and
actually exempt from all change and all material conditions if so the
study of this being the divine being will be the highest effort the
crowning perfection of first philosophy which we may therefore call
the theological science if writes aristotle17 there really
exists a substance absolutely immutable and immaterial in a word a
divine beingas we hope to provethen such being must be the absolutely
first and supreme principle and the science that attains to such being
will be theological
in this triple division of speculative philosophy into physics
mathematics and metaphysics it will naturally occur to one to ask did
aristotle distinguish between what he called physics and what we nowadays
call the special physical sciences he did these special analytic
studies of the various departments of the physical universe animate and
inanimate aristotle described indiscriminately as partial sciences 
      these descriptive
inductive comparative studies proceeding a posteriori from effects to
causes he conceived rather as a preparation for scientific knowledge
proper this latter he conceived to be a synthetic deductive
explanation of things in the light of some common aspect detected in them
as principle or cause of all their concrete characteristics18 such
synthetic knowledge of things in the light of some such common aspect as
change is what he regarded as scientific knowledge meaning thereby what
we mean by philosophical knowledge19 what he called physics
therefore is what we nowadays understand as cosmology and
psychology20
mathematical science aristotle likewise regarded as science in the full
and perfect sense ie as philosophical but just as we distinguish
nowadays between the special physical and human sciences on the one hand
and the philosophy of external nature and man on the other so we may
distinguish between the special mathematical sciences and a philosophy of
mathematics with this difference that while the former groups of special
sciences are mainly inductive the mathematical group is mainly deductive
furthermore the philosophy of mathematicswhich investigates questions
regarding the ultimate significance of mathematical concepts axioms and
assumptions unity multitude magnitude quantity space time etcdoes
not usually form a separate department in the philosophical curriculum
its problems are dealt with as they arise in the other departments of
metaphysics
before outlining the modern divisions of metaphysics we may note that this
latter term was not used by aristotle we owe it probably to andronicus of
rhodes  40 bc who when arranging a complete edition of aristotles
works placed next in order after the physics or physical treatises
all the parts and fragments of the masters works bearing upon the
immutable and immaterial object of the philosophia prima these he
labelled      post physica the books after the
physics hence the name metaphysics21 applied to this highest
section of speculative philosophy it was soon noticed that the term thus
fortuitously applied to such investigations conveyed a very appropriate
description of their scope and character if interpreted in the sense of
supraphysica or transphysica inasmuch as the object of these
investigations is a hyperphysical object an object that is either
positively and really or negatively and by abstraction beyond the
material conditions of quantity and change st thomas combines both
meanings of the term when he says that the study of its subjectmatter
comes naturally after the study of physics and that we naturally pass
from the study of the sensible to that of the suprasensible22
the term philosophia prima has now only an historical interest and the
term theology used without qualification is now generally understood
to signify supernatural theology
vi departments of metaphysics cosmology psychology and natural
theologynowadays the term metaphysics is understood as synonymous with
speculative philosophy the investigation of the being nature or
essence and essential attributes of the realities which are also studied
in the various special sciences the search for the ultimate grounds
reasons and causes of these realities of which the proximate explanations
are sought in the special sciences we have seen that it has for its
special object that most abstract aspect of reality whereby the latter is
conceived as changeless and immaterial and we have seen that a being may
have these attributes either by mental abstraction merely or in actual
reality in other words the philosophical study of things that are really
material not only suggests the possibility but establishes the actual
existence of a being that is really changeless and immaterial so that
metaphysics in all its amplitude would be the philosophical science of
things that are negatively by abstraction or positively in reality
immaterial this distinction suggests a division of metaphysics into
general and special metaphysics the former would be the philosophical
study of all being considered by mental abstraction as immaterial the
latter would be the philosophical study of the really and positively
changeless and immaterial beinggod the former would naturally fall into
two great branches the study of inanimate nature and the study of
living things cosmology and psychology while special metaphysics
the philosophical study of the divine being would constitute natural
theology these three departments one of special metaphysics and two of
general metaphysics would not be three distinct philosophical sciences
but three departments of the one speculative philosophical science the
standpoint would be the same in all three sections viz being
considered as static and immaterial by mental abstraction for
whatever positive knowledge we can reach about being that is really
immaterial can be reached only through concepts derived from material
being and applied analogically to immaterial being
cosmology and psychology divide between them the whole domain of mans
immediate experience cosmology utilizing not only the data of direct
experience but also the conclusions established by the analytic study of
these data in the physical sciences explores the origin nature and
destiny of the material universe some philosophers include among the data
of cosmology all the phenomena of vegetative life reserving sentient and
rational life for psychology others include even sentient life in
cosmology reserving the study of human life for psychology or as they
would call it anthropology23 the mere matter of location is of
secondary importance seeing however that man embodies in himself all
three forms of life vegetative sentient and rational all three would
perhaps more naturally belong to psychology which would be the
philosophical study of life in all its manifestations  the vital
principle the soul just as the conclusions of the physical sciences are
the data of cosmology so the conclusions of the natural or biological
scienceszoology botany physiology morphology cellular biology
etcare the data of psychology indeed in psychology itselfespecially in
more recent yearsit is possible to distinguish a positive analytic
empirical study of the phenomena of consciousness a study which would
rank rather as a special than as an ultimate or philosophical science and
a synthetic rational study of the results of this analysis a study which
would be strictly philosophical in character this would have for its
object to determine the origin nature and destiny of living things in
general and of man himself in particular it would inquire into the nature
and essential properties of living matter into the nature of the subject
of conscious states into the operations and faculties of the human mind
into the nature of the human soul and its mode of union with the body
into the rationality of the human intellect and the freedom of the human
will the spirituality and immortality of the human soul etc
but since the human mind itself is the natural instrument whereby man
acquires all his knowledge it will be at once apparent that the study
of the phenomenon of knowledge itself of the cognitive activity of
the mind can be studied and must be studied not merely as a natural
phenomenon of the mind but from the point of view of its special
significance as representative of objects other than itself from the
point of view of its validity or invalidity its truth or falsity and
with the special aim of determining the scope and limitations and
conditions of its objective validity we have already referred to the
study of human knowledge from this standpoint in connexion with what was
said above concerning logic it has a close kinship with logic on the one
hand and with psychology on the other and nowadays it forms a distinct
branch of speculative philosophy under the title of criteriology
epistemology or the theory of knowledge
arising out of the data of our direct experience external and internal
as studied in the philosophical departments just outlined we find a
variety of evidences all pointing beyond the domain of this direct
experience to the supreme conclusion that there exists of necessity
distinct from this directly experienced universe as its creator
conserver and ruler its first beginning and its last end its alpha
and omega one divine and infinite being the deity the existence and
attributes of the deity and the relations of man and the universe to the
deity form the subjectmatter of natural theology
vii departments of metaphysics ontology and epistemologyaccording to
the aristotelian and scholastic conception speculative philosophy would
utilize as data the conclusions of the special sciencesphysical
biological and human it would try to reach a deeper explanation of their
data by synthesizing these under the wider aspects of change quantity
and being thus bringing to light the ultimate causes reasons and
explanatory principles of things this whole study would naturally fall
into two great branches general metaphysics cosmology and
psychology which would study things exempt from quantity and change
not really but only by mental abstraction and special metaphysics
natural theology which would study the positively immaterial and
immutable being of the deity
this division of metaphysics thoroughly sound in principle and based on
a sane and rational view of the relation between the special sciences and
philosophy has been almost entirely24 supplanted in modern times by a
division which abstracting from the erroneous attitude that prompted it
in the first instance has much to recommend it from the standpoint of
practical convenience of treatment the modern division was introduced by
wolff 16791755 a german philosophera disciple of leibniz 16461716
and forerunner of kant 1724180425 influenced by the excessively
deductive method of leibniz philosophy which he sought to systematize
and to popularize he wrongly conceived the metaphysical study of reality
as something wholly apart and separate from the inductive investigation of
this same reality in the positive sciences it comprised the study of the
most fundamental and essential principles of being considered in
themselves and the deductive application of these principles to the three
great domains of actual reality the corporeal universe the human soul
and god the study of the first principles of being in themselves would
constitute general metaphysics or ontology  their
applications would constitute three great departments of special
metaphysics cosmology which he described as transcendental in
opposition to the experimental physical sciences psychology which he
termed rational in opposition to the empirical biological sciences and
finally natural theology which he entitled theodicy
 using a term invented by leibniz for his essays in
vindication of the wisdom and justice of divine providence notwithstanding
the evils of the universe
    the spirit that animated this arrangement of the departments of
    metaphysics writes mercier was unsound in theory and
    unfortunate in tendency it stereotyped for centuries a disastrous
    divorce between philosophy and the sciences a divorce that had
    its origin in circumstances peculiar to the intellectual
    atmosphere of the early eighteenth century as a result of it
    there was soon no common language or understanding between
    scientists and philosophers the terms which expressed the most
    fundamental ideasmatter substance movement cause force
    energy and such likewere taken in different senses in science
    and in philosophy hence misunderstandings aggravated by a
    growing mutual distrust and hostility until finally people came
    to believe that scientific and metaphysical preoccupations were
    incompatible if not positively opposed to each other26
    how very different from the disintegrating conception here
    criticized is the traditional aristotelian and scholastic
    conception of the complementary functions of philosophy and the
    sciences in unifying human knowledge a conception thus eloquently
    expressed by newman in his idea of a university27
    all that exists as contemplated by the human mind forms one
    large system or complex fact now it is not wonderful that
    with all its capabilities the human mind cannot take in this
    whole vast fact at a single glance or gain possession of it at
    once like a shortsighted reader its eye pores closely and
    travels slowly over the awful volume which lies open for its
    inspection or again as we deal with some huge structure of many
    parts and sides the mind goes round about it noting down first
    one thing then another as best it may and viewing it under
    different aspects by way of making progress towards mastering the
    whole these various partial views or abstractions  are
    called sciences  they proceed on the principle of a division of
    labour as they all belong to one and the same circle of
    objects they are one and all connected together as they are but
    aspects of things they are severally incomplete in their relation
    to the things themselves though complete in their own idea and
    for their own respective purposes on both accounts they at once
    need and subserve each other and further the comprehension of
    the bearings of one science on another and the use of each to
    each and the location and limitation and adjustment and due
    appreciation of them all one with another this belongs i
    conceive to a sort of science distinct from all of them and in
    some sense a science of sciences which is my own conception of
    what is meant by philosophy
without in any way countenancing such an isolation of metaphysics from the
positive sciences we may nevertheless adopt the modern division in
substance and in practice while recognizing the intimate connexion
between the special sciences and metaphysics in all its branches we may
regard as general metaphysics all inquiries into the fundamental
principles of being and of knowing of reality and of knowledge
and as special metaphysics the philosophical study of physical nature
of human nature and of god the author and supreme cause of all finite
reality thus while special metaphysics would embrace cosmology
psychology and natural theology general metaphysics would embrace
ontology and epistemology these two latter disciplines must no doubt
investigate what is in a certain sense one and the same subjectmatter
inasmuch as knowledge is knowledge of reality nor can the knowing
mind the subjectum cognoscens and the known reality the objectum
cognitum be wholly separated or studied in complete isolation from each
other yet the whole content of human experience which forms their common
subjectmatter can be regarded by mental abstraction from the two
distinct standpoints of the knowing mind and the known reality and can
thus give rise to two distinct sets of problems epistemology is thus
concerned with the truth and certitude of human knowledge with the
subjective conditions and the scope and limits of its validity with the
subjective or mental factors involved in knowing28 ontology is
concerned with the objects of knowledge with reality considered in the
widest deepest and most fundamental aspects under which it is conceived
by the human mind with the being and becoming of reality its possibility
and its actuality its essence and its existence its unity and plurality
with the aspects of truth goodness perfection beauty which it assumes
in relation with our minds with the contingency of finite reality and the
grounds and implications both of its actual existence and of its
intelligibility with the modes of its concrete existence and behaviour
the supreme categories of reality as they are called substance
individual nature and personality quantity space and time quality and
relation causality and purpose these are the principal topics
investigated in the present volume the investigation is confined to
fundamental concepts and principles leaving their applications to be
followed out in special metaphysics furthermore the theory of knowledge
known as moderate realism29 the realism of aristotle and the
scholastics in regard to the validity of knowledge both sensual and
intellectual is assumed throughout because not alone is this the true
theory butas a natural consequenceit is the only theory which renders
the individual things and events of human experience really intelligible
and at the same time keeps the highest and most abstract intellectual
speculations of metaphysics in constant and wholesome contact with the
concrete actual world in which we live move and have our being
viii remarks on some misgivings and prejudicesthe student especially
the beginner will find the investigations in this volume rather abstract
but if he remembers that the content of our intellectual concepts be they
ever so abstract and universal is really embodied in the individual
things and events of his daily experience he will not be disposed to
denounce all ultimate analysis of these concepts as unprofitable or
unreal he will recognize that the reproach of talking in the air
which was levelled by an eminent medieval scholastic30 at certain
philosophers of his time tells against the metaphysical speculations of
conceptualism but not against those of moderate realism the reproach is
commonly cast at all systematic metaphysics nowadaysfrom prejudices too
numerous and varied to admit of investigation here31 the modern
prejudice which denies the very possibility of metaphysics a prejudice
arising from phenomenism positivism and agnosticismsystems which are
themselves no less metaphysical than erroneouswill be examined in due
course32
but really in order to dispel all such misgivings one has only to remember
that metaphysics systematic or otherwise is nothing more than a mans
reasoned outlook on the world and life whatever his conscious opinions
and convictions may be regarding the nature and purpose of himself and
other men and the world at largeand if he use his reason at all he must
have some sort of opinions and convictions whether positive or negative
on these mattersthose opinions and convictions are precisely that mans
metaphysics breaking free for the moment from all historical and
technical definition let us affirm to get at realitythis is the aim
of metaphysics so writes professor ladd in the opening chapter of his
theory of reality33 but if this is so surely a systematic attempt to
get at reality no matter how deep and wide no matter how abstract and
universal be the conceptions and speculations to which it leads us cannot
nevertheless always and of necessity have the effect of involving us in a
mirage of illusion and unreality
    systematic metaphysicsto quote again the author just referred
    to34 is  the necessary result of a patient orderly
    wellinformed and prolonged study of those ultimate problems
    which are proposed to every reflective mind by the real existences
    and actual transactions of selves and of things thus considered
    it appears as the least abstract and foreign to concrete realities
    of all the higher pursuits of reason mathematics is abstract
    logic is abstract mathematical and socalled pure physics are
    abstract but metaphysics is bound by its very nature and calling
    always to keep near to the actual and to the concrete dive into
    the depths of speculation indeed it may and its ocean is
    boundless in expanse and deep beyond all reach of human plummets
    but it finds its place of standing for every new turn of daring
    explanation on some bit of solid ground for it is actuality
    which it wishes to understandalthough in reflective and
    interpretative way to quote from professor royce the basis of
    our whole theory is the bare brute fact of experience which you
    have always with you namely the fact something is real our
    question is what is this reality or again what is the
    ultimately real35
the wonderful progress of the positive sciences during the last few
centuries has been the occasion of prejudice against metaphysics in a
variety of ways it is objected for instance that metaphysics has no
corresponding progress to boast of and from this there is but a small
step to the conclusion that all metaphysical speculation is sterile the
comparison is unfair for many reasons research into the ultimate grounds
and causes of things is manifestly more difficult than research into their
proximate grounds and causes again while the positive sciences have
increased our knowledge mainly in extent rather than in depth it is
metaphysics and only metaphysics that can increase this knowledge in its
unity comprehensiveness and significance
a positive increase in our knowledge of the manifold data of human
experience is not the aim of metaphysics its aim is to give an ultimate
meaning and interpretation to this knowledge it is not utilitarian in the
narrower sense in which the positive and special sciences are utilitarian
by ministering to our material needs but in the higher and nobler sense
of pointing out to us the bearing of all human knowledge and achievement
on our real nature and destiny true indeed individual leaders and
schools of metaphysics have strayed from the truth and spoken with
conflicting and uncertain voices especially when they have failed to
avail themselves of truth divinely revealed this however is not a
failure of metaphysics but of individual metaphysicians and furthermore
it is undeniable withal that the metaphysical labours of the great
philosophers in all ages have contributed richly to the enlightenment and
civilization of mankindparticularly when these labours have been in
concord and cooperation with the elevating and purifying influences of
the christian religion of no metaphysical system is this so entirely true
as of that embodied in scholastic philosophy the greatest intellect of
the middle ages st thomas aquinas gave to this philosophy an expression
which is rightly regarded by the modern scholastic as his intellectual
charter and the most worthy startingpoint of his philosophical
investigations the following passage from an eminent representative of
modern scholastic thought36 is sufficiently suggestive to admit of
quotation
    amid the almost uninterrupted disintegration of systems during the
    last three centuries the philosophy of st thomas has alone been
    able to stand the shock of criticism it alone has proved
    sufficiently solid and comprehensive to serve as an intellectual
    basis and unifying principle for all the new facts and phenomena
    brought to light by the modern sciences and unless we are much
    mistaken those who take up and follow this philosophy will come
    to think as we do that on the analysis of mental acts and
    processes on the inner nature of corporeal things of living
    things and of man on the existence and nature of god on the
    foundations of speculative and moral science none have thought or
    written more wisely than st thomas aquinas but though we place
    our programme and teaching under the patronage of the illustrious
    name of this prince of scholastics we do not regard the thomistic
    philosophy as an ideal beyond possibility of amelioration or as a
    boundary to the activity of the human mind we do think however
    on mature reflection that we are acting no less wisely than
    modestly in taking it as our startingpoint and constant standard
    of reference this we say in answer to those of our friends and
    enemies who are occasionally pleased to ask us if we really do
    mean to lead back the modern mind into the middle ages and to
    identify philosophy simply with the thought of any one
    philosopher manifestly we mean nothing of the kind has not leo
    xiii the great initiator of the new scholastic movement
    expressly warned us37 to be mindful of the present edicimus
    libenti gratoque animo recipiendum esse quidquid sapienter dictum
    quidquid utiliter fuerit a quopiam inventum atque excogitatum
    st thomas himself would be the first to rebuke those who would
    follow his own philosophical opinions in all things against their
    own better judgment and to remind them of what he wrote at the
    head of his summa that in philosophy of all arguments that
    based on human authority is the weakest locus ab auctoritate qu
    fundatur super ratione humana est infirmissimus38
    again therefore let us assert that respect for tradition is not
    servility but mere elementary prudence respect for a doctrine of
    whose soundness and worth we are personally convinced is not
    fetishism it is but a rational and rightful tribute to the
    dominion of truth over mind
    modern scholastics will know how to take to heart and profit by
    the lessons of the seventeenth and eighteenth century
    controversies they will avoid the mistakes of their predecessors
    they will keep in close contact with the special sciences
    subsidiary to philosophy and with the views and teachings of
    modern and contemporary thinkers39
an overweening confidence in the power of the special sciences to solve
ultimate questions or at least to tell us all that can be known for
certain about these problems a confidence based on the astonishing
progress of those sciences in modern times is the source of yet another
prejudice against metaphysics it is a prejudice of the halfeducated
mind of the campfollowers of science not of its leaders these latter
are keenly conscious that the solution of ultimate questions lies entirely
beyond the methods of the special sciences not that even the most eminent
scientists do not indulge in speculations about ultimate problemsas they
have a perfect right to do but though they may be themselves quite aware
that such speculations are distinctly metaphysical there are multitudes
who seem to think that a theory ceases to be metaphysical and becomes
scientific provided only it is broached by a scientific expert as distinct
from a metaphysician40 but all sincere thinkers will recognize that no
ultimate question about the totality of human experience can be solved by
any science which explores merely a portion of this experience nay the
more rapid and extensive is the progress of the various special sciences
the more imperative and insistent becomes the need to collect and collate
their separate findings to interrogate them one and all as to whether and
how far these findings fit in with the facts and conditions of human life
and existence to determine what light and aid they contribute to the
solution of the great and ever recurring questions of the whence and
whither and why of man and the universe one who is a sincere
scientist as well as an earnest philosopher has written  propos of this
necessity in the following terms
    the farther science has pushed back the limits of the discernible
    universe the more insistently do we feel the demand within us for
    some satisfactory explanation of the whole the old eternal
    problems rise up before us and clamour loudly and ever more loudly
    for some newer and better solution the solution offered by a
    bygone age was soothing at least if it was not final in the
    present age however the problems reappear with an acuteness that
    is almost painful the deep secret of our own human nature the
    questions of our origin and destiny the intermeddling of blind
    necessity and chance and pain in the strange tangled drama of our
    existence the foibles and oddities of the human soul and all the
    mystifying problems of social relations are not these all so many
    enigmas which torment and trouble us whithersoever we turn and
    all seem to circle around the one essential question has human
    nature a real meaning and value or is it so utterly amiss that
    truth and peace will never be its portion41
a final difficulty against philosophical research is suggested by the
thought that if the philosopher has to take cognizance of all the
conclusions of all the special sciences his task is an impossible one
inasmuch as nowadays at all events it would take a lifetime to become
proficient in a few of these sciences not to speak of all of them
there is no question however of becoming proficient in them the
philosopher need not be a specialist in any positive science his
acquaintance with the contents of these sciences need extend no farther
than such established conclusions and such current though unverified
hypotheses as have an immediate bearing on ultimate or philosophical
problems
moreover while it would be injurious both to philosophy and to science
as is proved by the history of both alike to separate synthetic from
analytic speculation by a divorce between philosophy and science while it
would be unwise to ignore the conclusions of the special sciences and to
base philosophical research exclusively on the data of the plain mans
common and unanalysed experience it must be remembered on the other hand
that the most fundamental truths of speculative and practical philosophy
the truths that are most important for the right and proper orientation of
human life can be established and defended independently of the special
researches of the positive sciences the human mind had not to await the
discovery of radium in order to prove the existence of god such supreme
truths as the existence of god the immortality of the human soul the
freedom of the human will the existence of a moral law the distinction
between right and wrong etc have been always in possession of the
human race it has been moreover confirmed in its possession of them by
divine revelation and it has not needed either the rise or the progress
of modern science to defend them these fundamental rational truths
constitute a philosophia perennis a fund of truth which is like all
truth immutable though our human insight into it may develop in depth
and clearness
but while this is so it is none the less true that philosophy to be
progressive in its own order must take account of every new fact and
conclusion brought to light in every department of scientificand
historical and artistic and literary and every other sort ofresearch
and this for the simple reason that every such accession whether of fact
or of theory is an enlargement of human experience as such it clamours
on the one hand for philosophical interpretation for explanation in the
light of what we know already about the ultimate grounds and causes of
things for admission into our worldoutlook for adjustment and
coordination with the previous contents of the latter while on the
other hand by its very appearance on the horizon of human experience it
may enrich or illumine rectify or otherwise influence this outlook or
some aspect of it42
if then philosophy has to take account of advances in every other
department of human research it is clear that its mastery at the present
day is a more laborious task than ever it was in the past in order to get
an intelligent grasp of its principles in their applications to the
problems raised by the progress of the sciences to newly discovered facts
and newly propounded hypotheses the student must be familiar with these
facts and hypotheses and all the more so because through the medium of a
sensational newspaper press that has more regard for novelty than truth
these facts and hypotheses are no sooner brought to light by scientists
than what are often garbled and distorted versions of them are circulated
among the masses43
similarly in order that a sound system of speculative and practical
philosophy be expounded developed and defended at the present time a
system that will embrace and coordinate the achieved results of modern
scientific research a system that will offer the most satisfactory
solutions of old difficulties in new forms and give the most reasonable
and reliable answers to the ever recurring questionings of man concerning
his own nature and destinyit is clear that the insufficiency of
individual effort must be supplemented by the cooperation of numbers it
is the absence of fulness completeness adequacy in most modern systems
of philosophy their fragmentary character the unequal development of
their parts that accounts very largely for the despairing attitude of the
many who nowadays despise and turn away from philosophical speculation
add to this the uncertain voice with which these philosophies speak in
consequence of their advocates ignoring the implications of the most
stupendous fact in human experiencethe christian revelation but there
is one philosophy which is free from these defects a philosophy which is
in complete harmony with revealed truth and which forms with the latter
the only true philosophy of life and that one philosophy is the system
which assimilating the wisdom of plato aristotle and all the other
greatest thinkers of the world has been traditionally expounded in the
christian schoolsthe scholastic system of philosophy it has been
elaborated by no one man and is the original fruit of no one mind unlike
the philosophies of kant or hegel or spencer or james or comte or bergson
it is not a oneman philosophy it cannot boast of the novelty or
originality of the many eccentric and ephemeral systems which have
succeeded one another so rapidly in recent times in the world of
intellectual fashion but it has ever possessed the enduring novelty of
the truth which is ever ancient and ever new now although this
philosophy may have been mastered in its broad outlines and applications
by specially gifted individuals in past ages its progressive exposition
and development and its application to the vastly extended and
evergrowing domains of experience that are being constantly explored by
the special sciences can never be the work of any individual it can be
accomplished only by the earnest cooperation of christian philosophers in
every part of the civilized world44
in carrying on this work we have not to build from the beginning it has
sometimes been remarked as newman observes45 when men have boasted
of the knowledge of modern times that no wonder we see more than the
ancients because we are mounted upon their shoulders yes the
intellectual toilers of today are heirs to the intellectual wealth of
their ancestors we have tradition not to despise but to use critically
judiciously reverently if we are to use it profitably thomas davis has
somewhere said that they who demolish the past do not build up for the
future and we have the christian revelation as a lamp to our feet
and a light to our paths46 in all those rational investigations
which form the appointed task of the philosopher hence
    let knowledge grow from more to more
      but more of reverence in us dwell
      that mind and soul according well
    may make one music as before
    but vaster47
chapter i being and its primary determinations
1 our concept of being its expression and featuresthe term being
lat ens gr  ger seiend fr tant as present participle of
the verb to be lat esse gr  ger sein fr tre means
existing existens existere but the participle has come to be
used as a noun and as such it does not necessarily imply actual existence
hic et nunc it does indeed imply some relation to actual existence for
we designate as being in the substantive sense only whatever we
conceive as actually existing or at least as capable of existing and it
is from the participial sense which implies actual existence that the
substantive sense has been derived moreover the intelligible use of the
word being as a term implies a reference to some actually existing
sphere of reality48 it is in the substantive meaning the term will be
most frequently used in these pages as the context will show when we
speak of a being in the concrete the word has the same meaning as
thing res used in the wide sense in which this latter includes
persons places events facts and phenomena of whatsoever kind in the
same sense we speak of a reality this term having taken on a concrete
in addition to its original abstract meaning being has also this
abstract sense when we speak of the being or reality of things finally
it may be used in a collective sense to indicate the sumtotal of all that
is or can beall reality
a the notion of being spontaneously reached by the human mind is
found on reflection to be the simplest of all notions defying every
attempt at analysis into simpler notions it is involved in every other
concept which we form of any object of thought whatsoever without it we
could have no concept of anything
b it is thus the first of all notions in the logical order ie
in the process of rational thought
c it is also the first of all notions in the chronological order
the first which the human mind forms in the order of time not of course
that we remember having formed it before any other more determinate
notions but the childs awakening intellectual activity must have
proceeded from the simplest easiest most superficial of all concepts to
fuller clearer and more determinate concepts ie from the vague and
confused notion of being or thing to notions of definite modes of
being or kinds of thing
d this direct notion of being is likewise the most indeterminate of
all notions though not of course entirely indeterminate an object of
thought to be conceivable or intelligible at all by our finite minds
must be rendered definite in some manner and degree and even this widest
notion of being is rendered intelligible only by being conceived as
positive and as contrasting with absolute nonbeing or nothingness49
    according to the hegelian philosophy pure thought can apparently
    think pure being ie being in absolute indeterminateness
    being as not even differentiated from pure notbeing or absolute
    nothingness and this absolutely indeterminate confusion we may
    not call it a synthesis or unity of something and nothing of
    being and notbeing of positive and negative of affirmation and
    denial would be conceived by our finite minds as the objective
    correlative of and at the same time as absolutely identical with
    its subjective correlative which is pure thought well it is
    with the human mind and its objects and how it thinks those
    objects that we are concerned at present not with speculations
    involving the gratuitous assumption of a being that would
    transcend all duality of subject and object all determinateness
    of knowing and being all distinction of thought and thing we
    believe that the human mind can establish the existence of a
    supreme being whose mode of thought and existence transcends all
    human comprehension but it can do so only as the culminating
    achievement of all its speculation and the transcendent being it
    thus reaches has nothing in common with the monistic idealreal
    being of hegels philosophy in endeavouring to set out from the
    high a priori ground of such an intangible conception the
    hegelian philosophy starts at the wrong end
e further the notion of being is the most abstract of all notions
poorest in intension as it is widest in extension we derive it from the
data of our experience and the process by which we reach it is a process
of abstraction we lay aside all the differences whereby things are
distinguished from one another we do not consider these differences we
prescind or abstract from them mentally and retain for consideration only
what is common to all of them this common element forms the explicit
content of our notion of being
it must be noted however that we do not positively exclude the
differences from the object of our concept we cannot do this for the
simple reason that the differences too are being inasmuch as they too
are modes of being our attitude towards them is negative we merely
abstain from considering them explicitly though they remain in our
concept implicitly the separation effected is only mental subjective
notional formal negative not objective not real not positive hence
the process by which we narrow down the concept of being to the more
comprehensive concept of this or that generic or specific mode of being
does not add to the former concept anything really new or distinct from
or extraneous to it but rather brings out explicitly something that was
implicit in the latter the composition of being with its modes is
therefore only logical composition not real
on the other hand it would seem that when we abstract a generic mode of
being from the specific modes subordinate to the former we positively
exclude the differentiating characteristics of these species and that
conversely when we narrow down the genus to a subordinate species we do
so by adding on a differentiating mode which was not contained even
implicitly in the generic concept thus for example the differentiating
concept rational is not contained even implicitly in the generic concept
animal it is added on ab extra to the latter50 in order to reach
the specific concept of rational animal or man so that in abstracting
the generic from the subordinate specific concept we prescind
objectively and really from the differentiating concept by positively
excluding this latter this kind of abstraction is called objective real
positive and the composition of such generic and differentiating modes of
being is technically known as metaphysical composition the different
modes of being which the mind can distinguish at different levels of
abstraction in any specific conceptsuch as rational sentient
living corporeal in the concept of manare likewise known as
metaphysical grades of being
    it has been questioned whether this latter kind of abstraction is
    always used in relating generic specific and differential modes
    of being at first sight it would not appear to be a quite
    satisfactory account of the process in cases where the generic
    notion exhibits a mode of being which can be embodied only in one
    or other of a number of alternative specific modes by means of
    differentiae not found in any things lying outside the genus
    itself the generic notion of plane rectilinear figure does not
    of course include explicitly its species triangle
    quadrilateral pentagon etc nor does it include even
    implicitly any definite one of them but the concept of each of
    the differentiating characters eg the differentia
    threesidedness is unintelligible except as a mode of a plane
    rectilinear figure51 this however is only accidental ie
    due to the special objects considered52 and even here there
    persists this difference that whereas what differentiates the
    species of plane rectilinear figures is not explicitly and
    formally planerectilinearity that which differentiates finite
    from infinite being or substantial from accidental being is
    itself also formally and explicitly being but there are other
    cases in which the abstraction is manifestly objective thus for
    example the differentiating concept rational does not even
    implicitly include the generic concept animal for the former
    concept may be found realized in beings other than animals and
    the differentiating concept living does not even implicitly
    include the concept corporeal for it may be found realized in
    incorporeal beings
f since the notion of being is so simple that it cannot be analysed
into simpler notions which might serve as its genus and differentia
it cannot strictly speaking be defined we can only describe it by
considering it from various points of view and comparing it with the
various modes in which we find it realized this is what we have been
attempting so far considering its fundamental relation to existence we
might say that being is that which exists or is at least capable of
existing ens est id quod existit vel saltem existere potest or
considering its relation to its opposite we might say that being is that
which is not absolute nothingness ens est id quod non est nihil
absolutum or considering its relation to our minds we might say that
being is whatever is thinkable whatever can be an object of thought
g the notion of being is so universal that it transcends all actual
and conceivable determinate modes of being it embraces infinite being and
all modes of finite being in other words it is not itself a generic but
a transcendental notion wider than all even the widest and highest
genera it is not itself a genus a genus is determinable into its species
by the addition of differences which lie outside the concept of the genus
itself being as we have seen is not in this way determinable into its
modes
2 in what sense are all things that exist or can exist said to be real
or to have beinga generic concept can be predicated univocally
ie in the same sense of its subordinate species these latter differ
from one another by characteristics which lie outside the concept of the
genus while they all agree in realizing the generic concept itself they
do not of course realize it in the same way53 but as such it is really
and truly in each of them and is predicated in the same sense of each but
the characteristics which differentiate all genera and species from one
another and from the common notion of being in which they all agree are
likewise being that in which they differ is being as well as that in
which they agree hence we do not predicate being univocally of its
various modes when we say of the various classes of things which make up
our experience that they are real or realities or beings we do
not apply this predicate in altogether the same sense to the several
classes for as applied to each class it connotes the whole content of
each not merely the part in which this agrees with but also the part in
which it differs from the others nor yet do we apply the concept of
being in a totally different sense to each separate determinate mode of
being when we predicate being of its modes the predication is not
merely equivocal the concept expressed by the predicateterm being is
not totally different as applied to each subjectmode for in all cases
alike it implies either actual existence or some relation thereto it only
remains therefore that we must regard the notion of being when
predicated of its several modes as partly the same and partly
different and this is what we mean when we say that the concept of
being is analogical that being is predicated analogically of its various
modes
analogical predication is of two kinds a term or concept may be affirmed
of a variety of subjects either by analogy of attribution or by analogy
of proportion we may for instance speak not only of a man as
healthy but also of his food his countenance his occupation his
companionship etc as healthy now health is found really only in the
man but it is attributed to the other things owing to some extrinsic
but real connexion which they have with his health whether as cause or
effect or indication of the latter this is analogy of attribution the
subject of which the predicate is properly and primarily affirmed being
known as the primary analogue or analogum princeps those to which it is
transferred being called the analogata it underlies the figures of
speech known as metynomy and synechdoche now on account of the various
relations that exist between the different modes of being relations of
cause and effect whole and part means and end ground and consequence
etcrelations which constitute the orders of existing and possible
things the physical and the metaphysical ordersbeing is of course
predicated of its modes by analogy of attribution and in such
predication infinite being is the primary analogue for finite beings and
the substancemode of being for all accidentmodes of being
inasmuch however as being is not merely attributed to these modes
extrinsically but belongs to all of them intrinsically it is also
predicated of them by analogy of proportion this latter sort of analogy
is based on similarity of relations for example the act of understanding
bears a relation to the mind similar to that which the act of seeing bears
to the eye and hence we say of the mind that it sees things when it
understands them or again we speak of a verdant valley in the sunshine
as smiling because its appearance bears a relation to the valley
similar to that which a smile bears to the human countenance or again we
speak of the parched earth as thirsting for the rains or of the devout
soul as thirsting for god because these relations are recognized as
similar to that of a thirsty person towards the drink for which he
thirsts in all such cases the analogical concept implies not indeed the
same attribute differently realized in all the analogues as in univocal
predication but rather a similarity in the relation or proportion in
which each analogue embodies or realizes some attribute or attributes
peculiar to itself seeing is to the eye as understanding is to the mind
smiling is to the countenance as the pleasing appearance of its natural
features is to the valley rain is to the parched earth and god is to the
devout soul as drink is to the thirsty person it will be noted that in
all such cases the analogical concept is affirmed primarily and properly
of some one thing the analogum princeps and of the other only
secondarily and relatively to the former
now if we reflect on the manner in which being is affirmed of its various
modes eg of the infinite and the finite or of substance and
accident or of spiritual and corporeal substances or of quantities or
qualities or causes etc we can see firstly that although these
differ from one another by all that each of them is by the whole being
of each yet there is an allpervading similarity between the relations
which these modes bear each to its own existence all have or can have
actual existence each according to the grade of perfection of its own
reality if we conceive infinite being as the cause of all finite beings
then the former exists in a manner appropriate to its allperfect reality
and finite beings in a manner proportionate to their limited realities
and so of the various modes of finite being among themselves moreover we
can see secondly as will be explained more fully below54 that being
is affirmed of the finite by virtue of its dependence on the infinite and
of accident by virtue of its dependence on substance55 being or reality
is therefore predicated of its modes by analogy of proportion56
is a concept when applied in this way one or is it really manifold it
is not simply one for this would yield univocal predication nor is it
simply manifold for this would give equivocal predication being
considered in its vague imperfect inadequate sense as involving some
common or similar proportion or relation to existence in all its
analogues is one considered as representing clearly and adequately what
is thus similarly related to each of the analogues it is manifold
analogy of proportion is the basis of the figure of speech known as
metaphor it would be a mistake however to infer from this that what is
thus analogically predicated of a number of things belongs intrinsically
and properly only to one of them being transferred by a mere extrinsic
denomination to the others and that therefore it does not express any
genuine knowledge on our part about the nature of these other things it
does give us real knowledge about them metaphor is not equivocation but
perhaps more usually it is understood not to give us real knowledge
because it is understood to be based on resemblances that are merely
fanciful not real still no matter how slender and remote be the
proportional resemblance on which the analogical use of language is based
in so far forth as it has such a real basis it gives us real insight
into the nature of the analogues and if we hesitate to describe such a
use of language as metaphorical this is only because metaphor perhaps
too commonly connotes a certain transferred and improper extension of the
meaning of terms based upon a purely fanciful resemblance
all our language is primarily and properly expressive of concepts
derived from the sensible appearances of material realities as applied to
the suprasensible intelligible aspects of these realities such as
substance and cause or to spiritual realities such as the human soul and
god it is analogical in another sense not as opposed to univocal but as
opposed to proper that is it expresses concepts which are not formed
directly from the presence of the things which they signify but are
gathered from other things to which the latter are necessarily related in
a variety of ways57 considering the origin of our knowledge the
material the sensible the phenomenal comes first in order and moulds
our concepts and language primarily to its own proper representation and
expression while the spiritual the intelligible the substantial comes
later and must make use of the concepts and language thus already
moulded
if we consider however not the order in which we get our knowledge but
the order of reality in the objects of our knowledge being or reality
is primarily and more properly predicated of the infinite than of the
finite of the creator than of the creature of the spiritual than of the
material of substances than of their accidents and sensible
manifestations or phenomena yet we do not predicate being or reality of
the finite or of creatures in a mere transferred extrinsic improper
sense as if these were mere manifestations of the infinite or mere
effects of the first cause to which alone reality would properly belong
for creatures finite things are in a true and proper sense also real
    duns scotus and those who think with him contend that the concept
    of being derived as it is from our experience of finite being if
    applied only analogically to infinite being would give us no
    genuine knowledge about the latter they maintain that whenever a
    universal concept is applied to the objects in which it is
    realized intrinsically it is affirmed of these objects
    univocally the notion of being in its most imperfect
    inadequate indeterminate sense is they say one and the same
    in so far forth as it is applicable to the infinite and the
    finite and to all the modes of the finite and it is therefore
    predicated of all univocally58 but although they apply the
    concept of being univocally to the infinite and the finite ie
    to god and creatures they admit that the reality corresponding
    to this univocal concept is totally different in god and in
    creatures that god differs by all that he is from creatures
    and they by all that they are from him while however scotists
    emphasize the formal oneness or identity of the indeterminate
    common concept followers of st thomas emphasize the fact that
    the various modes of being differ totally by all that each of
    them is from one another and from this radical diversity in the
    modes of being they infer that the common concept should not be
    regarded as simply the same but only as proportionally the
    same as expressive of a similar relation of each intrinsically
    different mode of reality to actual existence
    thomists lay still greater stress perhaps upon the second
    consideration referred to above as a reason for regarding being
    as an analogical concept when affirmed of creator and creature or
    of substance and accident the consideration that the finite is
    dependent on the infinite and accident on substance if being
    is realized in a true and proper sense and intrinsically as it
    undoubtedly is in whatever is distinguishable from nothingness
    why not say that we should affirm being or reality of all things
    either as a genus in the strict sense or else in some sense not
    analogical but proper after the manner in which we predicate a
    genus of its species and individuals since the object of our
    universal idea of being is admitted to be really in all things we
    can evidently abstract from what is proper to substance and to
    accident just as we abstract from what is proper to plants and to
    animals when we affirm of these that they are living things59
    in reply to this difficulty father kleutgen continues60 we
    say in the first place that the idea of being is in truth less
    analogical and more proper than any belonging to the first sort of
    analogy ie of attribution and that therefore it approaches
    more closely to generic concepts properly so called at the same
    time the difference which separates both from the latter concepts
    remains for a name applied to many things is analogical if what
    it signifies is realized par excellence in one and in the
    others only subordinately and dependently on that hence it is
    that aristotle regards predication as analogical when something is
    affirmed of many things 1 either because these have a certain
    relation to some one thing 2 or because they depend on some one
    thing in the former case the thing signified by the name is
    really and properly found only in one single thing and is
    affirmed of all the others only in virtue of some real relation of
    these to the former whether this be a that these things
    merely resemble that single thing metaphor or b bear some
    other relation to it such as that of effect to cause etc
    metonymy in the latter case the thing signified by the name is
    really in each of the things of which it is affirmed but it is in
    one alone par excellence and in the others only by depending
    for its very existence in them on that one now the object of the
    term being is found indeed in accidents eg in quantity
    colour shape but certainly it must be applied primarily to
    substance and to accidents only dependently on the latter for
    quantity colour shape can have being only because the corporeal
    substance possesses these determinations but this is not at all
    the case with a genus and its species these differ from the
    genus not by any such dependence but by the addition of some
    special perfection to the constituents of the genus for example
    in the brute beast sensibility is added to vegetative life and in
    man intelligence is added to sensibility here there is no
    relation of dependence for existence even if we considered human
    life as that of which life is principally asserted we could not
    say that plants and brute beasts so depended for their life on the
    life of man that we could not affirm life of them except as
    dependent on the life of man as we cannot attribute being to
    accidents except by reason of their dependence on substance hence
    it is that we can consider apart and in itself life in general
    and attribute this to all living things without relating it to any
    other being61
    it might still be objected that the one single being of which we
    may affirm life primarily and principally ought to be not human
    life but absolute life and between this divine life and the life
    of all other beings there is a relation of dependence which
    reaches even to the very existence of life in these other beings
    in fact all life depends on the absolute life not indeed in the
    way accident depends on substance but in a manner no less real
    and far more excellent this is entirely true but what are we to
    conclude from it if not precisely this which scholasticism
    teaches that the perfections found in the various species of
    creatures can be affirmed of these in the same sense univoc
    but that they can be affirmed of god and creatures only
    analogically
    from all of which we can understand why it is that in regard to
    genera and species the analogy is in the things but not in our
    thoughts while in regard to substance and accidents it is both in
    the things and in our thoughts a difference which rests not
    solely on our manner of conceiving things nor a fortiori on
    mere caprice or fancy but which has its basis in the very nature
    of the things themselves for though in the former case there is a
    certain analogy in the things themselves inasmuch as the same
    nature that of the genus is realized in the species in different
    ways still as we have seen that is not sufficient without the
    relation of dependence to yield a basis for analogy in our
    thoughts for it is precisely because accident as a determination
    of substance presupposes this latter that being cannot be
    affirmed of accident except as dependent on substance
    these paragraphs will have shown with sufficient clearness why we
    should regard being not as an univocal but as an analogical
    concept when referred to god and creatures or to substance and
    accident for the rest the divergence between the scotist and the
    thomist views is not very important because scotists also will
    deny that being is a genus of which the infinite and the finite
    would be species finite and infinite are not differentiae
    superadded to being inasmuch as each of these differs by its
    whole reality and not merely by a determining portion from the
    other it is owing to the limitations of our abstractive way of
    understanding reality that we have to conceive the infinite by
    first conceiving being in the abstract and then mentally
    determining this concept by another namely by the concept of
    infinite mode of being62 the infinite and whatever
    perfections we predicate formally of the infinite transcend all
    genera species and differentiae because the distinction of
    being into infinite and finite is prior to the distinction into
    genera species and differentiae this latter distinction applying
    only to finite not to infinite being63
the observations we have just been making in regard to the analogy of
being are of greater importance than the beginner can be expected to
realize a proper appreciation of the way in which being or reality is
conceived by the mind to appertain to the data of our experience is
indispensable to the defence of theism as against agnosticism and
pantheism
3 real being and logical beingwe may next illustrate the notion of
being by approaching it from another standpointby examining a fundamental
distinction which may be drawn between real being ens reale and
logical being ens rationis
we derive all our knowledge through external and internal sense
perception from the domain of actually existing things these things
including our own selves and our own minds we form from the data of
senseconsciousness by an intellectual process proper mental
representations of an abstract and universal character which reveal to us
partial aspects and phases of the natures of things we have no intuitive
intellectual insight into these natures it is only by abstracting their
various aspects by comparing these in judgments and reaching still
further aspects by inferences that we progress in our knowledge of
thingsgradually step by step discursiv discurrendo all this
implies reflection on and comparison of our own ideas our mental views
of things it involves the processes of defining and classifying
affirming and denying abstracting and generalizing analysing and
synthesizing comparing and relating in a variety of ways the objects
grasped by our thought now in all these complex functions by which alone
the mind can interpret rationally what is given to it by which alone
in other words it can know reality the mind necessarily and inevitably
forms for itself and expresses in intelligible language a series of
concepts which have for their objects only the modes in which and the
relations by means of which it makes such gradual progress in its
interpretation of what is given to it in its knowledge of the real these
concepts are called secundae intentiones mentisconcepts of the second
order so to speak and their objects the modes and mutual relations of
our primae intentiones or direct concepts are called entia
rationislogical entities for example abstractness is a mode which
affects not the reality which we apprehend intellectually but the concept
by which we apprehend it so too is the universality of a concept its
communicability or applicability to an indefinite multitude of similar
realitiesthe intentio universalitatis as it is calleda mode of
concept not of the realities represented by the latter so likewise is
the absence of other reality than that represented by the concept the
relative nothingness or nonbeing by contrast with which the concept is
realized as positive and the absolute nothingness or nonbeing which is
the logical correlative of the concept of being and the static
unchanging selfidentity of the object as conceived in the abstract64
these are not modes of reality as it is but as it is conceived again
the manifold logical relations which we establish between our
conceptsrelations of extensive or intensive identity or distinction
inclusion or inherence etcare logical entities entia rationis
relations of genus species differentia proprium accidens the
affirmative or negative relation between predicate and subject in
judgment65 the mutual relations of antecedent and consequent in
inference now all these logical entities or objecta secundae
intentionis mentis are relations established by the mind itself between
its own thoughts they have no doubt a foundation in the real objects of
those thoughts as well as in the constitution and limitations of the mind
itself but they have themselves and can have no other being than that
which they have as products of thought their sole being consists in
being thought of they are necessary creations or products of the
thoughtprocess as this goes on in the human mind we see that it is only
by means of these relations we can progress in understanding things in
the thoughtprocess we cannot help bringing them to lightand thinking
them after the manner of realities per modum entis whatever we think
we must think through the concept of being whatever we conceive we must
conceive as being but on reflection we easily see that such entities as
nothingness negation or absence or privation of being
universality predicateand in general all relations established by
our own thought between our own ideas representative of realitycan have
themselves no reality proper no actual or possible existence other than
that which they get from the mind in virtue of its making them objects of
its own thought hence the scholastic definition of a logical entity or
ens rationis as that which has objective being merely in the
intellect illud quod habet esse objective tantum in intellectu seu
 id quod a ratione excogitatur ut ens cum tamen in se entitatem non
habeat66 of course the mental process by which we think such
entities the mental state in which they are held in consciousness is
just as real as any other mental process or state but the entity which is
thus held in consciousness has and can have no other reality than what it
has by being an object of thought and this precisely is what
distinguishes it from real being from reality for the latter
besides the ideal existence it has in the mind which thinks of it has or
at least can have a real existence of its own independently altogether
of our thinking about it we assume here of coursewhat is established
elsewhere as against the subjective idealism of phenomenists and the
objective idealism of berkeleythat the reality of actual things does
not consist in their being perceived or thought of that their esse is
not percipi that they have a reality other than and independent of
their actual presence to the thought of any human mind and even purely
possible things even the creatures of our own fancy the fictions of
fable and romance could absolutely speaking and without any
contradiction have an existence in the actual order in addition to the
mental existence they receive from those who fancy them such entities
therefore differ from entia rationis they too are real beings
    what the reality of purely possible things is we shall discuss
    later on actually existing things at all events we assume to be
    given to the knowing mind not to be created by the latter
    even in regard to these however we must remember that the mind
    in knowing them in interpreting them in seeking to penetrate the
    nature of them is not purely passive that reality as known to
    usor in other words our knowledge of realityis the product of
    a twofold factor the subjective which is the mind and the
    objective which is the extramental reality acting on and thus
    revealing itself to the mind hence it is that when we come to
    analyse in detail our knowledge of the nature of thingsor in
    other words the natures of things as revealed to our mindsit
    will not be always easy to distinguish in each particular case the
    properties aspects relations distinctions etc which are
    real in the sense of being there in the reality independently
    of the consideration of the mind from those that are merely
    logical in the sense of being produced and superadded to the
    reality by the mental process itself67 yet it is obviously a
    matter of the very first importance to determine as far as may be
    possible to what extent our knowledge of reality is not merely a
    mental interpretation but a mental construction of the
    latter and whether if there be a constructive or constitutive
    factor in thought this should be regarded as interfering with the
    validity of thought as representative of reality this problemof
    the relation of the ens rationis to the ens reale in the
    process of cognitionhas given rise to discussions which in
    modern times have largely contributed to the formation of that
    special branch of philosophical enquiry which is called
    epistemology but it must not be imagined that this very problem
    was not discussed and very widely discussed by philosophers long
    before the problem of the validity of knowledge assumed the
    prominent place it has won for itself in modern philosophy even a
    moderate familiarity with scholastic philosophy will enable the
    student to recognize this problem in a variety of phases in the
    discussions of the medieval schoolmen concerning the concepts of
    matter and form the simplicity and composition of beings and the
    nature of the various distinctionswhether logical virtual
    formal or realwhich the mind either invents or detects in the
    realities it endeavours to understand and explain
4 real being and ideal beingthe latter of these expressions has a
multiplicity of kindred meanings we use it here in the sense of being
known ie to signify the esse intentionale the mental
presence which in the scholastic theory of knowledge an entity of
whatsoever kind whether real or logical must have in the mind of the
knower in order that he be aware of that entity a mere logical entity as
we have seen has and can have no other mode of being than this which
consists in being an object of the minds awareness all real being too
when it becomes an object of any kind of human cognition whatsoeverof
intellectual thought whether direct or reflex of sense perception
whether external or internalmust obtain this sort of mental presence or
mental existence thereby alone can it become an objectum cognitum
only by such mental mirroring or reproduction or reconstruction can
reality become so related and connected with mind as to reveal itself to
mind under this peculiar relation which we call cognition the mind as
we know from psychology and epistemology is not passive if reality
revealed itself immediately as it is to a purely passive mind were such
conceivable the existence of error would be unaccountable but the mind
is not passive under the influence of the reality it forms the
intellectual concept the verbum mentale or the sense percept the
species sensibilis expressa in and through which and by means of
which it attains to its knowledge of the real
but prior ontologically to this mental existence and as partial cause
of the latter there is the real existence or being which reality has
independently of its being known by any individual human mind real being
then as distinguished here from ideal being is that which exists or can
exist extramentally whether it is known by the human mind or not ie
whether it exists also mentally or not
    that there is such real being apart from the thoughtbeing
    whereby the mind is constituted formally knowing is proved
    elsewhere as also that this esse intentionale has modes which
    cannot be attributed to the esse reale we merely note these
    points here in order to indicate the errors involved in the
    opposite contentions our concepts are characterized by
    abstractness by a consequent static immutability by a plurality
    often resulting from purely mental distinctions by a universality
    which transcends those distinctions and unifies the variety of all
    subordinate concepts in the widest concept of being now if for
    example we attribute the unifying mental mode of universality to
    real being we must draw the pantheistic conclusion that all real
    being is one the logical outcome of extreme realism if again
    we transfer purely mental distinctions to the unity of the
    absolute or supreme being thus making them real we thereby deny
    infinite perfection to the most perfect being conceivable an
    error of which some catholic philosophers of the later middle ages
    have been accused with some foundation if finally we identify
    the esse reale with the esse intentionale and this with the
    thoughtprocess itself we find ourselves at the startingpoint of
    hegelian monism68
5 fundamental distinctions in real beingleaving logical and ideal being
aside and fixing our attention exclusively on real being we may indicate
here a few of the most fundamental distinctions which experience enables
us to recognize in our study of the universal order of things
a possible or potential being and actual beingthe first of these
distinctions is that between possibility and actuality between that which
can be and that which actually is for a proper understanding of this
distinction which will be dealt with presently it is necessary to note
here the following divisions of actual being which will be studied in
detail later on
b infinite being and finite beingsall people have a sufficiently
clear notion of infinite being or infinitely perfect being though not
all philosophers are agreed as to how precisely we get this notion or
whether there actually exists such a being or whether if such being does
exist we can attain to a certain knowledge of such existence by infinite
being we mean a being possessing all conceivable perfections in the most
perfect conceivable manner and by finite beings all such beings as have
actually any conceivable limitation to their perfection about these
nominal definitions there is no dispute and scholasticism identifies
their respective objects with god and creatures
c necessary being and contingent beingsnecessary being we conceive
as that being which exists of necessity being which if conceived at all
cannot be conceived as nonexistent being in the very concept of which is
essentially involved the concept of actual existence so that the attempt
to conceive such being as nonexistent would be an attempt to conceive
what would be selfcontradictory contingent being on the other hand is
being which is conceived not to exist of necessity being which may be
conceived as not actually existent being in the concept of which is not
involved the concept of actual existence the same observations apply to
this distinction as to the preceding one it is obvious that any being
which we regard as actual we must regard either as necessary or as
contingent and secondly that necessary being must be considered as
absolutely independent as having its actual existence from itself by
its own nature while contingent being must be considered as dependent for
its actual existence on some being other than itself hence necessary
being is termed ens a se contingent being ens ab alio
d absolute being and relative beingsin modern philosophy the terms
absolute and relative as applied to being correspond roughly with
the terms god and creatures in the usage of theistic philosophers but
the former pair of terms is really of wider application than the latter
the term absolute means etymologically that which is loosed
unfettered disengaged or free from bonds absolutum absolvere
solvo  seluo from  that therefore which is not bound up with
anything else which is in some sense selfsufficing independent while
the relative is that which is in some way bound up with something else
and which is so far not selfsufficing or independent that therefore is
ontologically absolute which is in some sense selfsufficing
independent of other things in its existence while the ontologically
relative is that which depends in some real way for its existence on
something else again that is logically absolute which can be
conceived and known by us without reference to anything else while the
logically relative is that which we can conceive and know only through our
knowledge of something else and since we usually name things according to
the way in which we conceive them we regard as absolute any being which
is by itself and of itself that which we conceive it to be or that
which its name implies and as relative any being which is what its name
implies only in virtue of some relation to something else69 thus a
man is a man absolutely while he is a friend only relatively to
others
it is obvious that the primary and general meaning of the terms absolute
and relative can be applied and extended in a variety of ways for
instance all being may be said to be relative to the knowing mind
in the sense that all knowledge involves a transcendental relation of the
known object to the knowing subject in this widest and most improper
sense even god himself is relative not however as being but as known
again when we apply the same attribute to a variety of things we may see
that it is found in one of them in the most perfect manner conceivable or
at least in a fuller and higher degree than it is found in the others and
that it is found in these others only with some sort of subordination to
and dependence on the former we then say that it belongs to this
primarily or absolutely and to the others only secondarily or
relatively this is a less improper application of the terms than in the
preceding case what we have especially to remember here is that there are
many different kinds of dependence or subordination all alike giving rise
to the same usage
hence applying the terms absolute and relative to the predicate being
or real or reality it is obvious in the first place that the
potential as such can be called being or reality only in relation
to the actual it is the actual that is being simpliciter par
excellence the potential is so only in relation to this70 again
substances may be termed beings absolutely while accidents are beings
only relatively because of their dependence on substances though this
relation is quite different from the relation of potential to actual
being finally all finite contingent realities actual and possible are
what they are only because of their dependence on the infinite and
necessary being and hence the former are relative and the latter
absolute though here again the relation is different from that of
accident to substance or of potential to actual
since the order of being includes all orders and since a being is
absolutely suchorsuch in any order only when that being realizes in
all its fulness and purity suchorsuch reality it follows that the being
which realizes in all its fulness the reality of being is the absolute
being in the highest possible sense of this term this concept of absolute
being is the richest and most comprehensive of all possible concepts it
is the very antithesis of that other concept of being in general which
is common to everything and distinguished only from nothingness it
includes in itself all actual and possible modes and grades and
perfections of finite things apart from their limitations embodying all
of them in the one highest and richest concept of that which makes all of
them real and actual viz the concept of actuality or actual reality
itself
    hegel and his followers have involved themselves in a pantheistic
    philosophy by neglecting to distinguish between those two totally
    different concepts71 a similar error has also resulted from
    failure to distinguish between the various modes in which being
    that is relative may be dependent on being that is absolute god
    is the absolute being creatures are relative so too is substance
    absolute being compared with accidents as inhering and existing
    in substance but god is not therefore to be conceived as the one
    allpervading substance of which all finite things all
    phenomena would be only accidental manifestations
chapter ii becoming and its implications
6 the static and the changingthe things we see around us the things
which make up the immediate data of our experience not only are or
exist they also become or come into actual existence they
change they pass out of actual existence the abstract notion of being
represents its object to the mind in a static permanent changeless
selfidentical condition but if this condition were an adequate
representation of reality change would be unreal would be only an
illusion this is what the eleatic philosophers of ancient greece
believed distinguishing merely between being and nothingness but they
were mistaken for change in things is too obviously real to be eliminated
by calling it an illusion even if it were an illusion this illusion at
least would have to be accounted for in order therefore to understand
reality we must employ not merely the notion of being something
static but also the notion of becoming change process appearing and
disappearing something kinetic and something dynamic in doing so
however we must not fall into the error of the opposite extreme from the
eleaticsby regarding change as the adequate representation of reality
this is what heraclitus and the later ionians did holding that nothing
is that all becomes   that change is all reality that the
stable the permanent is nonexistent unreal an illusion this too is
false for change would be unintelligible without at least an abiding
law of change a permanent principle of some sort which in turn
involves the reality of some sort of abiding stable permanent being
we must thenwith aristotle as against both of those onesided
conceptionshold to the reality both of being and of becoming and proceed
to see how the stable and the changing can both be real
to convince ourselves that they are both real very little reflection is
needed we have actual experience of both those elements of reality in our
consciousness and memory of our own selves every human individual in the
enjoyment of his mental faculties knows himself as an abiding
selfidentical being yet as constantly undergoing real changes so that
throughout his life he is really the same being though just as certainly
he really changes in external nature too we observe on the one hand
innumerable processes of growth and decay of motion and interaction and
on the other hand a similarly allpervading element of sameness or
identity amid all this neverending change
7 the potential and the actual a possibility absolute relative
and adequateit is from our experience of actuality and change that we
derive not only our notion of temporal duration but also our notion of
potential being or possibility as distinct from that of actual
being or actuality it is from our experience of what actually exists
that we are able to determine what can and what cannot exist we know
from experience what gold is and what a tower is and that it is
intrinsically possible for a golden tower to exist that such an object of
thought involves no contradiction that therefore its existence is not
impossible even though it may never actually exist as a fact similarly
we know from experience what a square is and what a circle is and that
it is intrinsically impossible for a square circle to exist that such an
object of thought involves a contradiction that therefore not only is
such an object never actually existent in fact but that it is in no sense
real in no way possible
thus intrinsic or objective absolute logical metaphysical
possibility is the mere nonrepugnance of an object of thought to actual
existence any being or object of thought that is conceivable in this way
that can be conceived as capable of actually existing is called
intrinsically or objectively absolutely logically metaphysically
possible being the absence of such intrinsic capability of actual
existence gives us the notion of the intrinsically objectively
absolutely logically metaphysically impossible we shall return to
these notions again they are necessary here for the understanding of real
change in the actual universe
fixing our attention now upon the real changes which characterize the data
of our experience let us inquire what conditions are necessary in order
that an intrinsically possible object of thought become here and now an
actual being it matters not whether we select an example from the domain
of organic nature of inorganic nature or of artwhether it be an oak or
an iceberg or a statue in order that there be here and now an actual
oaktree it is necessary not only 1 that such an object be
intrinsically possible but 2 that there have been planted here an
actual acorn ie an actual being having in it subjectively and really
the passive potentiality of developing into an actual oaktree and 3
that there be in the actual things around the acorn active powers or
forces capable of so influencing the latent passive potentiality of the
acorn as gradually to evolve the oaktree therefrom so too for the 1
intrinsically possible iceberg there are needed 2 water capable of
becoming ice and 3 natural powers or forces capable of forming it into
ice and setting this adrift in the ocean and for the 1 intrinsically
possible statue there are needed 2 the block of marble or other material
capable of becoming a statue and 3 the sculptor having the power to
mould this material into an actual statue
in order therefore that a thing which is not now actual but only
intrinsically or absolutely possible become actual there must actually
exist some being or beings endowed with the active power or potency of
making this possible thing actual the latter is then said to be
relatively extrinsically possiblein relation to such being or beings
and obviously a thing may be possible relatively to the power of one
being and not possible relatively to lesser power of another being the
statue that is intrinsically possible in the block of marble may be
extrinsically possible relatively to the skilled sculptor but not
relatively to the unskilled person who is not a sculptor
furthermore relatively to the same agent or agents the production of a
given effect the doing of a given thing is said to be physically
possible if it can be brought about by such agents acting according to the
ordinary course of nature if in other words they have the physical power
to do it otherwise it is said to be physically impossible even though
metaphysically or intrinsically possible eg it is physically
impossible for a dead person to come to life again a thing is said to be
morally possible in reference to free and responsible agents if they
can do it without unreasonable inconvenience otherwise it is considered
as morally impossible even though it be both physically and
metaphysically possible as often happens in regard to the fulfilment of
ones obligations
that which is both intrinsically and extrinsically possible is said to
be adequately possible whatever is intrinsically possible is also
extrinsically possible in relation to god who is almighty
omnipotent
8 b subjective potentia active and passivefurthermore we
conceive the infinite being almighty god as capable of creating or
producing actual being from nothingness ie without any actually
preexisting material out of whose passive potentiality the actual being
would be developed creative power or activity does not need any
preexisting subject on which to exercise its influence any subject in
whose passive potentiality the thing to be created is antecedently
implicit
but all other power all activity of created causes does require some
such actually existing subject if we examine the activities of the
agencies that fall within our direct experience whether in external
nature or in our own selves we shall find that in no case does their
operative influence or causality extend beyond the production of changes
in existing being or attain to the production of new actual being out of
nothingness the forces of nature cannot produce an oak without an acorn
or an iceberg without water nor can the sculptor produce a statue except
from some preexisting material
    the natural passive potentiality of things is moreover limited
    in reference to the active powers of the created universe these
    for example can educe life from the passive potentiality of
    inorganic matter but only by assimilating this matter into a
    living organism they cannot restore life to a human corpse yet
    the latter has in it the capacity to be restored to life by the
    direct influence of the author of nature this special and
    supernatural potentiality in created things under the influence
    of omnipotence is known as potentia obedientalis72
this consideration will help us to realize that all reality which is
produced by change and subject to change is essentially a mixture of
becoming and being of potential and actual the reality of such
being is not tota simul only immutable being whose duration is
eternal has its reality tota simul it alone is purely actual the
actus purus and its duration is one eternal now without
beginning end or succession but mutable being whose duration in actual
existence is measured by time is actualized only successively its
actuality at any particular instant does not embody the whole of its
reality this latter includes also a was and will be the thing
was potentially what it now is actually and it will become actually
something which it now is only potentially nor shall we have understood
even moderately the nature or essence of any mutable beingan oaktree
for exampleuntil we have grasped the fact that the whole reality of its
nature embraces more than what we find of it actually existing at any
given instant of its existence in other words we have to bear in mind
that the reality of such a being is not pure actuality but a mixture of
potential and actual that it is an actus nonpurus or an actus
mixtus
we have to note well that the potential being of a thing is something
realthat it is not merely a modus loquendi or a modus
intelligendi the oak is in the acorn in some true and real sense the
potentiality of the oak is something real in the acorn if it were not so
if it were nothing real in the acorn we could say with equal truth that a
man or a horse or a house is potentially in the acorn or again with
equal truth that the oak is potentially in a mustardseed or a grain of
corn or a pebble or a drop of water therefore the oak is really in
the acornnot actually but potentially potentia passiva
the oaktree is also really in those active forces of nature whose
influence on the acorn develop the latter into an actual oaktree it is
in those causes not actually of course but virtually for they possess
in themselves the operative powerpotentia activa sive operativato
educe the oaktree out of the acorn these two potential conditions of a
beingin the active causes which produce it and in the preexisting
actual thing or things from which it is producedare called each a real or
subjective potency potentia realis or potentia subjectiva in
distinction from the mere logical or objective possibility of such a
being
and just as the passive potentiality of the statue is something real in
the block of marble though distinct from the actuality of the statue and
from the process by which this is actualized so is the active power of
making the statue something real in the sculptor though distinct from the
operation by which he makes the statue if an agents power to act to
produce change were not a reality in the agent a reality distinct from
the action of the latter or if a beings capacity to undergo change
and thereby to become something other were not a reality distinct from
the process of change and from the actual result of this processit would
follow not only that the actual alone is real and the merely possible or
potential unreal but also that no change can be real that nothing can
really become and nothing really disappear73
9 c actuality its relation to potentialityit is from our
experience of change in the world that we derive our notions of the
potential and the actual of active power and passive potentiality the
term act has primarily the same meaning as action operation that
process by which a change is wrought but the latin word actus gr
  means rather that which is achieved by the actio
that which is the correlative and complement of the passive potentiality
the actuality of this latter that by which potential being is rendered
formally actual and by way of consequence this actual being itself
potentia activa and its correlative actus might perhaps be
appropriately rendered by power potestas agendi and action or
operation potentia passiva and its correlative actus by
potentiality and actuality respectively
in these correlatives the notion underlying the term actual is
manifestly the notion of something completed achieved perfectedas
compared with that of something incomplete imperfect determinable which
is the notion of the potential hence the notions of potentia and
actus have been extended widely beyond their primary signification of
power to act and the exercise of this power such pairs of correlatives as
the determinable and the determined the perfectible and the perfected
the undeveloped or less developed and the more developed the generic and
the specific are all conceived under the aspect of this widest relation
of the potential to the actual and since we can distinguish successive
stages in any process of development or an order of logical sequence
among the contents of our concept of any concrete reality it follows that
what will be conceived as an actus in one relation will be conceived as
a potentia in another thus the disposition of any facultyas for
example the scientific habit in the intellectis an actus or perfection
of the faculty regarded as a potentia but it is itself a potentia
which is actualized in the operation of actually studying this
illustrates the distinction commonly drawn between an actus primus and
an actus secundus in any particular order or line of reality the
actus primus is that which presupposes no prior actuality in the same
order the actus secundus is that which does presuppose another the act
of knowing is an actus secundus which presupposes the cognitive faculty
as an actus primus the faculty being the first or fundamental
equipment of the soul in relation to knowledge hence the child is said to
have knowledge in actu primo as having the faculty of reason and the
student to have knowledge in actu secundo as exercising this faculty
the actus or perfecting principles of which we have spoken so far are
all conceived as presupposing an existing subject on which they supervene
they are therefore accidents as distinct from substantial constitutive
principles of this subject and they are therefore called accidental
actualities actus accidentales but the actual existence of a being
is also conceived as the complement and correlative of its essence as
that which makes the latter actual thus transferring it from the state of
mere possibility hence existence also is called an actus or actuality
the actus existentialis to distinguish it from the existing things
activities and other subsequently acquired characters in reference to
these existence is a first actualityesse est actus primus prius
est esse quam agere existence is the first actuality action
presupposes existencewhile each of these in reference to existence is a
second actuality an actus secundus
when furthermore we proceed to examine the constitutive principles
essential to any being in the concrete we may be able to distinguish
between principles which are determinable passive and persistent
throughout all essential change of that being and others which are
determining specifying differentiating principles in water for
example we may distinguish the passive underlying principle which
persists throughout the decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen
from the active specifying principle which gives that substratum its
specific nature as water the former or material principle 
materia is potential compared with the latter or formal principle
   forma species actus as actual the
concept of actus is thus applied to the essence itself the actus
essentialis or formalis of a thing is that which we conceive to be
the ultimate completing and determining principle of the essence or
nature of that thing in reference to this as well as the other
constitutive principles of the thing the actual existence of the thing is
a second actuality an actus secundus
in fact all the constitutive principles of the essence of any existing
thing and all the properties and attributes involved in the essence or
necessarily connected with the essence must all alike be conceived as
logically antecedent to the existential actus whereby they are
constituted something in the actual order and not mere possible objects
of our thought and from this point of view the existence of a thing is
called the ultimate actualization of its essence hence the scholastic
aphorism esse est ultimus actus rei
the term actus may designate that complement of reality by which
potential being is made actual actus actuans or this actual being
itself actus simpliciter dictus in the latter sense we have
already distinguished the being that is immutable the being of god as
the actus purus from the being of all mutable things which latter
being is necessarily a mixture of potential and actual an actus mixtus
now if the essences of corporeal things are composite if they are
constituted by the union of some determining formative principle with a
determinable passive principleof form with matter in scholastic
terminologywe may call these formative principles actus
informantes and if these cannot actually exist except in union with a
material principle they may be called actus nonsubsistentes eg
the formative principle or forma substantialis of water or the vital
principle of a plant if on the other hand there exist essences which
being simple do not actualize any material determinable principle but
subsist independently of any such they are called actus
noninformantes or actus subsistentes such for example are
god and pure spirits whose existence is known from revelation finally
there may be a kind of actual essence which though it naturally
actualizes a material principle de facto can nevertheless continue to
subsist without this latter such an actual being would be at once an
actus informans and an actus subsistens and such in fact is the
human soul
throughout all distinctions between the potential and the actual there
runs the conception of the actual as something more perfect than the
potential there is in the actual something positive and real over and
above what is in the potential this is an ultimate fact in our analysis
and its importance will be realized when we come to apply the notions we
have been explaining to the study of change
the notion of grades of perfection in things is one with which everyone is
familiar we naturally conceive some beings as higher upon the scale of
reality than others as having more reality so to speaknot
necessarily of course in the literal sense of size or quantitythan
others as being more perfect nobler of greater worth value dignity
excellence than others thus we regard the infinite as more perfect than
the finite spiritual beings as nobler than material beings man as a
higher order of being than the brute beast this again as surpassing the
whole vegetable kingdom the lowest form of life as higher on the scale of
being than inorganic matter the substancemode of being as superior to
all accidentmodes the actualized state of a being as more perfect than
its potential state ie as existing in its material efficient and
ideal or exemplar causes the grounds and significance of this mental
appreciation of relative values in things must be discussed elsewhere we
refer to it here in order to point out another scholastic aphorism
according to which the higher a thing is in the scale of actual being and
the more perfect it is accordingly the more efficient it will also be as
a principle of action the more powerful as a cause in the production of
changes in other things the more operative in actualizing their passive
potentialities and conversely the less actual a thing is and therefore
the more imperfect the greater its passive capacity will be to undergo
the influence of agencies that are actual and operative around it as
passive potentiality says st thomas74 is the mark of potential
being so active power is the mark of actual being for a thing acts in
so far as it is actual but is acted on so far as it is potential our
knowledge of the nature of things is in fact exclusively based on our
knowledge of their activities we have no other key to the knowledge of
what a thing is than our knowledge of what it does operari sequitur
esse qualis est operatio talis est naturaacting follows being
conduct is the key to nature
a being that is active or operative in the production of a change is said
to be the efficient cause of the change the latter being termed the
effect now the greater the change ie the higher and more perfect be
the grade of reality that is actualized in the change the higher too in
the scale of being must be the efficient cause of that change there must
be a proportion in degree of perfection or reality between effect and
cause the former cannot exceed in actual perfection the active power and
therefore the actual being of the latter this is so because we conceive
the effect as being produced or actualized through the operative
influence of the cause and with real dependence on this latter and it
is inconceivable that a cause should have power to actualize other being
distinct from itself which would be of a higher grade of excellence than
itself the nature of efficient causality of the influence by which the
cause is related to its effect is not easy to determine it will be
discussed at a subsequent stage of our investigations ch xi but
whatever it be a little reflection should convince us of the truth of the
principle just stated that an effect cannot be more perfect than its
cause the medival scholastics embodied this truth in the formula nemo
dat quod non habeta formula which we must not interpret in the more
restricted and literal sense of the words giving and having lest we
be met with the obvious objection that it is by no means necessary for a
boy to have a black eye himself in order to give one to his neighbour
what the formula means is that an agent cannot give to or produce in any
potential subject receptive of its causal influence an actuality which
it does not itself possess virtually or in its active power that no
actuality surpassing in excellence the actual perfection of the cause
itself can be found thus virtually in the active power of the latter
there is no question of the cause or agent transferring bodily as it were
a part of its own actuality to the subject which is undergoing change75
nor will such crude imagination images help us to understand what real
change under the influence of efficient causality involves76 an
analysis of change will enable us to appreciate more fully the real
difficulty of explaining it and the futility of any attempt to account
for it without admitting the real objective validity of the notions of
actual and potential being of active powers or forces and passive
potentialities in the things that are subject to change
10 analysis of changechange mutatio motus  
is one of those simplest concepts which cannot be defined we may describe
it however as the transition of a being from one state to another if
one thing entirely disappeared and another were substituted for it we
should not regard the former as having been changed into the latter when
one thing is put in the place of another each no doubt undergoes a
change of place but neither is changed into the other so also if we
were to conceive a thing as absolutely ceasing to exist as lapsing into
nothingness at a given instant and another as coming into existence out
of nothingness at the same instant and in the same place we should not
consider this double event as constituting a real change of the former
thing into the latter and although our senses cannot testify to
anything beyond sequence in sense phenomena our reason detects in
real change something other than a total substitution of things for one
another or continuous total cessations and inceptions of existence in
things no doubt if we conceive the whole phenomenal or perceptible
universe and all the beings which constitute this universe as essentially
contingent and therefore dependent for their reality and their actual
existence on a supreme necessary being who created and conserves them
who at any time may cease to conserve any of them and produce other and
new beings out of nothingness then such absolute cessations and
inceptions of existence in the world would not be impossible god might
annihilate ie cease to conserve in existence this or that
contingent being at any instant and at any instant create a new
contingent being ie produce it in its totality from no preexisting
material but there is no reason to suppose that this is what is
constantly taking place in nature that all change is simply a series of
annihilations and creations on the contrary the modes of being which
appear and disappear in real change in the transition of anything from
one state to a really different state of being do not appear de novo
ex nihilo as absolute beginnings out of nothingness or disappear
totaliter in nihilum as absolute endings or lapses of reality into
nothingness the real changes which take place in nature are due to the
operation of natural causes these causes being finite in their operative
powers cannot create ie produce new being from nothingness they
can however with the concurrence of the omnipotent being modify
existing modes of being ie make actual what was only potential in
these latter the notion of change is not verified in the conception of
successive annihilations and creations for there is involved in the
former concept not merely the notion of a real difference between the two
actual states that before and that after the change but also the
notion of some potential reality persisting throughout the change
something capable of being actually so and so before the change and
actually otherwise after the change for real change therefore we
require 1 two positive and really different states of the same being a
terminus a quo and a terminus ad quem and 2 a real process of
transition whereby something potential becomes actual in creation there
is no real and positive terminus a quo in annihilation there is no real
and positive terminus ad quem these therefore are not changes in the
proper sense of the term sometimes too change is affirmed by purely
extrinsic denomination of a thing in which there is no real change but
only a relation to some other really changing thing in this sense when an
object unknown or unthought of becomes the actual object of somebodys
thought or cognition it is said to change though the transition from
unknown to known involves no real change of state in the object but
only in the knowing subject if thought were in any true sense
constitutive of reality as many modern philosophers contend the change
in the object would of course be real
since therefore change consists in this that a thing which is actually
in a given state ceases to be actually such and begins to be actually in
another state it is obvious that there persists throughout the process
some reality which is in itself potential and indifferent to either actual
state and that moreover something which was actual disappears while
some new actuality appears in this persisting potentiality the abiding
potential principle is called the matter or subject of the change the
transient actualizing principles are called forms not all these forms
which precede or result from change are necessarily positive entities in
themselves they may be mere privations of other forms privatio
 not all changes result in the acquisition of a new degree of
positive actual being some result in loss of perfection or actuality
still even in these cases the state characterized by the less perfect
degree of actuality has a determinate actual grade of being which is
proper to itself and which as such is not found actually but only
potentially in the state characterized by the more perfect degree of
actuality when then a being changes from a more perfect to a less
perfect state the actuality of this less perfect state cannot be
adequately accounted for by seeking it in the antecedent and more perfect
state it is not in this latter state actually but only potentially
nor do we account for it by saying that it is equivalently in the
greater actuality of the latter state the two actualizing principles are
really distinct and neither is wholly or even partially the other the
significance of this consideration will appear presently in connection
with the scholastic axiom quidquid movetur ab alio movetur
meanwhile we must guard against conceiving the potential or material
factor in change as a sort of actual but hidden core of reality which
itself persists unchanged throughout and the formative or actualizing
factors as superficially adorning this substratum by constantly replacing
one another such a substitution of imagination images for intellectual
thought will not help but rather hinder all accurate analysis it is not
the potential or material factor in things that changes nor yet the
actualizing or formal factors but the things themselves and if things
are subject to real change it is manifest that this fact can be made
intelligible if at all only by intellectually analysing the things and
their changes into constitutive principles or factors which are nor
themselves things or changes were we to arrive only at principles of
the latter sort so far from explaining anything we would really only have
pushed back the problem a step farther it may be that none of the
attempts yet made by philosophers or scientists to offer an ultimate
explanation of change is entirely satisfactorythe scholastic explanation
will be gradually outlined in these pagesbut it will be of advantage at
least to recognize the shortcomings of theories that are certainly
inadequate
we are now in a position to state and explain the important scholastic
aphorism embodying what has been called the principle of change
principium motus quidquid movetur ab alio movetur whatever
undergoes change is changed by something else the term motus is here
taken in the wide sense of any real transition from potentiality to
actuality as is evident from the alternative statements of the same
principle nihil potest seipsum reducere e potentia in actum nothing
can reduce itself from potentiality to actuality or again potentia
qua talis nequit per semetipsam ad actum reduci sed reducitur ab alio
principio in actu the potential as such cannot be reduced by itself to
the actual but only by some other already actual principle77 this
assertion rightly understood is selfevidently true for the state of
passive potentiality as such involves the absence of the correlative
actuality in the potential subject and since the actual as such
involves a perfection which is not in the potential the latter cannot
confer upon itself this perfection nothing can be the adequate principle
or source of a perfection which is not in this principle or source nemo
dat quod non habet
we have already anticipated the objection arising from the consideration
that the state resulting from a change is sometimes in its totality less
perfect than the state which existed prior to the change even in such
cases there results from the change a new actuality which was not in the
prior state and which cannot be conceived as a mere part or residue of
the latter or regarded as equivalently contained in the latter even
granting as we must that the net result of such a change is a loss of
actuality or perfection in the subject of change still there is always a
gain which is not accounted for by the loss there is always a new actual
state which as such was not in the original state
a more obvious objection to the principle arises from the consideration of
vital action but it is based on a misunderstanding of the principle under
discussion living things it is objected move themselves their vital
action is spontaneous and immanent originating within themselves it has
its term too within themselves resulting in their gradual development
growth increase of actuality and perfection therefore it would appear
that they move and perfect themselves and hence the socalled principle
of change is not true universally
in reply to all this we admit that vital action is immanent remaining
within the agent to perfect the latter also that it is spontaneous
inasmuch as when the agent is actually exercising vital functions it need
not be actually undergoing the causal influence of any other created
agent or actually dependent on any such agent but it must nevertheless
in such action be dependent on and influenced by some actual being
other than itself and the reason is obvious if by such action it
increases its own actual perfection and becomes actually other than it
was before such action then it cannot have given itself the actuality of
this perfection which it possessed before only potentially no doubt it
is not merely passively potential in regard to such actual perfections as
is the case in nonvital change which results in the subject from the
transitive action of some outside cause upon the latter the living thing
has the active power of causing or producing in itself these actual
perfections there is interaction between its vital parts through one
organ or faculty it acts upon another thus educing an actuality a new
perfection in this other and thus developing and perfecting its own
being but even considered as active it cannot be the adequate cause of
the actuality acquired through the change if this actuality is something
really over and above the reality of its active and passive potential
principles then it remains true that change implies the influence of an
actual being other than the subject changed quid quid movetur ab alio
movetur
    the question here arises not only in reference to vital agents
    but to all finite created causes does the active cause of
    change together with the passive potentiality of the subject of
    change whether this subject be the agent itself as in immanent
    activity or something other than the agent as in transitive
    activitydoes this active power account adequately for the new
    actuality educed in the change it obviously does not for the
    actuality acquired in the change is as such a new entity a new
    perfection in some degree positively surpassing the total reality
    of the combined active powers and passive potentialities which it
    replaces in other words if the actuality resulting from the
    change is not to be found in the immediate active and passive
    antecedents of the change then we are inevitably referred for an
    adequate explanation of this actuality to some actual being above
    and beyond these antecedents and to what sort of actual being are
    we referred to a being in which the actuality of the effect
    resides only in the same way as it resides in the immediate active
    and passive antecedents of the change that is potentially no
    for this would be useless merely pushing the difficulty one step
    farther back we are obliged rather to infer the existence of an
    actual being in whom the actuality of the said effect resides
    actually not formally of course as it exists in itself when
    it is produced through the change but eminently eminenter in
    such a way that its actualization outside himself and under his
    influence does not involve in him any loss of perfection any
    increase of perfection or any manner of change whatsoever we are
    compelled in this way to infer from the existence of change in
    the universe of our direct experience the existence of a
    transcendent immovable prime mover a primum movens immobile
    all the active causes or principles of change which fall under our
    notice in the universe of direct experience are themselves subject
    to change none of them causes change in any other thing without
    itself undergoing change the active power of finite causes is
    itself finite by educing the potentiality of other things into
    actuality they gradually use up their own energy they diminish
    and lose their active power of producing effects this belongs to
    the very nature of finite causes as such moreover they are
    themselves passive as well as active interaction is universal
    among the finite causes which constitute the universe of our
    direct experience they all alike have passive potentiality and
    undergo change now if any one finite cause in this system cannot
    adequately account for the new actuality evolved from the
    potential in any single process of change neither can the whole
    system adequately account for it what is true of them
    distributively is true of them taken all together when there is
    question of what belongs to their nature and the fact that their
    active powers and passive potentialities fall short of the
    actuality of the effects we attribute to them is a fact that
    appertains to their very nature as finite things the phenomenon
    of continuous change in the universe involves the continuous
    appearance of new actual being to account for this constant
    stream of actuality we are of necessity carried beyond the system
    of finite changing being itself we are forced to infer the
    existence of a source and principle which must itself be purely
    actual and exempt from all changea being who can cause all the
    actuality that results from change without losing or gaining or
    changing in any way himself because he possesses all finite
    actuality in himself in a supereminent manner which transcends all
    the efforts of finite human intelligence to comprehend or
    characterize in any adequate or positive manner the scholastics
    expressed this in the simple aphorism omne novum ens est a deo
    and it is the realization of this profound truth that underlies
    their teaching on the necessity of the divine concursus ie
    the influence of the infinite first cause or prime mover
    permeating the efficiency of all finite or created causes here
    for example is a brief recent statement of that doctrine
    if we must admit a causal influence of these things of direct
    experience on one another then a closer examination will
    convince us that a finite thing can never be the adequate cause of
    any effect but is always metaphysically regarded only a
    partcause ever needing to be completed by another cause every
    effect isat least under one aspect at least as an
    effectsomething new something that was not there before even
    were the effect contained whether formally or virtually in the
    cause it is certainly not identical with this latter for if it
    were there would be no causality nothing would happen in all
    causing and happening something which was heretofore only
    possible becomes real and actual but things cannot determine
    themselves to influence others or to receive the influence of
    others since they are not dependent in their being on one
    another hence the necessary inference that all being all
    happening all change requires the concurrence of an absolute
    principle of being when two things act on each other the absolute
    being must work in and with them the same absolute being in
    bothto relate them to each other and supplement their natural
    insufficiency
    such is the profound teaching about the divine concursus with
    every creature god works in all and with all he permeates all
    reality everywhere there is no being beyond him or independent
    of his conserving and concurring power just as creatures are
    brought into being only through gods omnipotence and of
    themselves have no independent reality so do they need the
    selfsame everpresent allsustaining power to continue in this
    being and develop it by their activity every event in nature is a
    transitory passing phenomenon so bound up with conditions and
    circumstances that it must disappear to give place to some other
    how could a mode of being so incomplete discharge its function in
    existence without the concurrence of the first cause78
we have seen now that in the real order the potential presupposes the
actual for the potential cannot actualize itself but can be actualized
only by the action of some already actual being nor can we avoid this
consequence by supposing the potential being to have had no actual
beginning in time but to be eternally in process of actualization for
even so it must be eternally actualized by some other actual beinga
position which aristotle and some scholastics admit to be possible
whether then we conceive the actualization as beginning in time or as
proceeding from all eternity it is selfcontradictory to suppose the
potential as capable of actualizing itself
it is likewise true that the actual precedes the possible in the order of
our knowledge the concept of a thing as possible presupposes the concept
of that thing as actual for the possible is understood to be possible
only by its intelligible relation to actual existence this is evidently
true of extrinsic possibility but our knowledge even of the intrinsic
possibility of a thing cannot be the first knowledge we possess in the
order of time our first knowledge is of the actual for the minds first
cognitive act must have for object either itself or something not itself
but it knows itself as a consciously acting and therefore actual being
and it comes to know things other than itself only by the fact that such
other things act upon it either immediately or mediately through
senseconsciousness so that in every hypothesis its first known object is
something actual79
    the priority of the actual as compared with the potential in the
    real order suggests a proof of the existence of god in the manner
    indicated above it also affords a refutation of hegelian monism
    the conception of the world including all the phenomena of mind
    and matter as the gradual selfmanifestation or evolution of a
    potential being eternally actualizing itself is a
    selfcontradictory conception scholastics rightly maintain that
    the realities from which we derive our first most abstract and
    transcendental notion of being in general are actual realities
    hegelians seize on the object of this notion identify it with
    pure thought proclaim it the sole reality and endow it with the
    power of becoming actually everything it is manifest therefore
    that they endow purely potential being with the power of
    actualizing itself
    nor can they fairly avoid this charge by pointing out that
    although their startingpoint is not actual being with which the
    scholastic philosophy of being commences yet neither is it
    possible or potential being but being which has neither of these
    determinations being which abstracts from both like the real
    being of the scholastics 7 13 for though real being can be an
    object of abstract human thought without either of the predicates
    existent or nonexistent yet it cannot be anything in the
    real order without either of them there it must be either
    actually existent or else merely potential but hegelians claim
    absolutely indeterminate being to be as such something in the
    real order and though they try to distinguish it from potential
    being they nevertheless think of it as potential being for they
    distinctly and repeatedly declare that it can become all things
    and does become all things and is constantly eternally
    transforming itself by an internal dialectic process into the
    phenomena which constitute the worlds of mind and matter
    contrasting it with the abstract inert being which they conceive
    to be the object of the traditional metaphysics they endow
    indeterminate being with the active power of producing and the
    passive potentiality of becoming actually everything thus in
    order to show a priori how this indeterminate being must evolve
    itself by internal logical necessity into the world of our direct
    and immediate experience they suppose it to be subject to change
    and to be at the same time selfactualizing in direct opposition
    to the axiom that potential reality reality which is subject to
    change cannot actualize itself quidquid movetur ab alio
    moveatur oportet
11 kinds of changefollowing aristotle80 we may recognize a broad and
clear distinction between four great classes of change 
mutatio in the phenomena of our sense experience local change 
   latio quantitative change     
 augmentatio vel diminutio qualitative change   
 alteratio and substantial change    
 the three former are accidental ie do not reach or affect the
essence or substance of the thing that is changed the fourth is
substantial a change of essence substantial change is regarded as taking
place instantaneously as soon as the condition brought about by the
accidental changes leading up to it becomes naturally incompatible with
the essence or nature of the subject the accidental changes on the other
hand are regarded as taking place gradually as realizing and involving a
succession of states or conditions in the subject these changes
especially when they take place in corporeal things are properly
described as movement or motion motus motio by movement or motion
in the strict sense we therefore mean any change which takes place
gradually or successively in a corporeal thing it is only in a wider and
improper sense that these terms are sometimes applied to activity of
whatsoever kind even of spiritual beings in this sense we speak of
thoughts volitions etc as movements of the soul motus animae or of
god as the prime mover ever in motion the primum movens semper in motu
with local change in material things as also with quantitative change
growth and diminution of quantity mass and volume everyone is perfectly
familiar from the earliest times moreover we find both in science and
philosophy the conception of matter as composed of and divisible into
ultimate particles themselves supposed to admit of no further real
division and hence called atoms   from the days of
grecian atomism men have attempted to show that all change in the universe
is ultimately reducible to changes of place order spatial arrangement
and collocation of those hypothetical atomic factors it has likewise
been commonly assumed that change in mass is solely due to change in the
number of those atoms and change in volume of the same mass to the
relative density or closeness with which the atoms aggregate together
though some have heldand it is certainly not inconceivablethat exactly
the same material entity an atom let us say may be capable of real
contraction and expansion and so of real change of volume as distinct
from the apparent contraction and expansion of bodies a change which is
supposed to be due to change of density ie to decrease or increase in
the dimensions of the pores or interstices between the smaller constituent
parts or molecules however this may be the attempts to reduce all change
in physical nature to mere mechanical change ie to spatial motions
of the masses molar motions the molecules molecular motions and
the atoms or other ultimate components of matter whether vibratory
undulatory rotatory or translational motions have never been
satisfactory
qualitative change is wider than material change for it includes changes
in spiritual beings ie in beings which are outside the category of
quantity and have a mode of existence altogether different from the
extensional spatial existence which characterizes matter when for
instance the human mind acquires knowledge it undergoes qualitative
change but matter too has qualities and is subject to qualitative
change it is endowed with active qualities ie with powers forces
energies whereby it can not merely perform mechanical work by producing
local changes in the distribution of its mass throughout space but also
produce physical and chemical changes which seem at least to be different
in their nature from mere mechanical changes it is likewise endowed with
passive qualities which appear to the senses to be of various kinds
differing from one another and from the mechanical or quantitative
characteristics of size shape motion rest etc while these latter are
called primary qualities of bodiesbecause conceived to be more
fundamental and more closely inherent in the real and objective nature of
matteror common sensibles sensibilia communia because perceptible
by more than one of our external sensesthe former are called secondary
qualities because conceived to be less characteristic of the real and
objective nature of matter and more largely subjective products of our
own sentient cognitive activityor proper sensibles sensibilia
propria because each of them is apprehended by only one of our external
senses colour sound taste odour temperature material state or
texture eg roughness liquidity softness etc now about all these
perceived qualities and their changes the question has been raised are
they as such ie as perceived by us really in the material things or
bodies which make up the physical universe and really different in these
bodies from the quantitative factors and motions of the latter or as
such are they not rather partially or wholly subjective
phenomenaproducts at least in part of our own sense perception states
of our own consciousness having nothing really corresponding to them in
the external matter of the universe beyond the quantitative mechanical
factors and motions whereby matter acts upon our faculties of sense
cognition and produces these states of consciousness in us this is a
question of the first importance the solution of which belongs to
epistemology aristotle would not allow that the objective material
universe can be denuded in the way just suggested of qualities and
qualitative change and scholastic philosophers have always held the same
general view what we have to note here however in regard to the
question is simply this that even if the world of matter were thus
simplified by transferring all qualitative change to the subjective domain
of consciousness the reality of qualitative change and all the problems
arising from it would still persist to transfer qualitative change from
object to subject from matter to mind is certainly something very
different from explaining it as reducible to quantitative or mechanical
change the simplification thus effected would be more apparent than real
it would be simplifying the world of matter by transferring its complexity
to the world of mind this consideration is one which is sometimes lost
sight of by scientists who advance mechanical hypotheses as ultimate
explanations of the nature and activities of the physical universe
if all material things and processes could be ultimately analysed into
configurations and local motions of spaceoccupying atoms homogeneous in
nature and differing only in size and shape then each of these ultimate
atomic factors would be itself exempt from intrinsic change as to its own
essence and individuality in this hypothesis there would be really no
such thing as substantial change the collection of atoms would form an
immutable core of material reality wholly simple and ever actual such an
hypothesis however is utterly inadequate as an explanation of the facts
of life and consciousness and even as an account of the processes of the
inorganic universe it encounters insuperable difficulties the common
belief of men has always been that even in this domain of reality there
are fundamentally different kinds of matter kinds which differ from one
another not merely in the shape and size and configuration and arrangement
of their ultimate actual constituents but even in the very substance or
nature of these constituents and that there are some material changes
which affect the actual substance itself of the matter which undergoes
them this belief scholastics again following aristotle hold to be a
correct belief and one which is well grounded in reason and this belief
in turn involves the view that every type of actual material
entitywhether merely inorganic or endowed with life or even allied with
a higher spiritual mode of being as in the case of man himselfis
essentially composite essentially a synthesis of potential and
actual principles of being and therefore capable of substantial
change the actually existing material being scholastics describe as
materia secunda the   of aristotle the purely potential
factor which is actualized in this or that particular kind of matter
they describe as materia prima the   of aristotle the
actualizing specifying formative principle they designate as forma
substantialis  and since the purely potential principle cannot
actually exist except as actualized by some formative principle all
substantial change or transition from one substantial type to another is
necessarily both a corruptio and a generatio that is it involves the
actual disappearance of one substantial form and the actual appearance of
another hence the scholastic aphorism regarding substantial change
corruptio unius est generatio alterius the corruption or destruction of
one kind of material thing involves the generation of another kind
the concepts of materia prima and forma substantialis are concepts not
of phenomenal entities directly accessible to the senses or the
imagination but of principles which can be reached only mediately and by
intellect proper they cannot be pictured in the imagination which can
only attain to the sensible we may help ourselves to grasp them
intellectually by the analogy of the shapeless block of marble and the
figure educed therefrom by the sculptor but this is only an analogy just
as the statue results from the union of an accidental form with an
existing matter so this matter itself the substance marble is
composed of a substantial form and a primordial potential matter but
there the analogy ceases
furthermore when we consider that the proper and primary objects of the
human intellect itself are corporeal things or bodies and that these
bodies actually exist in nature only as composite substances subject to
essential or substantial change we shall realize why it is that the
concept of materia prima especially being a mediate and negative
concept is so difficult to grasp for as the scholastics describe it
translating aristotles formula it is in itself neque quid neque
quantum neque quale neque aliquid eorum quibus ens determinatur81
but it is through intellectual concepts alone and not through imagination
images that we may hope to analyse the nature and processes even of the
world of corporeal reality and as st thomas well observes it was
because the ancient greek atomists did not rise above the level of
thinking in imagination images that they failed to recognize the
existence or explain the nature of substantial change in the material
universe82 an observation which applies with equal force to those
scientists and philosophers of our own time who would fain reduce all
physical processes to mere mechanical change
those then are the principal kinds of change as analysed by aristotle
and the scholastics we may note finally that the distinction between
immanent and transitive activity is also applied to changethat is to
change considered as a process not to the result of the change to change
in fieri not in facto esse immanent movement or activity motio
actio immanens is that of which the term the educed actuality remains
within the agentwhich latter is therefore at once both agens and
patiens vital action is of this kind transitive movement or activity
on the other hand motio actio transiens is that of which the term
is some actuality educed in a being other than the agent the patiens is
here really distinct from the agens and it is in the former not in the
latter that the change takes place actio fit in passo all change in
the inorganic universe is of this sort 101
chapter iii existence and essence
12 existencein the preceding chapters we examined reality in itself and
in its relation to change or becoming we have now to examine it in
relation to its actual existence and to its intrinsic possibility 7
a
existing or being in the participial sense esse existere 
 is a simple indefinable notion a being is said to exist when it
is not merely possible but actual when it is not merely potential in its
active and passive causes but has become actual through those causes
existere exsisto exstare to stand forth distinct from its
causes or if it have no causes when it simply is essein which
sense god the necessary purely actual being simply is thus
existence implies the notion of actuality and is conceived as that by
which any thing or essence is distinct from nothingness in the actual
order83 or again it is the actuality of any thing or essence
about any conceivable being we may ask two distinct questions a what
is it and b does such a being actually exist the answer to the
former gives us the essence what is presented to the mind through the
concept the answer to the latter informs us about the actual existence
of the being or essence in question
to the mind of any individual man the real existence as also the real
essence of any being whatsoever not excepting his own can be known only
through its ideal presence in his mind through the concept or percept
whereby it becomes for him a known object an objectum cognitum but
this actual presence of known being to the knowing mind must not be
confounded with the real existence of such being 4 real being does not
get its real existence in our minds or from our minds our cognition does
not produce but only discovers actually existing reality the latter by
acting on the mind engenders therein the cognition of itself now all our
knowledge comes through the senses and sense cognition is excited in us
by the direct action of material or phenomenal being on our sense
faculties but through sense cognition the mind is able to attain to a
knowledge both of the possibility and of the actual existence of
suprasensible or spiritual realities hence we cannot describe existence
as the power which material realities have to excite in us a knowledge of
themselves their existence is prior to this activity prius est esse
quam agere nor can we limit existence to material realities for if
there are spiritual realities these too have existence though this
existence can be discerned only by intellect and not by sense
13 essencein any existing thing we can distinguish what the thing is
its essence from its actual existence if we abstract from the actual
existence of a thing not considering whether it actually exists or not
and fix our attention merely on what the thing is we are thinking of
its real essence if we positively exclude the notion of actual
existence from our concept of the essence and think of the latter as not
actually existing we are considering it formally as a possible essence
there is no being even the necessary being whose essence we cannot think
of in the former way ie without including in our concept the notion
of actual existence but we cannot without error positively exclude the
notion of actual existence from our concept of the necessary being or
think of the latter as a merely possible essence
taken in its widest sense the essence of a thing  essentia 
  quod quid est quidditas means that by which a thing is
what it is id quo res est id quod est that which gives us the answer
to the question what is this thing quid est haec res   
84 now of course any individual thing is what it is just precisely by
all the reality that is in it but we have no direct or intuitive
intellectual insight into this reality we understand it only by degrees
we explore it from various points of view abstracting and generalizing
partial aspects of it as we compare it with other things and seek to
classify and define it ratio humana essentias rerum quasi venatur as
the scholastics say the human mind hunts as it were after the essences
or natures of things understanding the individual datum of sense
experience what aristotle called   or   and the
scholastics hoc aliquid or substantia prima eg this individual
socrates first under the vaguest concept of being then gradually under
the more and more determinate concepts of substance corporeal living
sentient rational it finally forms the complex concept of his species
infima expressed by his lowest classname man and explicitly set
forth in the definition of his specific nature as a rational animal nor
does our reason fail to realize that by reaching this concept of the
specific essence or nature of the individual socrates it has not yet
grasped all the reality whereby the individual is what he is it has
reached what he has in common with all other individuals of his class
what is essential to him as a man it has distinguished this from the
unanalysed something which makes him this particular individual of his
class and which makes his specific essence this individual essence
essentia atoma or individua and it has also distinguished
his essence from those accidental and ever varying attributes which are
not essential to him as a man and from those which are not essential to
him as socrates it is only the unfathomed individual essence as existing
hic et nunc that is concrete all the minds generic and specific
representations of iteg of socrates as a corporeal substance a
living being a sentient being a rational animalare abstract and all
more or less inadequate none of them exhausting its knowable reality but
it is only in so far as the mind is able to represent concrete individual
things by such abstract concepts that it can attain to intellectual
knowledge of their nature or reality hence it is that by the term
essence simply and sine addito we always mean the essence as grasped
by abstract generic or specific concepts  species and as thus
capable of definition  ratio rei the essence says st
thomas is that by which the thing is constituted in its proper genus or
species and which we signify by the definition which states what the
thing is85 thus understood the essence is abstract and gives the
specific or generic type to which the individual thing belongs but we may
also mean by essence the concrete essence the individual person or thing
persona suppositum res individua the relations between the
objects of those two concepts of essence will be examined later
since the specific essence is conceived as the most fundamental reality in
the thing and as the seat and source of all the properties and activities
of the thing it is sometimes defined or described in accordance with
this notion of it as the primary constitutive of the thing and the source
of all the properties of the thing conceived as the foundation of all the
properties of the thing it is sometimes called substance 
substantia regarded as the source of the things activities and the
principle of its growth or development it is called the nature of the
thing  natura from  nascor86
since what makes a thing that which it is by the same fact differentiates
this thing from every other thing the essence is rightly conceived as
that which gives the thing its characteristic being thereby marking it
off from all other being in reality of course each individual being is
distinct by all that it is from every other but since we get our
intellectual knowledge of things by abstracting comparing generalizing
and classifying partial aspects of them we apprehend part of the
imperfectly grasped abstract essence of each individual as common to other
classes generic and part as peculiar to that class itself
differential and thus we differentiate classes of things by what is
only part of their essence by what we call the differentia of each
class distinguishing mentally between it and the generic element which
two are really one really identical in every individual of the species
thus defined and classified
but in the aristotelian and scholastic view of the constitution of any
corporeal thing there is a danger of taking what is really only part of
the essence of such a thing for the whole essence according to this view
all corporeal substance is essentially composite constituted by two
really distinct substantial principles primal matter  
materia prima and substantial form   united substantially
as potential and actual principles to form one composite nature or
essence now the kind or species or specific type to which a body
belongseg a horse an oak gold water etcdepends upon the
substantial form which actualizes the matter or potential principle in so
far as the corporeal essence is known to us at all it is known through the
form which is the principle of all the characteristic properties and
activities of that particular kind of body hence it is quite natural that
the   or forma substantialis of a body should often be
referred to as the specific essence of the body though of course the
essence of the body really includes the material as well as the formal
factor
we may look at the essence of any being from two points of view if we
consider it as it is conceived actually to exist in the being we call it
the physical essence if we consider it after the manner in which it is
apprehended and defined by our intellects through generic and
differentiating concepts we call it the metaphysical essence thus the
essence of man conceived by the two defining concepts rational animal
is the metaphysical essence the essence of man as known to be composed of
the two really distinct substantial principles soul and body is the
physical essence understood in this way both are one and the same essence
considered from different points of viewas existing in the actual order
and as conceived by the mind87
the physical essence of any being understood as the constitutive
principle or principles from which all properties spring is either
simple or composite according as it is understood to consist of one
such constitutive principle or to result from the substantial union of
two constitutive principles a material and a formal thus the essence of
god the essence of a purely spiritual being the essence of the human
soul are physically simple the essence of man the essences of all
corporeal beings are physically composite
according to our mode of conceiving defining and classifying essences by
means of the abstract generic and differential grades of being which we
apprehend in them all essences even physically simple essences are
conceived as logically and metaphysically composite moreover we speak and
think of their generic and differential factors as material and formal
respectively after the analogy of the composition of corporeal or
physically composite essences from the union of two really distinct
principles matter and form the analogy consisting in this that as
matter is the indeterminate principle which is determined and actuated by
form so the generic concept is the indeterminate concept which is made
definite and specific by that of the differentia88 but when we think
of the genus of any corporeal essence as material and the
differentia as formal we must not consider these metaphysical parts
as really distinct whereas the physical parts of a corporeal substance
such as man are really distinct the genus animal although a
metaphysical part expresses the whole essence man in an indeterminate
way whereas the matter which is a physical part does not express the
whole essence of man nor does the soul which is also a physical part but
only both together not a little error has resulted from the confusion of
thought whereby genus and differentia have been regarded as material
and formal constitutives in the literal sense of those expressions
14 characteristics of abstract essenceswhen we consider the essences of
things not as actually existing but as intrinsically possiblethe
abstract metaphysical essences thereforewe find that when as objects of
our thought they are analysed into their simplest constituents and
compared or related with themselves and with one another they present
themselves to our minds in these relations as endowed with certain more or
less remarkable characteristics
a in the first place being abstract they present themselves to the
mind as being what they are independently of actual existence at any
particular time or place their intelligibility is something apart from
any relation to any actual time or place being intrinsically possible
they might exist at any time or place but as possible they are out of
time and out of placedetemporalized and delocalized if we may be
permitted to use such expressions89
b furthermore since the intellect forms its notions of them through
the aid of the senses and the imagination from actual realizations of
themselves or their constituent factors and since it understands them to
be intrinsically possible or free from intrinsic incompatibility of their
constituent factors it conceives them to be capable of indefinitely
repeated actualizations throughout time and spaceunless it sees some
special reason to the contrary as it does in the case of the necessary
being and according to some philosophers in the case of purely
immaterial beings or pure spirits that is to say it universalizes them
and sees them to be capable of existing at any and every conceivable time
and place this relation of theirs to space is not likely to be confounded
with the immensity or ubiquity of god but their corresponding
relation to time is sometimes described as eternity and if it is so
described it must be carefully distinguished from the positive eternity
of god the immutable being to distinguish it from the latter it is
usually described as negative eternitythis indifference of the
possible essence to actual existence at any particular point of time
    but apart from this relation which we conceive it as having to
    existence in the order of actual reality can we or do we or
    must we conceive it as in itself an intrinsic possibility from
    all eternity in the sense that it never began to be
    intrinsically possible and will never cease to be so must we
    attribute to it a positive eternity not of course of actuality
    or existence but of ideal being as an object of thought to an
    eternally existing mind what is this supposed eternal possibility
    of the possible essence is it nothing actual the possible as
    such is nothing actual but is it anything real has it only ideal
    beingesse ideale or intentionale and has it this only in and
    from the human mind or independently of the human mind and also
    independently of the actual essences from which the human mind
    gets the data for its thoughtso that we must ascribe to it an
    eternal ideal being to these questions we shall return
    presently
c thirdly essences considered apart from their actual existence and
compared with their own constitutive factors or with one another reveal
to the mind relations which the mind sees to be necessary and which it
formulates for itself in necessary judgmentsjudgments in materia
necessaria by virtue of the principle of identity an abstract essence is
necessarily what it is what the mind conceives it to be what the mind
conceives as its definition man as an object of thought is
necessarily a rational animal whether he actually exists or not and if
he is thought of as existing he cannot at the same time be thought of as
nonexistingby the principle of contradiction an existing man is
necessarily an existing manby the principle of identity these logical
principles are rooted in the nature of reality whether actual or
possible considered as an object of thought there is thus a necessary
relation between any complex object of thought and each of the constituent
factors into which the mind can analyse it and similarly there is a
necessary negative relationa relation of exclusionbetween any object of
thought and anything which the mind sees to be incompatible with that
object as a whole or with any of its constituent factors
again the mind sees necessary relations between abstract essences
compared with one another five and seven are necessarily twelve
whatever begins to exist actually must have a cause contingent being
if such exists is necessarily dependent for its existence on some other
actually existing being if potential being is actualized it must be
actualized by actual being the three interior angles of a triangle are
necessarily equal to two right angles and so on
but is the abstract essence itselfapart from all mental analysis of it
apart from all comparison of it with its constituent factors or with other
essencesin any sense necessary there is no question of its actual
existence but only of itself as an object of thought now our thought
does not seem to demand necessarily or have a necessary connexion
with any particular object of which we do de facto think what we do
think of is determined by our experience of actual things and the
things which we conceive to be possible by the exercise of our reason
upon the data of our senses memory and imagination are determined as to
their nature and number by our experience of actual things even although
they themselves can and do pass beyond the domain of actually experienced
things the only necessary object of thought is reality in general for
the exercise of the function of thought necessarily demands an object and
this object must be reality of some sort thought as we saw begins with
actual reality working upon this thought apprehends in it the
foundations of those necessary relations and judgments already referred
to considering moreover the actual data of experience our thought can
infer from these the actual existence of one being who must exist by a
necessity of his essence
    but furthermore must all the possible essences which the mind
    does or can actually think of be conceived as necessarily
    possible in the same sense in which it is suggested that they
    must be conceived as eternally possible to this question too we
    shall return presently
d finally possible essences appear to the mind as immutable and
consequently indivisible this means simply that the relations which we
establish between them and their constitutive factors are not only
necessary but immutable that if any constitutive factor of an essence is
conceived as removed from it or any new factor as added we have no
longer the original essence but some other essence if animal is a being
essentially embodying the two objective concepts of organism and
sentient then on removing either we have no longer the essence
animal so too by adding to these some other element compatible with
them eg rational we have no longer the essence animal but the
essence man hence possible essences have been likened to numbers
inasmuch as if we add anything to or subtract anything from any given
number we have now no longer the original number but another90 this
too is only an expression of the laws of identity and contradiction
    we might ask however whether apart from analysis and comparison
    of an abstract object of thought with its constitutive notes or
    factors such a possible essence is in itself immutably
    possible this is similar to the question whether we can or must
    conceive such a possible essence as eternally and necessarily
    possible
15 grounds of those characteristicsin considering the grounds or
reasons of the various characteristics just enumerated it may be well to
reflect that when we speak of the intrinsic possibility of a possible
essence we conceive the latter as something complex which we mentally
resolve into its constitutive notes or factors or principles to see if
these are compatible if they are we pronounce the essence intrinsically
possible if not we pronounce it intrinsically impossible for our minds
absence of internal incompatibility in the content of our concept of any
object is the test of its intrinsic possibility whatever fulfils this
test we consider capable of existing but what about the possibility of
the notes or factors or principles themselves whereby we define those
essences and by the union of which we conceive those essences to be
constituted how do we know that those abstract principles or factorsno
one of which can actually exist alone since all are abstractcan in
certain combinations form possible objects of thought we can know this
only because we have either experienced such objects as actual or because
we infer their possibility from objects actually experienced and
similarly our knowledge of what is impossible is based upon our experience
of the actual since moreover our experience of the actual is finite and
fallible we may err in our judgments as to what essences are and what
are not intrinsically possible91
if now we ask ourselves what intelligible reason can we assign for the
characteristics just indicated as belonging to possible essences we must
fix our attention first of all on the fundamental fact that the human
intellect always apprehends its object in an abstract condition it
contemplates the essence apart from the existence in which the essence is
subject to circumstances of time and place and change it grasps the
essence in a static condition as simply identical with itself and distinct
from all else it sees the essence as indifferent to existence at any
place or time reflecting then on the actualization of this essence in the
existing order of things it apprehends the essence as capable of
indefinite actualizations except in cases where it sees some reason to
the contrary ie it universalizes the essence comparing it with
its constituent notes or elements and with those of other essences it
sees and affirms certain relations of identity or diversity
compatibility or incompatibility between those notes or elements as
holding good necessarily and immutably and independently of the
actual embodiment of those notes or elements in any object existing at any
particular place or time all these features of the relations between the
constituents of abstract possible essences seem so far to be adequately
accounted for by the fact that the intellect apprehends those essences in
the abstract the data in which it apprehends them being given to it
through sense experience what may be inferred from the fact that the
human intellect has this power of abstract thought is another
question92 but granting that it does apprehend essences in this manner
we seem to have in this fact a sufficient explanation of the features just
referred to
we have however already suggested other questions about the reality of
those possible essences is their possibility so far as known to us
explained by our experience of actual things or must we think them as
eternally necessarily and immutably possible from the manner in which we
must apprehend them can we infer anything about the reality of an
eternal immutable necessary intelligence in whose thought and essence
alone those essences as apprehended by our minds can find their ultimate
ground and explanation these are the questions we must now endeavour to
examine
16 possible essences as such are something distinct from mere logical
being and from nothingnessthere have been philosophers who have held
that the actual alone is real and only while it is actual that a purely
intrinsically possible essence as such is nothing real that the actual
alone is possible that the purely possible as such is impossible this
view is based on the erroneous assumption that whatever is or becomes
actual is so or becomes so by some sort of unintelligible fatalistic
necessity apart from the fact that it is incompatible with certain truths
of theism such as the divine omnipotence and freedom in creating it also
involves the denial of all real becoming or change and the assertion that
all actuality is eternal for if anything becomes actual it was
previously either possible or impossible if impossible it could never
become actual if possible then as possible it was something different
from the impossible or from absolute nothingness moreover the
intrinsically possible is capable of becoming actual and may be
actualized if there exists some actual being with power to actualize it
but absolute nothingnessor in other words the intrinsically
impossiblecannot be actualized even by omnipotence therefore the
possible essence as such is something positive or real as distinct from
nothingness finally intrinsically possible essences can be clearly
distinguished from one another by the mind but their negation which is
pure nonentity or nothingness cannot be so distinguished it is therefore
clear that possible essences are in some true sense something positive or
real from which it follows that nothingness in the strict sense is not
the mere absence or negation of actuality but also the absence or
negation of that positive or real something which is intrinsic
possibility in other words that nothingness in the strict sense means
intrinsic impossibility
even those who hold the opinion just rejectedthat the purely possible
essence as such has no reality in any conceivable sensewould presumably
admit that it is an object of human thought at all events they would
accord to it the being it has from the human mind which thinks it it
would therefore be an ens rationis according to this view having only
the ideal being which consists in its being constituted and contemplated
by the human mind that it has the ideal being the esse ideale or esse
intentionale which consists in its being contemplated by the human mind
as an object of thought no one will deny but a little reflection will
show firstly that this ideal being is something more than the ideal
being of an ens rationis of a mere logical entity and secondly that
a possible essence must have some other ideal being than that which it has
in the individual human mind
the possible essence is not a mere logical entity for the latter cannot
be conceived as capable of existing apart from the human mind in the
world of actual existences 3 whereas the former can be and is in fact
conceived as capable of such existence its ideal being in the human mind
is therefore something other than that of a mere logical entity
the ideal being which it has in the human mind as an object of thought is
undoubtedly derived from the minds knowledge of actual things we think
of the essences of actually experienced realities apart from their actual
existence thus abstracted we analyse them compare them reason from
them by these processes we can not merely attain to a knowledge of the
actual existence of other realities above and beyond and outside of our
own direct and immediate intuitional experience but we can also form
concepts of multitudes of realities or essences as intrinsically possible
thus giving these latter an ideal existence in our own minds here then
the question arises is this the only ideal being that can be ascribed to
such essences in other words are essences intrinsically possible because
we think them as intrinsically possible or is it not rather the case
that we think them to be intrinsically possible because they are
intrinsically possible does our thought constitute or does it not rather
merely discover their intrinsic possibility does the latter result from
or is it not rather presupposed by our thoughtactivity the second
alternative suggested in each of these questions is the true one as our
thought is not the source of their actuality neither is it the source of
their intrinsic possibility solipsism is the reductio ad absurdum of
the philosophy which would reduce all actuality experienced by the
individual mind to phases or phenomena or selfmanifestations of the
individual mind itself as the one and only actuality and no less absurd
is the philosophy which would accord to all intrinsically possible
realities no being other than the ideal being which they have as the
thoughtobjects of the individual human mind the study of the actual
world of direct experience leads the impartial and sincere inquirer to the
conclusion that it is in some true sense a manifestation of mind or
intelligence not however of his own mind which is itself only a very
tiny item in the totality of the actual world but of one supreme
intelligence and in this same intelligence the world of possible essences
too will be found to have its original and fundamental ideal being
17 possible essences have besides ideal being no other sort of being or
reality proper and intrinsic to themselvesbefore inquiring further into
the manner in which we attain to a knowledge of this intelligence and of
the ideal being of possible essences in this intelligence we may ask
whether above and beyond such ideal being possible essences have not
perhaps from all eternity some being or reality proper and intrinsic to
themselves not indeed the actual being which they possess when actualized
in time but yet some kind of intrinsic reality as distinct from the
extrinsic ideal being or esse intentionale which consists merely in
this that they are objects of thought present as such to a supreme
intelligence or mind
some few medieval scholastics93 contended that possible essences have
from all eternity not indeed the existence they may receive by creation or
production in time but an intrinsic essential being which by creation or
production may be transferred to the order of actual existences and
which when actual existence ceases if they ever receive it still
continues immutable and incorruptible what these writers called the esse
essentiae as distinct from the esse existentiae conceiving it to be
intermediate between the latter on the one hand and mere ideal or logical
being on the other and hence calling it esse diminutum or secundum
quid examining the question from the standpoint of theism these authors
seem to have thought that since god understands these essences as possible
from all eternity and since this knowledge must have as its term or
object something real and positive these essences must have some real and
proper intrinsic being from all eternity otherwise they would be simply
nothingness and nothingness cannot be the term of the divine
intelligence but the obvious reply is that though possible essences as
such are nothing actual they must be distinguished as realities capable
of actually existing from absolute nothingness and that as thus
distinguished from absolute nothingness they are really and positively
intelligible to the divine mind as indeed they are even to the human
mind to be intelligible they need not have actual being they must no
doubt be capable of having actual being in order to be understood as
realities it is precisely in this understood capability that their
reality consists for the real includes not only what actually exists but
whatever is capable of actual existence whatever is opposed to absolute
nothingness is real and this manifestly includes not only the actual but
whatever is intrinsically possible
realities or essences which have not actual being have only ideal being
and ideal being means simply presence in some mind as an object of
thought scholastic philosophers generally94 hold that possible essences
as such have no other being than this that before and until such essences
actually exist they have of themselves and in themselves no being except
the ideal being which they have as objects of the divine intelligence and
the virtual being they have in the divine omnipotence which may at any
time give them actual existence one convincing reason for this view is
the consideration that if possible essences as such had from all eternity
any proper and intrinsic being in themselves god could neither create nor
annihilate for in that hypothesis essences on becoming actual would not
be produced ex nihilo inasmuch as before becoming actual they would in
themselves and from all eternity have had their own proper real being and
after ceasing to be actual they would still retain this but creation is
the production of the whole reality of actual being from nothingness
and is therefore impossible if the actual being is merely produced from an
essence already real ie having an eternal positive reality of its
own the same is true of annihilation the theory of eternally existing
uncreated matter is no less incompatible with the doctrine of creation
than this theory of eternally real and uncreated forms or essences
again what could this supposed positive and proper reality of the
possible essence be if it is anything distinct from the mere ideal being
of such an essence as it is assumed to be it must after all be actual
being of some sort which would apparently have to be actualized again in
order to have actual existence finally this supposed eternal reality
proper to possible essences cannot be anything uncreated for whatever is
uncreated is god and since it is these supposed proper realities of
possible essences that are made actual and constitute the existing
created universe the latter would be in this view an actualization of the
divine essence itselfwhich is pantheism pure and simple and neither can
this supposed eternal reality proper to possible essences be anything
created for such creation would be eternal and necessary whereas gods
creative activity is admitted by all scholastics to be essentially free
and although they are not agreed as to whether creation from all
eternity creatio ab aeterno is possible they are agreed that it is
not a fact
possible essences as such are therefore nothing actual furthermore as
such they have in themselves no positive being but they are not therefore
unreal they are positively intelligible as capable of actual existence
and therefore as distinct from logical entities or entia rationis which
are not capable of such existence they are present as objects of thought
to mind and to some mind other than the individual human mind about this
ideal being which they have in this mind we have now in the next place to
inquire
18 inferences from our knowledge of possible essenceswe have stated
that an impartial study of the actual world will lead to the conclusion
that it is dependent on a supreme intelligence and we have suggested that
in this supreme intelligence also possible essences as such have their
primary ideal being 16 17 when the existence of god has been
establishedas it may be established by various lines of argumentfrom
actual things we can clearly see as will be pointed out presently
that in the divine essence all possible essences have the ultimate source
of their possibility but many scholastic philosophers contend that the
nature and properties of possible essences as apprehended by the human
mind furnish a distinct and conclusive argument for the existence of a
supreme uncreated intelligence95 others deny the validity of such a
line of reasoning contending that it is based on misapprehension and
misinterpretation of those characteristics
    all admit that it is not human thought that makes essences
    possible they are intelligible to the human mind because they are
    possible not vice versa96 for the human mind the immediate
    source and ground of their intrinsic possibility and
    characteristics is the fact that they are given to it in actual
    experience while it has the power of considering them apart from
    their actual existence
    but 1 are they not independent of experienced actuality no less
    than of the human mind so that we are forced to infer from them
    the reality of a supreme eternal mind in which they have eternal
    ideal being
    2 is not any possible essence eg water or a triangle
    so necessarily what it is that even if it never did and never will
    exist nay even were there no human or other finite mind to
    conceive it it would still be what it is eg a chemical
    compound of oxygen and hydrogen or a plane rectilinear
    threesided figureso that there must be some necessarily
    existing intelligence in and from which it has this necessary
    truth as a possible essence97 these essences as known to us
    are so far from being grounded in or explained by the things of
    our actual experience that we rather regard the latter as
    grounded in the former do we not consider possible essences as
    the prototypes and exemplars to which actual things must conform
    in order to be actual in order to exist at all98
    3 finally the relations which we apprehend as obtaining between
    them we see to be necessary and immutable relations they embody
    necessary truths which are for our minds the standards of all
    truth such necessary truths cannot be grounded either in the
    contingent human mind or in the contingent and mutable actuality
    of the things of our immediate experience therefore we can and
    must infer from them the reality of a necessary immutable being
    of whose essence they must be imitations
    if then this ideal order of intrinsically possible essences is
    logically and ontologically prior to the contingent actualizations
    of any of them even though it be posterior to them in the order
    of our knowledge which is based on actual experience there
    must be likewise ontologically prior to all contingent actualities
    including our own minds some necessary intelligence in which
    this order of possible essences has its ideal being
    19 critical analysis of those inferencesthe validity of the
    general line of argument indicated in the preceding paragraphs has
    been seriously questioned among other criticisms the following
    points have been urged99
    1 actual things furnish the basis of irrefragable proofs of
    the existence of godthe supreme necessary eternal omniscient
    and omnipotent being but we are here inquiring whether a mind
    which has not yet so analysed actual being as to see how it
    involves this conclusion or a mind which abstracts altogether
    from the evidence furnished by actual things for this conclusion
    can prove the existence of such a being from the separate
    consideration of possible essences their attributes and
    relations now it is not evident that to such a mind possible
    essences reveal themselves as having eternal ideal being such a
    mind is no doubt conscious that it is not itself the cause of
    their possibility but it sees that actual things plus the
    abstract character of its own thought account sufficiently for all
    their features as it knows them to the question is not their
    ideal being eternal it can only answer that will depend on
    whether the world of actual things can be shown to involve the
    existence of an eternal intelligence until this is proved we
    cannot say whether possible essences have any ideal being other
    than that which they have in human minds
    2 the actual things from which we get our concepts of possible
    essences do not exist necessarily but granted their existence
    we know from them that certain essences are de facto possible
    they are not necessarily given to us as possible any more than
    actual things are necessarily given to us as actual of course
    when they are thought of at all they are as objects of thought
    necessarily and immutably identical with themselves and related
    to one another as mutually compatible or incompatible etc but
    this necessity of relations hypothetical as it is and contingent
    on the mental processes of analysis and comparison involved as it
    is in the very nature of being and thought and expressed as it is
    in the principles of identity and contradiction is just as true
    of actual contingent essences as of possible essences100 and it
    is something very different from the sort of necessity claimed for
    possible essences by the contention that they must be conceived as
    having ideal being necessarily the ideal being they have in the
    human mind is certainly not necessary the human mind might never
    have conceived these possible essences
    but must the human mind conceive a possible essence as having
    some ideal being necessarily no unless that mind has already
    convinced itself from a study of actual things that an
    eternal necessary omniscient intelligence exists to which of
    course such essences would be eternally and necessarily present
    as objects of thought if the human mind had already reached this
    conviction it could then see that even if there were no human
    intellect things would still be true in relation to the divine
    intellect but if both intellects were per impossibile
    conceived as nonexistent truth would persist no longer101
    suppose therefore that it has not yet reached this conviction
    or abstracts altogether from the existence of god as known from
    actual things and then further imagines the actual things of
    its experience and all human intellects and finite intellects of
    whatsoever kind as nonexistent must it still conceive possible
    things as possible no possibility and impossibility truth and
    falsity will now have ceased to have any meaning after such
    attempted abstraction the mind would have before it only what
    balmes describes as the abyss of nothing and balmes is right in
    saying that the mind is unable to abstract all existence but
    the reason of the inability is not as balmes contends because
    when it has removed actual things and finite minds there still
    remains in spite of it a system or order of possible essences
    which forces it to infer and posit the existence of an eternal
    necessary mind as the source and ground of that order the reason
    rather is because the mind sees that the known actual things
    from which it got all its notions of possible essences
    necessarily imply as the only intelligible ground of their
    actuality the existence of a necessary being in whose
    intelligence they must have been contained ideally and in whose
    omnipotence they must have been contained virtually from all
    eternity from contingent actuality as known to it the mind
    can argue to the eternal actuality of necessary being and to the
    impossibility either of a state of absolute nothingness or of an
    order of purely possible things apart from all actuality
    3 of course whether the mind has thus thought out the ultimate
    implications of the actuality of experienced things or not once
    it has thought and experienced those things it cannot by any
    effort banish the memory of them from its presence they are there
    still as objects of its thought even when it abstracts from their
    actual existence but if while it has not yet seen that their
    actuality implies the existence of a necessary omniscient and
    omnipotent being it abstracts not only from their actual
    existence but from the existence of all finite minds itself
    included then in that state so far as its knowledge goes there
    would be neither actual nor ideal nor possible being nor can the
    fact that an ideal order of possible things still persists in its
    own thought mislead it into concluding that such an ideal order
    really persists in the hypothesis it has made for it knows that
    this ideal order still persists for itself simply because it
    cannot think itself away it sees all the time that if it could
    effectively think itself away this ideal order would have to
    disappear with it leaving nothingso far as it knowseither
    actual or possible mercier has some apposite remarks on this very
    point from the fact he writes that those abstract essences
    grasped by our abstractive thought from the dawn of our reason
    have grown so familiar to us we easily come to look upon them as
    preexisting archetypes or models of our thoughts and of things
    they form a fund of predicates by which we are in the habit of
    interpreting the data of our experience so too the
    hypothetically necessary relations established by abstract thought
    between them we come to regard as a sort of eternal system of
    principles endowed with a sort of legislative power to which
    created things and intelligences must conform but they have
    really no such preexistence the eternal preexistence of those
    essencetypes which plato called the intelligible world the
      and the supposed eternal legislative power of their
    relations are a sort of mental optical illusion those abstract
    essences and the principles based upon them are the products of
    our mental activity working on the data of our actual experience
    when we enter on the domain of speculative reflection  they
    are there before us  but we must not forget that reflection is
    consequent on the spontaneous thoughtactivity whichby working
    abstractively on the actual data of sensible contingent
    changeable temporal realitiesset them up there we know from
    psychology how those ideal abstract essencetypes are formed
    but because we have no actual memory of their formation which is
    so rapid as practically to escape consciousness in spontaneous
    thought we are naturally prone to imagine that they are not the
    product of our own mental action on the data of actual experience
    but that they exist in us or rather above us and independently
    of us we can therefore understand the psychological illusion
    under which plato wrote such passages as the following but if
    anyone should tell me why anything is beautiful either because it
    has a blooming florid colour or figure or anything else of the
    kind i dismiss all other reasons for i am confounded by them
    all but i simply wholly and perhaps navely confine myself to
    this that nothing else causes it to be beautiful except either
    the presence or communication of that abstract beauty by whatever
    means and in whatever way communicated for i cannot yet affirm
    with certainty but only that by means of beauty all beautiful
    things become beautiful       for this
    appears to me the safest answer to give both to myself and others
    and adhering to this i think that i shall never fall into
    error and that by magnitude great things become great and
    greater things greater and by littleness less things become
    less102 st augustines doctrine on the invariable laws of
    numbers on the immutable principles of wisdom and on truth
    generally draws its inspiration from this platonic
    idealism103
    but this platonic doctrine attributing to the abstract essences
    conceived by our thought a reality independent both of our thought
    and of the actual sense data from which directly or indirectly we
    derive our concepts of them is rejected as unsound by scholastics
    generally when we have proved from actual things that god exists
    and is the intelligent and free creator of the actual world of our
    direct experience we can of course consider the divine intellect
    as contemplating from all eternity the divine essence and as
    seeing therein the eternal archetypes or ideas of all actual and
    possible essences we may thus regard the divine mind as the
    eternal   or mundus intelligibilis this of course
    is not platos thought it is what st augustine substituted for
    platonism and very properly but we must not infer from this
    truth that when we contemplate possible essences with all the
    characteristics we may detect in them we are contemplating this
    mundus intelligibilis which is the divine mind this was the
    error of the ontologists they inferred that since possible
    essences as known by the human mind have ideal being
    independently of the latter and of all actual contingent reality
    the human mind in contemplating them has really an intuition of
    them as they are seen by the divine intellect itself in the divine
    essence so that in the words of gioberti the primum
    ontologicum the divine being himself is also the primum
    logicum or first reality apprehended by human thought104
    now those authors who hold that the ideal order of possible
    essences contemplated by the human mind is seen by the latter as
    so contemplated to have some being some ideal being really
    independent of the human mind itself and of the actual contingent
    things from which they admit that the human mind derives its
    knowledge of such essencesthese authors do not hold but
    deny that this independent ideal being which they claim for
    these essences is anything divine that it is the divine
    essence as seen by the divine intellect to be imitable ad
    extra105 hence they cannot fairly be charged with the error of
    ontologism
    renouncing platos exaggerated realism and holding that our
    knowledge of the ideal order of possible essences is derived by
    our mind from its consideration of actual things they yet hold
    that this ideal order is seen to have some sort of being or
    reality independent both of the mind and of actual things106
    this is not easy to understand when we ask is this supposed
    independent being or reality or possibility of possible
    essences the ideal being they have in the divine mindwe are told
    that it is not107 but that it is something from which we can
    infer by reasoning this eternal necessary and immutable
    ideal being of these same essences in the divine mind
    the considerations urged in the foregoing paragraphs will
    however have shown that the validity of this line of reasoning
    from possible essences to the reality of an eternal divine
    immutable intelligence is by no means evident or free from
    difficulties of course when the existence of god has been proved
    from actual things the conception of the divine intelligence and
    essence as the ultimate source of all possible reality no less
    than of all actual reality will be found to shed a great deal of
    new light upon the intrinsic possibility of possible essences
    since however our knowledge of the divine is merely analogical
    and since gods intuition of possible essences as imitations of
    his own divine essence completely transcends our comprehension
    and is totally different from our abstractive knowledge of such
    essences our conception of the manner in which these essences are
    related to the divine nature and the divine attributes must be
    determined after the analogy of the manner in which our own minds
    are related to these essences
20 essences are intrinsically possible not because god can make them
exist actually nor yet because he freely wills them to be possible nor
because he understands them as possible but because they are modes in
which the divine essence is imitable ad extraa the ultimate source
of the extrinsic possibility of all contingent realities is the divine
omnipotence just as the proximate source of the extrinsic possibility of
a statue is the power of the sculptor to educe it from the block of wood
or marble but just as the power of the sculptor presupposes the
intrinsic possibility of the statue so does the divine omnipotence
presuppose the intrinsic possibility of all possible things it is not as
william of ockam  1347 a scholastic of the decadent period
erroneously thought because god can create things that such things are
intrinsically possible but rather because they are intrinsically possible
he can create them
b not less erroneous is the voluntarist theory of descartes
according to which possible essences are intrinsically possible because
god freely willed them to be possible108 the actuality of all created
things depends of course on the free will of god to create them but
that possible essences are what they are and are related to each other
necessarily as they are because god has willed them to be such is
absolutely incredible descartes seems to have been betrayed into this
strange error by a false notion of what is requisite for the absolute
freedom and independence of the divine will as if this demanded that god
should be free to will eg that two plus two be five or that the
radii of a circle be unequal or that creatures be independent of himself
or that blasphemy be a virtuous act the intrinsic possibility of essences
is not dependent on the free will of god the actualization of possible
essences is but god can will to actualize only such essences as he sees
from comprehending his own divine essence to be intrinsically possible
but it derogates in no way from the supremacy of the divine will to
conceive its free volition as thus consequent on and illumined by the
divine knowledge whereas it is incompatible with the wisdom and sanctity
of god as well as inconceivable to the human mind that the necessary
laws of thought and beingsuch as the principles of contradiction and
identity the principle of causality the first principles of the moral
ordershould be what they are simply because god has freely willed them to
be so and might therefore have been otherwise
    from the fact that we have no direct intuition of the divine
    being some philosophers have concluded that all speculation on
    the relation of god to the world of our direct experience is
    necessarily barren and fruitless this is a phase of agnosticism
    and like all error it is the exaggeration of a truth the truth
    being that while we may reach real knowledge about the divine
    nature and attributes by such speculation we can do so only on
    condition that we are guided by analogies drawn from gods
    creation and remember that our concepts as applied to god are
    analogical 2
    we can know god only by analogy with contingent and finite
    beings and consequently the realities and laws of the contingent
    and finite world must necessarily serve as our term of comparison
    but among finite realities we see an essential subordination of
    the extrinsically possible to the intelligible of this to the
    intrinsically possible and of this again to the essential type
    which is presupposed by our thought therefore a pari we must
    consider the omnipotent will of god which is the first and
    universal cause of all contingent existences as under the
    direction of the divine omniscience and this in turn as having
    for its object the divine essence and in it the essential types
    whose intrinsic possibility is grounded on the necessary
    imitability of the divine being
    when therefore in defence of his position descartes argues
    that in god willing and knowing are one and the same the reason
    why he knows anything is because he wills it and for this reason
    only can it be true ex hoc ipso quod deus aliquid velit ideo
    cognoscit et ideo tantum talis res est verahe is only
    confusing the issue we might indeed retort the argument in
    god willing and knowing are one and the same the reason why he
    wills anything is because he knows it and for this reason only
    can it be good ex hoc ipso quod aliquid cognoscit ideo vult et
    ideo tantum talis res est bona but both inferences are equally
    unwarranted for though willing and knowing are certainly one and
    the same in god this one and the same thing is formally and for
    our minds neither will nor intellect but a reality transcending
    will and intellect a substance infinitely above any substances
    known to us  supersubstantia as the fathers of the
    church and the doctors of the schools call it but of this
    transcendent substance we have no intuitive knowledge we must
    therefore either abandon all attempts to find out anything about
    it or else apprehend it and designate it after the analogy of
    what we know from direct experience about created life and mind
    and as in creatures will is not identical with intellect nor
    either of these with the nature of the being that possesses them
    so what we conceive in god under the concept of will we must not
    identify in thought with what we conceive in him under the concept
    of intellect nor may we with impunity confound either in our
    thought with the nature or essence of the divine being109
c philosophers who deny the validity of all the arguments advanced by
theists in proof of the existence of a transcendent supreme being
distinct from the world of direct human experience endeavour to account
in various ways for the intrinsic possibility of abstract essences
agnostics either deny to these latter any reality whatsoever 16 or else
declare the problem of their reality insoluble monists of the materialist
typewho try to reduce all mind to matter and its mere mechanical energies
11treat the question in a still more inadequate and unsatisfactory
manner while the advocates of idealistic monism like hegel and his
followers refer us to the supposed immanent mind of the universe for an
ultimate explanation of all intrinsic possibility certainly this must
have its ultimate source in some mind and it is not in referring us to an
eternal mind that these philosophers err but in their conception of the
relation of this mind to the world of direct actual experience it is not
however with such theories we are concerned just now but only with
theories put forward by theists and among these latter it is surprising
to find some few110 who maintain that the intrinsic possibility of
abstract essences depends ultimately and exclusively on these essences
themselves irrespective of things actually experienced by the human mind
irrespective of the human mind itself and irrespective of the divine mind
and the divine nature
as to this view we have already seen 19 that if we abstract from all
human minds and from all actual things that can be directly experienced
by such minds we are face to face either with the alternative of absolute
nothingness wherein the true and the false the possible and the
impossible cease to have any intelligible meaning or else with the
alternative of a supreme eternal necessary omniscient and omnipotent
being whose actual existence has been or can be inferred from the
actual data of human experience now the theist who admits the existence
of such a being cannot fail to see that possible essences must have their
primary ideal being in the divine intellect and the ultimate source of
their intrinsic possibility in the divine essence itself for knowing
that god can actualize intrinsically possible essences by the creative
act which is intelligent and free he will understand that these essences
have their ideal being in the divine intellect that the divine intellect
sees their intrinsic possibility by contemplating the divine essence as
the uncreated prototype and exemplar of all intrinsically possible things
and that these latter are intrinsically possible precisely because they
are possible adumbrations or imitations of the divine nature
d but are we to conceive that essences are intrinsically possible
precisely because the divine intellect by understanding them makes them
intrinsically possible or should we rather conceive their intrinsic
possibility as antecedent to this act by which the divine intellect
understands them and as dependent only on the divine essence itself so
that essences would be intrinsically possible simply because the divine
essence is what it is and because they are possible imitations or
expressions of it here scholastics are not agreed
some111 hold that the intrinsic possibility of essences is formally
constituted by the act whereby the divine intellect contemplating the
divine essence understands the latter to be indefinitely imitable ad
extra so that as the actuality of things results from the fiat of the
divine will and as their extrinsic possibility is grounded in the divine
omnipotence so their intrinsic possibility is grounded in the divine
intellect the latter by understanding the divine essence would not
merely give an ideal being to the intrinsic possibility of essences but
would make those essences formally possible they being only virtually
possible in the divine essence considered antecedently to this act of the
divine intellect or rather as some scotists explain the matter112
this ideal being which possible essences have from the divine intellect is
not as extrinsic to them as the ideal being they have from the human
intellect but is rather the very first being they can be said formally
to have and is somehow intrinsic to them after the analogy of the being
which mere logical entities entia rationis derive from the human mind
which being is intrinsic to these entities and is in fact the only being
they have or can have
others113 hold that while no doubt possible essences have ideal being
in the divine intellect from the fact that they are objects of the divine
knowledge yet we must not conceive these essences as deriving their
intrinsic possibility from the divine intellect for intellect as such
presupposes its object just therefore as possible essences are not
intrinsically possible because they are understood by and have ideal
being in the human mind so neither are they intrinsically possible
because they are understood by and have ideal being in the divine mind
in order to be understood actually in order to have ideal being in order
to be objects of thought they must be intelligible and in order to be
intelligible they must be intrinsically possible therefore they are
formally constituted as intrinsically possible essences not by the fact
that they are understood by the divine intellect but by the fact that
antecedently to this act in our way of conceiving the matter for there
is really no priority of acts or attributes in god they are already
possible imitations of the divine essence itself
this view seems preferable as being more in accordance with the analogy of
what takes place in the human mind the speculative intellect in man does
not constitute but presupposes its object now while actual things are
the objects of gods practical sciencethe scientia visionis which
reaches what is freely decreed by the divine willpossible things are
the objects of gods speculative sciencethe scientia simplicis
intelligentiae which is not like the former productive of its object
but rather contemplative of objects presented to it by and in the divine
essence
why then ultimately will the notions square and circle not coalesce
so as to form one object of thought for the human mind while the notions
equilateral and triangle will so coalesce because the essence of god
the necessary being the first reality and the source of all contingent
reality affords no basis for the former as a possible expression or
imitation of itself in other words because being is not expressible by
nothingness and a square circle is nothingness while the divine
essence does afford a basis for the latter because necessary being is in
some intelligible way imitated expressed manifested by whatever has any
being to distinguish it from nothingness and an equilateral triangle
has such being and is not nothingness
it is hardly necessary to add that when we conceive the divine essence
contemplated by the divine intellect as containing in itself the
exemplars or prototypes of all possible things we are not to understand
the divine essence as the formal exemplar of each or a fortiori as
a vast collection of such formally distinct exemplars but only as
virtually and equivalently the exemplar of each and all we are not to
conceive that possible essences are seen by the divine intellect imaged in
the divine essence as in a mirror but rather as in their supreme
source and principle so that they are faint and far off reflections of
it and when actualized become for us the only means we have in this
present state for reaching any knowledge of the deity videmus nunc per
speculum114
21 distinction between essence and existence in actually existing
contingent or created beingspassing now from the consideration of
possible essences as such to the consideration of actually existing
essences we have to examine a question which has given rise to a great
deal of controversy partly on account of its inherent difficulty and
partly because of a multitude of ambiguities arising from confusion of
thought what is the nature of the distinction between essence and
existence in the actually existing things of our experience
we have seen already that the concepts of essence and existence are
distinct from each other 12 13 in other words that in all cases there
is at least a logical distinction between the essence and the existence
of any being we must however distinguish between created or contingent
beings and the uncreated necessary selfexistent being the latter
exists essentially eternally by his own essence so that in him
essence and existence are really identical his essence is formally
his existence and therefore in thinking of his essence we cannot
positively exclude the notion of existence or think of him as
nonexistent the distinction between essence and existence which we find
in our thoughts is therefore when applied to god a purely logical
distinction due solely to our finite human mode of thinking and having
no ground or basis or reason in the reality which is the object of our
thought on this there is complete unanimity among scholastic
philosophers
but while we conceive that god actually exists by that whereby he is god
by his essence itself we do not conceive that any created or contingent
being exists by that whereby it is what it is by its essence we do not
for example regard the essence of socrates whether specific or
individual that whereby he is a man or that whereby he is this man
socrates as that whereby he actually exists in other words the essence
of the existing socrates being a contingent essence does not necessarily
demand or imply that it actually exist our concept of such an essence
does not include the note of actual existence therefore if we find such
an essence actually existing we consider this actually existing essence as
caused or produced and conserved in existence by some other being
viz by the necessary being so that if it were not so created and
conserved it would be a pure possibility and nothing actual115 the same
difference between the necessary being and contingent beings will be seen
from considering their existence the abstract concept of existence is
rendered definite and determinate by the essence which it actualizes now
every finite essence is of some particular kind and its existence is
rendered determinate by the fact that it is the existence of a definite
kind of essence the existence of a contingent being we conceive as the
actuality of its essence and its essence as a definite potentiality of
existence thus if we conceive existence as a perfection it is restricted
by the finite nature of the potentiality which it actualizes but the
existence of the necessary being is the plenitude of actuality an
existence not restricted by being the existence of any essence that is
determinate because finite but of an essence that is determinate by being
above all genera and species by being infinite by being itself pure
actuality in no sense potential but perfectly and formally identical with
actual existence while therefore the essence of the necessary being is
a necessarily existing essence that of a contingent being is not
necessarily existent but is conceived as a potentiality which has been
de facto actualized or made existent by the necessary being and which
may again cease to be actually existent116 on this too there is
unanimity among scholastic philosophers
we distinguish mentally or logically between the essence of an actually
existing contingent being and its existence considering the former as the
potential principle in relation to the latter as the actualizing
principle of the contingent existing reality but is the distinction
between such an essence and its existence something more than a logical
distinction is it a real distinction this is the question in dispute
and in order to avoid misunderstanding we must be clear on these two
points firstly of what essence and existence is there question and
secondly what exactly are we to understand by a real distinction in this
matter
22 state of the questionin the first place there is no question here
of the relation of a possible essence as such to existence the possible
essence of a contingent being as such has no reality outside the divine
essence intellect will and omnipotence before the world was created
the possible essences of all the beings that constitute it were certainly
really distinct from the actual existence of these beings which do
constitute the created universe on this point there can be no difference
of opinion to contend that it is on the eternal reality of the possible
essence that actual existence supervenes when a contingent being begins
to exist would be equivalent to contending that it is the divine essence
that becomes actual in the phenomena of our experience which is the error
of pantheism
again before a contingent thing comes into actual existence it may be
virtually and potentially in the active powers and passive potentialities
of other actually existing contingent things as the oak for instance is
in the passive potentiality of the acorn and in the active powers of the
natural agencies whereby it is evolved from the acorn or the statue in
the block of marble and in the mind and artistic power of the sculptor
but neither is there any question here of the relation of such potential
being or essence as a thing has in its causes to the actual existence of
this thing when actually produced whatever being or essence it has in its
active and passive causes is certainly really distinct from the existence
which the thing has when it has been actually produced nor is there any
doubt or dispute about this point at the same time much controversy is
due to misunderstandings arising from a confusion of thought which fails
to distinguish between the essence as purely possible the essence as
virtually or potentially in its causes and the essence as actually
existing it is about the distinction between the latter and its existence
that the whole question is raised and it must be borne in mind that this
essence whether it is really distinct from its existence or not is
itself a positive reality from the moment it is created or produced the
question is whether the creative or productive actwhereby this essence is
placed outside its causes and is now no longer merely possible or
merely virtual or potential in its causes but something real in
itselfhas for its term one reality or two realities viz the
essence as real subjective potentiality of existence and the existential
act or perfection whereby it is constituted actually existent117
the question is exclusively concerned with the essence which began to
exist when the contingent being came into actual existence and which
ceases to exist when or if this being again passes out of actual
existence and the question is whether this essence which actually exists
is really distinct from the existence whereby it actually exists finally
the question concerns the essence and existence of any and every actual
contingent reality whether such reality be a substance or an accident of
course it is primarily concerned with the essence and existence of
substances but it also applies to the essence and existence of accidents
in so far as these latter will be found to be really distinct from the
substances in which they inhere and to have reality proper to themselves
23 the theory of distinctions in its application to the questionin the
next place what are we to understand by a real distinction in this
matter ambiguity and obscurity of thought in regard to the theory of
distinctions and in regard to the application of the theory to the
present question has been probably the most fertile source of much
tedious and fruitless controversy in this connexion
anticipating what will be considered more fully at a later stage 30 we
must note here the two main classes of distinction which by reflecting on
our thoughtprocesses we discover between the objects of our thought the
real distinction is that which exists in things independently of the
consideration of our minds that which is discovered but not made by the
mind that which is given to us in and with the data of our experience
for example the act of thinking is a reality other than and therefore
really distinct from the mind that thinks for the mind persists after
the act of thinking has passed away
opposed to this is the mental or logical distinction which is the
distinction made by the mind itself between two different concepts of one
and the same reality which is not in the reality independently of our
thought but is introduced into it by our thought regarding the same
reality under different aspects or from different points of view the mind
never makes such a distinction without some ground or reason for doing so
sometimes however this reason will be found exclusively in the mind
itselfin the limitations of its modes of thoughtand not in the reality
which is the matter or object of the thought the distinction is then said
to be purely logical or mental such distinctions are entia rationis
logical entities an example would be the distinction between the concept
man and the concept rational animal or in general between any
definable object of thought and its definition the distinction
therefore between the essence and the existence of the necessary being is
a purely logical distinction for in a definition it is the essence of the
thing we define and existence is of the essence or definition of the
necessary being
sometimes again the reason for making a mental distinction will be found
in the reality itself what is one and the same reality presents different
aspects to the mind and evokes different concepts of itself in the mind
though really one it is virtually manifold and the distinction between
the concepts of these various aspects is commonly known as a virtual
distinction for example when we think of any individual man as a
rational animal though our concept of animal nature is distinct from
that of rational nature we do not regard these in him as two realities
coexisting or combining to form his human nature but only as two
distinct aspects under which we view the one reality which is his human
nature and we view it under these two aspects because we have actual
experience of instances in which animal nature is really distinct and
separated from rationality eg in the brute beast or again since
we can recognize three grades of life in manvegetative sentient and
rationalwe conceive the one principle of life his soul as virtually
three principles and so we distinguish mentally or virtually between
three souls in man although in reality there is only one or once more
when we think of the wisdom the will and the omnipotence of god we know
that although these concepts represent different aspects of the deity
these aspects are not distinct realities in him but that because of his
infinite perfection and infinite simplicity they are all objectively one
and the same selfidentical reality
a virtual distinction is said to be imperfect thus approaching nearer
to the nature of a purely logical distinction when each of the concepts
whereby we apprehend the same reality only prescinds explicitly from
what is expressed by the other although one of them is found on analysis
to include implicitly what is expressed by the other such is the
distinction between the being and the life of any living thing or the
distinction between the spirituality and the immortality of the human
soul or the distinction between infinite wisdom and infinite power
the distinction between the divine attributes in general a virtual
distinction is said to be perfect thus approaching nearer to the nature
of a real distinction when neither of the concepts includes either
explicitly or implicitly what is expressed by the other such for
instance is the distinction between the principle of intellectual life
and the principle of animal or sentient life in man for not only can
these exist separately the former without the latter eg in pure
spirits the latter without the former eg in brute beasts but also
it will be found that by no analysis does either concept in any way
involve the other118
our only object in setting down the various examples just given is to
illustrate the general scholastic teaching on the doctrine of distinction
in themselves they are not beyond dispute for the general doctrine of
distinction is not easy of application in detail but they will be
sufficient for our present purpose probably the greatest difficulty in
applying the general doctrine will be found to lie in discriminating
between virtual distinctionsespecially perfect virtual distinctionsand
real distinctions119 and this difficulty will be appreciated still more
when we learn that a real distinction does not necessarily involve
separability of the objects so distinguished in other words there may
be in a composite existing individual being constitutive factors or
principles or integral parts each of which is a positive real entity
really distinct from the others and yet incapable of existing separately
or in isolation from the others separability says mercier120 is
one of the signs of a real distinction but it is neither essential to
nor a necessary property of the latter two separable things are of course
really distinct from each other but two entities may be really distinct
from each other without being separable or capable of existing apart from
each other thus we believe that the intellect and the will in man are
really distinct from each other and both alike from the substance of the
human soul yet they cannot exist isolated from the soul therefore even
though the objects which we apprehend as distinct by means of distinct
concepts be understood to be such that they cannot actually exist in
isolation from each other but only as united in a composite individual
being still if it can be shown that each of them has its own proper
reality independently of our thought so that the distinction between them
is not the result of our thought or introduced by our thought into the
individual thing or being which we are considering then the distinction
must be regarded as real if on the other hand it can be shown that the
different aspects which we apprehend in any datum by means of distinct
concepts have not apart from the consideration of the mind apart from
the analytic activity of our own thought each its own proper reality but
are only distinct mental views of what is objectively one and the same
reality then the distinction must be regarded as logical not realand
this even although there may be in the richness and fulness of that one
reality comparatively to the limited capacity of our minds as well as in
the very constitution and modes of thought of our minds themselves a
reason or basis for and an explanation of the multiplicity of concepts
whereby we attain to an understanding of some one reality
24 solutions of the questionpostponing further consideration of the
serious problems on the validity of knowledge and its relation to reality
to which those reflections inevitably give rise let us now return to the
main question the nature of the distinction between the essence and the
existence of any actually existing contingent being we need not be
surprised to find that the greatest minds have been unable to reach the
same solution of this question for it is but a phase of the more general
metaphysical problemat once both ontological and epistemologicalof the
nature of reality and the relation of the human mind thereto nor will any
serious modern philosopher who is at all mindful of the wealth of current
controversial literature on this very problem or of the endless variety
of conflicting opinions among contemporary thinkers in regard to it be
disposed to ridicule the medieval controversies on the doctrine of
distinction as applied to essence and existence no doubt there has been a
good deal of mere verbal and perhaps trifling argumentation on the
matter it lends itself to the dialectical skill of the controversialist
who takes sides as well as to the serious thought of the openminded
investigator it is not however through drawing different conclusions
from the same premisses that conflicting solutions of the question have
been reached but rather through fundamentally different attitudes in
regard to the premisses themselves which different philosophers profess to
find in the common data of their experience when we have once grasped
what philosophers mean by a logical or a real distinction as applied to
the relation between essence and existence we shall not get any very
material assistance towards the choice of a solution by considering at
length the arguments adduced on either side121
those who believe there is a real distinction122 between the essence and
the existence of all actually existing contingent beings mean by this that
the real essence which comes into actual existence by creation or by the
action of created causes is a reality distinct from the existence whereby
it actually exists the actually existing essence is the total term of the
creative or productive act but what we apprehend in it under the concept
of essence is really distinct from what we apprehend in it under the
concept of existence the existence being a real principle which
actualizes the essence and this latter being itself another real
principle which is in itself a positive subjective potentiality of
existence123 neither of course can actually exist without the other
no actual existence except that of a real essence no existing essence
except by reason of the existence which makes it actual but these two
real principles of existing contingent being inseparable as they are and
correlative are nevertheless distinct realitiesdistinct in the objective
order and independently of our thoughtand form by their union a really
composite product the existing thing
    we might attempt to illustrate this by the analogy of a body and
    its shape or colour the body itself is really distinct from its
    actual shape and colour it may lose them and yet remain the same
    body and it may acquire other shapes and colours at any time the
    body has actually some particular shape and colour but that by
    which it is formally so shaped and coloured is something really
    different from the body itself furthermore before the body
    actually possessed this particular shape and colour these were
    in it potentially that is to say there were then in the body
    the real passive subjective potentialities of this particular
    shape and colour so too that by which a real contingent
    essence actually exists ie the existential act existence
    is really distinct from that which actually exists ie the
    essence the potentiality of that existential act the analogy
    is however at best only a halting one for while it is
    comparatively easy to understand how the passive subjective
    potentiality of a shape or colour can be something real in the
    already actually existing body it is not so easy to understand
    how the potentiality of existence ie the real essence can
    be anything that is itself real and really distinct from the
    existence124 the oak is really in the acorn for the passive
    subjective potentiality of the oak is in the actual acorn but is
    this potentiality anything really distinct from the acorn or
    should we not rather say that the actual acorn is potentially
    the oak or is the potentiality of the oak at all events even
    if it is really distinct from the actual acorn it is in the
    actual acorn but is it possible to conceive a real subjective
    potentiality which does not reside in anything actual125 now
    if the real essence is really distinct from its existence it must
    be conceived as a real subjective potentiality of existence
    yet it cannot be conceived as a potentiality in anything actual
    except indeed in the actually existing essence which is the
    composite result of its union with the existential act it is not
    a real subjective potentiality antecedently to the existential
    act and on which the latter is as it were superimposed126 in
    itself it is in fact nothing real except as actualized by the
    latter but as we have already observed the process of
    actualization whether by direct creation or by the action of
    created causes must be conceived as having for its total term or
    effect a composite reality resulting from what we can at best
    imperfectly describe as the union of two correlative concreated
    or coproduced principles of being a potential and an actual
    really distinct from each other that whereby the thing can
    exist the potentiality of existence the essence and that
    whereby the thing does exist the actuality of essence the
    existence the description is imperfect because these principles
    are not concreated or coproduced separately but rather the
    creation or production of an existing essence the efficiency by
    which it is placed outside its causes has one single though
    composite term the actually existing thing
this view thus advocating a real distinction between essence and
existence may obviously be regarded as an emphatic expression of the
objective validity of intellectual knowledge it might be regarded as an
application of the more general view that the objective concepts between
which the intellect distinguishes in its interpretation of reality should
be regarded as representing distinct realities except when the
distinction is seen to arise not from the nature of the object but from
the nature of the subject from the limitations and imperfections of our
own modes of thought but in the case of any particular disputed
distinction the onus probandi should lie rather on the side of those
who contend that such distinction is logical and not real on the other
hand many philosophers who are no less firmly convinced of the objective
validity of intellectual knowledge observe that it is possible to push
this principle too far or rather to err by excess in its application
instead of placing the burden of proof solely on the side of the logical
distinction they would place it rather more on the side of the real
distinctionin conformity with the maxim of method entia non sunt
multiplicanda praeter necessitatem and they think that it is an error by
excess to hold the distinction between essence and existence to be real
this brings us to the second alternative opinion that the distinction in
question is not real but only virtual127
according to this view the essence and the existence of any existing
contingent being are one and the same reality there is however in this
reality a basis for the two distinct objective conceptsof essence and of
existencewhereby we apprehend it for the contingent being does not exist
necessarily we see such beings coming into existence and ceasing to
exist we can therefore think of what they are without thinking of them
as actually existent in other words we can think of them as possible
and of their existence as that by which they become actual this is a
sufficient reason for distinguishing mentally in the existing being the
essence which exists and the existence by which it exists128 but when
we think of the essence of an actually existing being as objectively
possible or as potential in its causes we are no longer thinking of it
as anything real in itself but only of its ideal being as an object of
thought in our minds or of the ideal being it has in the divine mind or
of the potential being it has in created causes or of the virtual being
it has in the divine omnipotence or of the ultimate basis of its
possibility in the divine essence but all these modes of being we know
to be really distinct from the real contingent essence itself which
begins to exist actually in time and may cease once more to exist in time
when and if its own nature demands and god wills such cessation but
that the real contingent essence itself which so exists is something
really distinct from the existence whereby it exists that it forms with
the latter a really composite being that it is in itself a real
subjective potentiality receptive of existence as another and actualizing
reality really distinct from it so that the creation or production of
any single actually existing contingent being would have for its term two
really distinct principles of being a potential and an actual essence
and existence created or produced per modum unius so to speak for
asserting all this it is contended by supporters of the virtual
distinction that we have no sufficient justifying reason129 hence they
conclude that a real distinction must be denied entia non sunt
multiplicanda praeter necessitatem
    though each of these opinions has been defended with a great deal
    of ability and an exhaustive array of arguments a mere rehearsal
    of these latter would not give much material assistance towards a
    solution of the question we therefore abstain from repeating them
    here there are only a few points in connexion with them to which
    attention may be directed
    in the first place some defenders of the real distinction urge
    that were the distinction not real things would exist
    essentially ie necessarily and thus the most fundamental
    ground of distinction between god and creatures between the
    necessary being and contingent beings would be destroyed
    creatures would be no longer in their very constitution composite
    mixtures of potentiality and actuality but would be purely
    actual absolutely simple and in a word identical with the
    infinite being himself supporters of the virtual distinction deny
    that those very serious consequences follow from their view they
    point out that though the existence of the creature is really
    identical with its essence the essence does not exist necessarily
    or a se the whole existing essence is ab alio is caused
    contingent and the fundamental distinction between such a being
    and the selfexisting being is in this view perfectly clear nor
    is the creature they contend purely actual and absolutely
    simple it need not have existed and it may cease to exist it
    has therefore a potentiality of nonexistence which is
    inconceivable in the case of the necessary and purely actual
    being it is therefore mutable as regards existence besides
    which the essences even of the most simple created beings namely
    pure spirits are composite in the sense that they have faculties
    and operations really distinct from their substance
    secondly it is alleged by some defenders of the real distinction
    that this latter view of the nature of existing contingent reality
    is a cardinal doctrine in the whole philosophical system of st
    thomas and of scholastics generally so fundamental in fact
    that many important doctrines unanimously held to be true by all
    scholastics cannot be successfully vindicated apart from it130
    to which it is replied that there are no important truths of
    scholastic philosophy which cannot be defended quite adequately
    apart altogether from the view one may hold on the present
    question and that this being the case it is unwise to endeavour
    to base admittedly true doctrines which can be better defended
    otherwise upon an opinion which can at best claim only the amount
    of probability it can derive from the intrinsic merits of the
    arguments by which it is itself supported131
    before passing from this whole question we must note the existence
    of a third school of thought identified mainly with the followers
    of duns scotus132 these authors contend that the distinction
    between essence and existence is not a real distinction nor yet
    on the other hand is it merely a virtual distinction but one
    which they call formalis actualis ex natura rei that between a
    reality and its intrinsic modes it is better known as the
    scotistic distinction we shall see the nature of it when
    dealing ex professo with the general doctrine of distinctions
    the multiplicity of these views and the unavoidable difficulty
    experienced in grasping and setting forth their meaning with any
    tolerable degree of clearness would suggest the reflection that
    in those controversies the medieval scholastics were perhaps
    endeavouring to think and to express what reality is apart from
    thought and independently of the consideration of the minda
    task which conceived in these terms must appear fruitless and
    one which anyhow involves in its very nature the closest
    scrutiny of the epistemological problem of the power of the human
    mind to get at least a true and valid if not adequate and
    comprehensive insight into the nature of reality
chapter iv reality as one and manifold
25 the transcendental attributes or properties of being unity truth
and goodnessso far we have analysed the notions of real being of
becoming or change of being as possible and as actual of essence and
existence before approaching a study of the categories or suprema genera
entis the highest and widest modes in which reality manifests itself we
have next to consider certain attributes or properties of being which
reveal themselves as coextensive with reality itself taking human
experience in its widest sense as embracing all modes that are cognitive
or allied with consciousness as including intellect memory imagination
sense perception will and appetite as speculative ethical or moral and
esthetic or artisticwe find that the reality which makes up this complex
human experience of ours is universally and necessarily characterized by
certain features which we call the transcendental attributes or
properties of being inasmuch as they transcend all specific and generic
modes of being pervade all its categories equally and are inseparable
from any datum of experience we shall see that they are not really
distinct from the reality which they characterize but only logically
distinct from it being aspects under which we apprehend it negations or
other logical relations which we necessarily annex to it by the mental
processes whereby we seek to render it actually intelligible to our minds
the first in order of these ontological attributes is unity the concept
of that whereby reality considered in itself becomes a definite object of
thought the second in order is truth which is the conception of
reality considered in its relation to cognitive experience to intellect
the third is goodness the aspect under which reality is related as an
object to appetitive experience to will
now when we predicate of any reality under our consideration that it is
one or good or truein the ontological sense to be explainedthat
which we predicate is not a mere ens rationis but something real
something which is really identical with the subject and which is
distinguished from the latter in our judgment only by a logical
distinction the attribution of any of these properties to the subject
does not however add anything real to the latter it adds merely some
logical aspect involved in or supposed by the attribution at the same
time this logical aspect gives us real information by making explicit
some real feature of being not explicitly revealed in the concept of being
itself although involved in and following as a property from the
latter
there do not seem to be any other transcendental properties of being
besides the three enumerated the terms reality thing something
are synonymous expressions of the concept of being itself rather than of
properties of being existence is not a transcendental attribute of
being for it is not coextensive with reality or real being and although
reality must be either possible or actual either necessary
or contingent either infinite or finite etc this necessity of
verifying in itself one or other member of any such alternatives is not a
property of being but rather something essentially rooted in the very
concept of reality itself some would regard as a distinct transcendental
attribute of being the conception of the latter as an object of esthetic
contemplation as manifesting order and harmony as beautiful this
conception of being will be found however to flow from the more
fundamental aspects of reality considered as true and as good rather
than directly from the concept of being itself
26 transcendental unitywhen we think of anything as one we think of it
as undivided in itself the unity or oneness of being is the undividedness
of being unum est id quod est indivisum in se universaliter quaecunque
non habent divisionem inquantum non habent sic unum dicuntur133
when therefore we conceive being as undivided into constitutive parts
and unmultiplied into repetitions of itself we conceive it as a being
as one for the concept of being formally as one it does not seem
necessary that we conceive being as divided or distinct from all other
being this second negation of identity with other being rather follows
the conception of being as one being is distinct from other being because
it is already itself one it is a prior negation that formally constitutes
its unity namely the negation of internal division or multiplication of
itself god was truly one from all eternity before there was any
other being any created being distinct from him the division or
distinction of an object of thought from whatever is not itself is what
constitutes the notion of otherness134
it is manifest that being and unity are really identical that when we
think of being we think of what is really undivided in itself that once
we introduce dividedness into the object of our concept we are no longer
thinking of being but of beings ie of a multitude or plurality each
member of which is a being and one for being as an object of
thought is either simple or composite if simple it is not only
undivided but indivisible if composite we cannot think of it as a
being capable of existing so long as we think its parts as separate or
divided only when we think of them as actually united and undivided have
we the concept of a being and eo ipso we have the concept of being as
one as a unity135
hence the scholastic formul ens et unum convertuntur and omne ens
est unum the truth embodied in these is so selfevident that the
expression of it may seem superfluous but they are not mere tautologies
and in the interests of clear and consistent thinking our attention may be
profitably directed to them the same remark applies to much in the
present and subsequent chapters on the transcendental attributes of being
27 kinds of unitya the unity we have been describing has been
called transcendental to distinguish it from predicamental unitythe
unity which is proper to a special category of being namely quantity
and which accordingly is also called quantitative or mathematical
unity while the former is common to all being with which it is really
identical and to which it adds nothing real the latter belongs and is
applicable properly speaking only to the mode of being which is
corporeal which exists only as affected by quantity as occupying space
as capable of measurement and therefore also this latter unity adds
something real to the being which it affects namely the attribute of
quantity of which unity is the measure and the generating principle136
for quantity as we shall see is a mode of being really distinct from the
corporeal substance which it affects the quantity has its own
transcendental unity so has the substance which it quantifies so has the
composite whole the quantified body but this latter transcendental
unity like the composite being with which it is identical is not a unum
per se but only a unum per accidens cf b infra
we derive our notion of quantitative or mathematical unity which is the
principle of counting and the standard of measuring from dividing
mentally the continuous quantity or magnitude which is one of the
immediate data of sense experience now the distinction between this unit
and transcendental unity supposes not merely that quantity is really
distinct from the corporeal substance but also that the human mind is
capable of conceiving as real certain modes of being other than the
corporeal modes to which quantitative concepts and processes such as
counting and measuring are not properly applicable as they are to
corporeal reality but only in an analogical or transferred sense 2
the notion of transcendental unity therefore bears the same relation to
that of quantitative unity as the notion of being in general bears to
that of quantified or corporeal being
b transcendental unity may be either essential or substantial
unum per se unum simpliciter or accidental unum per
accidens unum secundum quid the former characterizes a being
which has nothing in it beyond what is essential to it as such eg the
unity of any substance and this unity is twofold1 unity of
simplicity and 2 unity of compositionaccording as the substance is
essentially simple such as the human soul or a pure spirit or
essentially composite such as man or any corporeal substance since
every such substance is composed essentially of a formative and an
indeterminate principle137
accidental unity is the unity of a being whose constituent factors or
contents are not really united in such a way as to form one essence
whether simple or composite it is threefold 1 collective unity or
unity of aggregation as of a heap of stones or a crowd of men 2
artificial unity as of a house or a picture and 3 natural or
physical unity as of any existing substance with its connatural
accidents eg a living organism with its size shape qualities etc
or the human soul with its faculties138
c transcendental unity may be either individual singular numerical
concrete real or universal specific generic abstract logical the
former is that which characterizes being or reality considered as actually
existing or as proximately capable of existing the unity of an
individual nature or essence the unity whereby a being is not merely
undivided in itself but incapable of repetition or multiplication of
itself it is only the individual as such that can actually exist the
abstract and universal is incapable of actually existing as such we shall
examine presently what it is that individuates reality and what it is
that renders it capable of existing actually in the form of things or of
personsthe forms in which it actually presents itself in our
experience
abstract or universal unity is the unity which characterizes a reality
conceived as an abstract universal object by the human intellect the
object of a specific or generic concept man or animal for example
is one in this sense undivided in itself but capable of indefinite
multiplication or repetition in the only mode in which it can actually
existthe individual mode the universal is unum aptum inesse pluribus
finally we can conceive any nature or essence without considering it in
either of its alternative stateseither as individual or as universal
thus conceived it is characterized by a unity which has been commonly
designated as abstract or by scotists as formal unity
28 multitude and numberthe one has for its correlative the
manifold units one of which is not the other constitute multitude or
plurality if unity is the negation of actual division in being multitude
results from a second negation that namely by which the undivided being
or unit is marked off or divided from other units139 we have defined
unity by the negation of actual intrinsic dividedness and we have seen
it to be compatible with extrinsic dividedness or otherness thus the
vague notion of dividedness is anterior to that of unity now multitude
involves dividedness but it also involves and presupposes the intrinsic
undividedness or unity of each constituent of the manifold in the real
order of things the one is prior to all dividedness but on account of
the sensuous origin of our concepts we can define the former only by
exclusion of the latter the order in which we obtain these ideas seems
therefore to be as follows first being then dividedness next
unity which excludes dividedness and finally multitude which consists
of units140
the relation of the one to the manifold is that of undivided being to
divided being the same reality cannot be one and manifold under the same
aspect though obviously a being may be actually one and potentially
manifold or vice versa or one under a certain aspect and manifold under
another aspect
from the transcendental plurality or multitude which we have just
described we can distinguish predicamental or quantitative plurality
a distinction which is to be understood in the same way as when applied to
unity quantitative multitude is the actually separated or divided
condition of quantified being number is a multitude measured or counted
by unity it is a counted and therefore necessarily a definite and
finite multitude now it is mathematical unity that is properly the
principle of number and the standard or measure of all counting and
therefore it is only to realities which fall within the category of
quantityin other words to material beingthat the concept of number is
properly applicable no doubt we can and do conceive transcendental unity
after the analogy of the quantitative unity which is the principle of
counting and measuring and no doubt we can use the transcendental concept
of actually undivided being as a principle of enumeration and so
count or enumerate spiritual beings but this counting is only
analogical and many philosophers following aristotle and st thomas
hold that the concepts of numerical multiplicity and numerical
distinction are not properly applicable to immaterial beings that these
latter differ individually from one another not numerically but each by
its whole nature or essence that is formally141
29 the individual and the universalwe have distinguished transcendental
unity into individual and universal 27 c reality as endowed with
universal unity is reality as apprehended by abstract thought to be
capable of indefinite repetition or multiplication of itself in actual
existence reality as endowed with individual unity is reality apprehended
as actually existing or as proximately capable of actually existing and
as therefore incapable of any repetition or multiplication of itself of
any division of itself into other selves or communication of itself to
other selves while therefore the universal has its reality only in
the individuals to which it communicates itself and which thus embody it
the individual has its reality in itself and of its own right so to
speak when it actually exists it is sui juris and as such
incommunicable incommunicabilis the actually existing individual is
called in latin a supposituma term which we shall render by the
english thing or individual thing it was called by aristotle the
  substantia prima first substance or first essence to
distinguish it from the substance or essence conceived by abstract thought
as universal the latter being designated as   substantia
secunda second substance or second essence
now it is a fundamental assumption in aristotelian and scholastic
philosophy that whatever actually exists or whatever is real in the sense
that as such it is proximately capable of actual existence is and must be
individual that the universal as such is not real ie as such cannot
actually exist and the manifest reason for this assumption is that
whatever actually exists must be with entire definiteness and
determinateness its own self and nothing else it cannot be capable of
division or repetition of itself of that which it really is into other
realities which would still be that individual thing but reality
considered as universal is capable of such repetition of itself
indefinitely therefore reality cannot actually exist as universal but
only as individual
    this is merely plain common sense nor does the idealistic monism
    which appears to attribute reality to the universal as such and
    which interprets reality exclusively according to the forms in
    which it presents itself to abstract thought really run counter
    to this consideration for what it really holds is not that
    universals as such are real but that they are phases of the
    allone reality which is itself one individual being
    but many modern philosophers hold that individuality no less than
    universality is a form of thought no doubt individuality in
    the abstract is no less than universality an object abstracted
    from the data of experience by the minds analysis of the latter
    but this is not what those philosophers mean they mean that the
    individual as such is not a real datum of experience from the
    kantian view that individuality is a purely mental form with which
    the mind invests the datum they draw the subjectivist conclusion
    that the world thus interpreted as consisting of individuals
    is a phenomenal or mental product for the objective validity of
    which there can be to mans speculative reason no sufficient
    guarantee
    to this theory we oppose that of aristotle and the scholastics
    not merely that the individual alone is actually existent but
    that as actually existent and as individual it is actually given
    to us and apprehended by us in internal and external sense
    experience and that although in the inorganic world and to some
    extent in the lower forms of life we may not be able to determine
    for certain what portions of this experience are distinct
    individuals still in the world of living things generally and
    especially of the animal kingdom there can be no difficulty in
    determining this for the simple reason that here reality is given
    to us in sense experience as consisting of distinct individuals
at the same time it is true that we can understand these individual
realities interpret them read the meaning of them only by the
intellectual function of judgment ie by the analytic and synthetic
activity whereby we abstract and universalize certain aspects of them and
use these aspects as predicates of the individuals now seeing that
intellectual thought as distinct from sense experience apprehends its
objects only as abstract and potentially universal only as static
selfidentical possible essences and nevertheless predicates these of
the concrete individual contingent actually existing things of sense
experience identifying them with the latter in affirmative judgments
seeing moreover thatsince the intellectual knowledge we thus acquire
about the data of sense experience is genuine and not chimericalthose
objects of abstract thought must be likewise real and must be really in
those individual sense data according to the theory of knowledge which
finds its expression in moderate realismthere arises immediately the
problem or rather the group of problems regarding the relations between
reality as revealed to intellect ie as abstract and universal and
reality as revealed to sense ie as concrete and individual in other
words we have to inquire how we are to interpret intellectually the fact
that reality which as a possible essence is universal for abstract
thought is nevertheless as actually existing individualized for
senseand consequently for intellect reflecting on the data of sense142
30 the metaphysical grades of being in the individualwhat then is
the relation between all that intellect can apprehend in the individual
viz its lowest class essence or specific nature and its whole nature
as an individual its essentia atoma or individual nature we can best
approach this problem by considering first these various abstract
thoughtobjects which intellect can apprehend in the individual
what are called the metaphysical grades of being those positive moments
of perfection or reality which the mind detects in the individual as for
instance substantiality materiality organic life animality
rationality individuality in the individual manwhether we describe them
as phases or aspects or formalities of beingare undoubtedly
distinct objects for abstract thought why does it thus distinguish
between them and express them by distinct concepts even when it finds
them embodied in a single individual because reflecting on the manner in
which reality presents itself through sense experience as actually
existing it finds resemblances and differences between individually
distinct data it finds in some of them grades of reality which it does
not find in others individual specific and generic grades and
sometranscendentalgrades common to all now between these various grades
of being as found in one and the same individual it cannot be denied that
there exists a logical distinction with a foundation or ground for it in
the individual reality because the latter being more or less similar
to other individual realities causes the mind to apprehend it by a number
of distinct concepts the individuality whereby it differs really from all
other individuals of the same species the specific differential and
generic grades of being whereby it is conceptually identified with wider
and wider classes of things and the transcendental grades whereby it is
conceptually identified with all others the similarity of really
distinct individuals which is the conceptual identity of their
qualities is the ground on which we conceptually identify their
essences now is there any reason for thinking that these grounds of
similarity as found in the individual are really distinct from one
another in the latter they are certainly conceptually distinct
expressionseach less inadequate than the wider onesof what is really one
individual essence but we must take them to be all really identical in
and with this individual essence unless we are prepared to hold
conceptual plurality as such to be real plurality in which case we should
also hold conceptual unity as such to be real unity but this latter view
is precisely the error of extreme realism of reifying abstract concepts
and holding the universale a parte rei a theory which leads logically
to monism143
31 individualitythe distinction therefore between these grades of
being in the individual is a virtual distinction ie a logical
distinction with a ground for it in the reality this is the sort of
distinction which exists between the specific nature of the individual
ie what is contained in the definition of the lowest class to which it
belongs and its individuality ie what constitutes its nature or
essence as an individual no doubt the concrete existing individual
contains besides its individual nature or essence a variety of
accidental characteristics which serve as marks or signs whereby its
individuality is revealed to us these are called individualizing
characteristics notae individuantes the familiar scholastic list of
them being forma figura locus tempus stirps patria
nomen with manifest reference to the individual man but though
these characteristics enable us to mark off the individual in space and
time from other individuals of the same class thus revealing
individuality to us in the concrete it cannot be held that they
constitute the individuality of the nature or substance in each case if
the human substance essence or nature as found in socrates were held
to differ from the human substance essence or nature as found in plato
only by the fact that in each it is affected by a different set of
accidents ie of modes accidental to the substance as found in each
then it would follow that this substance is not merely conceptually
identical in both but that it is really identical in both which is the
error of extreme realism as a matter of fact it is the converse that is
true the sets of accidents are distinct because they affect individual
substances already really and individually distinct
it is manifest that the accidents which are separable from the
individual substance eg name shape size appearance location
etc cannot constitute its individuality there are however other
characteristics which are inseparable from the individual substance or
which are properties of the latter eg the fact that an individual
man was born of certain parents perhaps it is such characteristics that
give its individuality to the individual substance144 to think so would
be to misunderstand the question under discussion we are not now
inquiring into the extrinsic causes whereby actually existing reality is
individuated into the efficient principles of its individuation but
into the formal and intrinsic principle of the latter there must
obviously be something intrinsic to the individual reality itself whereby
it is individuated and it is about this intrinsic something we are
inquiring the individual man is this individual human nature is thus
individuated in him by something that is essential to human nature as
found in him this something has been calledafter the analogy of the
differentia specifica which differentiates species within a genusthe
differentia individua of the individual it has also been called by some
the differentia numerica and by scotists the haecceitas however we
are to conceive this something it is certain at all events that
considered as it is really found in the individual it cannot be anything
really distinct from the specific nature of the latter no doubt the
differentia specifica considered in the abstract it is not essential
and intrinsic to the natura generica considered in the abstract it is
extrinsic and accidental to the abstract content of the latter notion but
this is because we are conceiving these grades of being in the abstract
the same is true of the differentia individua as compared with the
natura specifica in the abstract but we are now considering these
grades of reality as they are actually in the concrete individual being
and as they are found here we have seen that a real distinction between
them is inadmissible
32 the principle of individuationhow then are we to conceive this
something which individuates reality it may be well to point out that for
the erroneous doctrine of extreme realism which issues in monism the
problem of individuation as here understood does not arise for the
monist all plurality in being is merely apparent not real there can be
no question of a real distinction between individual and individual145
similarly the nominalist and the conceptualist evade the problem for
these the individual alone is not merely formally real it alone is
fundamentally real the universal is not even fundamentally real has no
foundation in reality and thus all scientific knowledge of reality as
revealed in sense experience is rendered impossible but for the moderate
realist while the individual alone is formally real the universal is
fundamentally real and hence the problem arises it may be forcibly
stated in the form of a paradox that whereby socrates and plato are
really distinct from each other as individuals is really identical with
the human nature which is really in both but what individuates human
nature in socrates or in plato is logically distinct from the human
nature that is really in socrates and really in plato we have only to
inquire therefore whether the intrinsic principle of individuation is to
be conceived merely as a negation as something negative added by the mind
to the concept of the specific nature whereby the latter is apprehended
as incapable of multiplication into others each of which would be
formally that same nature or in other words as incommunicable or is
the intrinsic ground of this incommunicability to be conceived as
something positive not indeed as something really distinct from and
superadded to the specific nature but as a positive aspect of the
latter an aspect moreover not involved in the concept of the specific
nature considered in the abstract
of the many views that have been put forward on this question two or three
call for some attention in the opinion of thomists generally the
principle which individuates material things thus multiplying
numerically the same specific nature is to be conceived as a positive
mode affecting the latter and revealing it in a new aspect whereas the
specific nature of the spiritual individual is itself formally an
individual the principle of the latters individuation is already
involved in the very concept of its specific nature and therefore is not
to be conceived as a distinct positive aspect of the latter but simply as
the absence of plurality and communicability in the latter in material
things moreover the positive mode or aspect whereby the specific nature
is found numerically multiplied and incommunicable as it exists in each
consists in the fact that such a specific nature involves in its very
constitution a material principle which is actually allied with certain
quantitative dimensions hence the principle which individuates material
substances is not to be conceivedafter the manner in which scotists
conceive itas an ultimate differentia affecting the formal factor of
the nature determining the specific nature just as the differentia
specifica determines the generic nature but as a material
differentiating principle what individuates the material individual what
marks it off as one in itself distinct or divided from other individuals
of the same specific nature and incommunicable in that condition is the
material factor of that individuals naturenot indeed the material
factor materia prima considered in the abstract but the material
factor as proximately capable of actual existence by being allied to
certain more or less definite spatial or quantitative dimensions matter
affected with quantity materia quantitate signata146
in regard to material substances this doctrine embraces two separate
contentions a that the principle which individuates such a substance
must be conceived as something positive not really distinct from but yet
not contained in the specific nature considered in the abstract b
that this positive aspect is to be found not in the formal but in the
material principle of the composite corporeal substance
to the former contention it might be objected that what individuates the
specific nature cannot be conceived as anything positive superadded to
this nature it cannot be anything accidental to the latter for if it
were the individual would be only an accidental unity a unum per
accidens and would be constituted by an accident which we have seen to
be inadmissible nor on the other hand can it be anything essential to
the specific nature for if it were then individuals should be capable of
adequate essential definition and furthermore the definition of the
specific nature would not really give the whole essence or quidditas of
the individualstwo consequences which are commonly rejected by all
scholastics to this however it is replied that the principle of
individuation is something essential to the specific nature in the sense
that it is something intrinsic to and really identical with the whole
real substance or entity of this nature though not involved in the
abstract concept by the analysis of which we reach the definition or
quidditas of this nature what individuates socrates is certainly
essential to socrates and is therefore really identical with his human
nature it is intrinsic to the human nature in him a mode or aspect of
his human substance yet it does not enter into the definition of his
natureanimal rationalefor such definition abstracts from
individuality when therefore we say that definition of the specific
nature gives the whole essence of an individual we mean that it gives
explicitly the abstract specific essence not the individuality which is
really identical with this nor therefore the whole substantial reality
of the individual we give different answers to the questions what is
socrates and who is socrates the answer to the former questiona
man or a rational animalgives the essence but not explicitly the
whole substantial reality of the individual this remaining incapable of
adequate conceptual analysis the latter question we answer by giving the
notes that reveal individuality these of course are accidental in
the strict sense but even the principles which constitute the
individuality of separate individuals of the same species and which
differentiate these individuals numerically from one another we do not
describe as essential differences whereas we do describe specific and
generic differences as essential the reason of this is that the latter
are abstract universal conceptual amenable to intellectual analysis
scientifically important while the former are just the reverse the
universal differences alone are principles about which we can have
scientific knowledge for all science is of the abstract and
universal147 and this is what we have in mind when we describe them as
essential or formal and individual differences as entitative or
material
the second point in the thomistic doctrine is that corporeal substances
are individuated by reason of their materiality the formative
specific determining principle of the corporeal substance is rendered
incommunicable by its union with the material determinable principle
and it becomes individually distinct or separate by the fact that this
latter principle in order to be capable of union with the given specific
form has in its very essence an exigence for certain more or less
determinate dimensions in space corporeal things have their natural size
within certain limits the individual of a given corporeal species can
exist only because the material principle receptive of this specific
form has a natural relation to the fundamental property of corporeal
things viz quantity within certain more or less determinate limits
the form is rendered incommunicable by its reception in the matter this
concrete realization of the form in the matter is individually distinct
and separate from other realizations of the same specific form by the
fact that the matter of this realization demands certain dimensions of
quantity this latter property being the rootprinciple of numerical
multiplication of corporeal individuals within the same species
on the other hand incorporeal substances such as angels or pure spirits
being pure forms form subsistentes wholly and essentially
unallied with any determinable material principle are of themselves not
only specific but individual they are themselves essentially
incommunicable superior to all multiplication or repeated realization of
themselves they are such that each can be actualized only once and for
all each is a species in itself it is the full exhaustive and
adequate expression of a divine type of an exemplar in the divine mind
its realization is not like that of a material form the actuation of an
indefinitely determinable material principle it sums up and exhausts the
imitable perfection of the specific type in its single individuality
whereas the perfection of the specific type of a corporeal thing cannot be
adequately expressed in any single individual realization but only by
repeated realizations nor indeed can it ever be adequately exhaustively
expressed by any finite multitude of these
it follows that in regard to pure spirits the individuating principle and
the specific principle are not only really but also logically
conceptually identical that the distinction between individual and
individual is here properly a specific distinction that it can be
described as numerical only in an analogical sense if by numerical we
mean material or quantitative ie the distinction between corporeal
individuals of the same species 28
but the distinction between individual human souls is not a specific or
formal distinction these though spiritual are not pure spirits they
are spiritual substances which of their very nature are essentially
ordained for union with matter they all belong to the same speciesthe
human species but they do not constitute individuals of this species
unless as existing actually united with matter each human soul has a
transcendental relation to its own body to the materia signata for
which and in which it was created for each human soul this relation is
unique just as it is the material principle of each human being the
matter as allied to quantitative dimensions that individuates the man so
it is the unique relation of his soul to the material principle thus
spatially determined that individuates his soul now the soul even when
disembodied and existing after death necessarily retains in its very
constitution this essential relation to its own body and thus it is that
disembodied souls though not actually allied with matter remain
numerically distinct and individuated in virtue of their essential
relation each to its own body we see therefore that human souls
though spiritual are an entirely different order of beings and must be
conceived quite differently from pure spirits
    we must be content with this brief exposition of the thomistic
    doctrine on individuation a discussion of the arguments for and
    against it would carry us too far148 there is no doubt that
    what reveals the individuality of the corporeal substance to us
    is its material principle in virtue of which its existence is
    circumscribed within certain limits of time and space and affected
    with individual characteristics notae individuantes but the
    thomistic doctrine which finds in materia signata the formal
    intrinsic constitutive principle of individuation goes much
    deeper it is intimately connected with the aristotelian theory of
    knowledge and reality according to this philosophy the formative
    principle or  the forma subtantialis is our sole key to
    the intelligibility of corporeal things these are intelligible in
    so far forth as they are actual and they are actual in virtue of
    their forms hence the tendency of the scholastic commentators
    of aristotle to use the term form as synonymous with the term
    nature though the whole nature of the corporeal substance
    embraces the material as well as the formal principle for even
    though it does we can understand nothing about this nature
    beyond what is intelligible in it in virtue of its form the
    material principle on the other hand is the potential
    indeterminate principle in itself unintelligible we know that in
    ancient greek philosophy it was regarded as the  the surd
    and contingent principle in things the element which resisted
    rational analysis and fell outside the scope of science or
    knowledge of the necessary and universal while it revealed the
    forms or natures of things to sense it remained itself impervious
    to intellect which grasped these natures and rendered them
    intelligible only by divesting them of matter by abstracting them
    from matter reality is intelligible only in so far forth as it is
    immaterial either in fact or by abstraction the human intellect
    being itself spiritual is receptive of forms without matter
    but being itself allied with matter its proper object is none
    other than the natures or essences of corporeal things
    abstracted however from the matter in which they are actually
    immersed the only reason therefore why any intelligible form
    or essence which as abstract and universal is one for
    intellect is nevertheless actually or potentially manifold in
    its reality is because it is allied with a material principle it
    is the latter that accounts for the numerical multiplication in
    actual reality of any intelligible form or essence if the latter
    is material it can be actualized only by indefinitely repeated
    numerically or materially distinct alliances with matter it
    cannot be actualized tota simul or once for all as it
    were it is therefore the material principle that not merely
    reveals but also constitutes the individuation of such corporeal
    forms or essences hence too the individual as such cannot be
    adequately apprehended by intellect for all intelligible
    principles of reality are formal whereas the individuating
    principle is material
    on the other hand if an intelligible essence or form be purely
    spiritual wholly unrelated to any indeterminate material
    principle it must be one not alone conceptually or logically
    but also really it can exist only as one it is of itself
    individual it can be differentiated from other spiritual essences
    not materially but only formally or in other words not
    numerically but by a distinction which is at once individual and
    specific two pure spirits cannot be two numerically and one
    specifically two for sense and one for intellect as two men are
    if they are distinct at all they must be distinct for intellect
    ie they cannot be properly conceived as two members of the
    same species
    in this solution of the question it is not easy to see how the
    material principle which by its alliance with quantity
    individuates the form is itself individuated so as to be the
    source and principle of a multiplicity of numerically distinct and
    incommunicable realizations of this form perhaps the most that
    can be said on this point is that we must conceive quantity which
    is the fundamental property of corporeal reality as being itself
    essentially divisible and the material principle as deriving from
    its essential relation to quantity its function of multiplying the
    same specific nature numerically
of those who reject the thomistic doctrine some few contend that it is the
actual existence of any specific nature that should be conceived as
individuating the latter no doubt the universal as such cannot exist
reality in order to exist actually must be individual yet it cannot be
actual existence that individuates it we must conceive it as individual
before conceiving it as actually existent and we can conceive it as
individual while abstracting from its existence we can think for
instance of purely possible individual men or angels as numerically or
individually distinct from one another moreover what individuates the
nature must be essential to the latter but actual existence is not
essential to any finite nature hence actual existence cannot be the
principle of individuation149 can it be contended that possible
existence is what individuates reality no for possible existence is
nothing more than intrinsic capacity to exist actually and this is
essential to all reality it is the criterion whereby we distinguish real
being from logical being but real being as such is indifferent to
universality or individuality as far as the simple concept of real being
is concerned the latter may be either universal or individual the concept
abstracts equally from either condition of being
the vast majority therefore of those who reject the thomistic doctrine
on individuation support the view that what individuates any nature or
substance is simply the whole reality the total entity of the
individual this total entity of the individual though really identical
with the specific nature must be conceived as something positive
superadded to the latter for it involves a something which is logically
or mentally distinct from the latter this something is what we conceive
as a differentia individua after the analogy of the differentia
specifica which contracts the concept of the genus to that of the
species and by scotists it has been termed haecceitas or thisness
without using the scotist terminology most of those scholastics who
reject the thomist doctrine on this point advocate the present view the
individuality or thisness of the individual substance is regarded as
having no special principle in the individual other than the whole
substantial entity of the latter if the nature is simple it is of itself
individual if composite the intrinsic principles from which it
resultsie matter and form essentially unitedsuffice to individuate
it
in this view therefore the material principle of any individual man for
example is numerically and individually distinct from that of any other
individual of itself and independently of its relation either to the
formative principle or to quantity the formative principle too is
individuated of itself and not by the material principle which is
really distinct from it or by its relation to this material principle
likewise the union of both principles which is a substantial mode of the
composite substance is individuated and rendered numerically distinct
from all other unions of these two individual principles not by either or
both these but by itself and finally the individual composite substance
has its individuation from these two intrinsic principles thus
individually united
    it may be doubted perhaps whether this attempt at explaining the
    real individual manifoldness of what is one for intellect
    ie the universal throws any real light upon the problem no
    doubt every element or factor which is grasped by intellect in
    its analysis of realitymatter form substance accident
    quantity nay even individuality itselfis apprehended as
    abstract and universal and if we hold the doctrine of moderate
    realism that the intellect in apprehending the universal attains
    to reality and not merely to a logical figment of its own
    creation the problem of relating intelligibly the reality which
    is one for intellect with the same reality as manifestly
    manifold in its concrete realizations for sense is a genuine
    philosophical problem to say that what individuates any real
    essence or nature what deprives it of the oneness and
    universality which it has for intellect what makes it this
    that or the other incommunicable individual must be
    conceived to be simply the whole essential reality of that nature
    itselfleaves us still in ignorance as to why such a nature which
    is really one for intellect can be really manifold in its
    actualizations for sense experience the reason why the nature
    which is one and universal for abstract thought and which is
    undoubtedly not a logical entity but a reality capable of actual
    existence can be actualized as a manifold of distinct
    individuals must be sought we are inclined to think in the
    relation of this nature to a material principle in alliance with
    quantity which is the source of all purely numerical space and
    time distinctions
33 individuation of accidentsthe rle of quantity in the thomistic
theory of individuation suggests the question how are accidents
themselves individuated we have referred already 29 n to the view
that they are individuated by the individual subjects or substances in
which they inhere if we distinguish again between what reveals
individuality and what constitutes it there can be no doubt that when
accidents of the same kind are found in individually distinct subjects
what reveals the numerical distinction between the former is the fact that
they are found inhering in the latter so also distinction of individual
substances is the extrinsic genetic or causal principle of the
numerical distinction between similar accidents arising in these
substances but when the same kind of accident recurs successively in the
same individual substanceas for example when a man performs repeated
acts of the same kindwhat reveals the numerical or individual distinction
between these latter cannot be the individual substance for it is one and
the same but rather the time distinction between the accidents
themselves
the intrinsic constitutive principle which formally individuates the
accidents of individually distinct substances is according to thomists
generally their essential relation to the individual substances in which
they appear it is not clear how this theory can be applied to the
fundamental accident of corporeal substances if the function of formally
individuating the corporeal substance itself is to be ascribed in any
measure to quantity it would seem to follow that this latter must be
regarded as individuated by itself by its own total entity or reality
and this is the view held by most other scholastics in regard to the
individuation of accidents generally that these like substances are
individuated by their own total positive reality
when there is question of the same kind of accident recurring in the same
individual subject the time distinction between such successive
individual accidents of the same kind would appear not merely to reveal
their individuality but also to indicate a different relation of each to
its subject as existing at that particular point of space and time so
that the relation of the accident to its individual subject as here and
now existing in the concrete would be the individuating principle of the
accident
whether a number of accidents of the same species infima and distinct
merely numerically could exist simultaneously in the same individual
subject is a question on which scholastic philosophers are not agreed
the negative opinion which has the authority of st thomas being the
more probable those various questions on the individuation of accidents
will be better understood from a subsequent exposition of the scholastic
doctrine on accidents ch viii
    it may be well to remark that in inquiring about the individuation
    of substances and accidents we have been considering reality from
    a static standpoint seeking how we are to conceive and interpret
    intellectually or for abstract thought the relation of the
    universal to the individual if however we ascribe to time
    distinctions any function in individuating accidents of the same
    kind in the same individual substance we are introducing into our
    analysis the kinetic aspect of reality or its subjection to
    processes of change
    we may call attention here to a few other questions of minor
    import discussed by scholastics first have all individuals of
    the same species the same substantial perfection or can
    individuals have different grades of substantial perfection within
    the same species all admit the obvious fact that individual
    differs from individual within the same species in the number
    variety extent and intensity of their accidental properties and
    qualities but having the human soul mainly in view they
    disagree as to whether the substantial perfection of the specific
    nature can be actualized in different grades in different
    individuals according to the more common opinion there cannot be
    different substantial grades of the same specific nature for
    the simple reason that every such grade of substantial perfection
    should be regarded as specific as changing the species hence
    eg all human souls are substantially equal in perfection this
    view is obviously based upon the conception of specific types or
    essences as being after the analogy of numbers immutable when
    considered in the abstract and it seems to be confirmed by the
    consideration that the intrinsic principle of individuation is
    nothing or adds nothing really distinct from the specific
    essence itself
    another question in connexion with individuation has derived at
    least an historical interest from the notable controversy to which
    it gave rise in the seventeenth century between clarke and
    leibniz the latter in accordance with the principles of his
    system of philosophythe law of sufficient reason and the law
    of continuity among the monads or ultimate principles of
    beingcontended that two individual beings so absolutely alike as
    to be indiscernible would be eo ipso identical in other
    words that the reality of two such beings is impossible
    of course if we try to conceive two individuals so absolutely
    alike both in essence and accidents both in the abstract and in
    the concrete as to be indiscernible either by our senses or by
    our intellect or by any intellecteven the divine intellectwe
    are simply conceiving the same thing twice over but is there
    anything impossible or contradictory in thinking that god could
    create two perfectly similar beings distinct from each other only
    individually so similar however that neither human sense nor
    human intellect could apprehend them as two but only as one the
    impossibility is not apparent were they two material individuals
    they should of course occupy the same space in order to have
    similar spatial relations but impenetrability is not essential to
    corporeal substances and even in the view that each is
    individuated by its materia signata it is not impossible to
    conceive numerically distinct quantified matters allied at the
    same time to the same dimensions of space if on the other hand
    there be question of two pure spirits absolutely similar
    specifically even in the thomistic view that here the individual
    distinction is at the same time specific there seems to be no
    sufficient ground for denying that the divine omnipotence could
    create two or more such individually and therefore specifically
    distinct spirits150 such distinction remaining of course
    indiscernible for the finite human intellect
    the argument of leibniz that there would be no sufficient
    reason for the creation of two such indiscernible beings and
    that it would therefore be repugnant to the divine wisdom is
    extrinsic to the question of their intrinsic possibility if they
    be intrinsically possible they cannot be repugnant to any
    attribute of the divinity either to the divine omnipotence or to
    the divine wisdom
34 identityconsidering the order in which we acquire our ideas we are
easily convinced that the notion of finite being is antecedent to that of
infinite being moreover it is from reflection on finite beings that we
arrive at the most abstract notion of being in general we make the object
of this latter notion definite only by dividing it off mentally from
nothingness conceived per modum entis or as an ens rationis thus
the natural way of making our concepts definite is by limiting them it
is only when we come to reflect on the necessary implications of our
concept of infinite being that we realize the possibility of conceiving
a being which is definite without being really limited which is
definite by the very fact of its infinity by its possession of unlimited
perfection and even then our imperfect human mode of conceiving infinite
being is helped by distinguishing or dividing it off from all finite
being and contrasting it with the latter all this goes to prove the truth
of the teaching of st thomas that the mental function of dividing or
distinguishing precedes our concepts of unity and multitude now the
concepts of identity and distinction are closely allied with those of
unity and multitude but they add something to these latter when we think
of a being as one we must analyse it further look at it under different
aspects and compare it with itself before we can regard it as the
same or identical with itself or at least we must think of it twice
and compare it with itself in the affirmative judgment this is itself
a is a thus formulating the logical principle of identity in order
to come into possession of the concept of identity151 every
affirmative categorical judgment asserts identity of the predicate with
the subject s is p asserts in other words that what we apprehend
under the notion of the predicate p is really identical with what we
have apprehended under the distinct notion of the subject s the
synthetic function of the affirmative categorical judgment identifies in
the real order what the analytic function of mental abstraction had
separated in the logical order by saying that the affirmative
categorical judgment asserts identity we mean that by asserting that this
is that man is rational we identify this with that man with
rational thus denying that they are two that they are distinct
that they differ identity is one of those elementary concepts which
cannot be defined but perhaps we may describe it as the logical relation
through which the mind asserts the objects of two or more of its thoughts
to be really one
if the object formally represented by each of the concepts is one and the
sameas eg when we compare a with a or man with rational
animal or in general any object with its definitionthe identity is
both real and logical or conceptual formal if the concepts
differ in their formal objects while representing one and the same
realityas when we compare st peter with head of the apostles or
man with rationalthe identity is real but not logical or formal
finally if we represent two or more realities john james thomas by
the same formal concept man the identity is merely logical or
formal not real of these three kinds of identity the first is
sometimes called adequate the second and third inadequate
logical identity may be specific or generic according as we identify
really distinct individuals under one specific concept or really distinct
species or classes under one generic concept again it may be essential
or accidental according as the abstract and universal classconcept
under which really distinct members are classified represents a common
part of the essence of these members or only a common property or
accident thus john james and thomas are essentially identical in their
human nature they are accidentally identical in being all three
fairhaired and six feet in height logical identity under the concept
of quality is based on the real relation of similarity logical
identity under the concept of quantity is based on the real relation of
equality when we say that essential logical identity eg the
identity of john james and thomas under the concept of man is based on
the fact that the really distinct individuals have really similar
natures we merely mean that our knowledge of natures or essences is
derived from our knowledge of qualities taking qualities in the wide
sense of accidents generally that the properties and activities of
things are our only key to the nature of these things operari sequitur
esse it is not implied nor is it true that real similarity is a
partial real identity it is but the ground of a partial logical
identityidentity under the common concept of some quality in the wide
sense of this term for example the height of john is as really distinct
from that of james as the humanity of john is from that of james if
then individual things are really distinct how is it that we can
represent even inadequately a multitude of them by one concept to
say that we can do so because they reveal themselves to us as similar to
one another is to say what is undoubtedly true but this does not solve
the problem of the relation between the universal and the individual in
human experience rather it places us face to face with this problem
reverting now to real identity whatever we can predicate affirmatively
about a being considered as one and as subject of a judgment we regard
as really identical with that being we cannot predicate a real part of
its real whole or vice versa but our concepts when compared together
in judgment bear logical relations of extension and intension to each
other that is relations of logical part to logical whole thus the
logical identity of subject and predicate in the affirmative judgment
may be only inadequate152 but the real identity underlying the
affirmative judgment is an adequate real identity when we say for
example that socrates is wise we mean that the object of our concept
of wisdom is in this case really and adequately identical with the
object of our concept of socrates in other words that we are conceiving
one and the same real being under two distinct concepts each of which
represents more or less adequately the whole real being and one of them
in this case less adequately than the other
we have to bear in mind that while considering being as one or manifold
identical or distinct we are thinking of it in its static mode as an
object of abstract thought not in its dynamic and kinetic mode as
actually existing in space and time and subject to change it is the
identity of being with itself when considered in this static unchanging
condition that is embodied in the logical principle of identity in
order therefore that this principle may find its application to being or
reality as subject to actual changeand this is the state in which de
facto reality is presented to us as an immediate datum of experiencewe
must seize upon the changing reality and think of it in an indivisible
instant apart from the change to which it is actually subject only thus
does the principle of identity apply to itas being not as becoming
not in fieri but in facto esse the principle of identity which
applies to all real being whether possible or actual tells us simply
that a thing is what it is but for the understanding of actual being as
subject to real change we must supplement the principle of identity by
another principle which tells us that such an actual being not only is
actually what it is principle of identity but also that it is
potentially something other than what it actually is that it is
potentially what it can become actually ch ii
we have seen that since change is not continuous annihilation and
creation the changing being must in some real and true sense persist
throughout the process of change it is from experience of change we
derive our notion of timeduration and the concept of permanence or
stability throughout change gives us the notion of a real sameness or
abiding selfidentity which is compatible with real change but a being
which persists in existence is identical with itself throughout its
duration only in so far forth as it has not changed only the necessary
being whose duration is absolutely exempt from all change is
absolutely or metaphysically identical with himself his duration is
eternitywhich is one perpetual unchanging now a being which persists
unchanged in its essence or nature which is exempt from substantial
change but which is subject to accidental change to a succession of
accidental qualities such as vital actionssuch a being is said to retain
its physical identity with itself throughout those changes such for
instance is the identity of the human soul with itself or of any
individual living thing during its life or even of an inorganic material
substance as long as it escapes substantial change finally the
persisting identity of a collection of beings united by some moral bond
so as to form a moral unit is spoken of as moral identity as long as
the bond remains even though the constituent members may be constantly
disappearing to be replaced by others as in a nation a religious
society a legal corporation etc
35 distinctiondistinction is the correlative of identity it is the
absence or negation of the latter we express the relation called
distinction by the negative judgment this is not that it is the
relation of a being to whatever is not itself the relation of one to
other
distinction may be either adequate or inadequate according as we
distinguish one total object of thought from another total object or only
from a part of itself for example the distinction between john and james
is an adequate real distinction while that between john and his body is
an inadequate real distinction the distinction between johns rationality
and his animality is an adequate logical distinction while the
distinction between either of these and his humanity is an inadequate
logical distinction
we have already 23 briefly explained and illustrated the most important
classification of distinctions that into real and logical the
subdivision of the latter into purely logical and virtual and of the
latter again into perfect complete adequate and imperfect incomplete
inadequate but the theory there briefly outlined calls for some further
analysis and amplification
36 logical distinctions and their groundsthe purely logical distinction
must not be confounded with a mere verbal distinction eg that
between an edifice and a building or between truthfulness and
veracity a logical distinction is a distinction in the concepts
these must represent one and the same reality but in different ways the
one may be more explicit more fully analysed than the other as a
definition is in comparison with the thoughtobject defined or the one
may represent the object less adequately than the other as when we
compare in intension the concepts man and animal or the one may be
predicated of the other in an affirmative judgment or the one may
represent the object as concrete and individual the other the same object
as abstract and universal153
comparing in the next place the purely logical with the virtual
distinction we see that the grounds for making these distinctions are
different every distinction made by the mind must have an intelligible
ground or reason of some sorta fundamentum distinctionis now in the
case of the purely logical distinction the ground is understood to consist
exclusively in the needs of the mind itselfneeds which spring from the
minds own limitations when confronted with the task of understanding or
interpreting reality of making reality intelligible purely logical
distinctions are therefore seen to be a class of purely logical relations
ie of those entia rationis which the mind must construct for itself
in its effort to understand the real they have no other reality as
objects of thought than the reality they derive from the constitutive or
constructive activity of the mind they are modes or forms or terms of
the cognitive activity itself not of the reality which is the object
apprehended and contemplated by means of this cognitive activity
the virtual distinction on the other hand although it also as an object
of thought is only an ens rationisinasmuch as there is no real duality
or plurality corresponding to it in the reality into which the mind
introduces it this reality being a real unitythe virtual distinction
is considered nevertheless to have a ground or reason or foundation
for making and introducing it in the nature of this one reality that
is it is regarded as having a real foundation a fundamentum in re
in so far therefore as our knowledge is permeated by virtual
distinctions reality cannot be said to be formally but only
fundamentally what this knowledge represents it to be does this fact
interfere with the objective validity of our knowledge not in the least
for we do not ascribe to the reality the distinctions and other such
modes or forms which we know by reflection to be formally characteristic
not of things but of our thought or cognition of things our
knowledge therefore so far as it goes may be a faithful apprehension of
reality even though it be itself affected by modes not found in the
reality
but what is this real foundation of the virtual distinction what is
the fundamentum in re it is not a real or objective duality in virtue
of which we could say that there are in the object of our thought two
beings or realities one of which is not the other such duality would
cause a real distinction but just here the difficulties of our analysis
begin to arise for we have to fix our attention on actually existing
realities and assuming that each and every one of these is an
individual we have to bear in mind the relation of the real to the
actual of reality as abstract and universal to reality as concrete and
individual of the simple to the composite of the stable to the changing
of essential to accidental unityin any and every attempt to discriminate
in detail between a real and a virtual distinction nor is it easy to lay
down any general test which will serve even theoretically to discriminate
between them let us see what grounds have been mainly suggested as real
foundations for the virtual distinction
if a being which is not only one but simple manifests in the superior
grade of being to which it belongs a perfection which is equivalent to
many lesser perfections found really distinct and separate elsewhere in
separate beings of an inferior order this is considered a sufficient real
ground for considering the former being though really one and simple as
virtually manifold154 the human soul as being virtually
threefoldrational sentient and vegetativeis a case in point but only
on the assumption that the soul of the individual man can be proved to be
one and simple this of course all scholastics regard as capable of
proof even those of them who hold that the powers or faculties whereby it
immediately manifests these three grades of perfection are accidental
realities really distinct from one another and from the substance of
the soul itself
again the being which is the object of our thought may be so rich in
reality or perfection that our finite minds cannot adequately grasp it by
any one mental intuition but must proceed discursively by analysis and
abstraction taking in partial aspects of it successively through
inadequate concepts while realizing that these aspects these objects of
our distinct concepts are only partial aspects of one and the same real
being this in fact is our common experience but the theory assumes
that we are able to determine when these objects of our concepts are only
mental aspects of one reality and when they are several separate
realities nay even that we can determine whether or not they are really
distinct entities united together to form one composite individual
being or only mentally distinct views of one simple individual being
for example it is assumed that while the distinction between the sentient
and the rational grades of being in a human individual can be shown to be
only a virtual distinction that between the body and the soul of the same
individual can be shown to be a real distinction or again that while
the distinction between essence intellect and will in god can be shown
to be only a virtual distinction that between essence intellect and
will in man can be shown to be a real distinction
37 the virtual distinction and the real distinctionnow scholastics
differ considerably in classifying this that or the other distinction
as logical or as real but this does not prove that it is impossible ever
to determine with certitude whether any particular distinction is logical
or real what we are looking for just now is a general test for
discriminating if such can be found and this brings us to a
consideration of the test suggested in the very definitions themselves at
first sight it would appear to be an impracticable if not even an
unintelligible test the distinction is real if it exists in the
realityie if the reality is two or more beings not one
beingantecedently to or independently of the consideration of the
mind otherwise the distinction is logical butit might be objectedhow
can we possibly know whether or not any object of perception or thought is
one or more than one antecedently to or independently of the
consideration of the mind it is certainly impossible for us to know what
or what kind reality is or whether it is one or manifold apart from and
prior to the exercise of our own cognitive activity this therefore
cannot be what the test means to interpret it in such a sense would be
absurd but when we have perceived reality in our actual sense experience
when we have interpreted it got the meaning of it made it intelligible
and actually understood it by the spontaneous exercise of intellect the
judging and reasoning faculty then obviously we are at liberty to
reflect critically on those antecedent spontaneous processes on the
knowledge which is the result of them and the reality which is known
through them and by such critical reflection on those processes their
objects and their products on the reality as perceived and known and on
the perceiving and knowing of it we may be able to distinguish
between two classes of contributions to the total result which is the
known reality those which we must regard as purely mental as modes or
forms or subjectively constructed terms of the mental function of
cognition itself whether perceptual or conceptual and those which we
must regard as given or presented to the mind as objects which are not in
any sense constructed or contributed by the mind which therefore are
what they are independently of our mental activity and which would be and
remain what they are and what we have apprehended them to be even if we
had never perceived or thought of them this according to the
scholastics is the senseand it is a perfectly intelligible sensein
which we are called on to decide whether the related terms of any given
distinction have been merely rendered distinct by the analytic activity of
the cognitive process or are themselves distinct realities irrespective
of this process that it is possible to carry on successfully at least to
some extent this work of discrimination between the subjective and the
objective factors of our cognitive experience can scarcely be denied it
is what philosophers in every age have been attempting there are
however some distinctions about the nature of which philosophers have
never been able to agree some holding them to be real others to be only
virtual the former view being indicative of the tendency to emphasize the
rle of cognition as a passive representation of objectively given
reality the latter view being an expression of the opposite tendency to
emphasize the active or constitutive or constructive factors whereby
cognition assimilates to the minds own mode of being the reality given to
it in experience in all cognition there is an assimilation of reality and
mind of object and subject when certain distinctions are held to be real
this consideration is emphasized that in the cognitive process as such
it is the mind that is assimilated to the objective reality155 when
these same distinctions are held to be logical this other consideration is
emphasized that in the cognitive process reality must also be assimilated
to mind must be mentalized so to speak cognitum est in cognoscente
secundum modum cognoscentis that in this process the mind must often
regard what is one reality under distinct aspects and that if we
regard these distinct aspects as distinct realities we are violating the
principle entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem
    now those philosophers who hold certain distinctions to be
    virtual and not real thereby ascribe to cognitive experience a
    larger sphere of constitutive or constructive influence than would
    be allowed to it by advocates of the reality of such distinctions
    but by doing so are they to be regarded as calling into question
    the objective validity of human knowledge by no means the fact
    that the human mind can understand reality only by processes of
    abstracting generalizing comparing relating analysing and
    synthesizingprocesses which involve the production of logical
    entitiesin no way vitiates the value of these modes of
    understanding it merely indicates that they are less perfect than
    intuitive modes of understanding which would dispense with such
    logical entitiesthe modes characteristic of pure angelic
    intelligences or the knowledge of the deity the objective
    validity of human cognition is not interfered with either by
    enlarging or by restricting the domain of the minds constitutive
    activity in forming such logical entities nor therefore by
    claiming that certain distinctions are real rather than virtual
    or vice versa it must be remembered moreover that the virtual
    distinction is not purely logical it has a foundation in the
    reality a fundamentum in re and in so far as it has it gives
    us an insight into the nature of reality
    no doubt any particular distinction cannot be virtual and at the
    same time simply real either view of it must be erroneous and
    possibly both if it happen to be de facto a purely logical
    distinction but the error of confounding a virtual distinction
    with a real is not so great as that of regarding either as a
    purely logical distinction now the tendency of much modern
    philosophy under the influence of kant has been to regard all
    the categories in which the mind apprehends reality as being
    wholly and exclusively forms of cognition as being in the reality
    neither formally nor even fundamentally and to infer from this an
    essential constitutional inability of the mind to attain to a
    valid knowledge of reality but if as a matter of fact these
    categories are in the reality formally nay even if they are in
    it only fundamentally the inference that issues in kantian
    subjectivism is unwarranted and those categories we hold to be in
    the reality at least fundamentally we therefore reject the
    kantian phenomenism of the speculative reason moreover we can
    see no valid ground for admitting the kantian division of the
    human mind into two totally separate cognitive compartments the
    speculative and the practical reason and ascribing to each
    compartment cognitive principles and capacities entirely alien to
    the other to arrive at a right theory of knowledge human
    cognitive experience as a whole must be analysed but provided the
    analysis is really an analysis of this experience it may be
    legitimately directed towards discovering what the mental
    conditions must beie the conditions on the side of the
    knowing subject the subject having the experiencewhich are
    necessarily prerequisite for having such experience and if it
    be found by such analysis that cognitive experience presupposes in
    the knowing subject not merely a sentient and intelligent mind
    but a mind which perceives imagines remembers reality in certain
    definite ways which thinks reality in certain modes and through
    certain forms which by its own constitutive activity it constructs
    for itself and which it recognizes by reflection to be its own
    constructions eg distinctions relations affirmations and
    negations abstractions generalizations etc intentiones
    logicae logical entitiesthere is no reason whatever in all
    this for inferring that because the mind is so constituted
    because it has these modes of cognition it must necessarily fail
    to reach by means of them a true valid and genuine knowledge
    of reality from the fact that human modes of cognition are human
    and not angelic or divine from the fact that reality can be known
    to man only through these modes these finite modes of finite
    human facultieswe may indeed infer that even our highest
    knowledge of reality is inadequate that it does not comprehend
    all that is in the reality but surely not that it is essentially
    illusory and of its very nature incapable of giving us any true
    and valid insight into the nature of reality
fixing our attention on the virtual distinction we see that the mind is
supposed by means of it to apprehend through a plurality of distinct
concepts what it knows somehow or other to be one being now if it
knows the reality to be really one it knows that the formal object of
every distinct concept of this reality is really identical with the
objects of all the other concepts of the latter this condition of things
is certainly verified when the mind can see that each of the distinct
concepts though not explicitly presenting the objects of the others
nevertheless implicitly and necessarily involves all these other
objects156 for by seeing that the distinct concepts necessarily involve
one another objectively it sees that the reality apprehended through all
of them must necessarily be one reality this is what takes place in the
imperfect virtual distinction the concepts prescind from one another
formally not objectively but suppose that the distinct concepts prescind
from one another objectively so that they cannot be seen by any
analysis to involve one another even implicitly but present to the mind
so far as they themselves are concerned adequately distinct modes of
beingas happens in the perfect virtual distinction eg between
organic life sentient life and intellectual life in man or between
animality and rationality in manthen the allimportant question
arises how do we know in any given case of this kind whether or not
these adequately distinct thoughtobjects are identical with one another
in the reality what is the test for determining whether or not in a
given case these objects which are many for abstract intellectual
thought are one being in the real order the answer seems to be that
internal and external sense experience can and does furnish us with
embodiments of these intellectual manifoldsembodiments each of which we
apprehend as a being that is really one as an individual subject of
which they are conceptually distinct predicates
    it would appear therefore that we cannot reach a true conception
    of what we are to regard as really one or really manifold by
    abstract thought alone it is external and internal sense
    experience not abstract thought which first brings us into
    direct and immediate mental contact with actually existing
    reality what we have therefore to determine is this does sense
    experience or does it not reveal reality to us as a real
    manifold not as one being but as beings coexisting outside
    one another in space succeeding one another in time
    interdependent on one another interacting on one another and by
    this interaction causing and undergoing real change each
    producing others or being produced by others really distinct
    from itself in other words is separateness of existence in time
    or space as revealed in sense experience a sufficient index of
    the real manifoldness of corporeal being and of the really
    distinct individuality of each such beingor are we to take it
    that because those space and time distinctions have to be
    apprehended by thought in order that not merely sense but
    intellect may apprehend corporeal beings as really manifold
    therefore these distinctions are not in the reality given to us
    or again is each persons own conscious experience of himself as
    one being of his own unity and of his distinctness from other
    persons a sufficient index that the distinction between person
    and person is a real distinctionor are we to take it that
    because his feeling of his individual unity through sense
    consciousness must be interpreted by the thoughtconcepts of
    oneindividualpersondistinct from others these
    concepts do not truly express what is really given him to
    interpret finally if we can infer from the actually existing
    material reality which forms the immediate datum of direct
    experience or from the human ego as given in this experience
    the actual existence of a real mode of being which is not material
    but spiritual by what tests can we determine whether this
    spiritual mode of being is really one or whether there is a real
    plurality of such beings the solution of these questions bears
    directly on the validity of the adequate or greater real
    distinction the distinctio realis major seu absoluta
    the philosophy which defends the validity of this
    distinctionwhich holds that the distinction between individual
    human beings and between individual living things generally is
    in the fullest and truest sense a real distinctionis at all
    events in conformity with universally prevailing modes of thought
    and language while the monism which repudiates these spontaneous
    interpretations of experience as invalid by denying all real
    manifoldness to reality can make itself intelligible only by
    doing violence to thought and language alike not that this alone
    is a disproof of monism but at all events it creates a
    presumption against a system to find it running counter to any of
    those universal spontaneous beliefs which appear to be rooted in
    mans rational nature on the other hand the philosophy which
    accords with common belief in proclaiming a real plurality in
    being has to reconcile intellect with sense and the universal
    with the individual by solving the important problem of
    individuation what is it that makes real being individual if
    notwithstanding the fact that intellect apprehends reality as
    abstract and universal reality nevertheless can exist only as
    concrete and individual 2933
38 the real distinctionin the next place it must be remembered
comparing the virtual distinction with the real that philosophers have
recognized two kinds of real distinction the major or absolute real
distinction and the minor real or modal distinction before defining
these let us see what are the usual signs by which a real distinction in
general can be recognized
    the relation of efficient causality of efficient cause and
    effect between two objects of thought is sometimes set down as a
    sure sign of a major real distinction between them157 and the
    reason alleged is that a thing cannot be the efficient cause of
    itself the efficient cause is necessarily extrinsic to the effect
    and cannot be really identical with the latter it is to be noted
    that this test applies to reality as actually existing as
    producing or undergoing change and that it is derived from our
    sense experience of reality in process of change but since our
    concept of efficient causality has its origin in our internal
    experience of our own selves as active agents as causing some
    portion of what enters into our experience the test seems to
    assume that we have already introduced into this experience a real
    distinction between the self and what is caused by the self it is
    not clear that the relation of efficient cause to effect as
    applied to created causes can precede and reveal in our
    experience the relation of what is really one to what is
    really other in this experience if the reality revealed to us
    in our direct experience the phenomenal universe has been
    brought into existence by the creative act of a supreme being
    this of course implies a real distinction between creator and
    creature but it does not seem possible in this case or indeed in
    any case to prove the existence of the causal relation
    antecedently to that of the real distinction or to utilize the
    former as an index to the latter
two distinct thoughtobjects are regarded as really distinct 1 when
they are found to exist separately and apart from each other in time or
space as is the case with any two individuals such as john and james or
a man and a horse 2 when although they are found in the same
individual one of them at least is separable from the other in the sense
that it can actually exist without that other for example the soul of
any individual man can exist apart from the material principle with which
it is actually united to form this living human individual the individual
himself can exist without the particular accidental modes such as
sitting thinking speaking which actually affect his being at any
particular instant of his existence
from this we can gather in the first place that the distinction between
two individualsindividual persons or individual thingsis a real
distinction in the fullest and plainest sense of this expression a major
or absolute real distinction it is moreover not merely real but actual
two existing individuals are always actually divided and separate from
each other while each is actually one or actually undivided in itself
and they are so independently of the consideration of the mind
in the second place assuming that the mind can apprehend in the
individuals of its experience a unity resulting from the union or
composition of separable factors or principles whether essential or
accidental 27 b and assuming that it can know these factors to be
really separable though actually one and undivided that is separable
in the sense that each of any two such factors or at least one of them
could actually exist without the otherit regards the distinction between
such factors as real they are really distinct because though actually
one and undivided they are potentially manifold if each has a positive
entity of its own so that absolutely speaking each could exist without
the other the distinction is still regarded as an absolute or major real
distinction for example the human soul can exist without the body the
body can exist without the soul being actualized by the new formative
principle or principles which replace the soul at death therefore there
is an absolute real distinction between the soul and the body of the
living human individual although both factors form one actual being
still independently of the consideration of the mind the one factor is
not the other each is really though only potentially other than the
factor with which it is united the relation of one to other though
not actually verified of either factor since there is only one actual
being the existing individual man is potentially and really verified
ie verifiable of each again the individual corporeal substance
can absolutely speaking exist without its connatural accident of
external or local extension this latter can absolutely speaking exist
without its connatural substance158 therefore these are absolutely and
really distinct
if only one of the factors is seen to be capable of existing without the
other and the latter to be such that it could not actually exist except
as united with the former so that the separability is not mutual the
distinction is regarded still as real but only as a minor or modal
distinction such for instance is the distinction between a body and its
location or its state of rest or motion and in general the distinction
between a substance and what are called its accidental modes or modal
accidents the distinction is regarded as real because reflection is held
to assure us that it is in the reality itself independently of the mind
and not merely imposed by the mind on the reality because of some ground
or reason in the reality it is called a modal distinction rather than an
absolute real distinction because those accidental modes of a substance do
not seem to have of themselves sufficient reality to warrant our calling
them things or realities but rather merely modes or
determinations of things or realities it is significant as throwing
light on the relation of the virtual to the real distinction that some
authors call the modal distinction not a real distinction but a
distinctio media ie intermediate between a real and a logical
distinction and that the question whether it should be called simply a
real distinction or intermediate between a real and a logical
distinction is regarded by some as a purely verbal question159 we
shall recur to the modal distinction later 68
in the third place it must be noted that separability in the sense
explained even nonmutual is not regarded as the only index to a real
distinction in other words certain distinctions are held by some to be
real even though this test of separability does not apply for instance
it is commonly held that not merely in man but in all corporeal
individuals the formative and the determinable principle of the nature or
substance the forma substantialis and the materia prima are really
distinct although it is admitted that apart from the case of the human
soul neither can actually exist except in union with the other what is
held in regard to accidental modes is also applied to these essential
principles of the corporeal substance viz that there is here a special
reason why such principles cannot actually exist in isolation of their
very nature they are held to be such that they cannot be actualized or
actually exist in isolation but only in union but this fact it is
contended does not prove that the principles in question are merely
mentally distinct aspects of one reality the fact that they cannot
actually exist as such separately does not prove that they are not really
separable and it is contended that they are really and actually separated
whenever an individual corporeal substance undergoes substantial change
    this then raises once more the question what sort of
    separation or separability is the test of a real distinction
    is it separateness in and for sense perception or separateness in
    and for intellectual thought the former is certainly the
    fundamental index of the real distinction for all our knowledge
    of reality originates in sense experience and separateness in
    time and space which marks its data is the key to our knowledge
    of reality as a manifold of really distinct individual beings and
    when we infer from senseexperience the actual existence of a
    spiritual domain of reality we can conceive its individuals
    only after the analogy of the corporeal individuals of our
    immediate sense experience scholastic philosophers following
    aristotle have always taken the manifoldness of reality ie
    its presentation in sense experience in the form of individuals
    of this and that   hoc aliquid as an
    unquestioned and unquestionable real datum not that they
    navely assumed everything perceived by the senses as an
    individual in time and space to be really an individual they
    realized that what is perceived by sense as one limited
    continuum occupying a definite portion of space may be in
    reality an aggregate of many individuals and they recognized the
    need of scrutinizing and analysing those apparent individuals in
    order to test their real individuality but they held and
    rightly that sense experience does present to us some data that
    are unmistakably real individualsindividual men for instance
    next they saw that intellectual thought by analysing sense
    experience amasses an evergrowing multitude of abstract and
    conceptually distinct thoughtobjects which it utilizes as
    predicates for the interpretation of this sense experience these
    thoughtobjects intellect can unite or separate can in some cases
    positively see to be mutually compatible or incompatible can form
    into ideal or possible complexes but whether or not the
    conceptually distinct though mutually compatible
    thoughtobjects forming any such complex will be also really
    distinct from one another is a question which evidently cannot
    arise until such a complex is considered as an actual or possible
    individual being for it is the individual only that exists or
    can exist they will be really distinct when found actualized in
    distinct individuals even the conceptually one and
    selfidentical abstract thoughtobject will be really distinct
    from itself when embodied in distinct individuals the one single
    abstract thoughtobject humanity human nature is really
    distinct from itself in john and in james the humanity of john is
    really other than the humanity of james
    of course if conceptually distinct thoughtobjects are seen to be
    mutually incompatible they cannot be found realized except in
    really distinct individuals the union of them is only an ens
    rationis again it may be that the intellect is unable to
    pronounce positively as to whether they are compatible or not
    18 as to whether the complex forms a possible being or not but
    when the intellect positively sees such thoughtobjects to be
    mutually compatibleby interpretation of and inference from its
    actual sense experience of them as embodied in individuals
    18and when furthermore it now finds a number of them
    coexisting in some one actual individual the question recurs
    how can it know whether they are really distinct from each
    other though actually united to form one essentially or
    accidentally composite individual or only conceptually distinct
    aspects of one simple individual 27 b
    this as we have seen already is the case for which it is really
    difficult to find a satisfactory test and hence the different
    views to be found among scholastic philosophers as to the nature
    of the distinctions which the mind makes or discovers within the
    individual the difficulty is this the conceptual distinction
    between compatible thoughtobjects is not a proof of real
    distinction when these thoughtobjects are found united in one
    individual of sense experience as eg animality and
    rationality in man and the only distinction given to us by sense
    experience at least directly and immediately as undoubtedly
    real is the distinction between corporeal individuals
    existing apart in space or time as eg between man and man
    how then can we show that any distinctions within the
    individual are real
    well we have seen that certain entities which are objects of
    sense or of thought or of both can disappear from the individual
    without the residue thereby perishing or ceasing to exist actually
    as an individual the human soul survives as an actual individual
    reality after its separation from the material principle with
    which it formed the individual man the individual man persists
    while the accidental modes that affect him disappear in such
    cases as these intellect interpreting sense experience and
    reasoning from it places a real distinction in the composite
    individual between the factors that can continue to exist without
    others and these latter in doing so it is apparently applying
    the analogy of the typical real distinctionthat between one
    individual and another the factor or group of factors which can
    continue to exist actually after the separation of the others is
    an individual and what were separated from it were apparently
    real entities though they may have perished by the actual
    separation but on what ground is the distinction between the
    material principle and the vital principle of a plant or an
    animal for example regarded as real again on the ground
    furnished by the analogy of the distinction between individuals of
    sense experience note that it is not between the material and the
    vital principles as objects of abstract thought ie between
    the materiality and the vitality of the plant or the animal
    that a real distinction is claimed these are regarded only as
    conceptually distinct aspects of the plant or the animal nor is
    it admitted that because one of these thoughtobjects is found
    embodied elsewhere in nature without the othermateriality without
    vitality in the inorganic universewe can therefore conclude that
    they are really distinct in the plant or the animal no it is
    between the two principles conceived as coexisting and united in
    the concrete individual that the real distinction is claimed and
    it is held to be a real distinction because substantial change in
    corporeal things ie corruption and generation of individual
    corporeal substances is held to be real if it is real there is a
    real separation of essential factors when the individual perishes
    and the factors continue to be real as potential principles of
    other individuals when any individual corporeal substance
    perishes each principle may not continue to exist actually as
    such in isolation from the otherthough some scholastics hold
    that absolutely speaking they could be conserved apart as
    actual entities by the author of nature but they can actually
    exist as essential principles of other actual individuals they
    are real potentialities which become actual in other
    individuals thus we see that they are conceived throughout after
    the analogy of the individual those who hold that absolutely
    speaking the material principle as such materia prima could
    actually exist in isolation from any formative principle should
    apparently admit that in such a case it would be an individual
    reality
39 some questionable distinctions the scotist distinctionthe
difficulty of discriminating between the virtual and the real distinction
in an individual has given rise to the conception of distinctions which
some maintain to be real others to be less than real the virtual
distinction as we have hitherto understood it may be described as
extrinsic inasmuch as it arises in the individual only when we consider
the latter under different aspects or in different relations to things
extrinsic to it by regarding an individual under different aspectseg
a man under the aspects of animality and rationalitywe can predicate
contradictory attributes of the individual eg of a man that he is
similar to a horse and that he is not similar to a horse now it is
maintained by some that although independently of the consideration of the
mind the grounds of these contradictory predications are not actually
distinct in the individual nevertheless even before such consideration
the individual has a real intrinsic capacity to have these contradictory
predicates affirmed of him they can be affirmed of him not merely when he
is regarded and because he is regarded under conceptually different
aspects but because these principles animality and rationality are
already really in him not merely as aspects but as distinct capacities as
potentially distinct principles of contradictory predications
the virtual distinction understood in this way is described as
intrinsic it is rejected by some on the ground that at least in its
application to finite realities it involves a violation of the principle
of contradiction it seems to imply that one and the same individual has
in itself absolutely and not merely as considered under different aspects
and relations the capacity to verify of itself contradictory predicates
scotus and his followers go even farther than the advocates of this
intrinsic virtual distinction by maintaining the existence of a
distinction which on the one hand they hold to be less than real because
it is not between thing and thing and on the other hand to be more than
logical or virtual because it actually exists between the various
thoughtobjects or formalitates such eg as animality and
rationality in the individual independently of the analytic activity
whereby the mind detects these in the latter this distinction scotists
call a formal distinction actual on the part of the thingdistinctio
formalis actualis ex natura rei hence the name formalists applied
to scotists from their advocacy of this scotistic distinction it is
they explain a distinction not between things res but between
formalities formalitates by thing as opposed to formality
they mean not merely the individual but also any positive thoughtobject
which though it may not be capable of existing apart can really appear
in or disappear from a thing which can so exist for instance the
essential factors of a really composite essence its accidental modes and
its real relations by formality they mean a positive thoughtobject
which is absolutely inseparable from the thing in which it is apprehended
which cannot exist without the thing nor the thing without it for
instance all the metaphysical grades of being in an individual such as
substantiality corporeity life animality rationality individuality
in an individual man the distinction is called formal because it is
between such formalitieseach of which is the positive term of a
separate concept of the individual it is called actual on the side of
the thing because it is claimed to be actually in the latter apart from
our mental apprehension of the individual what has chiefly influenced
scotists in claiming this distinction to be thus actually in the
individual independently of our mental activity is the consideration
that these metaphysical grades are grounds on which we can predicate
contradictory attributes of the same individual eg of an individual
man that he is similar to a horse and that he is not similar to a
horse whence they infer that in order to avoid violation of the
principle of contradiction we must suppose these grounds to be actually
distinct in the thing
to this it is replied firstly that if such predications were truly
contradictory we could avoid violation of the principle of contradiction
only by inferring a real distinctionwhich scotists deny to
existbetween these grounds secondly that such predications are not
truly contradictory inasmuch as he is similar really means he is
partially similar and he is not similar means he is not completely
similar therefore when we say that a mans rationality is not the
principle whereby he resembles a horse and his animality is the
principle whereby he resembles a horse we mean a that his
rationality is not the principle of complete resemblance though we know
it is the principle of partial resemblance inasmuch as we see it to be
really identical with that which is the principle of partial resemblance
viz his animality and we mean b that his animality is the
principle of his partial resemblance to a horse not of total resemblance
for we know that the animality of a man is not perfectly similar to that
of a horse the former being really identical with rationality the latter
with irrationality when then we predicate of one thing that it is
similar to some other thing and that it is not similar to this other
thing we are not really predicating contradictories of the same thing if
we take the predicates as contradictories they are true of the same
reality undoubtedly but not under the same aspect scotists themselves
admit that the real identity of these aspects involves no violation of
the principle of contradiction why then should these be held to be
actually distinct formalities independently of the consideration of the
mind how can a distinction that is actual independently of the minds
analysis of the reality be other than real is not predication a work of
the mind and must not the conditions on which reality verifies the
predication be determined by the mind if then we see that in order to
justify this predicationof similar and not similarabout any reality
it is merely necessary that the mind should apprehend this reality to be
in its undivided unity equivalent to manifold grades of being or
perfection which the mind itself can grasp as mentally distinct aspects
by distinct concepts how can we be justified in supposing that these
grades of being are not merely distinguishable but actually distinct
in the reality itself independently of the mind
    the scotist doctrine here is indicative of the tendency to
    emphasize perhaps unduly the assimilation of reality as a datum
    with the mind which interprets this datum to regard the
    constitution of reality itself as being what abstract thought
    irrespective of sense experience would represent it and
    accordingly to place in the reality as being actually there
    independently of thought distinctions which as a matter of fact
    may be merely the product of thought itself
    scotists by advocating an actual distinction between these
    grades of being as formalities in the individual have exposed
    themselves to the charge of extreme realism they teach that each
    of these formalities has for abstract thought a formal unity
    which is sui generis and this unity is not regarded as a
    product of thought any more than the distinction between such
    unities thus the materiality apprehended by thought in all
    material things is one not because it is made one by the
    abstracting and universalizing activity of thought as most if not
    all other scholastics teach it is not merely conceptually one
    through our thoughtactivity it is formally one apart from the
    latter and it thus knits into a formal unity all material
    things and so does life all living things and animality all
    animals and rationality all men now if this formal unity of
    any such essential or metaphysical grade of being were regarded as
    a real unity monism would be of course the logically inevitable
    corollary of the theory
    but the formal unity of any such essential grade of being
    scotists will not admit to be a real unity though they hold it to
    be characteristic of reality independently of our thought they
    contend that this unity is quite compatible with the real
    plurality conferred upon being by the principles which
    individuate the latter and thus they cannot be fairly accused of
    monism their reasoning here is characteristically subtle just as
    any metaphysical grade of being considered as an object of
    thought is in itself neither manifold individually nor one
    universallyso that as thomists say designating it in this
    condition as the universale directum or metaphysicum or
    fundamentale or quoad rem conceptam we can truly affirm of
    it in this condition neither that it is one logically as a
    universal nor that it is manifold really as multiplied in
    actual individuals160so likewise scotists contend it is in
    this condition ontologically as an entity in the real order
    independently of thought and as such has a unity of its own a
    formal unity which while uniting in a formal unity all the
    individuals that embody it is itself incapable of fitting this
    grade of being for actual existence and therefore admits those
    ultimate individuating principles which make it a real manifold in
    the actual order161
    thus the metaphysical grade of being which as considered in
    itself thomists hold to be an abstraction having no other unity
    than that which thought confers upon it by making it logically
    universal scotists on the contrary hold to be as such something
    positive in the ontological order having there a formal unity
    corresponding to the conceptual or logical unity which thought
    confers upon it by universalizing it the metaphysical grade of
    being thus conceived as something positive in the real order
    scotists will not admit to be a reality nor the unity which
    characterizes it a real unity but after all if such a
    formality with its proportionate unity is independent of
    thought and if on the other hand universality is the work of
    thought so that the universal as such cannot be real it is not
    easy to see how the scotist doctrine escapes the error of extreme
    realism the metaphysical grade of being is a formality only
    because it is made abstract by thought and it has unity only
    because it is made logically universal by thought therefore to
    contend that as such it is something positive in the real order
    independently of thought is to reify the abstract and universal
    as such which is extreme realism
chapter v reality and the true
40 ontological truth considered from analysis of experiencewe have seen
that when the mind thinks of any reality it apprehends it as one that
ontological unity is a transcendental attribute of being and this
consideration led us to consider the manifoldness and the distinctions
which characterize the totality of our experience now man himself is a
real being surrounded by all the other real beings that constitute the
universe moreover he finds himself endowed with faculties which bring him
into conscious relations both with himself and with those other beings
and only by the proper interpretation of these relations can he understand
aright his place in the universe the first in order of these relations is
that of reality to mind 25 this relation between mind and reality is
what we understand by truth
now truth is attributed both to knowledge and to things we say that a
person thinks or judges truly that his knowledge is true or correct
or accurate when things really are as he thinks or judges them to be
the truth which we thus ascribe to knowledge to the mind interpreting
reality is logical truth a relation of concord or conformity of the
mind interpreting realityor of the minds judgment about realitywith
the reality itself162 logical truth is dealt with in logic and
epistemology we are concerned here only with the truth that is attributed
to reality to things themselves ontological metaphysical
transcendental truth as it is called there is nothing abstruse or
farfetched about the use of the terms true and truth as equivalent to
real and reality we speak of true gold a true friend a
veritable hero etc now what do we mean by thus ascribing truth to a
thing we mean that it corresponds to a mental type or ideal we call a
liquid true wine or real wine for instance when it verifies in itself
the definition we have formed of the nature of wine hence whenever we
apply the terms true or truth to a thing we shall find that we are
considering that thing not absolutely and in itself but in reference to an
idea in our minds we do not say of a thing simply that it is true we say
that it is truly such or such a thing ie that it is really of a
certain nature already conceived by our minds if the appearance of the
thing suggests comparison with some such ideal type or nature and if the
thing is seen on examination not really to verify this nature in itself
we say that it is not really or truly such or such a thing eg that a
certain liquid is not really wine or is not true wine when we have no
such ideal type to which to refer a thing when we do not know its nature
cannot classify and name it we have to suspend our judgment and say that
we do not know what the thing really is hence for example the new
rays discovered by rntgen were called provisionally x rays their real
nature being at first unknown we see then that real or ontological
truth is simply reality considered as conformable with an ideal type with
an idea in the mind
whence does the human mind derive these ideal types these concepts or
definitions of the nature of things it derives them from actually
experienced reality by abstraction comparison generalization and
reflection on the data of its experience163 hence it follows that the
ontological truth of things is not known by the mind antecedently to the
formation of the mental type it is of course in the things antecedently
to any judgment we form about the things and the logical truth of our
judgments is dependent on it for logical truth is the conformity of our
judgments with the real nature of things but antecedently to all exercise
of human thought antecedently to our conception of the nature of a thing
the thing has not for us formal or actual ontological truth it has
only fundamental or potential ontological truth if in this condition
reality had actual ontological truth for us there would be no ground for
our distinguishing mentally between the reality and the truth of things
whereas the existence of this mental or logical distinction is undeniable
the concept of reality is the concept of something absolute the concept
of ontological truth is the concept of something relative not of an
absolute but of a relative property of being
    but if for the human mind the ontological truth of things isat
    least proximately immediately and in the first placetheir
    conformity with the abstract concepts of essences or natures
    concepts derived by the mind from an analysis of its experience
    how can this ontological truth be one for all men or immutable
    and necessary for since men form different and divergent and
    conflicting conceptions as to the natures of things and so have
    different views and standards of truth for things ontological
    truth would seem according to the exposition just outlined to be
    not one but manifold not immutable but variable consequences
    which surely cannot be admitted the answer to this difficulty
    will lead us to a deeper and more fundamental conception of what
    ontological truth really is
    first then we must consider that all men are endowed with the
    same sort of intellect an intellect capable of some insight at
    least into the nature of things that therefore they abstract the
    same transcendental notions and the same widest concepts from
    their experience transcendental concepts of being unity truth
    goodness generic concepts of substance matter spirit cause of
    accident quantity multitude number identity similarity
    distinction diversity etc they also form the same specific
    concepts of possible essences although therefore they may
    disagree and err in regard to the application of those concepts
    especially of the lower richer and more complex specific
    concepts to the actual data of their experience they agree in
    the fact that they have those common concepts or ideatypes of
    reality also in the fact that when they apply those concepts
    rightly ie by logically true judgments to the things
    that make up their experience they have so far grasped the real
    natures of these things and finally in recognizing that the
    ontological truth of these things lies in the conformity of the
    latter with their true and proper mental types or essences and
    just as each of these latter is one indivisible immutable
    necessary and eternal 14 15 so is the ontological truth of
    things whether possible or actual one indivisible immutable
    necessary and eternal of course just as the human mind does not
    constitute but only apprehends reality so the human mind does not
    constitute the ontological truth of reality but only apprehends
    it every reality is capable of producing in the human mind a more
    or less adequate mental representation of itself in this lies
    what we may call the potential or fundamental ontological truth of
    reality when it does produce such a mental concept of itself its
    relation of conformity to this concept is its formal ontological
    truth of course the human mind may err in applying to any reality
    a wrong concept when it does it has so far failed to grasp the
    real nature of the thing and therefore the ontological truth which
    is really identical with this nature but the thing still has its
    ontological truth independently of the erring mind not only
    fundamental truth but also possibly formal truth in so far as it
    may be rightly apprehended and thus related to its proper mental
    type by other human minds reality itself therefore is not and
    cannot be false as we shall see more fully later error or
    falsity is an accident only of the mind interpreting reality
41 ontological truth considered synthetically from the standpoint of its
ultimate real basisso far we have explained ontological truth as a
relation of reality to the human intelligence but this relation is not
one of dependence the objective term of the relation the reality itself
is anterior to the human mind it is not constituted by the latter the
subjective term the abstract concept is indeed as a vital product
dependent on the mind but as representative of reality it is determined
only by the latter is there however an intelligence to which reality is
essentially conformed other than the human intelligence granted the
actual existence of contingent realities and granted that the human mind
can derive from these realities rational principles which it sees to be
necessarily and universally applicable to all the data of experience we
can demonstrate the existence of a necessary being a first and
selfexistent intelligence realizing then that god has created all
things according to infinite wisdom we can see that the essences of
things are imitations of exemplar ideas in the divine mind 20 on the
divine mind they depend essentially for their reality and intelligibility
it is because all created realities including the human mind itself are
adumbrations of the divine essence that they are intelligible to the
human mind thus we see that in the ontological order in the order of
real gradation and dependence among things as distinct from the order of
human experience164 the reason why reality has ontological truth for
the human mind is because it is antecedently and essentially in accord
with the divine mind from which it derives its intelligibility although
therefore ontological truth is for us proximately and immediately the
conformity of reality with our own conceptions it is primarily and
fundamentally the essential conformity of all reality with the divine
mind all reality actual and possible including the divine essence
itself is actually comprehended by the divine mind is actually in
conformity with the exemplar ideas in the divine mind and has therefore
ontological truth even independently of its relation to created minds but
in the impossible hypothesis of the absence of all intellect such a
thing as truth would be inconceivable165
the reason therefore why things are ontologically true for our minds
why our minds can apprehend their essences why we can have any true
knowledge about them is in fact because both our minds and all things
else being expressions of the divine essence are in essential conformity
with the divine intellect not that we must know all this in order to have
any logical truth any true knowledge about things or in order to
ascribe to things the ontological truth which consists in their conformity
with our conception of their nature the atheist can have a true knowledge
of things and can recognize in them their conformity with his mental
conception of their nature only he is unaware of the real and fundamental
reason why he can do so nor can he of course while denying the
existence of god rise to the fuller conception of ontological truth which
consists in the essential conformity of all reality with the divine
intellect and its essential dependence on the latter for its
intelligibility to the human intellect
naturally it is this latter and fuller conception of ontological truth
that has been at all times expounded by scholastic philosophers166 we
may therefore define ontological truth as the essential conformity of
reality as an object of thought with intellect and primarily and
especially with the divine intellect
    the conformity of reality with the divine intellect is described
    as essential to reality in the sense that the reality is
    dependent on the divine intellect for its intelligibility it
    derives its intelligibility from the latter the conformity of
    reality with the human intellect is also essential in the sense
    that potential conformity with the latter is inseparable from
    reality it is an aspect really identical with and only logically
    distinct from the latter but inasmuch as the actual conformity
    of reality with our human conception of it is contingent on the
    existence of human intelligences and is not ultimately
    dependent on the latter inasmuch as reality does not derive its
    intelligibility ultimately from this conceptionseeing that
    rather this conception is derived from the reality and is
    ultimately dependent on the divine exemplarthis conformity of
    reality with the human mind is sometimes spoken of as accidental
    to reality in contrast with the relation of dependence which
    exists between reality and the divine mind
    bearing in mind that reality derives its intelligibility from its
    essential conformity with the divine mind and that the human mind
    derives its truth from the reality we can understand how it has
    been said of truth in general that it is first in the uncreated
    intellect then in things then in created intellects that the
    primary source and measure of all truth is the divine intellect
    itself unmeasured mensurans non mensuratus that created
    reality is measured by or conformed with the divine intellect
    and is in turn the measure of the human intellect conforming the
    latter with itself mensurans et mensurata and that finally
    the human intellect measured by created reality and the divine
    mind is itself the measure of no natural things but only of the
    products of human art intellectus noster  non mensurans
    quidem res naturales sed artificiales tantum167
    is truth one then or is it manifold logical truth is
    manifoldmultiplied by the number of created intelligences and by
    the number of distinct cognitions in each the primary ontological
    truth which consists in the conformity of all reality with the
    divine intellect is one there is no real plurality of archetype
    ideas in the divine mind they are manifold only to our imperfect
    human mode of thinking the secondary ontological truth which
    consists in the conformity of things with the abstract concepts of
    created intelligences is conditioned by and multiplied with the
    manifoldness of the latter168
    again to the question is truth eternal or temporalwe reply
    in a similar way that the truth of the divine comprehension of
    reality actual and possible is eternal but that no other truth
    is eternal there is no eternal truth outside of god created
    things are not eternal and truth is consecutive on reality where
    there is no reality there is no ontological truth the conformity
    of things with human conceptions and the logical truth of the
    latter are both alike temporal169
    finally we may say that the truth of the divine intellect is
    immutable and so is the essential conformity of all reality
    with the divine intellect the change to which created reality is
    essentially subject is itself essentially conformed with the
    divine mind it is so to speak part and parcel of the
    ontological truth of this reality in relation to the divine mind
    and cannot therefore interfere with this ontological truth when
    the acorn grows into the oak the whole process has its ontological
    truth that of the acorn changes not into falsity but into
    another truth that of the oak170 we see then that as things
    change their truth does not change in the sense of being lost or
    giving place to falsity the truth of one state changes to the
    truth of another while the ontological truth of the changing
    reality perseveres immutably
    the same immutability attaches to the truth of things in relation
    to the human mind with the qualification to which we shall
    return 43 that they may occasion false judgments in the human
    mind and on that account be designated false
    finally the logical truth which has its seat in created
    intelligences is mutable it may be increased or diminished
    acquired or lost
42 ontological truth a transcendental attribute of realityfrom what has
been said it will be apparent that ontological truth is a transcendental
attribute of reality that is to say whatever is real whether actual or
possible is ontologically true or in scholastic terminology omne ens
est verum ens et verum convertuntur all being is true the real and the
true are convertible terms for in the first place there is no mode or
category of real being of which the human mind actually thinks to which
it does not attribute ontological truth in the sense of conformity with
the right human conception of it moreover the proper object of the human
intellect is reality all true knowledge is knowledge of reality reality
of itself is manifestly knowable intelligible and thus potentially or
fundamentally true and on the other hand intellect is according to the
measure of its capacity a faculty of insight into all reality into
whatever is real intellectus potens fieri omnia anima  quodammodo
fit omnia171 deny either of these postulates regarding the terms of
the ontological relation reality and mind and all rational thought is
instantly paralysed hence in so far as a reality becomes an actual
object of human knowledge it has formal ontological truth in relation both
to the human mind and to the divine mind while antecedently to human
thought it is fundamentally true or intelligible to the human mind and
of course formally true in relation to the divine mind
thus we see that whatever is real is ontologically true that ontological
truth is really identical with real being that applied to the latter it
is not a mere extrinsic denomination but signifies an intrinsic positive
aspect of reality viz the real essential or transcendental relation
of all real being to mind or intellect a relation which is logically or
conceptually distinct from the notion of reality considered in itself
43 attribution of falsity to real beingif ontological truth is really
identical with real being if it is an essential aspect of the latter a
transcendental relation of reality to mind it follows immediately that
there can be no such thing as transcendental falsity if whatever is real
is ontologically true then the ontologically false must be the unreal
must be nothingness and this is really so ontologically falsity is
nothingness we have therefore to discover the real meaning of
attributing falsity to things as when we speak of a false friend false
gold false teeth a false musical note a false measure in poetry etc
first of all then it will be noted that each such object has its own
real nature and character its proper mental correlate and therefore
its ontological truth the false friend is a true or real deceiver or
traitor or coward or whatever his real character may be the false gold
is true or real bronze or alloy or whatever it may be in reality the
false teeth are true or real ivory or whatever substance they are made
of a false musical note is a true or real note but not the proper one in
its actual setting and so of a false measure in poetry next when we
thus ascribe falsity to a friend or gold or such like we see that the
epithet false is in reality merely transferred from the false judgment
which a person is liable to make about the object we mean that to judge
that person a friend or that substance gold or those articles real
teeth would be to form a false judgment we see that it is only in the
judgment there can be falsity but we transfer the epithet to the object
because the object is likely to occasion the erroneous judgment in the
fallible human mind by reason of the resemblance of the object to
something else which it really is not we see therefore that falsity is
not in the objects but is transferred to them by a purely extrinsic
denomination on account of appearances calculated to mislead we commonly
say in such cases that things mislead us that appearances deceive
us things however do not deceive or mislead us necessarily but only
accidentally they are the occasions of our allowing ourselves to be
deceived the fallibility and limitations of our own minds in interpreting
reality are the real cause of our erroneous judgments172
secondly there is another improper sense in which we attribute falsity to
works of art which fail to realize the artists ideal in this sense we
speak of a false note in music a false measure in poetry a false
tint in painting a false curve in sculpture or architecture false
here means defective bad wanting in perfection the object being out of
harmony with the ideal or design in the practical intellect of the artist
we describe it as false after the analogy of what takes place when we
describe as false gold a substance which is out of harmony with the idea
of gold in the speculative intellect it is in relation to the
speculative not the practical intellect that things have ontological
truth all created things are of course as such in conformity not only
with the divine intellect considered as speculative but also with the
divine intellect considered as practical for god being omnipotent does
all things according to the designs of his wisdom for him nothing is
accidental nothing happens by chance but the world he has freely willed
to create is not the best possible world both in the physical and in the
moral order there are things and events which are defective which fall
short of their natural perfection this defectiveness which is properly
physical or moral evil is sometimes described as falsity lying vanity
etc on account of the discrepancy between those things and the ideal of
what they should be but all such defective realities are known to be what
they are by the divine mind and may be known as they really are by the
human mind they have therefore their ontological truth the question of
their perfection or imperfection gives rise to the consideration of quite
a different aspect of reality namely its goodness this then we must
deal with in the next place
chapter vi reality and the good
44 the good as desirable and as suitablethe notion of the good
l bonum gr  is one of the most familiar of all notions but
like all other transcendental or widely generic concepts the analysis of
it opens up some fundamental questions the princes of ancient greek
philosophy socrates plato and aristotle gave much anxious thought to
its elucidation the tentative gropings of socrates involved an ambiguity
which issued in the conflicting philosophies of stoicism and epicureanism
nor did plato succeed in bringing down from the clouds the idea of the
good which he so devotedly worshipped as the sun of the intellectual
world it needed the more sober and searching analysis of the stagyrite to
bring to light the formula so universally accepted in after ages the good
of beings is that which all desire bonum est quod omnia appetunt173
let us try to reach the fundamental idea underlying the terms good
goodness by some simple examples
the child deriving sensible pleasure from a sweetmeat cries out that is
good whatever gratifies its senses gives it sensible delight it
likes or loves such things it desires seeks yearns for in
their absence and in their presence enjoys at this stage the good
means simply the pleasuregiving but as reason develops the human being
apprehends and describes as good not merely what is pleasuregiving but
whatever satisfies any natural need or craving whether purely organic or
purely intellectual or more widely human food is good because it
satisfies a physical organic craving knowledge is good because it
satisfies a natural intellectual thirst friendship is good because it
satisfies a wider need of the heart here we notice a transition from
agreeable in the sense of pleasuregiving to agreeable in the more
proper sense of suitable or useful the good is now conceived not in the
narrow sense of what yields sensible pleasure but in the wider sense of
that which is useful or suitable for the satisfaction of a natural
tendency or need that which is the object of a natural tendency
next let us reflect with aristotle that each of the individual persons
and things that make up the world of our direct experience has an end
towards which it naturally tends there is a purpose in the existence of
each each has a nature ie an essence which is for it a principle of
development a source of all the functions and activities whereby it
continually adapts itself to its environment and thereby continually
fulfils the aim of its existence by its very nature it tends towards its
end along the proper line of its development174 in the world of
conscious beings this natural tendency is properly called appetite sense
appetite of what is apprehended as good by sense cognition and rational
appetite or will in regard to what is apprehended as good by intellect
or reason in the world of unconscious things this natural tendency is a
real tendency and is analogous to conscious appetite hence it is that
aristotle taking in all grades of real being describes the good as that
which is the object of any natural tendency or appetite whatsoever the
good is the appetibile or desirable that which all things seek
bonum est quod omnia appetunt
45 the good as an end perfecting the natureso far we have
analysed the notion of what is good for some being and we have
gathered that it implies what suits this being what contributes to the
latters realization of its end but we apply the term good to objects
and speak of their goodness apart from their direct and immediate
relation of helpfulness or suitability for us when for instance we
say of a watch that it is a good one or of a soldier that he is a
good soldier what precisely do we mean by such attribution of goodness
to things or persons a little reflection will show that it is
intelligible only in reference to an end or purpose and we mean by it
that the being we describe as good has the powers qualities equipments
which fit it for its end or purpose a being is good whose nature is
equipped and adapted for the realization of its natural end or purpose
thus we see that the notion of goodness is correlative with the notion of
an end towards which or for which a being has a natural tendency or
desire without the concept of a nature as tending to realize an end or
purpose the notion of the good would be inexplicable175 and the two
formul the good is that which beings desire or towards which they
naturally tend and the good is that which is adapted to the ends which
beings have in their existence really come to the same thing the former
statement resolving itself into the latter as the more fundamental for
the reason why anything is desirable why it is the object of a natural
tendency is because it is good and not vice versa the description of
the good as that which is desirable bonum est id quod est appetibile
is an a posteriori description a description of cause by reference to
effect176 a thing is desirable because it is good why then is it good
and therefore desirable because it suits the natural needs and is
adapted to the nature of the being that desires it or tends towards it
because it helps this being agrees with it by contributing towards
the realization of its end bonum est id quod convenit natur
appetentis the good is that which suits the nature of the being that
desires it the greatest good for a being is the realization of its end
and the means towards this are also good because they contribute to this
realization
no doubt in beings endowed with consciousness the gradual realization of
this natural tendency by the normal functioning and development of their
activities is accompanied by pleasurable feeling the latter is in fact
not an end of action itself but rather the natural concomitant the
effect and index of the healthy and normal activity of the conscious
being delectatio sequitur operationem debitam it is the pleasure felt
in tending towards the good that reveals the good to the conscious agent
that is taking pleasure in its wide sense as the feeling of wellbeing
of satisfaction with ones whole condition activities and environment
hence it is the anticipated pleasure connected by past association with a
certain line of action that stimulates the conscious being to act in that
way again it is in the first instance because a certain operation or
tendency is felt to be pleasing that it is desired and apprehended as
desirable nor does the brute beast recognize or respond to any stimulus
of action other than pleasure but manendowed with reason and reflecting
on the relation between his own nature and the activities whereby he duly
orients his life in his environmentmust see that what is pleasuregiving
or agreeable in the ordinary sense of this term is generally so because
it is agreeable in the deeper sense of being suitable to his nature
adapted to his end and therefore good
the good then is whatever suits the nature of a being tending towards
its end bonum est conveniens natur appetentis in what precisely does
this suitability consist what suits any nature perfects that nature
and suits it precisely in so far as it perfects it but whatever perfects
a nature does so only because and in so far as it is a realization of the
end towards which this nature tends here we reach a new notion that of
perfecting or perfection and one which is as essentially connected
with the notion of end or purpose as the concept of the good itself
is let us compare these notions of goodness end and perfection
we have said that a watch or a soldier are good when they are adapted to
their respective ends but they are so only because the end itself is
already good and we may ask why any such end is itself good and therefore
desirable for example why is the accurate indication of time good or
the defence of ones country and obviously in such a series of questions
we must come to something which is good and desirable in and for itself
for its own sake and not as leading and helping towards some remoter good
and this something which is good in and for itself is a last or ultimate
endan absolute not a relative good there must be such an absolute
good such an ultimate end if goodness in things is to be made
intelligible at all and it is only in so far as things tend towards this
absolute good and are adapted to it that they can be termed good the
realization of this tendency of things towards the absolute good or
ultimate end is what constitutes the goodness of those things and it
does so because it perfects their natures
    the end towards which any nature tends is the cause of this
    tendency its final cause and the influence of a final cause
    consists precisely in its goodness ie in its power of
    actualizing and perfecting a nature this influence of the good is
    sometimes described as the diffusive character of goodness
    bonum est diffusivum sui goodness tends to diffuse or
    communicate itself to multiply or reproduce itself this
    character which we may recognize in the goodness of finite
    created things is explained in the philosophy of theism as being
    derived with this goodness itself from the uncreated goodness of
    god who is the ultimate end and supreme good of all reality every
    creature has its own proper ultimate end and highest perfection in
    its being a manifestation an expression a shewing forth of the
    divine goodness it has its own actuality and goodness distinct
    from but dependent on the divine goodness but inasmuch as its
    goodness is an expression or imitation of the divine goodness we
    may by an extrinsic denomination say that the creature is good
    by the divine goodness in a similar way and without any
    suspicion of pantheism we may speak of the goodness of creatures
    as being a participation of the divine goodness 5
46 the perfect analysis of the notion of perfectionit is the
realization of the end or object or purpose of a nature that perfects the
latter and so far formally constitutes the goodness of this nature now
the notion of perfection is not exactly the same as the notion of
goodness although what is perfect is always good what is good is not
always perfect the term perfect comes from the latin perficere
perfectum meaning fully made thoroughly achieved completed finished
strictly speaking it is only finite being potential being capable of
completion that can be spoken of as perfectible or when fully
actualized perfect but by universal usage the term has been extended
to the reality of the infinite being we speak of the latter as the
infinitely perfect being not meaning that this being has been
perfected but that he is the purely actual and infinite reality
applied to any finite being the term perfect means that this being has
attained to the full actuality which we regard as its end as the ideal of
its natural capacity and tendency the finite being is subject to change
it is not actualized all at once but gradually by the play of those
active and passive powers which are rooted in its nature it is gradually
actualized and thus perfected gaining more and more reality or being by
the process but what directs this process and determines the line of its
tendency the good which is the end of the being the good towards
which the being by its nature tends this good which is the term of the
beings natural tendencywhich is in other words its endis the
fundamental principle177 which perfects the nature of the being is the
source and explanation of the process whereby this nature is perfected
bonum est perfectivum the good is the perfecting principle of
reality the end itself is the good which perfects bonum quod the
perfecting itself is the formal cause of the goodness of the being that
is perfected bonum quo the being itself which is perfected and
therefore ameliorated or increased in goodness is the bonum cui in
proportion therefore to the degree in which a being actually possesses
the perfection due to its nature it is good in so far as it lacks this
perfection it is wanting in goodness or is as we shall see
ontologically bad or evil
while then the notion of the good implies a relation of the appetite
or natural tendency of a being towards its end the notion of
perfection or perfecting conveys to our minds actual reality simply
or the actualizing of reality the term perfection is commonly used as
synonymous with actual reality in so far forth as a reality is actual we
say it has perfection but we do not call it perfect simply unless
it has all the actuality we conceive to be due to its nature so long as
it lacks any of this it is only perfect secundum quid ie in
proportion to the actuality it does possess hence we define the perfect
as that which is actually lacking in nothing that is due to its nature
the perfect is therefore not simply the good but the complete or finished
good and it is even logically distinct from the latter inasmuch as the
actuality connoted by the former has added to it the relation to appetite
connoted by the latter similarly goodness is logically distinct from
perfection by adding the like relation to the latter although a thing
has goodness in so far as it has perfection and vice versa still its
perfection is its actuality simply while its goodness is this actuality
considered as the term of its natural appetite or tendency
47 grades of perfection reality as standard of valuewe may distinguish
between stages of perfection in the changing reality of the same being or
grades of perfection in comparing with one another different classes or
orders of being
in one and the same being we may distinguish between what is called its
first or essential perfection which means its essence or nature
considered as capable of realizing its purpose in existence by tending
effectively towards its end what is called its intermediate or
accidental perfection which consists in all the powers faculties and
functions whereby this tendency is gradually actualized and what is
called its final or integral perfection which consists in its full
actualization by complete attainment of its end
again comparing with one another the individual beings that make up our
experience we classify them we arrange them in a hierarchical order of
relative perfection of inferiority or superiority according to the
different grades of reality or perfection which we think we apprehend in
them thus we look on living things as a higher nobler more perfect
order of beings than nonliving things on animal life as a higher form of
being than plant life on intelligence as higher than instinct on will as
superior to sense appetite on mind or spirit as nobler than matter and
so on now all such comparisons involve the apprehension of some standard
of value an estimation of relative values or relative grades of
perfection in things is unintelligible except in reference to some such
standard it involves of necessity the intuition of such a standard we
feel sure that some at least of our appreciations are unquestionably
correct that man for instance is superior to the brute beast and the
latter superior to the plant that the lowest manifestation of lifein the
amba or whatever monocellular microscopic germ may be the lowestis
higher on the scale of being than the highest expression of the
mechanical chemical and physical forces of the inorganic universe and if
we ask ourselves what is our standard of comparison what is our test or
measure and why are we sure of our application of it in such cases our
only answer is that our standard of comparison is reality itself actual
being perfection that we rely implicitly on our intuition of such actual
reality as manifested to us in varying grades or degrees within our
experience that without claiming to be infallible in our judgments of
comparison in our classifications of things in our appreciations of
their relative perfection we may justly assume reality itself to be as
such intelligible and the human mind to be capable of obtaining some true
and certain insight into the nature of reality
48 the good the real and the actualhaving compared perfection with
goodness and with being let us next compare the two latter notions
with each other we shall see presently that every actual being has its
ontological goodness that these are in reality identical but there is a
logical distinction between them in the first place the term being is
applied par excellence to substances rather than to accidents but we do
not commonly speak of an individual substance a person or thing as good
in reference to essential or substantial perfection178 when we describe
a man or a machine as good we mean that the man possesses those
accidental perfections those qualities and endowments which are
suitable to his nature as a man that the machine possesses those
properties which adapt it to its end in the second place the notion of
being is absolute that of the good is relative for it implies the notion
not of reality simply but of reality as desirable agreeable suitable as
perfecting the nature of a subject as being the end or conducive to the
end towards which this nature tends and since what thus perfects must
be something not potential but actual it follows that unlike real truth
real goodness is identical not with potential but only with actual
reality it is not an attribute of the abstract possible essence but
only of the concrete actually existing essence179
from the fact that the notion of the good is relative it follows that the
same thing can be simultaneously good and bad in different relations
what is one mans meat is another mans poison
49 kinds of goodness divisions of the gooda the goodness of a
being may be considered in relation to this being itself or to other
beings what is good for a being itself what makes it intrinsically and
formally good bonum sibi is whatever perfects it and in the fullest
sense the realization of its end hence we speak of a virtuous upright
man whose conduct is in keeping with his nature and conducive to the
realization of his end as a good man but a being may also be good to
others bonum alteri by an extrinsic active effective goodness
inasmuch as by its action it may help other beings in the realization of
their ends in this sense a beneficent man who wishes the wellbeing of
his fellowmen and helps them to realize this wellbeing is called a good
man this kind of goodness is what is often nowadays styled
philanthropy in christian ethics it is known as charity
b we have described the good as the term or object of natural tendency
or appetite in the domain of beings not endowed with the power of
conscious apprehension determinism rules this natural tendency this
latter is always oriented towards the real good it never acts amiss it
is always directed by the divine wisdom which has given to things their
natures but in the domain of conscious living agents this natural
tendency is consequent on apprehension it takes the form of instinctive
animal appetite or of rational volition and since this apprehension of
the good may be erroneous since what is not really good but evil may be
apprehended as good the appetite or will which follows this
apprehensionnil volitum nisi praecognitummay be borne towards evil
sub ratione boni hence the obvious distinction between real good and
apparent goodbonum verum and bonum apparens
c in reference to any individual subjecta man for instanceit is
manifest that other beings can be good for him in so far as any of them
can be his end or a means to the attainment of his end they are called in
reference to him objective goods and their goodness objective
goodness but it is equally clear that they are good for him only because
he can perfect his own nature by somehow identifying or uniting himself
with them possessing using or enjoying them this possession of the
objective good constitutes what has been already referred to as formal
or subjective goodness180
d we have likewise already referred to the fact that in beings endowed
with consciousness and appetite proper whether sentient or rational the
function of possessing or attaining to what is objectively good to what
suits and perfects the nature of the subject has for its natural
concomitant a feeling of pleasure satisfaction wellbeing delight
enjoyment and we have observed that this pleasurable feeling may then
become a stimulus to fresh desire may indeed be desired for its own sake
now this subjective pleasuregiving possession of an objective good has
been itself called by scholastics bonum delectabiledelectable or
delightgiving good the objective good itself considered as an end and
the perfecting of the subject by its attainment have been called bonum
honestumgood which is really and absolutely such in itself while if
the good in question is really such only when considered as a means to the
attainment of an end of something that is good in itself the former is
called bonum utileuseful good181
in this important triple division bonum honestum is used in the wide
sense in which it embraces any real good whether physical or moral as
applied to man it would therefore embrace whatever perfects his physical
life as well as whatever perfects his nature considered as a rational and
therefore moral being but in common usage it has been restricted to the
latter and is in this sense synonymous with moral good virtue182
furthermore a good which is an end and therefore desirable for its own
sake whether it be physical or moral can be at the same time a means to
some higher good and desired for the sake of this latter hence st
thomas following aristotle reduces all the moral goods which are
desirable in themselves to two kinds that which is desirable only for
itself which is the last end final felicity and those which while good
in themselves are also conducive to the former and these are the
virtues183
    when these various kinds of goodness are examined in reference to
    the nature conduct and destiny of man they raise a multitude of
    problems which belong properly to ethics and natural theology the
    fact that man has a composite nature which is the seat of various
    and conflicting tendencies of the flesh and of the spirit that
    he perceives in himself a double law a higher and a lower
    appetite that he is subject to error in his apprehension of the
    good that he apprehends a distinction between pleasure and duty
    that he feels the latter to be the path to ultimate happinessall
    this accentuates the distinction between real and apparent good
    between bonum honestum bonum utile and bonum delectabile
    the existence of god is established in natural theology and in
    ethics aided by psychology it is proved that no finite good can
    be the last end of man that god the supreme infinite good is
    his last end and that only in the possession of god by knowledge
    and love can man find his complete and final felicity
50 goodness a transcendental attribute of beingwe have shown that there
is a logical distinction between the concept of goodness and that of
being we have now to show that the distinction is not real in other
words that goodness is a transcendental attribute of all actual reality
that all being in so far forth as it is actual has
goodnesstranscendental or ontological goodness in the sense of
appetibility desirability suitability as already explained
when the thesis is formulated in the traditional scholastic statement
omne ens est bonum all being is good it sounds a startling paradox
surely it cannot be contended that everything is good a cancer in the
stomach is not good lies are not good yet these are actual realities
cancers exist and lies are told therefore not every reality is good this
is unquestionably true but it does not contradict the thesis rightly
understood the true meaning of the thesis is not that every being is
good in all respects or possesses such goodness as would justify us in
describing it as good in the ordinary sense but that every being
possesses some goodness every being in so far as it has actuality has
formal intrinsic goodness or is in other words the term or object of
natural tendency or desire this goodness which we predicate of any and
every actual being may be 1 the term of the natural tendency or
appetite of that being itself bonum sibi or 2 it may be conceivably
the term of the appetite of some other being bonum alteri let us see
whether it can be shown that every actual being has goodness in one or
both of these senses
1 bonum sibiis there any intelligible sense in which it can be said
that the actuality of any and every existing being is good for that
beingbonum sibi there is for if we recognize in every such being as
we must a nature a potentiality of further actualization a tendency
towards a state of fuller actuality which is its end and if
furthermore we recognize that every such being at any instant not merely
is or exists but is becoming or changing and thereby tending
effectively towards its end we must admit not merely that the full
attainment of its end its integral or final perfection is desired by
and perfects and is good for that beings nature but also that the
partial realization of its end or in other words the actuality it has
at any instant in its changing condition of existence its accidental or
intermediate perfection is similarly good for it and even that its
actual existence as compared with its mere possibility its first or
essential perfection is desirable and good for its nature actually
existing beings are intelligible only because they exist for some end or
purpose which by their very existence activities operations conduct
they tend to realize if this be admitted we cannot deny that the full
attainment of this end or purpose is good for themsuitable desirable
agreeable perfecting them in so far as they fail in this purpose they
are wanting in goodness they are bad evil for the realization of their
end their natures are endowed with appropriate powers faculties forces
by the normal functioning of which they gradually develop and grow in
actuality no real being is by nature inert or aimless no real being is
without its connatural faculties forces and functions but the natural
result of all operation of all action and interaction among things is
actualization of the potential amelioration development growth in
perfection and goodness by gradual realization of ends if by accident any
of these powers is wanting or acts amiss by failing to contribute its due
perfection to the nature there is in the being a proportionate want of
goodnessit is so far bad evil but even so the nature of the thing
preserves its fundamental orientation towards its end towards the
perfection natural to it and struggles as it were against the eviltries
to make good the deficiency a cancer in the stomach is never good for
the stomach or for the living subject of which the stomach is an
organ for the living being the cancer is an evil a failure of one of
the organs to discharge its functions normally an absence of a good
viz the healthy functioning of an organ but the cancerous growth
considered in itself and for itself biologically and chemically has its
own nature purpose tendencies laws nor can we deny that its
development according to these laws is good for its specific
nature184 bonum sibi
it may be asked how can the first or essential perfection of an
existing substance which is nothing else than the actual existence of the
nature itself be conceived as good for this nature it is so inasmuch
as the actual existence of the substance is the first stage in the process
by which the nature tends towards its end an existing nature desires and
tends towards the conservation of its own being185 hence the saying
selfpreservation is the first law of nature and hence too the
scholastic aphorism melius est esse quam non esse
the argument just outlined tends to show that every nature of which we can
have direct experience or in other words every finite contingent nature
is bonum sibi formally and intrinsically good for itself
it is of course equally applicable to the uncreated necessary being
himself the infinite actuality of the divine nature is essentially the
term and end of the divine love therefore every actual being has
intrinsic formal goodness whereby it is bonum sibi ie its
actuality is in regard to its nature really an object of tendency
desire appetite a something that really suits and perfects this nature
thus understood the thesis formulates no mere tautology it makes a real
assertion about real being nor can the truth of this assertion be proved
otherwise than by an argument based as ours is on the recognition of
purpose of final causality of adaptation of means to ends in the actual
universe of our experience
notwithstanding all that has been said it may still be asked why should
those individual beings whose existence we have claimed to be good for
them exist at all it will be objected that there exist multitudes of
beings whose existence is manifestly not good for them take for
instance the case of the reprobate if they wish their total
annihilation if they desire the total cessation of their being rather
than an existence of eternal punishment they undoubtedly wish it as a
good is annihilation or absolute nonexistence really a good for
them de facto it is for them considered in their actual condition
which is accidental to their nature christ said of the scandalgiver
what is surely true of the reprobate it were better for that man had he
never been born we may admit therefore that for the reprobate
themselves simple nonexistence is more desirable and better than their
actual concrete state of existence as reprobate because simple
nonexistence is for them the simple negation of their reality whereas
the absolute and irreparable loss of their last end the total frustration
of the purpose for which they came into being is for them the greatest
conceivable privation but this condition of the reprobate is accidental
to their nature alien to the purpose of their being a selfincurred
failure a deliberate thwarting of their natural tendency it remains
true therefore that their nature is good though incapable of progress
its purpose is good though frustrated in so far as they have actual
reality they have essential goodness their natures still tend towards
selfconservation and the realization of their end they form no real
exception to the general truth that it is better to be than not to be
melius est esse quam non esse it is not annihilation as such that is
desired by them but only as a less evil alternative than the eternal
privation of their last end186 if the evils accidentally and actually
attaching to a certain state of existence make the continuance of this
state undesirable for a being it by no means follows that the
continuance of this being in existence simply and in itself is less
desirable than nonexistence
2 bonum alterieven however if it were granted that the actual
existence of some beings is not good for themselves might it not
nevertheless be good for other beings and in relation to the general
scheme of things is there not an intelligible sense in which every
actual being is bonum alteri good for other things here again the same
experience of actual reality which teaches us that each individual being
has a nature whereby it tends to its own good as a particular end also
teaches us that in the general scheme of reality things are helpful to one
another nay are intended by their interaction and cooperation with one
another to subserve the wider end which is the good of the whole system of
reality there is little use in puzzling as people sometimes do over the
raison dtre of individual things or classes of things in human
experience over the good or the evil of the existence of these things
over the question whether or not it would be better that these things
should never have existed until we have consulted not any isolated
portion of human experience but this experience as a whole in this we
can find sufficient evidence for the prevalence of a beneficent purpose
everywhere not that we can read this purpose in every detail of reality
even when we have convinced ourselves that all creation is the work of a
supreme being who is infinite goodness itself we cannot gain that full
insight into the secret designs of his providence which would be needed
in order to justify his ways in all things but when we have convinced
ourselves that the created universe exists because god wills it we can
understand that every actual reality in it must be good as being an
object or term of the divine will every created reality is thus bonum
alteri inasmuch as it is good for god not of course in the impossible
sense of perfecting him but as an imitation and expression of the
goodness of the divine nature itself the experience which enables us to
reach a knowledge of the existence and nature of god the creator
conserver and providence of the actual universe also teaches us that
this universe can have no other ultimate end or good than god himself
ie gods will to manifest his goodness by the extrinsic glory which
consists in the knowledge and love of him by his rational creatures the
omnipotence of the creator his freedom in creating and our knowledge of
the universe he has actually chosen to create from among indefinite
possible worlds all alike convince us that the actual world is neither
the best possible nor the worst possible absolutely speaking but our
knowledge of his wisdom and power also convinces us that for the purpose
of manifesting his glory in the measure and degree in which he has
actually chosen to manifest it by creating the existing universe and
relatively to the attainment of this specific purpose the existing
universe is the best possible
51 optimism and pessimismthose few outlines of the philosophy of
theismtheses established in natural theologywill reveal to us the place
of theism in relation to optimist and pessimist systems of philosophy
pessimism as an outcome of philosophical speculation is the proclamation
in some form or other of the conviction that human existence nay
existence in general is a failure an evil it is the analogue in
relation to will of what scepticism is in relation to intellect and it
is no less selfcontradictory than the latter while the latter points to
total paralysis of thought the former involves a like paralysis of all
will all effort all purpose in existencea philosophy of despair
despondency gloom both are equally erroneous equally indicative of
philosophical failure equally repugnant to the normal healthy mind
optimism on the other hand is expressive of the conviction that good
predominates in all existence melius est esse quam non esse that at
the root of all reality there is a beneficent purpose which is ever being
realized that there is in things not merely a truth that can be known but
a goodness that can be loved existence is not an evil life is not a
failure this is a philosophy of hope buoyancy effort and attainment
but is it true or is it an empty illusion well to maintain that the
actual universe is the best absolutely would of course be absurd if
leibnizs principle of sufficient reason obliged him to contend in face
of the painfully palpable facts of physical and moral evil in the
universe that this universe is the best absolutely possible the best
that god could create we can only say so much the worse for his
principle the true optimism is that of the theist who admitting the
prevalence of evil in the universe in the sense to be explained
presently at the same time holds that throughout creation the good
predominates that gods beneficent purpose in regard to individuals does
in the main prevail and that his glory is manifested in giving to
rational creatures the perfection and felicity of knowing and loving
himself for the theist then the problem of the existence of evil in the
universe assumes the general form of reconciling the fact of evil in gods
creation with the fact of gods infinite power and goodness this is a
problem for natural theology here we have merely to indicate some general
principles arising from the consideration of evil as the correlative and
antithesis of goodness
52 evil its nature and causes manicheismadmitting the existence of
evil in the universe the scholastic apparently withdraws the admission
forthwith by denying the reality of evil the paradox explains itself by
comparing the notions of good and evil and thus trying to arrive at a
proper conception of the latter
if ontological goodness is really identical with actual being if being is
good in so far as it is actual then it would appear that ontological evil
must be identical with nonbeing nothingness and so it is in the sense
that no evil is a positive actual reality that all evil is an absence of
reality but just as the good though really identical with the actual is
nevertheless logically distinct from the latter so is evil logically
distinct from nothingness or the absence of reality as we have seen the
good is that which perfects a nature that which is due to a nature as the
realization of the end of the latter so too is evil the privation of
any perfection due to a nature the absence of something positive and
something which ought to be present evil therefore is not a mere
negation or absence of being it is the absence of a good or in other
words the absence of a reality that should be present all privation is
negation but not vice versa for privation is the negation of something
due the absence of virtue is a mere negation in an animal in man it is
a privation hence the commonly accepted definition of evil malum est
privatio boni debiti evil is the privation of the goodness due to a
thing187 evil is always therefore a defect a deficiency the notion
of evil is a relative not an absolute notion as goodness is the right
relation of a nature to its proper end so is evil a failure a defect in
this relation malum est privatio ordinis ad finem debitum188
the very finiteness of a finite being is the absence of further reality in
this being but as this further reality is not due to such a being its
absence which has sometimes been improperly described as metaphysical
evil is not rightly regarded as evil at all except indeed we were to
conceive it as happening to the infinite being himself which would be a
contradiction in thought
evil then in its formal concept is nothing positive it is essentially
negative or rather privative for this very reason when we consider evil
in the concrete ie as affecting actual things as occurring in the
actual universewe can scarcely speak of it with propriety as
existingwe see that it essentially involves some positive real
subject which it affects some nature which by affecting it renders so
far evil cancer in the stomach is a real evil of the stomach a defect a
deficiency a failure in the adaptation of the stomach to its proper end
it is not itself a positive absolute evil entity in so far as it is
itself a positive physical reality a growth of living cells it has its
own nature its natural tendency its development towards an end in
accordance with biological laws in all of which it verifies the
definition of ontological goodness but the existence of such a growth in
the stomach is pathological ie a disease of the stomach a prevention
of the natural normal function of the stomach a failure of the latters
adaptation to its end and hence an evil for the stomach lying too
is an evil a moral evil of man as a moral subject but this does not mean
that the whole physical process of thinking judging speaking whereby a
man lies is itself a positive evil entity the thinking is itself good as
a physical act so is the speaking in itself good as a physical act
whatever of positive reality there is in the whole process is good
ontologically good but there is a want of conformity of the language
with the thought entailing a privation or failure of adaptation of
the man as a moral subject with his end with his real good and in this
failure of adaptation this privation of goodness lies the moral evil of
lying
evil then has a material or subjective cause viz some positive
actual reality which is good in so far forth as it is actual but which
is evil or wanting in something due to it in so far as the privation
which we have called evil affects it
but evil has no formal cause formally it is not a reality but a
privation evil has no formal cause but is rather the privation of a
form189
nor has evil any final cause for it consists precisely in the failure
of a beings natural tendency towards its end in the want of adaptation
of a nature to its end nor has evil a final cause but is rather the
privation of a beings due relation to its natural end190 evil cannot
be the natural result of a beings tendency towards its end or a means to
the attainment of this end for that which is really an end must be good
and a means derives its goodness from the end to which it is a means the
good because it is an end or a means to an end is desirable and so
too might evil be defined a posteriori as that which is the object of
no natural tendency or desire that from which all things are averse
malum est quod nullum ens appetit vel a quo omnia aversantur nor can
evil be itself an end or be as such desired or desirable real evil is no
doubt often sought and desired by conscious beings sometimes physical
evil sometimes moral evil but it is always desired and embraced as a
good sub specie boni ie when apprehended as here and now good in
the sense of gratifying pleasuregiving bonum delectabile this is
possible because pleasure especially organic sensible pleasure as
distinct from the state of real wellbeing which characterizes true
happiness is not the exclusive concomitant of seeking and possessing a
real good it often accompanies the seeking and possessing of a merely
apparent good and in such cases it is itself a merely apparent good and
in reality evil the unfortunate man who commits suicide does not embrace
evil as such he wrongly judges death to be good as being in his view a
lesser evil than the miseries of his existence and under this aspect of
goodness he embraces death
finally we have to inquire whether evil has an efficient cause seeing
that it is not merely a logical figment seeing that it really affects
actual things that it really occurs in the actual universe it must have
a real source among the efficient causes of these actual things that make
up the universe it is undoubtedly due to the action of efficient causes
ie to the failure the defective action of efficient causes but
being itself something negative a privation it cannot properly be said
to have an efficient cause for the influence of an efficient cause is
positive action which in turn must have for its term something positive
something real and therefore good hence st augustine very properly says
that evil should be described as having a deficient cause rather than
an efficient cause191 in other words evil is not the direct natural
or normal result of the activity of efficient causes for this result is
always good it must therefore be always an indirect abnormal accidental
consequence of their activity let us see how this can befirstly in
regard to physical evil then in regard to moral evil
in the action of physical causes we may distinguish between the operative
agencies themselves and the subjects in which the effects of these
operations are produced sometimes the effect is wanting in due
perfection or is in other words imperfect physically evil because of
some defect in the agencies the statue may be defective because the
sculptor is unskilled or his instruments bad offspring may be weak or
malformed owing to some congenital or accidental weakness or unfitness in
the parents sometimes the evil in the effect is traceable not to the
agents but to the materials on which they have to work the sculptor and
his instruments may be perfect but if there be a flaw in the marble the
statue will be a failure the educator may be efficient but if the pupil
be wanting in aptitude or application the results cannot be good
all this however does not carry us very far for we must still inquire
why are the agencies or the materials themselves defective moreover
physical evil sometimes occurs without any defect either in the agencies
or in the materials the effect produced may be incompatible with some
minor perfection already in the subject it can then be produced only at
the sacrifice of this minor perfection which sacrifice is for the subject
pro tanto an evil it is in the natural order of things that the
production of a new form or perfection excludes the actuality of a
preexisting form or perfection all nature is subject to change and we
have seen that all change is ruled by the law generatio unius est
corruptio alterius it might perhaps be said that this privation or
supplanting of perfections in things by the actualization in these things
of incompatible perfections is inherent in the nature of things and
essential to their finitenessat least if we regard the things not
individually but as parts of a whole as members of a system as
subserving a general schemeand that therefore such privation should not
be regarded as physical evil proper but rather as metaphysical evil
improperly so called however we regard it it can have no other first
source than the will of the creator decreeing the actual order of the
existing universe and the same must be said of the physical evils proper
that are incident to the actual order of things these evils are
accidental when considered in relation to the individual natures of the
created agencies and materials they are defects or failures of natural
tendencies were these natural tendencies always realized there would be
no such evils but they are not realized and their failure or evil is
not accidental in regard to god for god has willed and created these
agencies with natural tendencies which he has destined to be fulfilled not
always and in every detail but in such measure as will secure the actual
order of the universe and show forth his perfections in the finite degree
in which he has freely chosen to manifest these perfections the world he
has chosen to create is not the best absolutely possible there are
physical evils in it but it is the best for the exact purpose for which
he created it
there is also moral evil in the universe in comparison with moral evil
the physical defects in gods creationphysical pain and suffering
material privations and hardships decay and death of living thingsare
not properly evils at all at least they are not evils in the same
profound sense as the deliberate turning away of the moral agent from god
his last end and ultimate good is an evil for the physical evils
incident to individual beings in the universe can be not only foreseen by
god but accepted and approved so to speak by his will as subserving the
realization of the total physical good which he wills in the universe and
as subordinate to and instrumental in the realization of the moral good
of mankind for it is obvious that in the allwise designs of providence
physical evils such as pain suffering poverty hunger etc may be the
means of realizing moral goodness but moral evil on the contrary or in
the language of christian ethics sinthe conscious and deliberate
rejection by the free agent of god who is his true goodthough
necessarily foreseen by god in the universe he has actually chosen to
create and therefore necessarily permitted by the will of god
consequently on this foresight cannot have been and cannot be intended or
approved by him having created man an intelligent and free being god
could not will or decree the revolt of the latter from himself he loves
essentially his own infinite goodness were he to identify his will with
that of the sinning creature he would at the same time be turning away
from his goodness which is a contradiction in terms god therefore does
not will moral evil nevertheless he permits it otherwise it would not
occur for nothing can happen against his will he has permitted it by
freely choosing to create this actual universe of rational and free
creatures foreseeing that they would sin he could have created instead a
universe of such beings in which there would be no moral evil for he is
omnipotent into the secrets of his election it is not given to finite
minds to penetrate acknowledging his infinite power wisdom and goodness
realizing at the same time the finiteness of our faculties we see how
rational it is to bow down our minds with st paul and to exclaim in
admiration o the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge
of god how incomprehensible are his judgments and how unsearchable his
ways192
if it be objected that gods permission of moral evil in the universe is
really the cause of this evil and makes god himself responsible for sin
and its consequences a satisfactory answer is not far to seek it is
absolutely incompatible with gods infinite sanctity that he be
responsible for sin and its consequences for these the free will of the
creature is alone responsible the creation of intelligent beings
endowed with the power freely to love honour and serve god is the most
marvellous of all gods works free will is the noblest endowment of a
creature of god as it is also the most mysterious man who by his
intelligence has the power to know god as his supreme good has by his
will the power freely to tend towards god and attain to the possession
of god as his last end in so far as man sins ie knowingly
deliberately and freely violates the tendency of his nature towards god
by turning away from him he and he alone is responsible for the
consequences because he has the power to accomplish what he knows to be
gods design in his regard and to be his true destiny and path to
happinessviz that he tend towards union with god and the possession of
godand he deliberately fails to make use of this power such failure and
its consequences are therefore his own they leave absolutely untouched
and unassailed the infinite goodness and benevolence of gods eternal
design in his regard
in scholastic form the objection is proposed and answered in this way
the cause of a cause is the cause of the latters effects but god is the
cause of man and sin is the latters effect therefore god is the cause
of sin that the cause of a nonfree cause is the cause of the
latters effects we admit that the cause of a free cause is the cause
of the latters effects at least in the sense of permitting without
intending and being thereby responsible for them we also admit always in
the sense of intending and being responsible for them we deny the
positive effects of a created free cause those which the latter by
nature is intended to produce are attributable to the first cause or
creator of the free cause and the first cause is responsible for them
the failures of the created free cause to produce its natural and
intended effects are not due to the first cause they are not intended
by nor attributable to the first cause nor is the latter responsible
for them they are failures of the free cause and of him alone though
they are of course foreseen and permitted by the first cause or creator of
the latter the minor premiss of the objection we may admitnoting
however that sin is not properly called an effect but rather like all
evil a failure of some cause to produce its connatural effect it is a
defect a deficiency a privation of some effect of some positive
perfection which the cause ought naturally to have produced the
conclusion of the objection we distinguish according to our analysis of
the major premiss god is the cause of sin in the proper sense of
intending it willing it and producing it positively and being thereby
responsible for it we deny god is the cause of sin in the improper sense
of merely foreseeing and permitting it as incidental to the universe he
has actually willed and decreed to create as occurring in this universe
by the deliberate failure of free creatures to conform themselves to his
primary benevolent intention in their regard we may grant and this
divine permission of moral evil cannot be shown to be incompatible with
any attribute of the divinity
in the preceding paragraphs we have barely outlined the principles on
which the philosophy of theism meets the problem of evil in the universe
we have made assumptions which it is the proper province of natural
theology to establish and to that department also we must refer the
student for a fuller treatment of the whole problem
it has been sometimes said that the fact of evil in the universe is one of
the greatest difficulties against the philosophy of theism if this be
taken as an insinuation that the fact of evil can be better explainedor
even as well explainedon the assumptions of pantheism monism
manicheism or any other philosophy besides theism it is false if it
means simply that in accounting for evilwhether on principles of theism
or of any other philosophywe are forced to raise some ultimate questions
in the face of which we must admit that we have come upon depths of
mystery which the plummet of our finite intellects cannot hope to fathom
in this sense indeed the assertion may be admitted as we have already
hinted even with the light of the christian revelation to aid the natural
light of reason there are questions about the existence and causes of
evil which we may indeed ask but which we cannot adequately answer and
obviously this is no reflection on theism while in the latter system we
have a more intelligible and more satisfactory analysis of the problem
than in any other philosophy
among the ancient greek philosophers we find matter  identified
with vacuum or empty space   and this again with
nothingness or nonbeing    now the concept of evil is the
concept of something negativea privation of goodness of being or
reality thus the notion of evil came to be associated with the notion of
matter but the latter notion is not really negative it is that of a
formless chaotic disorderly material when therefore the manicheans
attributed a positive reality to evilconceiving it as the principle of
all disorder strife discordthey naturally regarded all matter as the
expression of the evil principle in opposition to soul or spirit as the
expression of the good principle the manichean philosophy of evil a
product of the early christian centuries has been perhaps the most
notable alternative or rival system encountered by the theistic philosophy
of evil for notwithstanding the fantastic character of its conceptions
manicheism has reappeared and reasserted itself repeatedly in after ages
notably in the middle ages its prevalence has probably been due partly to
the concreteness of its conceptions and partly to a certain analogy which
they bear towards the conception of satan and the fallen angels in
christian theology in both cases there is the idea of conflict strife
active and irreconcilable opposition between the powers of good and the
powers of evil but there the analogy ends while in christian theology
the powers of evil are presented as essentially subject to the divine
omnipotence in manicheism the evil principle the summum malum is
presented as a supreme selfexistent principle essentially independent
of as well as antagonistic to the divine being the summum bonum
since there is evil in the world and since good cannot be the cause of
evilso the manicheans arguethere must be an essentially evil first
principle which is the primary source of all the evil in the universe
just as there is an essentially good first principle which is the source
of all its good everything in the worldand especially man himself
composed of matter and spiritis the expression and the theatre of the
essential conflict which is being ever waged between the good and the evil
principle everywhere throughout the universe we find this dualism
between spirit and matter light and darkness order and disorder etc
from all that has been said in the preceding paragraphs regarding the
nature and causes of good and evil the errors of the manichean system will
be apparent its fundamental error is the conception of evil as a positive
entity evil is not a positive entity but a privation and this being so
its occurrence does not demand a positive efficient cause it can be
explained and accounted for by deficiency or failure in causes that are
good in so far forth as they are operative but which have not all the
goodness their nature demands and we have seen how this failure of
created causes is permitted by the first cause and is not incompatible
with his infinite goodness
besides the manichean conception of an intrinsically evil cause a cause
that could produce only evil is a contradiction in terms the operation
of an efficient cause must have a positive term in so far as the term is
positive it is good and therefore its cause cannot have been totally
evil but must have been in some degree good the crucial point in the
whole debate is this that we cannot conceive evil as a positive entity
by doing so we render reality unintelligible we destroy the fundamental
ground of any possible distinction between good and evil thus rendering
both alike inconceivable each is correlative to the other we cannot
understand the one without the other if therefore goodness is an aspect
of real being and identical with reality evil must be a negation of
reality and cannot be made intelligible otherwise
finally the manichean conception of two supreme selfexistent
independent first principles is obviously selfcontradictory as is shown
in natural theology being that is absolutely supreme selfexistent and
necessary must by its very nature be unique there could not be two such
beings
chapter vii reality and the beautiful
53 the concept of the beautiful from the standpoint of experiencetruth
and goodness characterize reality as related to intellect and to will
intimately connected with these notions is that of the beautiful193
which we must now briefly analyse the fine arts have for their common
object the expression of the beautiful and the department of philosophy
which studies these the philosophy of the beautiful is generally
described as esthetics194
like the terms true and good the term beautiful  pulchrum
beau schn etc is familiar to all to reach a definition of it let
us question experience what do men commonly mean when face to face with
some object or event they say that is beautiful they give expression
to this sentiment in the presence of a natural object such as a landscape
revealing mountain and valley lake and river and plain and woodland
glowing in the golden glow of the setting sun or in contemplating some
work of artpainting sculpture architecture music the sistine
madonna the moses of michael angelo the cathedral of notre dame a
symphony of beethoven or some literary masterpiece shakespeares
macbeth or dantes divina commedia or newmans apologia or
kickhams knocknagow there are other things the sight of which arouses
no such sentiment but leaves us indifferent and others again the sight
of which arouses a contrary sentiment to which we give expression by
designating them as commonplace vulgar ugly the sentiment in
question is one of pleasure and approval or of displeasure and
disapproval
hence the first fact to note is that the beautiful pleases us affects
us agreeably while the commonplace or the ugly leaves us indifferent or
displeases us affects us disagreeably
but the good pleases us and affects us agreeably is the beautiful
then identical with the good no the really beautiful is indeed always
good but not everything that is good is beautiful nor is the pleasure
aroused by the good identical with that aroused by the beautiful whatever
gratifies the lower sense appetites and causes organic pleasure is
goodbonum delectabilebut is not deemed beautiful eating and drinking
resting and sleeping indulging the senses of touch taste and smell are
indeed pleasuregiving but they have no association with the beautiful
again the deformed child may be the object of the mothers special love
but the pleasure thus derived from the good as the object of appetite
desire delight is not esthetic pleasure if we examine the latter the
pleasure caused by the beautiful we shall find that it is invariably a
pleasure peculiar to knowledge to apprehension perception
imagination contemplation hence in the domain of the senses we designate
as beautiful only what can be apprehended by the two higher senses
seeing and hearing which approximate most closely to intellect and
which through the imagination furnish data for contemplation to the
intellect195 this brings us to st thomass definition pulchra sunt
qu visa placent those things are beautiful whose vision pleases
uswhere vision is to be understood in the wide sense of apprehension
contemplation196 the owner of a beautiful demesne or of an art
treasure may derive pleasure from his sense of proprietorship but this
is distinct from the esthetic pleasure that may be derived by others no
less than by himself from the mere contemplation of those objects
esthetic pleasure is disinterested it springs from the mere
contemplation of an object as beautiful whereas the pleasure that
springs from the object as good is an interested pleasure a pleasure of
possession no doubt the beautiful is really identical with the good
though logically distinct from the latter197 the orderliness which we
shall see to be the chief objective factor of beauty is itself a
perfection of the object and as such is good and desirable hence the
beautiful can be an object of interested desire but only under the aspect
of goodness under the aspect of beauty the object can excite only the
disinterested esthetic pleasure of contemplation
but if esthetic pleasure is derived from contemplation is not this
identifying the beautiful with the true and supplanting art by science
again the consequence is inadmissible for not every pleasure peculiar to
knowledge is esthetic there is a pleasure in seeking and discovering
truth the pleasure which gratifies the scholar and the scientist the
pleasure of the philologist in tracing roots and paradigms of the chemist
in analysing unsavoury materials of the anatomist in exploring the
structure of organisms post mortem but these things are not
beautiful the really beautiful is indeed always true but it cannot
well be maintained that all truths are beautiful that two and two are
four is a truth but in what intelligible sense could it be said to be
beautiful
but besides the scientific pleasure of seeking and discovering truth
there is the pleasure which comes from contemplating the object known the
aim of the scientist or scholar is to discover truth that of the artist
is through knowledge to derive complacency from contemplating the thing
known the scientist or scholar may be also an artist or vice versa
but the scientists pleasure proper lies exclusively in discovering truth
whereas that of the artist lies in contemplating something apprehended
imagined conceived the artist is not concerned as to whether what he
apprehends is real or imaginary certain or conjectural but only as to
whether or how far the contemplation of it will arouse emotions of
pleasure admiration enthusiasm while the scientists supreme concern is
to know things to see them as they are the beautiful then is always
true either as actual or as ideal but the true is beautiful only when it
so reveals itself as to arouse in us the desire to see or hear it to
consider it to dwell and rest in the contemplation of it
let us accept then the a posteriori definition of the beautiful as
that which it is pleasing to contemplate and before inquiring what
precisely is it on the side of the object that makes the latter
agreeable to contemplate let us examine the subjective factors and
conditions of esthetic experience
54 the esthetic sentiment apprehension of the beautifulwe have seen
that both the appetitive and the cognitive faculties are involved in the
experience of the beautiful contemplation implies cognition while the
feeling of pleasure complacency satisfaction delight indicates the
operation of appetite or will now the notion of the beautiful like all
our notions has its origin in sense experience but it is itself
suprasensible for it is reached by abstraction and this is above the
power of sense faculties while the senses and imagination apprehend
beautiful objects the intellect attains to that which makes these objects
beautiful to the ratio pulchri that is in them no doubt the
perception or imagination of beautiful things in nature or in art
produces as its natural concomitant a feeling of sensible pleasure to
hear sweet music to gaze on the brilliant variety of colours in a
gorgeous pageant to inhale delicious perfumes to taste savoury
dishesall such experiences gratify the senses but the feeling of such
sensible pleasure is quite distinct from the esthetic enjoyment which
accompanies the apprehension of the beautiful though it is very often
confounded with the latter such sentient states of agreeable feeling
are mainly passive organic physiological while esthetic enjoyment
the appreciation of the beautiful is eminently active it implies the
operation of a suprasensible faculty the intelligence it accompanies
the reaction of the latter faculty to some appropriate objective stimulus
of the suprasensible intelligible order to some idea embodied in the
object of sense198
the error of confounding esthetic enjoyment with mere organic sense
pleasure is characteristic of all sensist and materialist philosophies a
feeling of sensible gratification always no doubt accompanies our
apprehension and enjoyment of the beautiful for just as man is not a
merely sentient being so neither is he a pure intelligence beauty reaches
him through the senses in order that an object be beautiful for him in
order that the contemplation of it may please him it must be in harmony
with his whole human nature which is both sentient and intelligent it
must therefore be agreeable to the senses and imagination as well as to
the intellect there is no painting writes m brunetire199 but
should be above all a joy to the eye no music but should be a delight for
the ear otherwise we shall not apprehend in it the order perfection
harmony adaptation to human nature whereby we pronounce an object
beautiful and rejoice in the contemplation of it and it is this
intellectual activity that is properly esthetic what makes us consider a
colour beautiful writes bossuet200 is the secret judgment we
pronounce upon its adaptation to the eye which it pleases beautiful
sounds songs cadences have a similar adaptation to the ear to
apprehend this adaptation promptly and accurately is what is described as
having a good ear though properly speaking this judgment should be
attributed to the intellect
according to some the esthetic sentiment the appreciation and enjoyment
of the beautiful is an exclusively subjective experience an emotional
state which has all its sources within the conscious subject and which
has no real extramental correlative in things according to others beauty
is already in the extramental reality independently of any subjective
conditions and has no mental factors in its constitution as an object of
experience both of these extreme views are erroneous esthetic pleasure
like all pleasure is the natural concomitant of the full orderly normal
exercise of the subjects conscious activities these activities are
called forth by and exercised upon some object for esthetic pleasure
there must be in the object something the contemplation of which will
elicit such harmonious exercise of the faculties esthetic pleasure
therefore cannot be purely subjective there must be an objective factor
in its realization but on the other hand this objective factor cannot
provoke esthetic enjoyment independently of the dispositions of the
subject it must be in harmony with those dispositionscognitive
appetitive affective emotional temperamentalin order to evoke such a
mental view of the object that the contemplation of the latter will cause
esthetic pleasure and it is precisely because these dispositions which
are so variable from one individual to another tinge and colour the
mental view while this in turn determines the quality of the esthetic
judgment and feeling that people disagree and dispute interminably about
questions of beauty in art and nature herein beauty differs from truth
no doubt people dispute about the latter also but at all events they
recognize its objective character and the propriety of an appeal to the
independent impersonal standard of evidence not so however in regard
to beauty de gustibus non est disputandum there is no disputing about
tastes the perception of beauty the judgment that something is or is not
beautiful is the product of an act of taste ie of the individuals
intelligence affected by numerous concrete personal dispositions both of
the sentient and of the spiritual order not only cognitive and appetitive
but temperamental and emotional moreover besides this variety in
subjective dispositions we have to bear in mind the effects of artistic
culture of educating the taste the eye and the ear which are the two
main channels of data for the intellect can be made by training more
delicate and exacting so that the same level of esthetic appreciation can
be maintained only by a constantly increasing measure of artistic
stimulation finally apart from all that a beautiful object directly
conveys to us for contemplation there is something more which it may
indirectly suggest it arouses a distinct activity of the imagination
whereby we fill up in our own individual degree and according to our own
interpretation what has not been actually supplied in it by nature or
art
all those influences account sufficiently for the subjectivity and
variability of the esthetic sentiment for diversity of artistic tastes
among individuals for the transitions of fashion in art from epoch to
epoch and from race to race but it must not be concluded that the
subjective factors in the constitution of the beautiful are wholly
changeable since human nature is fundamentally the same in all men there
ought to be a fund of esthetic judgments and pleasures common to all
there ought to be in nature and in art some things which are recognized
and enjoyed as beautiful by all and there are such in matters of
detail the maxim holds de gustibus non disputandum but there are
fundamental esthetic judgments for which it does not hold since men have
a common nature and since as we shall see presently there are
recognizable and stable objective factors to determine esthetic judgments
there is a legitimate foundation on which to discuss and establish some
esthetic canons of universal validity
55 objective factors in the constitution of the beautifulask the
artist writes st augustine201 whether beautiful things are
beautiful because they please us or rather please us because they are
beautiful and he will reply unhesitatingly that they please us because
they are beautiful what then is it that makes them beautiful and so
causes the esthetic pleasure we experience in contemplating them in order
that an object produce pleasure of any sort in a conscious being it must
evoke the exercise of this beings faculties for the conscious condition
which we describe as pleasure is always a reflex of conscious activity
furthermore this activity must be full and intense and
wellordered if it be excessive or defective if it be illregulated
wrongly distributed among the faculties it will not have pleasure for its
reflex but either indifference or pain
hence the object which evokes the esthetic pleasure of contemplation must
in the first place be complete or perfect of its kind 46 the
truncated statue the stunted oak the deformed animal the crippled human
being are not beautiful they are wanting in the integrity due to their
nature
but this is not enough to be beautiful the object must in the second
place have a certain largeness or amplitude a certain greatness or
power whereby it can act energetically on our cognitive faculties and
stimulate them to vigorous action the little the trifling the
commonplace the insignificant evokes no feeling of admiration the sight
of a small pasturefield leaves us indifferent but the vision of vast
expanses of meadow and cornfield and woodland exhilarates us a collection
of petty hillocks is uninteresting while the towering snowclad alps are
magnificent the multiplication table elicits no emotion but the
triumphant discovery and proof of some new truth in science some
farreaching theorem that opens up new vistas of research or sheds a new
light on long familiar facts may fill the mind with ecstasies of pure
esthetic enjoyment202 there is no moral beauty in helping up a child
that has stumbled and fallen in the mud but there is in risking ones
life to save the child from burning or drowning there must then be in
the object a certain largeness which will secure energy of appeal to our
cognitive faculties but this energy must not be excessive it must not
dazzle it must be in proportion to the capacity of our faculties203
a third requisite for beauty is that the object be in itself duly
proportioned orderly well arranged order generally may be
defined as right or proper arrangement we can see in things a twofold
order dynamic or that of subordination and static or that of
coordination the right arrangement of means towards ends and the
right arrangement of parts in a whole or members in a system the former
indicates the influence of final causes and expresses primarily the
goodness of things the latter is determined by the formal causes of
things and expresses primarily their beauty the order essential to
beauty consists in this that the manifold and distinct things or acts
which contribute to it must form one whole hence order has been defined
as unity in variety unitas in varietate variety being the material
cause and unity the formal cause of order but we can apprehend unity in
a variety of things only on condition that they are arranged ie
that they show forth clearly to the mind a set of mutual relations which
can be easily grasped why is it that things mutually related to one
another in one way make up what we declare to be a chaotic jumble while
if related in another way we declare them to be orderly because unless
these relations present themselves in a certain way they will fail to
unify the manifold for us we have an intellectual intuition of the
numerical series and of proportion which is equality of numerical
relations in the domains of magnitude and multitude the mind naturally
seeks to detect these proportions so also in the domains of sensible
qualities such as sounds and colours we have an analogous intuition of a
qualitative series and we naturally try to detect harmony which is the
gradation of qualitative relations in this series the detection of
proportion and harmony in a variety of things pleases us because we
are thus enabled to grasp the manifold as exhibiting unity while the
absence of these elements leaves us with the dissatisfied feeling of
something wanting whether this be because order in things is the
expression of an intelligent will of purpose and design and therefore
calls forth our intelligent and volitional activity with its consequent
and connatural feeling of satisfaction we do not inquire here but
certain it is that order is essential to beauty that esthetic pleasure
springs only from the contemplation of proportion and harmony which give
unity to variety204 and the explanation of this is not far to seek for
the full and vigorous exercise of contemplative activity we need objective
variety whatever lacks variety and stimulates us in one uniform manner
becomes monotonous and causes ennui while on the other hand mere
multiplicity distracts the mind disperses and weakens attention and
begets fatigue we must therefore have variety but variety combined
with the unity that will concentrate and sustain attention and thus call
forth the highest and keenest energy of intellectual activity hence the
function of rhythm in music poetry and oratory of composition and
perspective in painting of design in architecture
the more perfect the relations are which constitute order the more
clearly will the unity of the object shine forth hence the more fully
and easily will it be grasped and the more intense the esthetic pleasure
of contemplating it
st thomas thus sums up the objective conditions of the beautiful
integrity or perfection proportion or harmony and clarity or
splendour205
56 some definitions of the beautifulan object is beautiful when its
contemplation pleases us and this takes place when the object complete
and entire in itself possesses that order harmony proportion of parts
which will call forth the full and vigorous exercise of our cognitive
activity all this amounts to saying that the beauty of a thing is the
revelation or manifestation of its natural perfection206 perfection
is thus the foundation of beauty the showing forth of this perfection
is what constitutes beauty formally every real being has a nature which
constitutes it and activities whereby it tends to realize the purpose of
its existence now the perfection of any nature is manifested by the
proportion of its constitutive parts and by the harmony of all its
activities hence we see that order is essential to beauty because order
shows forth the perfection of the beautiful an object is beautiful in the
degree in which the proportion of its parts and the harmony of its
activities show forth the perfection of its nature
thus starting with the subjective a posteriori definition of beauty
from its effect beauty is that whose contemplation pleases uswe have
passed to the objective and natural definition of beauty by its
properties beauty is the evident integrity order proportion and
harmony of an objectand thence to what we may call the a priori or
synthetic definition which emphasizes the perfection revealed by the
static and dynamic order of the thing the beauty of an object is the
manifestation of its natural perfection by the proportion of its parts and
the harmony of its activities207
    a few samples of the many definitions that have been set forth by
    various authors will not be without interest vallet208 defines
    beauty as the splendour of perfection other authors define it
    as the splendour of order these definitions sacrifice clearness
    to brevity beauty is the splendour of the true this
    definition commonly attributed to plato but without reason is
    inadequate and ambiguous cousin209 defines beauty as unity in
    variety this leaves out an essential element the clarity or
    clear manifestation of order kant defines beauty as the power
    an object possesses of giving free play to the imagination without
    transgressing the laws of the understanding210 this definition
    emphasizes the necessary harmony of the beautiful with our
    cognitive faculties and the fact that the esthetic sentiment is
    not capricious but subject to the laws of the understanding it
    is however inadequate in as much as it omits all reference to
    the objective factors of beauty
57 classifications the beautiful in natureall real beauty is either
natural or artificial natural beauty is that which characterizes what
we call the works of nature or the works of god artificial beauty is
the beauty of works of art
again just as we can distinguish the real beauty of the latter from the
ideal beauty which the human artist conceives in his mind as its
archetype and exemplar cause so too we can distinguish between the real
beauty of natural things and the ideal beauty of their uncreated
archetypes in the mind of the divine artist
we know that the beauty of the human artists ideal is superior to and
never fully realized in that of the actually achieved product of his art
is the same true of the natural beauty of gods works that the works of
god in general are beautiful cannot be denied his wisdom spreads beauty
abroad throughout his works he arranges all things according to weight
and number and measurecum pondere numero et mensura his providence
disposes all things strongly and sweetly fortiter et suaviter but
while creatures by revealing their own beauty reflect the uncreated
beauty of god in the precise degree which he has willed from all eternity
it cannot be said that they all realize the beauty of their divine
exemplars according to his primary purpose and decree since there is
physical and moral evil in the universe since there are beings which fail
to realize their ends to attain to the perfection of their natures it
follows that these beings are not beautiful in so far forth as they have
real being and the goodness or perfection which is identical with their
reality it may be admitted that all real beings are fundamentally
beautiful for goodness or perfection is the foundation of beauty211
but in so far as they fail to realize the perfection due to their natures
they lack even the foundation of beauty furthermore in order that a
thing which has the full perfection due to its nature be formally
beautiful it must actually show forth by the clearness of its proportions
and the harmony of its activities the fulness of its natural perfections
but there is no need to prove that this is not universally verified in
natureor in art either and hence we must infer that formal beauty is not
a transcendental attribute of reality212
real beauty may be further divided into material or sensible or
physical and intellectual or spiritual the former reveals itself
to hearing seeing and imagination the latter can be apprehended only by
intellect but intellect depends for all its objects on the data of the
imagination the beauty of spiritual realities is of course of a higher
nobler and more excellent order than that of the realities of sense the
spiritual beauty which falls directly within human experience is that of
the human spirit itself from the soul and its experiences we can rise to
an apprehensionanalogical and inadequateof the beauty of the infinite
being in the soul itself we can distinguish two sources of beauty what
we may call its natural endowments such as intellect and will and its
moral dispositions its perfections and excellences as a free
intelligent moral agentits virtues beauty of soul especially the
moral beauty of the virtuous soul is incomparably more precious than
beauty of body the latter of course like all real beauty in gods
creation has its proper dignity as an expression and revelation however
faint and inadequate of the uncreated beauty of the deity but inasmuch
as it is so inferior to the moral beauty proper to man in itself so frail
and evanescent in its influence on human passions so dangerous to virtue
we can understand why in the proverbs of solomon it is proclaimed to be
vain and deceitful in contrast with the moral beauty of fearing the lord
fallax gratia et vana est pulchritudo mulier timens dominum ipsa
laudabitur213
58 the beautiful in art scope and function of the fine artsthe
expression of beauty is the aim of the fine arts art in general is the
proper conception of a work to be accomplished ars nihil aliud est quam
recta ratio aliquorum operum faciendorum214 while the mechanical
arts aim at the production of things useful the fine arts aim at the
production of things beautiful ie of works which by their order
symmetry harmony splendour etc will give such apt expression to human
ideals of natural beauty as to elicit esthetic enjoyment in the highest
possible degree the artist then must be a faithful student and admirer
of all natural beauty not indeed to aim at exact reproduction or
imitation of the latter but to draw therefrom his inspiration and ideals
even the most beautiful things of nature express only inadequately the
ideal beauty which the human mind may gather from the study of them this
ideal is what the artist is ever struggling to express with the
everpresent and tormenting consciousness that the achievement of his
highest effort will fall immeasurably short of giving adequate expression
to it
if each of the things of nature were so wholly simple and intelligible as
to present the same ideal type of beauty to all and leave no room for
individual differences of interpretation there would be no variety in the
products of artistic genius except indeed what would result from perfect
or imperfect execution but the things of nature are complex and in part
at least enigmatical they present different aspects to different minds
and suggest a variety of interpretations they leave large scope to the
play of the imagination both as to conception of the ideal itself and as
to the arrangement and manipulation of the sensible materials in which the
ideal is to find expression by means of these two functions conception
and expression the genius of the artist seeks to interpret and realize
for us ideal types of natural beauty
the qualities of a work of art the conditions it must fulfil are those
already enumerated in regard to beauty generally it must have unity
order proportion of parts it must be true to nature not in the sense of
a mere copy but in the sense of drawing its inspiration from nature and
so helping us to understand and appreciate the beauties of nature it must
display a power and clearness of expression adjusted to the capacity of
the normal mind
we may addas indicating the connexion of art with moralitythat the work
of art must not be such as to excite disapproval or cause pain by shocking
any normal faculty or running counter to any fundamental belief
sympathy sentiment or feeling of the human mind the contemplation of
the really beautiful whether in nature or in art ought per se to have
an elevating ennobling refining influence on the mind but the beautiful
is not the good nor does the cultivation of the fine arts necessarily
enrich the mind morally from the ethical point of view art is one of
those indifferent things which the will can make morally good or morally
evil since man is a moral being no human interest can fall outside the
moral sphere or claim independence of the moral law and art is a human
interest neither the creator nor the critic nor the student of a work
of art can claim that the latter simply because it is a work of art is
neither morally good nor morally bad or that he in his special relation
to it is independent of the moral law
under the specious plea that science in seeking truth is neither
positively moral nor positively immoral but abstracts altogether from the
quality of morality it is sometimes claimed that a pari art in its
pursuit of the beautiful should be held to abstract from moral
distinctions and have no concern for moral good or evil but in the first
place though science as such seeks simply the true and in this sense
abstracts from the good and the evil still the man of science both in
acquiring and communicating truth is bound by the moral law he may not
under the plea that he is learning or teaching truth do anything morally
wrong anything that will forfeit or endanger moral rectitude whether
in himself or in others and in the second place owing to the different
relations of truth and beauty to moral goodness we must deny the parity
on which the argument rests truth appeals to the reason alone beauty
appeals to the senses the heart the will the passions and emotions
pulchrum trahit ad se desiderium the scientist expresses truth in
abstract laws definitions and formulas a law of chemistry will help the
farmer to fertilize the soil or the anarchist to assassinate sovereigns
but the artist expresses beauty in concrete forms calculated to provoke
emotions of esthetic enjoyment from the contemplation of them now there
are other pleasuregiving emotions sensual and carnal emotions the
indiscriminate excitement and unbridled indulgence of which the moral law
condemns as evil and if a work of art be of such a kind that it is
directly calculated to excite them the artist stands condemned by the
moral law and that even though his aim may have been to give expression
to beauty and call forth esthetic enjoyment merely if the preponderating
influence of the artists work on the normal human individual be a
solicitation of the latters nature towards what is evil what is opposed
to his real perfection his moral progress his last end then that
artists work is not a work of art or truly beautiful the net result of
its appeal being evil and unhealthy it cannot be itself a thing of
beauty
    art for arts sake is a cry that is now no longer novel taken
    literally it is unmeaning for art is a means to an endthe
    expression of the beautiful and a means as such cannot be for
    its own sake but it may signify that art should subserve no
    extrinsic purpose professional or utilitarian that it should
    be disinterested that the artist must aim at the conception and
    expression of the beautiful through a disinterested admiration and
    enthusiasm for the beautiful in this sense the formula expresses
    a principle which is absolutely true and which asserts the noble
    mission of the artist to mankind but the formula is also commonly
    understood to claim the emancipation of the artist from the bonds
    of morality and his freedom to conceive and express beauty in
    whatever forms he pleases whether these may aid men to virtue or
    solicit them to vice this is the pernicious error to which we
    have just referred and we may now add that this erroneous
    contention is not only ethically but also artistically unsound
    for surely art ought to be based on truth the artist should
    understand human nature to which his work appeals he should not
    regard as truly beautiful a work the contemplation of which will
    produce a discord in the soul which will disturb the right
    order of the souls activities which will solicit the lower
    faculties to revolt against the higher and this is what takes
    place when the artist ignores moral rectitude in the pursuit of
    his art by despising the former he is false to the latter he
    fails to realize that the work of art must be judged not merely in
    relation to the total amount of pleasure it may cause in those
    who contemplate it but also in relation to the quality of this
    pleasure and not merely in relation to esthetic pleasure but in
    relation to the total effect the whole concrete influence of the
    work on all the mental faculties he fails to see that if this
    total influence is evil the work that causes it cannot be good
    nor therefore really beautiful
    are we to conclude then that the artist is bound to aim
    positively and always at producing a good moral effect through
    his work by no means esthetic pleasure is as we have said
    indifferent the pursuit of it through the conception and
    expression of the beautiful is the proper and intrinsic end of
    the fine arts and is in itself legitimate so long as it does not
    run counter to the moral law it has no need to run counter to the
    moral law nor can it do so without defeating its own end outside
    its proper limits art ceases to be art within its proper limits
    it has a noble and elevating mission and it can serve indirectly
    but powerfully the interests of truth and goodness by helping men
    to substitute for the lower and grosser pleasures of sense the
    higher and purer esthetic pleasures which issue from the
    disinterested contemplation of the beautiful
chapter viii the categories of being substance and accident
59 the conception of ultimate categorieshaving examined so far the
notion of real being itself which is the proper subjectmatter of
ontology and those widest or transcendental notions which are coextensive
with that of reality we must next inquire into the various modes in which
we find real being expressed determined actualized as it falls within
our experience in other words we must examine the highest categories of
being the suprema genera entis considered from the point of view of
the logical arrangement of our concepts each of these categories reveals
itself as a primary and immediate limitation of the extension of the
transcendental concept of real being itself each is ultimately distinct
from the others in the sense that no two of them can be brought under any
other as a genus nor can we discover any intermediate notion between any
one of them and the notion of being itself the latter notion is not
properly a genus of which they would be species nor can it be predicated
univocally of any two or more of them 2 each is itself an ultimate
genus a genus supremum
by using these notions as predicates of our judgments we are enabled to
interpret things to obtain a genuine if inadequate insight into reality
for we assume as established in the theory of knowledge that all our
universal concepts have real and objective validity that they give us
real knowledge of the nature of those individual things which form the
data of our sense experience hence the study of the categories which is
for logic a classification of our widest concepts become for metaphysics
an inquiry into the modes which characterize real being215 by
determining what these modes are by studying their characteristics by
tracing them through the data of experience we advance in our knowledge
of reality
the most divergent views have prevailed among philosophers both as to what
a category is or signifies and as to what or how many the really ultimate
categories are is a category such as substance or quality or quantity
a mode of real being revealed to the knowing mind as most ancient and
medieval philosophers thought with aristotle and st thomas or is it a
mental mode imposed on reality by the knowing mind as many modern
philosophers have thought with kant and after him it is for the theory
of knowledge to examine this alternative nor shall we discuss it here
except very incidentally for we shall assume as true the broad
affirmative answer to the first alternative that is to say we shall hold
that the mind is able to see in the categories generally modes of
reality rejecting the sceptical conclusions of kantism in regard to the
power of the speculative reason and the principles which lead to such
conclusions
as to the number and classification of the ultimate categories this is
obviously a question which cannot be settled a priori by any such purely
deductive analysis of the concept of being as hegel seems to have
attempted but only a posteriori ie by an analysis of experience in
its broadest sense as including matter and spirit nature and mind object
and subject of thought and even the process of thought itself moreover
it is not surprising that with the progress of philosophical reflection
certain categories should have been studied more deeply at certain epochs
than ever previously that they should have been discovered so to speak
not of course in the sense that the human mind had not been previously in
possession of them but in the sense that because of closer study they
furnished the mind with a richer and fuller power of explaining things
it is natural too that historians of philosophy intent on tracing the
movement of philosophic thought should be inclined to overemphasize the
relativity of the categories as regards their explaining valuetheir
relativity to the general mentality of a certain epoch or period216 but
there is danger here of confounding certain large hypothetical
conceptions which are found to yield valuable results at a certain stage
in the progress of the sciences217 with the categories proper of real
being if the mind of man is of the same nature in all men if it
contemplates the same universe if it is capable of reaching truth about
this universereal truth which is immutablethen the modes of being which
it apprehends in the universe and by conceiving which it interprets the
latter must be in the universe as known and must be there immutably
nowhere do we find this more clearly illustrated than in the futility of
the numerous attempts of modern philosophers to deny the reality of the
category of substance and to give an intelligible interpretation of
experience without the aid of this category we shall see that as a matter
of fact it is impossible to deny in thought the reality of substance or
to think at all without it however philosophers may have denied it in
languageor thought that they denied it when they only rejected some
erroneous or indefensible meaning of the term
60 the aristotelian categoriesthe first palpable distinction we observe
in the data of experience is that between substance and accident we
might naturally ask writes aristotle218 whether what is signified by
such terms as walking sitting feeling well is a being or
reality and we might be inclined to doubt it for no single one of
such acts exists by itself    no one of them is
separable from substance  it is rather to him who walks or
sits or feels well that we give the name of being that which is a
being in the primary meaning of this term a being simply and
absolutely and not merely a being in a certain sense or with a
qualification is substance           
  219 but manifestly though substances or what in ordinary
language we call persons and thingsmen animals plants mineralsare
real beings in the fullest sense nevertheless sitting walking thinking
willing and actions generally are also undoubtedly realities so too are
states and qualities and shape size posture etc and yet we do not
find any of these latter actually existing in themselves like substances
but only dependently on substanceson persons or things that think or
walk or act or are large or small hot or cold or have some shape or
quality they are all accidents in contradistinction to substance
it is far easier to distinguish between accidents and substance than to
give an exhaustive list of the ultimate and irreducible classes of the
former aristotle enumerates nine quantity  quality 
relation   action  passion  where  when
 posture  external condition or state  much has
been said for and against the exhaustive character of this classification
scholastics generally have defended and adopted it st thomas gives the
following reasoned analysis of it220 since accidents may be
distinguished by their relations to substance we see that some affect
substances intrinsically others extrinsically and in the former case
either absolutely or relatively if relatively we have the category of
relation if absolutely we have either quantity or quality according
as the accident affects the substance by reason of the matter or the
form of the latter what affects and denominates a substance
extrinsically does so either as a cause or as a measure or otherwise if
as a cause the substance is either suffering action or acting
itself if as a measure it denominates the subject as in time or in
place or in regard to the relative position of its parts its
posture in the place which it occupies finally if the accident
affects the substance extrinsically though not as cause or as measure
but only as characterizing its external condition and immediate
surroundings as when we describe a man as clothed or armed we have the
category of condition
it might be said that all this is more ingenious than convincing but it
is easier to criticize aristotles list than to suggest a better one in
addition to what we have said of it elsewhere221 a few remarks will be
sufficient in the present context
some of the categories as being of lesser importance we may treat
incidentally when dealing with the more important ones ubi quando
and situs together with the analysis of our notions of space and time
fall naturally into the general doctrine of quantity the final
category  however interpreted222 may be referred to quality
quantity or relation
a more serious point for consideration is the fact generally admitted by
scholastics223 that one and the same real accident may belong to
different categories if we regard it from different standpoints actio
and passio are one and the same motus or change regarded in relation
to the agent and to the effect respectively place in regard to the
located body belongs to the category ubi whereabouts in regard to the
locating body it is an aspect of the latters quantity relation as
we shall see is probably not an entity really distinct from its
foundationquality quantity or causality the reason alleged for this
partial absence of real distinction between the aristotelian categories is
that they were thought out primarily from a logical point of viewthat of
predication224 and the reason is a satisfactory one for real
distinction is not necessary for diversity of predication then where
they are not really distinct entities these categories are at least
aspects so fundamentally distinct and mutually irreducible that each of
them is indeed a summum genus immediately under the concept of being in
general
it seems a bold claim to make for any scheme of categories that it
exhausts all the known modes of reality we often experience objects of
thought which seem at first sight incapable of reduction to any of
aristotles suprema genera but more mature reflection will always
enable us to find a place for them in order that any extrinsic
denomination of a substance constitute a category distinct from those
enumerated it must affect the substance in some real way distinct from
any of those nine and it must moreover be not a mere complex or
aggregate of two or more of the latter hence denominations which objects
derive from the fact that they are terms of mental activities which are
really immanent actiones intentionalesdenominations such as
being known being lovedneither belong to the category of passio
proper nor do they constitute any distinct category they are entia
rationis logical relations again while efficient causation resolves
itself into the categories of actio and passio the causation of
final formal and material causes cannot be referred to these categories
but neither does it constitute any new category the influence of a final
cause consists in nothing more than its being a good which is the term of
appetite or desire the causation of the formal cause consists in its
formally constituting the effect it is always either a substantial or an
accidental form and so must be referred to the categories of substance
or quality or quantity similarly material causality consists in this
that the matter is a partial constitutive principle of the composite
being and it therefore refers us to the category of substance it may be
noted too that the ontological principles of a composite beingsuch as
primal matter and substantial formsince they are themselves not properly
beings but only principles of being are said to belong each to its
proper category not formally but only referentially not formaliter but
only reductiv finally the various properties that are assigned to
certain accidents themselves are either logical relations such as not
having a contrary or being a measure or real relations or intrinsic
modes of the accident itself as when a quality is said to have a certain
intensity but in all cases where they are not mere logical entities
they will be found to come under one or other of the aristotelian
categories
the real being which is thus determined into the supreme modes or
categories of substance and accidents is of course being considered
substantially as essential whether possible or actual and not
merely being that is actually existent existential being in the
participial sense furthermore it is primarily finite or created being
that is so determined the infinite being is above the categories
supersubstantial it is because substance is the most perfect of the
categories and because the infinite being verifies in himself in an
incomprehensibly perfect manner all the perfections of substance that we
speak of him as a substance remembering always that these essentially
finite human concepts are to be predicated of him only analogically 2
5
it may be inquired whether accident is a genus which should be
predicated univocally of the nine aristotelian categories as species or
is the concept of accident only analogical so that these nine
categories would be each a summum genus in the strict sense ie an
ultimate and immediate determination of the concept of being itself we
have seen already that the concept of being as applied to substance
and accident is analogical 2 so too it is analogical as applied to
the various categories of accidents for the characteristic note of
accident that of affecting inhering in a subject can scarcely be
said to be verified in the same way univocally of the various kinds
of accidents it is therefore more probably correct not to regard
accident as a genus proper but to conceive each kind of accident as a
summum genus coming immediately under the transcendental concept of
being
61 the phenomenist attack on the traditional doctrine of
substancepassing now to the question of the existence and nature of
substances and their relation to accidents we shall find evidences of
misunderstandings to which many philosophical errors may be ascribed at
least in part it is a fairly common contention that the distinction
between substance and accident is really a groundless distinction that we
have experience merely of transient events or happenings internal and
external with relations of coexistence or sequence between them that it
is an illusion to suppose underlying these an inert abiding basis
called substance that this can be at best but a useless name for each
of the collections of external and internal appearances which make up our
total experience of the outer world and of our own minds this is the
general position of phenomenists what do you know of substance they
ask us except that it is an indeterminate and unknown something
underlying phenomena and even if you could prove its existence what
would it avail you since in its nature it is and must remain unknown
no doubt the mind naturally supposes this something underlying
phenomena but it is a mere mental fiction the reality of which cannot be
proved and the nature of which is admitted even by some who believe in
its real existence to be unknowable
now there can be no doubt about the supreme importance of this question
all parties are pretty generally agreed that on the real or fictitious
character of substance the very existence of genuine metaphysics in the
traditional sense depends and at first sight the possibility of such a
controversy as the present one seems very strange is it credible asks
mercier225 that thinkers of the first order like hume mill spencer
kant wundt paulsen littr taine should have failed to recognize the
substantial character of things and of the ego or self must they not
have seen that they were placing themselves in open revolt against sound
common sense and on the other hand is it likely that the genius of
aristotle could have been duped by the nave illusion which phenomenists
must logically ascribe to him or that all those sincere and earnest
teachers who adopted and preserved in scholastic philosophy for centuries
the peripatetic distinction between substance and accidents should have
been all utterly astray in interpreting an elementary fact of common
sense
there must have been misunderstandings possibly on both sides and much
waste of argument in refuting chimeras let us endeavour to find out what
they are and how they gradually arose
phenomenism has had its origin in the idealism which confines the human
mind to a knowledge of its own states proclaiming the unknowability of
any reality other than these and in the positivism which admits the
reality only of that which falls directly within external and internal
sense experience descartes did not deny the substantiality of the soul
nor even of bodies but his idealist theory of knowledge rendered suspect
all information derived by his deductive a priori method of reasoning
from supposed innate ideas regarding the nature and properties of bodies
locke rejected the innatism of descartes ascribing to sense experience a
positive rle in the formation of our ideas and proving conclusively that
we have no such intuitive and deductively derived knowledge of real
substances as descartes contended for226 locke himself did not deny the
existence of substances227 any more than descartes but unfortunately
he propounded the mistaken assumption of idealism that the mind can know
only its own states and also the error of thinking that because we have
not an intuitive insight into the specific nature of individual substances
we can know nothing at all through any channel about their nature and he
gathered from this latter error a general notion or definition of
substance which is a distinct departure from what aristotle and the
medieval scholastics had traditionally understood by substance for locke
substance is merely a supposed but unknown support for accidents228
setting out with these two notionsthat all objects of knowledge must be
states or phases of mind and that material substance is a supposed but
unknown and unknowable substratum of the qualities revealed to our minds
in the process of sense perceptionit was easy for berkeley to support by
plausible arguments his denial of the reality of any such things as
material substances and it was just as easy if somewhat more audacious
on the part of hume to argue quite logically that if the supposed but
unknowable substantial substratum of external sense phenomena is illusory
so likewise is the supposed substantial ego which is thought to underlie
and support the internal phenomena of consciousness
humes rejection of substance is apparently complete and absolute and is
so interpreted by many of his disciples but a thoroughgoing phenomenism
is in reality impossible no philosophers have ever succeeded in thinking
out an intelligible theory of things without the concepts of matter and
spirit and things and the ego or self however they may have
tried to dispense with them and these are concepts of substances hence
there are those who doubt that hume was serious in his elaborate reasoning
away of substances the fact is that hume reasoned away substance only
in the sense of an unknowable substratum of phenomena and not in the
sense of a something that exists in itself229 so far from denying the
existence of entities that exist in themselves he seems to have
multiplied these beyond the wildest dreams of all previous philosophers
by substantializing accidents230 what he does call into doubt is the
capacity of the human mind to attain to a knowledge of the specific
natures of such entities and even here the arguments of phenomenism
strike the false cartesian theory of knowledge rather than the sober and
moderate teachings of scholasticism regarding the nature and limitations
of our knowledge of substances
62 the scholastic view of our knowledge in regard to the existence and
nature of substanceswhat then are these latter teachings that we have
a direct intellectual insight into the specific essence or nature of a
corporeal substance such as gold similar to our insight into the abstract
essence of a triangle by no means locke was quite right in rejecting the
cartesian claim to intuitions which were supposed to yield up all
knowledge of things by mathematical ie deductive a priori
reasoning the scholastic teaching is briefly as follows
first as regards our knowledge of the existence of substances and the
manner in which we obtain our concept of substance we get this concept
from corporeal substances and afterwards apply it to spiritual
substances so that our knowledge of the former is immediate only in the
relative sense of being prior to the latter not in the sense that it is a
direct intuition of the natures of corporeal substances we have no such
direct insight into their natures but our concept of them as actually
existing is also immediate in the sense that at first we spontaneously
conceive every object which comes before our consciousness as something
existing in itself the child apprehends each separate stimulant of its
sense perceptionresistance colour sound etcas a this or a that
ie as a separate something existing there in itself in other words
it apprehends all realities as substances not of course that the child
has yet any reflex knowledge of what a substance is but unknowingly it
applies to all realities at first the concept which it undoubtedly
possesses something existing in itself it likewise apprehends each such
reality as one or undivided in itself and as distinct from other
things such is the childs immediate direct and implicit idea of
substance but if we are to believe hume what is true of the child
remains true of the man for the latter too every perception is a
substance and every distinct part of a perception a distinct
substance231 nothing however could be more manifestly at variance
with the facts for as reason is developed and reflective analysis
proceeds the child most undoubtedly realizes that not everything that
falls within its experience has the character of a something existing in
itself and distinct from other things walking talking and
actions generally it apprehends as realitiesas realities which
however do not exist in themselves but in other beings in the
beings that walk and talk and act and these latter beings it still
apprehends as existing in themselves and as thus differing from the
former which exist not in themselves but in other things thus the
child comes into possession of the notion of accident and of the
further notion of substance as something which not only exists in itself
 ens in se subsistens but which is also a support or subject of
accidents  substans substare232 nor indeed need
the childs reason be very highly developed in order to realize that if
experience furnishes it with beings that do not exist in themselves
there must also be beings which do exist in themselves that if
accidents exist at all it would be unintelligible and selfcontradictory
to deny the existence of substances
hence in the order of our experience the first implicit notion of
substance is that of something existing in itself  the first
explicit notion of it however is that by which it is apprehended as a
subject or support of accidents  substare substantia
then by reflection we go back to the explicit notion of it as something
existing in itself in the real or ontological order the perfection
of existing in itself is manifestly more fundamental than that of
supporting accidents it is in accordance with a natural law of language
that we name things after the properties whereby they reveal themselves to
us rather than by names implying what is more fundamental and essential
in them to exist in itself is an absolute perfection essential to
substance to support accidents is only a relative perfection nor can
we know a priori but a substance might perhaps exist without any
accidents we only know that accidents cannot exist without some
substance or subject or power which will sustain them in existence
can substance be apprehended by the senses or only by intellect strictly
speaking only by intellect it is neither a proper object of any one
sense such as taste or colour or sound nor a common object of more
than one sense as extension is with regard to sight and touch it is in
scholastic language not a sensibile per se not itself an object of
sense knowledge but only sensibile per accidens ie it may be
said to be accidentally an object of sense because of its conjunction
with accidents which are the proper objects of sense so that when the
senses perceive accidents what they are really perceiving is the substance
affected by the accidents but strictly and properly it is by intellect we
consciously grasp that which in the reality is the substance while the
external and internal sense faculties make us aware of various qualities
activities or other accidents external to the self or of various
states and conditions of the self the intellectwhich is a faculty of
the same soul as the sense facultiesmakes us simultaneously aware of
corporeal substances actually existing outside us or of the concrete
substance of the ego or self existing and revealing itself to us in
and through its conscious activities as the substantial abiding and
unifying subject and principle of these conscious activities
thus then do we attain to the concept of substance in general to a
conviction of the concrete actual existence of that mode of being the
essential characteristic of which is to exist in itself
in the next place how do we reach a knowledge of the specific natures
of substances233 what is the character and what are the limitations
of such knowledge here especially the very cautious and moderate
doctrine of scholasticism has been largely misconceived and misrepresented
by phenomenists and others about the specific nature of substances we
know just precisely what their accidents reveal to usthat and no more we
have no intuitive insight into their natures all our knowledge here is
abstractive and discursive as are their propertiestheir activities
energies qualities and all their accidentsso is their nature we know
of the latter just what we can infer from the former operari sequitur
esse we have no other key than this to knowledge of their specific
natures we have experience of them only through their properties their
behaviour their activities analysis of this experience a posteriori
reasoning from it inductive generalization based upon it such are the
only channels we possess the only means at our disposal for reaching a
knowledge of their natures
63 phenomenist difficulties against this view its vindicationnow the
phenomenist will really grant all this his only objection will be that
such knowledge of substance is really no knowledge at all or that such
as it is it is useless but surely the knowledge that this mode of being
really exists that there is a mode of being which exists in itself
is already some knowledge and genuine knowledge of substance no doubt
the information contained in this very indeterminate and generic concept
is imperfect but then it is only a starting point an allimportant
starting point however for not only is it perfectible but every item of
knowledge we gather from experience perfects it whereas without it the
intellect is paralysed in its attempt to interpret experience indeed so
indispensable is this concept of substance to the human mind that as we
have seen no philosopher has ever been really able to dispense with it
when phenomenists say that what we call mind is only a bundle of
perceptions and ideas when they speak of the flow of events which is
ourselves of which we are conscious234 the very language they
themselves make use of cries out against their professed phenomenism for
why speak of we ourselves etc if there be no we or ourselves
other than the perceptions ideas events etc referred to
of course the explanation of this strange attitude on the part of these
philosophers is simple enough they have a wrong conception of substance
and of the relation of accidents thereto they appear to imagine that
according to the traditional teaching nothing of all we can discover about
accidentsor as they prefer to term them phenomenacan possibly throw
any light upon the nature of substance as if the rle of phenomena were
to cover up and conceal from us some sort of inner core which they call
substance and not rather to reveal to us the nature of that being
existing in itself of which these phenomena are the properties and
manifestations
the denial of substance leads inevitably to the substantializing of
accidents it is possible that the manner in which some scholastics have
spoken of accidents has facilitated this error235 anyhow the error is
one that leads inevitably to contradictions in thought itself mill for
instance following out the arbitrary postulates of subjectivism and
phenomenism finally analysed all reality into present sensations of the
individual consciousness plus permanent possibilities of sensations
now consistently with the idealistic postulate these permanent
possibilities should be nothing more than a certain tone colouring
quality of the present sensation due to the fact that this has in it
as part and parcel of itself feelings of memory and expectation in which
case the present sensation taken in its concrete fulness would be the
sole reality and would exist in itself this solipsism is the ultimate
logical issue of subjective idealism and it is a sufficient reductio ad
absurdum of the whole system or else to evade this issue the
permanent possibilities are supposed to be something really other than
the present sensations in which case we must ask what mill can mean by
a permanent possibility whether it be subjective or objective
possibility it is presumably according to mills thought some property
or appurtenance of the individual consciousness ie a quality proper
to a subject or substance236 but to deny that the conscious subject is
a substance and at the same time to contend that it is a permanent
possibility of sensation ie that it has properties which can
appertain only to a substance is simply to hold what is
selfcontradictory
after these explanations it will be sufficient merely to state formally
the proof that substances really exist it is exceedingly simple and its
force will be appreciated from all that has been said so far whatever we
become aware of as existing at all must exist either in itself or by
being sustained supported in existence in something else in which it
inheres if it exists in itself it is a substance if not it is an
accident and then the something else which supports it must in turn
either exist in itself or in something else but since an infinite regress
in things existing not in themselves but in other things is impossible we
are forced to admit the reality of a mode of being which exists in
itselfviz substance
or again we are forced to admit the real existence of accidentsor if
you will phenomena or appearancesie of realities or modes of
being whose nature is manifestly to modify or qualify in some way or other
some subject in which they inhere can we conceive a state which is not
a state of something a phenomenon or appearance which is not an
appearance of something a vital act which is not an act of a living
thing a sensation thought desire emotion unless of some conscious
being that feels thinks desires experiences the emotion no and
therefore since such accidental modes of being really exist there exists
also the substantial mode of being in which they inhere
and the experienced realities which verify this notion of substance as
the mode of being which exists in itself are manifestly not one but
manifold individual persons and thingsmen animals plantsare all
so many really and numerically distinct substances 38 so too are the
ultimate individual elements in the inorganic universe whatever these may
be 31 nor does the universal interaction of these individuals on one
another or their manifold forms of interdependence on one another
throughout the course of their everchanging existence and activities
interfere in any way with the substantiality of the mode of being of each
these mutual relations of all sorts very real and actual as they
undoubtedly are only constitute the universe a cosmos thus endowing it
with unity of order but not with unity of substance 27
let us now meet the objection of hume that there is no substantial soul
distinct from its acts that it is only the sumtotal of the acts each of
these being a substance the objection has been repeated in the
metaphorical language in which huxley and taine speak of the soul the
living soul as nothing more than a republic of conscious states or the
movement of a luminous sheaf etc and locke and berkeley had already
contended that an apple or an orange is nothing more than a collection or
sumtotal of sensible qualities so that if we conceive these removed
there is nothing left for beyond these there was nothing there
now we admit that the substance of the soul is not adequately distinct
from its acts or the substance of the apple or orange from its qualities
as a matter of fact we never experience substance apart from accidents or
accidents apart from substance237 we do not know whether there exists
or even whether there can exist a created substance devoid of all
accidents nor can we know from the light of reason alone whether any
accidents could exist apart from substance238 we have therefore no
ground in natural experience for demonstrating such an adequate real
distinction 38 between substance and accidents as would involve the
separability of the latter from the former but that the acts of the soul
are so many really distinct entities each existing in itself each
therefore a substance so that the term soul is merely a title we give
to their sumtotal and similarly the terms apple and orange merely
titles of collections of qualities each of which would be an entity
existing in itself and really distinct from the others each in other
words a substancethis we entirely deny we regard it as utterly
unreasonable of phenomenists thus to multiply substances our contention
is that the individual soul or mind is one substance and that it is
partially and really though not adequately distinct from the
various conscious acts states processes functions which are certainly
themselves real entitiesentities however the reality of which is
dependent on that of the soul entities which this dependent or inhering
mode of being marks off as distinct in their nature and incapable of
total identification with that other noninhering or subsisting mode of
being which characterizes the substance of the soul
we cannot help thinking that this phenomenist denial of substance with
its consequent inevitable substantialization of accidents is largely due
to a mistaken manner of regarding the concrete existing object as a mere
mechanical bundle of distinct and independent abstractions every aspect
of it is mentally isolated from the others and held apart as an
impression an idea etc then the object is supposed to be
constituted by and to consist of a sumtotal of these separate
elements integrated together by some sort of mental chemistry the
attempt is next made to account for our total conscious experience of
reality by a number of principles or laws of what is known as association
of ideas and phenomenists discourse learnedly about these laws in
apparent oblivion of the fact that by denying the reality of any
substantial abiding selfidentical soul distinct from the transient
conscious states of the passing moment they have left out of account the
only reality capable of associating any mental states or making mental
life at all intelligible once the soul is regarded merely as a series of
conscious states or a stream of consciousness or a succession of
pulses of cognitive consciousness such elementary facts as memory
unity of consciousness the feeling of personal identity and personal
responsibility become absolutely inexplicable239
experience therefore does reveal to us the real existence of substances
of things that exist in themselves and likewise the reality of other
modes of being which have their actuality only by inhering in the
substances which they affect a substance says st thomas is a thing
whose nature it is to exist not in another whereas an accident is a thing
whose nature it is to exist in another240 every concrete being that
falls within our experiencea man an oak an applefurnishes us with the
data of these two concepts the being existing in itself the substance
and secondly its accidents the former concept comprises only
constitutive principles which we see to be essential to that sort of
being the material the vegetative the sentient the rational principle
in a man or his soul and his body the material principle and the formal
or vital principle in an apple the latter concept that of accidents
comprises only those characteristics of the thing which are no doubt real
but which do not constitute the essence of the being which can change or
be absent without involving the destruction of that essence an
intellectual analysis of our experience enables usand as we have
remarked above it alone enables usto distinguish between these two
classes of objective concepts the concept of the principles that are
essential to the substance or being that exists in itself and the concept
of the attributes that are accidental to this being and experience alone
enables us by studying the latter group the accidents of the being
whether naturally separable or naturally inseparable from the latter to
infer from those accidents whatever we can know about the former group
about the principles that constitute the specific nature of the particular
kind of substance that may be under investigation
it may perhaps be urged against all this that experience does not
warrant our placing a real distinction between the entities we describe
as accidents and those which we claim to be constitutive of the
substance or thing which exists in itself that all the entities
without exception which we apprehend by distinct concepts in any concrete
existing being such as a man an oak or an apple are only one and the
same individual reality looked at under different aspects that the
distinction between them is only a logical or mental distinction that we
separate in thought what is one in reality because we regard each aspect
in the abstract and apart from the others that to suppose in any such
concrete being the existence of two distinct modes of realityviz a
reality that exists in itself and other realities inhering in this
latteris simply to make the mistake of transferring to the real order of
concrete things what we find in the logical order of conceptual
abstractions
this objection which calls for serious consideration leads to a
different conclusion from the previous objection it suggests the
conclusion not that substances are unreal but that accidents are unreal
even if it were valid it would leave untouched the existence of
substances we hope to meet it satisfactorily by establishing presently
the existence of accidents really distinct from the substances in which
they inhere while the objection draws attention to the important truth
that distinctions recognized in the conceptual order are not always real
it certainly does not prove that all accidents are only mentally distinct
aspects of substance for surely a mans thoughts volitions feelings
emotions his conscious states generally changing as they do from moment
to moment are not really identical with the man himself who continues to
exist throughout this incessant change yet they are realities appearing
and disappearing and having all their actuality in him while he persists
as an actual being existing in himself
64 erroneous views on the nature of substanceif we fail to remember
that the notion of substance as a being existing in itself and
supporting the accidents which affect it is a most abstract and generic
notion if we transfer it in this abstract condition to the real order if
we imagine that the concrete individual substances which actually exist in
the real order merely verify this widest notion and are devoid of all
further content that they possess in themselves no further richness of
reality if we forget that actual substances in all the variety of their
natures as material or living or sentient or rational and spiritual
are indeed full vibrant palpitating with manifold and diversified
reality if we rob them of all this perfection or locate it in their
accidents as considered apart from themselveswe are likely to form very
erroneous notions both of substances and of accidents and of their real
relations to one another it will help us to form accurate concepts of
them concepts really warranted by experience if we examine briefly some
of the more remarkable misconceptions of substance that have at one time
or other gained currency
a substance is not a concrete core on which concrete accidents are
superimposed or a sort of kernel of which they form the rind such a way
of conceiving them is as misleading as it is crude and material no doubt
the language which for want of better we have to employ in regard to
substance and accidents suggests fancies of that kind we speak of
substance supporting sustaining accidents and of these as supported
by and inhering in the former but this does not really signify any
juxtaposition or superposition of concrete entities the substance is a
subject determinable by its various accidents these are actualizations of
its potentiality its relation to them is the relation of the potential to
the actual of a material or determinable subject to formal or
determining principles but the appearance or disappearance of accidents
never takes place in the same concrete subject by their variations the
concrete subject is changed at any instant the substance affected by its
accidents is one individual concrete being 27 and the inevitable result
of any modification in them is that this individual concrete being is
changed is no longer the same no doubt it preserves its substantial
identity throughout accidental change but not its concrete identitythat
is to say not wholly this is the characteristic of every finite being
subject to change and existing in time it has the actuality of its being
not tota simul but only gradually successively 10 from this too
we see that although substance is a more perfect mode of being than
accidentbecause the former exists in itself while the latter has its
actuality only in something elsenevertheless created finite substance
is a mode of being which is itself imperfect and perfectible by
accidents another illustration of the truth that all created perfection
is only relative not absolute to the notion of inherence we shall
return in connexion with our treatment of accidents 65
b again substance is wrongly conceived as an inert substratum
underlying accidents this false notion appears to have originated with
descartes he conceived the two great classes of created substances
matter and spirit as essentially inert for him matter is simply a res
extensa extension in three dimensions constitutes its essence and
extension is of course inert all motion is given to matter and conserved
in it by god spirit or soul is simply a res cogitans a being whose
essence is thought but in thinking spirit too is passive for it simply
receives ideas as wax does the impress of a seal nay even when soul or
spirit wills it is really inert or passive for god puts all its volitions
into it241 from these erroneous conceptions the earlier disciples of
descartes took the obvious step forward into occasionalism and to them
likewise may be traced the conviction of many contemporary philosophers
that the human soula being that is so eminently vital and activecannot
possibly be a substance neither indeed could it be if substance were
anything like what descartes conceived it to be the german philosophers
wundt and paulsen for example argue that the soul cannot be a substance
but when we inquire what they mean by substance what do we find that
with them the concept of substance applies only to the corporeal
universe where it properly signifies the atoms which are the absolutely
permanent substratum qualitatively and quantitatively unchangeable of
all corporeal reality242 no wonder they would argue that the soul is
not a substance
no actually existing substance is inert what is true however is this
that when we conceive a being as a substance when we think of it under
the abstract concept of substance we of course abstract from its concrete
existence as an active agent in other words we consider it not from the
dynamic but from the static aspect not as it is in the concrete but
as constituting an object of abstract thought and so the error of
descartes seems to have been that already referred tothe mistake of
transferring to the real order conditions that obtain only in the logical
order
c to the cartesian conception of substances as inert entities endowed
only with motions communicated to them ab extra the mechanical or
atomist conception of reality as it is called leibniz opposed the other
extreme conception of substances as essentially active entities for him
substance is an ens prditum vi agendi activity is the fundamental note
in the concept of substance these essentially active entities he
conceived as being all simple and unextended the corporeal no less
than the spiritual ones and he gave them the title of monads it is
unnecessary for our present purpose to go into any details of his
ingenious dynamic theory of the universe as a vast system of these monads
we need only remark that while combating the theory of inert substances he
himself erred in the opposite extreme he conceived every monad as endowed
essentially with active tendency or effort which is never without its
effectan exclusively immanent effect however which is the constant
result of constant immanent action for he denied the possibility of
transitive activity actio transiens and he conceived the immanent
activity of the monad as being in its nature perceptive243 that is to
say cognitive or representative in the sense that each monad though
wrapt up in itself doorless and windowless if we may so describe it
nevertheless mirrors more or less inchoatively vaguely or clearly all
other monads and is thus itself a miniature of the whole universe a
microcosm of the macrocosm apart from the fancifulness of his whole
system a fancifulness which is however perhaps more apparent than real
his conception of substance is much less objectionable than that of
descartes for as a matter of fact every individual actually existing
substance is endowed with an internal directive tendency towards some term
to be realized or attained by its activities every substance has a
transcendental relation to the operations which are natural to it and
whereby it tends to realize the purpose of its being but nevertheless
substance should not be defined by action for all action of created
substances is an accident not a substance nor even by its transcendental
relation to action for when we conceive it under this aspect we conceive
it as an agent or cause not as a substance simply the latter
concept abstracts from action and reveals its object simply as a reality
existing in itself when we think of a substance as a principle of action
we describe it by the term nature
d a very widespread notion of substance is the conception of it as a
permanent stable persisting subject of transient
ephemeral realities called accidents or phenomena this view of
substance is mainly due to the influence of kants philosophy according
to his teaching we can think the succession of phenomena which appear to
our sense consciousness only by the aid of a pure intuition in which our
sensibility apprehends them viz time now the application of the
category of substance to this pure intuition of our sensibility engenders
a schema of the imagination viz the persistence of the object in
time persistence therefore is for him the essential note of substance
herbert spencer too has given apt expression to this widely prevalent
notion existence means nothing more than persistence and hence in mind
that which persists in spite of all changes and maintains the unity of
the aggregate in defiance of all attempts to divide it is that of which
existence in the full sense of the word must be predicatedthat which we
must postulate as the substance of mind in contradistinction to the
varying forms it assumes but if so the impossibility of knowing the
substance of mind is manifest244
thus substance is conceived as the unique but hidden and unknowable basis
of all the phenomena which constitute the totality of human experience
what is to be said of such a conception there is just this much truth in
it that substance is relatively stable or permanent ie in
comparison with accidents the latter cannot survive the destruction or
disappearance of the substance in which they inhere while a substance can
persist through incessant change of its accidents but accidents are not
absolutely ephemeral nor is substance absolutely permanent were an
accident to exist for ever it would not cease to be an accident nor would
a substance be any less a substance were it created and then
instantaneously annihilated but in the latter case the human mind could
not apprehend the substance for since all human cognitive experience
takes place in time which involves duration the mind can apprehend a
substance only on condition that the latter has some permanence some
appreciable duration in existence this fact too explains in some
measure the error of conceiving permanence as essential to a substance
but the error has another source also under the influence of subjective
idealism philosophers have come to regard the individuals consciousness
of his own self the consciousness of the ego as the sole and unique
source of our concept of substance the passage we have just quoted from
spencer is an illustration and since the spiritual principle of our
conscious acts is a permanent principle which abides throughout all of
them thus explaining the unity of the individual human consciousness
those who conceive substance in general after the model of the ego
naturally conceive it as an essentially stable subject of incessant and
evanescent processes
but it is quite arbitrary thus to conceive the ego as the sole type of
substance bodies are substances as well as spirits matter as well as
mind and the permanence of corporeal substances is merely relative
nevertheless they are really substances the relative stability of spirit
which is immortal and the relative instability of matter which is
corruptible have nothing to do with the substantiality of either both
alike are substances for both alike have that mode of being which
consists in their existing in themselves and not by inhering in other
things as accidents do
e spencers conception of substance as the permanent unknowable
ground of phenomena implies that substance is one not manifold and thus
suggests the view of reality known as monism there is yet another
mistaken notion of substance the notion in which the well known
pantheistic philosophy of spinoza has had its origin spinoza appears to
have given the ambiguous definition of descartessubstantia est res quae
ita existit ut nulla alia re indigeat ad existenduman interpretation
which narrowed its application down to the necessary being for he defined
substance in the following terms per substantiam intelligo id quod est
in se et per se concipitur hoc est id cujus conceptus non indiget
conceptu alterius rei a quo formari debeat by the ambiguous phrase
that substance requires no other thing for existing descartes certainly
meant to convey what has always been understood by the scholastic
expression that substance exists in itself he certainly did not mean
that substance is a reality which exists of itself ie that it is
what scholastics mean by ens a se the being that has its actuality from
its own essence by virtue of its very nature and in absolute
independence of all other being for such being is one alone the
necessary being god himself whereas descartes clearly held and taught
the real existence of finite created substances245 yet spinozas
definition of substance is applicable only to such a being that our
concept of this being shows forth the actual existence of the latter as
absolutely explained and accounted for by reference to the essence of this
being itself and independently of any reference to other being in other
words it applies only to the necessary being this conception of
substance is the startingpoint of spinozas pantheistic philosophy
now the scholastic definition of substance and spinozas definition
embody two entirely distinct notions spinozas definition conveys what
scholastics mean by the selfexistent being ens a se and this the
scholastics distinguish from caused or created being ens ab alio both
phrases refer formally and primarily not to the mode of a beings
existence when it does exist but to the origin of this existence in
relation to the beings essence and specifically it marks the distinction
between the essence that is selfexplaining selfexistent essentially
actual a se the necessary being and essences that do not
themselves explain or account for their own actual existence essences
that have not their actual existence from themselves or of themselves
essences that are in regard to their actual existence contingent or
dependent essences which therefore if they actually exist can do so
only dependently on some other being whence they have derived this
existence ab alio and on which they essentially depend for its
continuance
not the least evil of spinozas definition is the confusion caused by
gratuitously wresting an important philosophical term like substance
from its traditional sense and using it with quite a different meaning
and the same is true in its measure of the other mistaken notions of
substance which we have been examining by defining substance as an ens
in se or per se stans scholastic philosophers mean simply that
substance does not depend intrinsically on any subjective or
material cause in which its actuality would be supported they do not
mean to imply that it does not depend extrinsically on an efficient
cause from which it has its actuality and by which it is conserved in
being they assert that all created substances no less than all
accidents have their being ab alio from god that they exist only by
the divine creation and conservation and act only by the divine
concursus or concurrence but while substances and accidents are both
alike dependent on this extrinsic conserving and concurring influence of a
divine transcendent being substances are exempt from this other and
distinct mode of dependence which characterizes accidents intrinsic
dependence on a subject in which they have their actuality246
    when we say that substance exists in itself obviously we do
    not attach to the preposition in any local signification as
    a part existing in the whole nor do we mean that they exist
    in themselves in the same sense as they have their being in
    god in a certain true sense all creatures exist in god in
    ipso enim vivimus et movemur et sumus acts xxii 28 in the
    sense that they are kept in being by his omnipresent conserving
    power but he does not sustain them as a subject in which they
    inhere as substance sustains the accidents which determine it
    thereby giving expression to its concrete actuality247 by
    saying that substance exists in itself we mean to exclude the
    notion of its existing in another thing as an accident does
    and this we shall understand better by examining a little more
    closely this peculiar mode of being which characterizes accidents
65 the nature of accident its relation to substance its causesfrom
all that has preceded we will have gathered the general notion of
accident as that mode of real being which is found to have its reality
not by existing in itself but by affecting determining some substance
in which it inheres as in a subject what do we mean by saying that
accidents inhere in substances as their subjects here we must at once
lay aside as erroneous the crude conception of something as located
spatially within something else as contained in container as eg
water in a vessel and the equally crude conception of something being in
something else as a part is in the whole as eg an arm is in the body
such imaginations are wholly misleading
the actually existing substance has its being or reality it is an actual
essence each real accident of it is likewise a reality and has an
essence distinct from that of the substance yet not wholly independent
of the latter it is a determination of the determinable being of the
substance affecting or modifying the latter in some way or other and
having no other raison dtre than this rle of actualizing in some
specific way some receptive potentiality of the concrete substance and
since its reality is thus dependent on that of the substance which it
affects we cannot ascribe to it actual essence or being in the same sense
as we ascribe this to substance but only analogically248 2 hence
scholastics commonly teach that we ought to conceive an accident rather as
an entity of an entity ens entis than as an entity simply
rather as inhering indwelling affecting inesse some subject than
simply as existing itself esse as something whose essence is rather
the determination affection modification of an essence than itself an
essence proper the term essence designating properly only a substance
accidentis esse est inesse249 this conception might no doubt if
pressed too far be inapplicable to absolute accidents like quantity
which are something more than mere modifications of substance but it
rightly emphasizes the dependence of the reality of accident on that of
substance the nonsubstantial and diminished character of the
accidentmode of being it also helps to show that the inherence of
accident in substance is a relationof determining to determinable
beingwhich is sui generis and finally it puts us on our guard against
the errors that may be and have been committed by conceiving accidents
in the abstract and reasoning about them apart from their substances as
if they themselves were substances
this inherence of accident in substance this mode of being whereby it
affects determines or modifies the substance differs from accident to
accident these in fact are classified into suprema genera by reason
of their different ways of affecting substance 60 to this we shall
return later here we may inquire about this general relation of accident
to substance whether it is essential to an accident actually to inhere
in a substance if not immediately then at least through the medium of
some other accident we suggest this latter alternative because as we
shall see presently there are some accidents such as colour taste
shape which immediately affect the extension of a body and only
through this the substance of the body itself now the ordinary course of
nature never presents us with accidents except as inhering mediately or
immediately in a substance nor is it probable that the natural light of
our reason would ever suggest to us the possibility of an exception to
this general law but the christian philosopher knows from divine
revelation that in the blessed eucharist the quantity or extension of
bread and wine together with the taste colour form etc which affect
this extension remain in existence after their connatural substance of
bread and wine has disappeared by transubstantiation in the supernatural
order of his providence god preserves these accidents in existence without
a subject but in this state though they do not actually inhere in any
substance they retain their natural aptitude and exigence for such
inherence the christian philosopher therefore will not define accident
as the mode of being which inheres in a subject but as the mode of
being which in the ordinary course of nature inheres in a subject or
as the mode of being which has a natural exigence to inhere in a
subject it is not actual inherence but the natural exigence to
inhere that is essential to an accident as such250
furthermore an accident needs a substance not formally qua substance
or as a mode of being naturally existing in itself it needs a substance
as a subject in which to inhere which it will in some way affect
determine qualify but the subject in which it immediately inheres need
not always be a substance it may be some other accident in which case
both of course will naturally require some substance as their ultimate
basis
comparing now the concept of accident with that of substance we find that
the latter is presupposed by the former that the latter is prior in
thought to the former that we conceive accident as something over and
above something superadded to substance as subject for instance we can
define matter and form without the prior concept of body or animality and
rationality without the prior concept of man but we cannot define colour
without the prior concept of body or the faculty of speech without the
prior concept of man251
substance therefore is prior in thought to accident but is the
substance itself also prior temporally prior tempore to its
accidents it is prior in time to some of them no doubt the individual
human being is thus prior for instance to the knowledge he may acquire
during life but there is no reason for saying that a substance must be
prior in time to all its accidents252 so far as we can discover no
created substance comes into existence devoid of all accidents corporeal
substance devoid of internal quantity or spiritual substance devoid of
intellect and will
if prior in thought though not necessarily in time to its accidents is
a substance prior to its accidents really ontologically prior
natura yes it is the real or ontological principle of its accidents
it sustains them and they depend on it it is a passive or material cause
using the term material in the wide sense as applicable even to
spiritual substances or a receptive subject determined in some way by
them as formal principles it is at the same time an efficient and passive
cause of some of its own accidents the soul is an efficient cause of its
own immanent processes of thought and volition and at the same time a
passive principle of them undergoing real change by their occurrence of
others it is merely a receptive determinable subject of those namely
which have an adequate and necessary foundation in its own essence and
which are called properties in the strict sense without these it cannot
exist though they do not constitute its essence or enter into the
concept of the latter but it is not prior to them in time nor is it the
efficient cause of them it is however a real principle of them an
essence from the reality of which they necessarily result and on which
their own reality depends such for instance is the faculty of thought
or volition or speech in regard to man
the accidentmode of being is therefore a mode of being which determines
a substance in some real way its formal effect is to give the substance
some real and definite determination not esse simpliciter but esse
tale with the substance it constitutes a concrete real being which is
unum per accidens not unum per se
the accident has no formal cause it is itself a form and its
causality is that of a formal cause which consists in its communicating
itself to a subject and by its union therewith constituting some new
realityin this case a concrete being endowed with accidental unity
accidents have of course a material cause not however in the sense
of a materia ex qua a material from which they are constituted
inasmuch as they are simple forms but in the sense of a subject in
which they are received and in which they inhere and this material
cause is proximately or remotely substance
substance also is the final cause the raison dtre of the reality
of the accidental mode of being accidents exist for the perfecting of
substances accidentia sunt propter substantiam as we have seen
already and as will appear more clearly later on the fundamental reason
for the reality of an accidental mode of being really distinct from the
created or finite substance for the infinite substance has no accidents
is that the created substance is imperfect limited in its actual
perfection does not exist tota simul but develops through a process
of change in time from its first or essential perfection through
intermediate perfections till it reaches the final perfection 46 of
its being
have all accidents efficient causes those which are called common
accidents as distinct from proper accidents or properties 66 have
undoubtedly efficient causes the various agencies which produce real but
accidental changes in the individual substances of the universe proper
accidents however inasmuch as they of necessity exist simultaneously
with the substances to which they belong and flow from these substances
by a necessity of the very essence of these latter cannot be said to have
any efficient causes other than those which contribute by their efficiency
to the substantial changes by which these substances are brought into
actual existence nor can they be said to be caused efficiently by these
substances themselves but only to flow or result necessarily from the
latter inasmuch as they come into existence simultaneously with but
dependently on these substances hence while substances are universally
regarded as real principles of their propertiesas for instance the
soul in regard to intellect and will or corporeal substance in regard to
quantitythey are not really efficient causes of their properties ie
they do not produce these properties by action for these properties
are antecedent to all action of the substance nor can a created
substance act by its essence but only through active powers or
faculties or forces which meditate between the essence of a created
substance and its actions and which are the proximate principles of these
actions while the substance or nature is their remote principle hence
the properties which necessarily result from a substance or nature have
as their efficient causes the agencies productive of the substance
itself253
66 main divisions of accidentsthese considerations will help us to
understand the significance of a few important divisions of accidents
into proper and common inseparable and separable we shall then be in a
position to examine the nature of the distinction between accidents and
substance and to establish the existence of accidents really distinct
from substance
a the attributes which we affirm of substance other than the notes
constitutive of its essence are divided into proper accidents or
properties in the strict sense  proprium and common
accidents or accidents in the more ordinary sense 
accidens a property is an accident which belongs exclusively to a
certain class or kind of substance and is found always in all members
of that class inasmuch as it has an adequate foundation in the nature of
that substance and a necessary connexion therewith such for instance
are the faculties of intellect and will in all spiritual beings the
faculties of speaking laughing weeping in man the temporal and spatial
mode of being which characterizes all created substances254 when
regarded from the logical point of view as attributes predicable of their
substances considered as logical subjects they are distinguished on the
one hand from what constitutes the essence of this subject as genus
differentia species but also on the other hand from those
attributes which cannot be seen to have any absolutely necessary connexion
with this subject the latter attributes alone are called logical
accidents the test being the absence of a necessary connexion in thought
with the logical subject255 but the former class which are
distinguished from logical accidents and called logical properties
propria are none the less real accidents when considered from the
ontological standpoint for they do not constitute the essence of the
substance they are outside the concept of the latter and
superaddedthough necessarilyto it whether however all or any of
these properties which philosophers thus classify as real or
ontological accidents proper accidents of certain substances are
really distinct from the concrete individual substances to which they
belong or are only aspects of the latter substantial modes only
virtually distinct in each case from the individual substance itselfis
another and more difficult question 69 such a property is certainly not
really separable from its substance we cannot conceive either to exist
really without the other though we can by abstraction think and reason
and speak about either apart from the other256 real inseparability is
however regarded by scholastic philosophers as quite compatible with what
they understand by a real distinction 38
a common accident is one which has no such absolutely necessary
connexion with its substance as a property has one which therefore
can be conceived as absent from the substance without thereby entailing
the destruction of the latters essence or of anything bound up by a
necessity of thought with this essence and such common accidents are of
two kinds
they may be such that in the ordinary course of nature and so far as its
forces and laws are concerned they are never found to be absent from
their connatural substancesinseparable accidents thus the colour of
the ethiopian is an inseparable accident of his human nature as an
ethiopian he is naturally black but if born of ethiopian parents he
would still be an ethiopian even if he happened to grow up white instead
of black we could not however conceive an ethiopian or any other human
being existing without the faculties not the use of intellect and will
or the faculty not the organs or the actual exercise of the faculty of
human speech
or common accidents may be such that they are sometimes present in their
substances and sometimes absentseparable accidents these are by far
the most numerous class of accidents thinking willing talking and
actions generally health or illness virtues vices acquired habits
rest or motion temperature colour form location etc
b the next important division of accidents is that into mere
extrinsic denominations and intrinsic accidents the latter being
subdivided into modal and absolute accidents respectively
an absolute accident is one which not merely affects its substance
intrinsically giving the latter an actual determination or mode of being
of some sort or other but which has moreover some entity or reality
proper to itself whereby it thus affects the substance an entity really
distinct from the essence of the substance thus determined by it such
for instance are all vital activities of living things257 knowledge
and other acquired habits quantity the fundamental accident whereby
corporeal substances are all capable of existing extended in space and
such sensible qualities and energies of matter as heat colour mechanical
force electrical energy etc such too according to many are
intellect will and sense faculties in man
there are however other intrinsic determinations of substance other
modifications of the latter which do not seem to involve any new or
additional reality in the substance over and above the modification
itself such for instance are motion rest external form or figure in
bodies these are called modal accidents they often affect not the
substance itself immediately but some absolute accident of the latter
and are hence called accidental modes those enumerated are obviously
modes of the quantity of bodies now the appearance or disappearance of
such an accident in a substance undoubtedly involves a real change in the
latter and not merely in our thought when a body moves or comes to
rest or alters its form there is a change in the reality as well as in
our thought and in this sense these accidents are real and intrinsic to
their substances yet though we cannot say that motion rest shape
etc are really identical with the body and only mentally distinct
aspects of it at the same time neither can we say that by their
appearance or disappearance the body gains or loses any reality other than
an accidental determination of itself whereas it does gain something more
than this when it is heated or electrified or increased in quantity
just as a man who acquires knowledge or virtue is not only really
modified but is modified by real entities which he has acquired not
having actually possessed them before
finally there are accidents which do not affect the substance
intrinsically at all which do not determine any real change in it but
merely give it an extrinsic denomination in relation to something outside
it 60 thus while the quality of heat is an absolute accident in a
body the action whereby the latter heats neighbouring bodies is no new
reality in the body itself and produces no real change in the latter but
only gives it the extrinsic denomination of heating in reference to
these other bodies in which the effect really takes place similarly the
location of any corporeal substance in space or in time relatively
to others in the space or time seriesits external place ubi or time
quando as they are calledor the relative position of its parts
situs in the place occupied by it these do not intrinsically
determine it or confer upon it any intrinsic modification of its
substance not indeed that they are mere entia rationis mere logical
fictions of our thought they are realities but not realities which
affect the substances denominated from them they are accidental modes of
other substances or of the absolute accidents of other substances
finally the accident which we call a real relation presupposes in its
subject some absolute accident such as quantity or quality or some real
and intrinsic change determining these or affecting the substance itself
but whether relation is itself a reality over and above such foundation
is a disputed question
from these classifications of accidents it will be at once apparent that
the general notion of accident as a dependent mode of being superadded
to the essence of a substance and in some way determining the latter is
realized in widely different and merely analogical ways in the different
ultimate classes of accidents
67 real existence of accidents nature of the distinction between
accidents and substanceit would be superfluous to prove the general
proposition that accidents really exist in establishing the real
existence of substances we have seen that the real existence of some
accidents at least has never been seriously denied these are often called
nowadays phenomena and philosophers who have denied or doubted the real
existence of substances have been called phenomenists simply because
they have admitted the real existence only of these phenomena though if
they were as logical as hume they might have seen with him that such
denial so far from abolishing substance could only lead to the
substantializing of accidents 63
but while undoubtedly there are realities which exist in themselves
such as individual men animals and plants there is no reason for
attributing this same mode of existence to entities such as the thoughts
volitions emotions virtues or vices of the individual man or the
instinct hunger or illness of the dog or the colour perfume or form
of the rose the concrete individual man or dog or rose reveals itself
to our minds as a substantial entity affected with these various
accidental entities which are really distinct from the substantial entity
itself and from one another nay in most of the instances just cited
they are physically separable from the substantial entity in which they
inhere not of course in the sense that they could actually exist without
it but in the sense that it can and does continue to exist actually
without them 38 for it continues to exist while they come and go
appear and disappear258 of course the concrete individual man or
dog or rose does not continue to exist actually unchanged and
totally identical with itself throughout the change of accidents 64
for the accidents are part of the concrete individual reality nay even
the substance itself of the concrete individual does not remain totally
unaffected by the change of the accidents because if they really affect
it as they do their change cannot leave it totally unaffected substance
is not at all a changeless concrete core surrounded by an everchanging
rind or vesture of accidents or a dark hidden immutable and inscrutable
background of a panorama of phenomena 64 but though it is beyond all
doubt really affected by the change of its accidents it is also beyond
all doubt independent of them in regard to the essential mode of its
being in as much as it exists and continues to exist in itself throughout
all fluctuation of its accidents while these on the other hand have only
that essentially dependent mode of being whereby they are actual only by
affecting and determining some subject in which they inhere and which
supports their actuality
the existence therefore of some accidents which are not only really
distinct but even physically separable from their substances cannot
reasonably be called into question to deny the existence of such
accidents or what comes to the same thing their real distinction from
substance is to take up some one of these three equally untenable
positions that all the changes which take place within and around us are
substantial changes or that there is no such thing as real change all
change being a mental illusion or that contradictory states can be
affirmed of the same reality259
but the nature of the real distinction between accidents and substance is
not in all cases so easy to determine nor can we discuss the question
here in reference to each summum genus of accident separately deferring
to the chapter on relation the question of the distinction of this
particular accident from substance and the other categories we may
confine our attention here to the distinction between substance and the
three classes of accidents we have called extrinsic denominations
modal accidents and absolute accidents respectively there are
accidents writes kleutgen260 which place nothing and change nothing
in the subject itself but are ascribed to it by reason of some extrinsic
thing others again produce indeed in the subject itself some new mode
of being but without their existing in it as a new reality distinct from
its reality others finally are themselves a new reality and have thus
a being which is proper to themselves though this being is of course
dependent on the substance these latter alone can be really distinct
from the substance in the full sense in which a real distinction is that
between thing and thing now cartesian philosophers have denied that there
are any such accidents as those of the latter class rejecting the
division of accidents into absolute and modal they teach that all
accidents are mere modifications or determinations of substance that
they consist solely of various locations and combinations of the ultimate
parts of a substance or relations of the latter to other substances
now all extrinsic denominations of a substance do seem on analysis
ultimately to resolve themselves partly into relations of the latter to
other substances and partly into modal or absolute accidents of other
substances hence we may confine our attention here to the distinction
between these two classes of accident and their connatural substances
    and approaching this question it will be well for us to bear two
    things in mind in the first place our definitions both of
    substance and of accident are abstract and generic or universal
    but the abstract and universal does not exist as such the
    concrete individual actually existing substance is never
    merely a being that naturally exists in itself nor is the
    accident of such a substance merely a verification of its
    definition as a being that naturally inheres in something else
    in every case what really and actually exists is the individual
    a being concreted of substance and accidents a being which is
    ever and always a real unity composite no doubt but really
    one and this no matter what sort of distinction we hold to obtain
    between the substance and its accidents this is important its
    significance will be better appreciated according as we examine
    the distinctions in question secondly as scholastics understand
    a real distinction this can obtain not merely between different
    persons or things which are separate from one another in time
    or space but also between different constitutive principles of
    any one single concrete composite individual being 38 we have
    seen that they are not agreed as to whether the essence and the
    existence of any actual creature are really distinct or not 24
    and it may help us to clear up our notion of accident if we
    advert here to their discussion of the question whether or not an
    accident ought to be regarded as having an existence of its own
    an existence proper to itself
    those who think that the distinction between essence and existence
    in created things is a real distinction hold that accidents as
    such have no existence of their own that they are actualized by
    the existence of the substance or rather of the concrete
    composite individual that since the latter is a real unitynot a
    mere artificial aggregation of entities but a being naturally
    oneit can have only one existence impossibile est quod unius
    rei non sit unum esse261 that by this one existence the
    concrete composite essence of the substance as affected and
    determined by its accidents is actualized they contend that if
    each of the principles whether substantial or accidental of a
    concrete individual being had its own existence their union no
    matter how intimate could not form a natural unitary being an
    individual but only an aggregate of such beings it is neither
    the matter nor the form nor the corporeal substance apart from
    its accidents that exists it is the substance completely
    determined by all its accidents and modes that is the proper
    subject of existence262 it alone is actualized and that by
    one existence which is the ultimate actuality of the
    concrete composite individual essence esse est ultimus actus
    hence it is too they urge that an accident should be conceived
    not properly as a being but only as that whereby a being is
    such or such accidens non est ens sed ens entis but it cannot
    be so conceived if we attribute to it an existence of its own for
    then it would be a being in the full and proper sense of the
    word
    this is the view of st thomas and of thomists generally the
    arguments in support of it are serious but not convincing and
    the same may be said of the reasons adduced for the opposite view
    that existence not being really distinct from essence accidents
    in so far as they can be said to have an essence of their own have
    likewise an existence of their own
    supporters of this view not only admit but maintain that the
    entity of a real existing accident is a diminished entity
    inasmuch as it is dependent in a sense in which a really existing
    substance is not dependent they simply deny the thomist assertion
    that substantial and accidental principles cannot combine to form
    a real and natural unit an individual being if each be accorded
    an existence appropriate and proportionate to its partial essence
    nor indeed can thomists prove this assertion moreover if
    existence be not really distinct from essence there is no more
    inconvenience in the claim that partial existences can combine to
    form one complete existence unum esse than in the thomist
    claim that partial essences such as substantial and accidental
    constitutive principles can combine to form one complete essence
    one individual subject of existence then furthermore it is
    urged that the substance exists prior in time to some of its
    accidents that it is prior in nature to its properties which
    are understood to proceed or flow from it and that therefore
    its existence cannot be theirs any more than its essence can be
    theirs finally it is pointed out that since existence is the
    actuality of essence the existence which actualizes a substance
    cannot be identical with that which actualizes an accident at all
    events whether the one existence of the concrete individual
    substance as determined by its accidents be as it were a simple
    and indivisible existential act which actualizes the composite
    individual subject as thomists hold or whether it be a composite
    existential act really identical with the composite individual
    subject as in the other view263 this concrete existence of the
    individual is constantly varying with the variation of the
    accidents of the individual this is equally true on either view
inquiring into the distinction between substance and its intrinsic
accidents whether modal or absolute we have first to remark that all
accidents cannot possibly be reduced to relations for if relation itself
is something extrinsic to the things related it must at least
presuppose a real and intrinsic foundation or basis for itself in the
things related local motion for instance is a change in the spatial
relations of a body to other bodies but it cannot be merely this for
if spatial relations are not mere subjective or mental fabrications if
they are in any intelligible sense real then a change in them must
involve a change of something intrinsic to the bodies concerned now
descartes in denying the existence of absolute accidents in reducing
all accidents to modes of substances understood by modes not any
intrinsic determinations of substance but only extrinsic determinations
of the latter all accidents of material substance were for him mere
locations arrangements dispositions of its extended parts extension
being its essence similarly all accidents of spiritual substance were
for him mere modalities and mutual relations of its thought or
consciousness this latter being for him the essence of spirit we have
here not only the error of identifying or confounding accidents such as
thought and extension with their connatural substances spirit and matter
but also the error of supposing that extrinsic relations and modes of a
substance and changes in these can be real without there being in the
substances themselves any intrinsic real changeable accidents which
would account for the extrinsic relations and their changes if there are
no intrinsic accidents really affecting and determining substances and
yet really distinct from the latter then we must admit either that all
change is an illusion or else that all change is substantial and this is
the dilemma that really confronts the cartesian philosophy
68 modal accidents and the modal distinctionthe real distinction which
we claim to exist between a substance and its intrinsic accidents is not
the same in all cases in regard to some accidents which we have called
intrinsic modes of the substance it is a minor or modal real
distinction in regard to others which we have called absolute accidents
it is a major real distinction 38 let us first consider the former
the term mode has a variety of meanings some very wide some
restricted when one concept determines or limits another in any way we
may call it a mode of the latter if there is no real distinction between
the determining and the determined thoughtobject the mode is called a
metaphysical mode as rationality is of animality in man again created
things are all modes of being and the various aspects of a creature may
be called modes of the latter as finiteness is a mode of every
created being we do not use the term in those wide senses in the present
context here we understand by a mode some positive reality which so
affects another and distinct reality as to determine the latter
proximately to some definite way of existing or acting to which the
latter is itself indifferent without however adding to the latter any
new and proper entity other than the said determination264 such modes
are called physical modes and some philosophers maintain that there are
not only accidental modes thus really distinct from the substance but
that there are even some substantial modes really distinct from the
essence of the substance which they affect for instance that the really
distinct constitutive principles of any individual corporeal substance
matter and form are actually united only in virtue of a substantial mode
whereby each is ordained for union with the other or that subsistence
whereby the individual substance is made a subsistent and incommunicable
person or thing is a substantial mode of the individual nature265
with these latter we are not concerned here but only with accidental
modes such as external shape or figure local motion position
action266 etc now when a substance is affected by such accidents as
these it is impossible on the one hand to maintain that they add any new
positive entity of their own to it they do not seem to have any reality
over and above the determination or modification in which their very
presence in the substance consists and on the other hand it cannot be
denied that they express some real predicate which can be affirmed of the
substance in virtue of their presence in it and that independently of our
thought in other words it cannot be maintained that they are mere
figments or forms of thought mere entia rationis if a piece of wax has
a certain definite shape this shape is inseparable from the wax it is
nothing except in the wax for it cannot exist apart from the wax but in
the wax it is something in some real sense distinct from the wax inasmuch
as the wax would persist even if it disappeared no doubt it is essential
to the wax as extended in space to have some shape or other but it is
indifferent to any particular shape and hence something distinct from it
is required to remove this indifference this something is the particular
shape it actually possesses the shape therefore is an accidental mode
of the extension of the wax a mode which is really distinct by a minor
real distinction from this extension which is its immediate subject267
hence we conclude that there are accidental modes or modal accidents
really distinct from the subjects in which they inhere
69 distinction between substance and its proper accidents unity of the
concrete beingturning next to the distinction between absolute accidents
and substance we have seen already that separable absolute accidents such
as acquired habits of mind and certain sensible qualities and energies of
bodies are really distinct from their subjects absolute accidents which
are naturally inseparable from their subjectssuch as external quantity
or spatial extension or volume is in regard to the corporeal substanceare
also really distinct from their subjects though we cannot know by reason
alone whether or how far such accidents are absolutely separable from
these subjects from christian revelation we know that extension at least
is separable from the substance of a body and with extension all the
other corporeal accidents which inhere immediately in extension268
but a special difficulty arises in regard to the nature of the distinction
between a substance and its proper accidents269 ie those which
have such an adequate and necessary ground in the essence of the substance
that the latter cannot exist without them accidents which are
simultaneous with the substance and proceed necessarily from it such as
the internal quantity of a corporeal substance or the intellectual and
appetitive powers or faculties of a spiritual substance the medieval
scholastic philosophers were by no means unanimous as to the nature of
this distinction their discussion of the question centres mainly around
the distinction between the spiritual human soul and its spiritual
faculties intellect and will and between these faculties themselves it
is instructiveas throwing additional light on what they understood by a
real distinctionto find that while thomists generally have held that the
distinction here in question is a real distinction many other scholastics
have held that it is only a virtual distinction while scotists have
generally taught that it is a formal distinction 3539
kleutgen270 interprets the formal distinction advocated by scotus in the
present context as really equivalent to the virtual distinction st
bonaventure after referring to the latter distinction and to the real
distinction propounded by st thomas adopts himself an intermediate view
that the faculties of the soul are indeed really distinct from one
another but nevertheless are not really distinct as accidental entities
from the substance of the soul itself we see how this can be by
considering that the material and formal principles which constitute a
corporeal substance though really distinct from each other are not
really distinct from the substance itself they are not accidents of the
latter but constitute its essence and so are to be referred reductiv
to the category of substance so by analogy the faculties of the soul
though really distinct from each other do not belong to any accidental
category really distinct from the substance of the soul but belong
reductiv to the latter category not indeed as constituting but as
flowing immediately and necessarily from the substance of the soul
itself271 and like st thomas he finds the ultimate source and
explanation of this multiplicity of faculties and forces in the
finiteness of the created substance as such272 but st thomas went
farther than st bonaventure for he taughtas indeed thomists generally
teach and many who are not thomiststhat the faculties of the human soul
are really distinct from one another not merely as proximate principles
of really distinct vital acts but as accidental entities or essences and
that as such they are really distinct from the essence or substance itself
of the human soul the arguments in favour of this view will be given in
their proper place in connexion with the category of quality if they
are not demonstrative in their force they are certainly such that the
view for which they make is very highly probable but we are concerned
here to show in this concluding section that the recognition of a real
distinction in general between substance and its accidents does not in any
way compromise the real unity of the concrete individual being it has
been widely accused of doing so by philosophers who try to discredit this
view without fully understanding it this characteristically modern
attitude is illustrated by the persistent attempts that have been made in
recent times to throw ridicule on what they describe as the faculty
psychology273
the source of this groundless charge lies partly in the mistaken
conception of accident and substance as concrete entities superadded the
one to the other partly in the mistaken notion that the union of
substance and accidents cannot result in a real unity that there cannot
be more or less perfect grades of real unity 27 and partly in the false
assumption that real distinction always implies mutual separability of
concrete entities of these errors we need only refer to that concerning
unity
modern philosophers not uncommonly conceive the union of substance and
accidents as being necessarily a mere mechanical union or aggregation
and oppose it to organic unity which they regard as a real unity
involving the richness of an energetic living multiplicity this
involves a misrepresentation of the traditional scholastic view the union
of substance and accident is not a mechanical union nothing could be
farther from the minds of the scholastic interpreters of aristotle than
the conception of the ultimate principles of the universe of our
experience as inert entities moved according to purely mechanical laws or
of the individual concrete being as a mere machine or a mere aggregate of
mechanical elements they recognized even in the individual inorganic
substance an internal unifying active and directive principle of all the
energies and activities of the thingits substantial form and if this is
all those philosophers mean by the metaphorical transference of the terms
organic unity internal living principle of development etc to the
mineral world they are so far in accord with the traditional scholastic
philosophy274 while if they mean that all substances are principles of
vital energy or that all reality is one organic unity in the literal
sense of these terms they are committing themselves either to the
palpably false theory of panpsychism or to the gratuitous reassertion of
a very old and very crude form of monism
by organic unity we understand the unity of any living organism a unity
which is much more perfect than that of the parts of a machine or than
any natural juxtaposition of material parts in an inorganic whole for the
organs though distinct in number and in nature from one another are
united by an internal principle to form one living individual so that if
any organ were separated from the living organism it would cease to be an
organ275 but organic unity is not by any means the most perfect kind of
unity conceivable276 the living organism exists and develops and
attains to the perfection of its being only through a multiplicity of
integral parts extended in space the spiritual substance is subject to no
such dispersion of its being from its union with the faculties whereby it
attains to its natural development there results a real unity of a higher
order than that of any organism
and nevertheless even though the unity of the concrete spiritual
substance and its faculties be so far higher than a mechanical or even an
organic unity it is not perfect even though the faculties of the soul be
determinations of its substance even though they flow from it as
actualities demanded by its essence for the normal and natural development
of its being still it is a complete subsisting essence of its kind
without them it possesses its essential perfection without them so
that however intimate be their union with it they can never form one
essence with it it needs them only for the fuller development of its
being by acquiring further intermediate perfections and thus attaining
to its final perfection 46
and here we touch on the most fundamental ground of the distinction in
all created things between their substance and their accidental
perfections unlike the necessary absolute being whose infinite
perfection is the eternal actuality of his essence no creature possesses
the actuality of its being tota simul but only by a progressive
development whereby it gradually acquires really new intermediate and
final perfections really distinct from though naturally due to its
essence hence even though some of its accidentsproperties such as the
powers and faculties we have been discussingbe not really distinct from
the essence wherewith they are necessarily connected this is not true of
its acquired habits and dispositions or of the activities which proceed
from these latter as their proximate principles at the same time the
concrete being is at every moment of its existence and development a
real unity but a unity which involving in itself as it does a real
multiplicity of distinct principles must ever fall infinitely short of
the perfect type of real unitythat realized only in the selfexistent
necessary being
chapter ix nature and person
70 some divisions of substancesin the preceding chapter we discussed
the nature of substance and accident in general and the relation between
a substance and its accidents we must next examine the category of
substance more in detail terminating as it does in the important concept
of personality or person this latter conception is one which must have
its origin for all philosophers in the study of the human individual but
which for scholastic philosophers is completed and perfected by the
light of christian revelation we shall endeavour to show in the first
place what can be gathered from the light of reason about the constitution
of personality and also briefly to note how christian revelation has
increased our insight into the perfections involved in it as leading up
to the concept of person we must set forth certain divisions or
classifications of substance into first and second substances and
into complete and incomplete substances277
a the specific and generic natures of substantial entities do not
inhere like accidents in individual substances they constitute the
essence of the latter and hence these universals are called substances
but the universal as such does not really exist it is realized only in
individuals in the logical order it presupposes the individual as a
logical subject of which it is affirmed a subjectum attributionis seu
praedicationis hence it is called a second substance while the
individual substance is called a first substance of course we can
predicate attributes of universal substances and use these as logical
subjects as when we say man is mortal but such propositions have no
real meaning and give us no information about reality except in so far
as we can refer their predicates mortal through the medium of their
universal subjects man back ultimately to the individual substances
john james etc which alone are real and in which alone the universal
man has its reality hence the individual is in the logical order
the ultimate and fundamental subject of all our predications and
furthermore the individual substance cannot be used as a logical
predicate of anything underlying itself while the universal substance can
be so used in relation to the individual
in the ontological order of course the universal substance is
individualized and as individual it is the subject in which all
accidents inhere their subjectum inhaesionis the only subject of
many of them and the remote or ultimate subject of those of them
which inhere immediately in other accidents
thus while in the ontological order all substances whether we think of
them as universal or as individual are the ultimate subjects of inhesion
for all real accidents in the logical order it is only the individual
substance that is the ultimate subject of attribution for all logical
predicates hence it was that the individual substance   
vindicating for itself more fully the rle of subject was called by
aristotle   substantia prima while he called the universal
specific or generic substance   substantia secunda278
these are of course two ways of regarding substance and not two really
distinct species of substance as genus the distinction between the
membra dividentia is logical not real
    the perfectly intelligible sense in which aristotle and the
    scholastics designate the universal a substance the sense of
    moderate realism according to which the universal constitutes
    and is identical with the essence of the individual person or
    thing is entirely different from the sense in which many
    exponents of modern monistic idealism conceive the universal as
    the substance par excellence the ens realissimum
    determining expressing evolving itself in the individual
    phenomena of mind and of nature which would be merely its
    manifestations279
b the divisions of substance into spiritual and corporeal of the
latter into inorganic and organic of these again into vegetative and
animal and finally of animal substances into brute animals and human
beingsoffer no special difficulties all purely natural or rational
knowledge of the possibility and nature of purely spiritual substances is
based on the analogy of our knowledge of the human soul which though a
spiritual substance is not a pure spirit but is naturally allied with
matter in its mode of existence the individual human being offers to
human experience the sole example of the sufficiently mysterious
conjunction and combination of matter and spirit of the corporeal mode of
being and the spiritual mode of being to form one composite substance
partly corporeal and partly spiritual
c this in turn suggests the division of substances into simple and
composite the latter are those which we understand to be constituted by
the natural and substantial union of two really distinct but incomplete
substantial principles a formative determining specifying principle
and a material determinable indifferent principle such are all
corporeal substances whether inorganic vegetative sentient or rational
the former or simple substances are those which we understand to be
constituted by a sole and single substantial principle which determines
and specifies their essence without the conjunction of any material
determinable principle we have no direct and immediate experience of any
complete created substance of this kind but each of us has such direct
experience of an incomplete simple substance viz his own soul while
we can infer from our experience the existence of other incomplete
simple substances viz the formative principles of corporeal
substances as also the possibility of such complete simple substances
as pure spirits and the actual existence of the perfectly simple
uncreated substance of the infinite being
d if there are such things as composite substances ie substances
constituted by the substantial union of two really distinct principles
then it follows that while the composite substance itself is complete
each of its substantial constitutive principles is incomplete of course
there are many philosophers nowadays who reject as mere mental fictions
as products of mere logical distinctions and as devoid of objective
validity the notions of composite substance and incomplete substance
nor is this to be wondered at when we remember what a variety of
groundless and gratuitous notions are current in regard to substance
itself 64 but understanding substance in the traditional sense already
explained 62 there is nothing whatever inconsistent in the notion of a
composite substance or of an incomplete substanceprovided these notions
are understood in the sense to be explained presently nay more not only
are these notions intrinsically possible we must even hold them to be
objectively valid and real to be truly expressive of the nature of
reality unless we are prepared to hold that there is no such thing as
substantial change in the universe and that man himself is a mere
aggregate of material atoms moved according to mechanical laws and
inhabited by a conscious soul or thinking principle rather than an
individual being with one definite substantial nature
what then are we to understand by complete and incomplete substances
respectively a substance is regarded as complete in the fullest sense
when it is wanting in no substantial principle without which it would be
incapable of existing and discharging all its functions in the actual
order as an individual of some definite species of course no created
substance exists or discharges its functions unless it is endowed with
some accidents eg with properties faculties forces etc but there
is no question of these here we are considering only the essential
perfections of the substance thus then any existing individual of any
speciesa man a horse an oakis a complete substance in this fullest
sense it is complete in the line of substance in substantial
perfection in ordine substantialitatis inasmuch as it can exist and
does actually exist without being conjoined or united substantially with
any other substance to form a composite substance other than itself and
it is complete in the line of specific perfection in ordine
speciei because not only can it exist without such conjunction with any
other substantial principle but it can discharge all the functions
natural to its species and thus tend towards its final perfection 47
without such conjunction
but it is conceivable that a substance might be complete in the line of
substantial perfections and thus be capable of existing in the actual
order and discharging there some of the functions of its species without
conjunction with any other substantial principle and yet be incapable of
discharging all the functions natural to an individual of its species
without conjunction with some other substantial principle in which case
it would be incomplete in the line of specific perfection though
complete in everything pertaining to its substantiality we know of one
such substancethe human soul being spiritual and immortal it can exist
apart from the body to which it is united by nature and in this separated
condition retain and exercise its spiritual faculties of intellect and
will it is therefore complete as regards the distinctively substantial
perfection whereby it is capable of existing in itself but being of its
nature destined for union with a material principle constituting an
individual of the human species only by means of such union and being
capable of discharging some of the functions of this species viz the
sentient and vegetative functions only when so united it has not all
the perfections of its species independently of the body and it is
therefore an incomplete substance in the line of specific perfections
though complete in those essential to its substantiality
again if it be true that just as man is composed of two substantial
principles soul and body so every living thing is composed of a
substantial vital principle and a substantial material principle and that
every inorganic individual thing is likewise composed of two really
distinct substantial principles a formative and a passive or material
principle and if furthermore it be true that apart from the spiritual
principle in man every other vital or formative principle of the composite
things of our experience is of such a nature that it cannot actually
exist except in union with some material principle and vice versathen
it follows necessarily that all such substantial principles of these
complete composite substances are themselves incomplete substances and
incomplete not only in regard to perfections which would make them
subsisting individuals of a species but unlike the human soul
incomplete even in the line of substantiality itself inasmuch as no one
of them is capable of actually existing at all except in union with its
connatural and correlative principle
thus we arrive at the notion of substances that are incomplete in the
line of specific perfections or in that of substantial perfections or
even in both lines an incomplete substance therefore is not one which
verifies the definition of substance only in part the incomplete
substance fully verifies the definition of a substance280 it is
conjoined no doubt with another to form a complete substance but it
does not exist in the other or in the composite substance as accidents
do it is a substantial principle of the composite substance not an
accidental determination of the latter or of the other substantial
principle with which it is conjoined it thus verifies the notion of
substance as a mode of being which naturally exists in itself and united
with its correlative substantial principle it discharges the function of
supporting all accidental determinations which affect the composite
substantial essence since however it does not exist itself
independently as an individual of a species but only forms the complete
individual substance by union with its correlative substantial principle
it may be and has been accurately described as not belonging to the
category of substance formally but only referentially reductiv
the concepts of composite substance of complete and incomplete
substances understood as we have just explained them are therefore
perfectly intelligible in themselves and this is all we are concerned to
show in the present context this is not the place to establish the theses
of psychology and cosmology from which they are borrowed that the human
soul is spiritual and immortal that its union with a really distinct
material principle to form the individual human substance or nature is a
substantial union that all living organisms and all inorganic bodies are
really composite substances and subject to substantial change these
various theses of scholastic philosophy we here assume to be true and if
they are true the conception of incomplete substances naturally united to
form a complete composite substance is not only intelligible as an
hypothesis but is objectively true and valid as a thesis and thus the
notion of an incomplete substance is not only a consistent and legitimate
notion but is also a notion which gives mental expression to an objective
reality
we may add this consideration the concept of an accident really distinct
from its substance involves no intrinsic repugnance yet an accident is a
mode of being which is so weak and wanting in reality if we may speak in
such terms that it cannot naturally exist except by inhering mediately
or immediately in the stronger and more real mode of being which is
substance but an incomplete substance is a higher grade of reality than
any accident therefore if accidents can be real a fortiori incomplete
substances can be real
71 substance and naturewe have already pointed out 13 that the terms
essence substance and nature denote what is really the same thing
regarded under different aspects the term essence is somewhat wider
than substance inasmuch as it means what a thing is whether the
thing be a substance an accident or a concrete existing individual
including substance and accidents
the traditional meaning of the term nature in aristotelian and
scholastic philosophy is unmistakable it means the essence or substance
of an individual person or thing regarded as the fundamental principle
of the latters activities every finite individual comes into existence
incomplete having no doubt its essential perfections and properties
actually but its intermediate and final perfections only
potentially 47 these it realizes gradually through the exercise of
its connatural activities every being is essentially intended for
activity of some sort omne ens est propter suam operationem says st
thomas and by the constant interplay of their activities these beings
realize and sustain the universal order which makes the world a cosmos
there is in all things an immanent purpose or finality which enables us to
speak of the whole system which they form as universal nature281
therefore what we call a substance or essence from the static point
of view we call a nature when we consider it from the dynamic
standpoint or as an agent282 no doubt the forces faculties and
powers the active and passive accidental principles whereby such an
agent exerts and undergoes action are the proximate principles of all
this action and change but the remote and fundamental principle of the
latter is the essence or substance of the agent itself in other words its
nature
    not all modern scholastics however are willing thus to identify
    nature with substance we have no intuitive insight into what any
    real essence or substance is our knowledge of it is discursive
    derived by inference from the phenomena the operations the
    conduct of things in accordance with the principle operari
    sequitur esse moreover the actually existing concrete
    individuala man for instancehas a great variety of activities
    spiritual sentient vegetative and inorganic he has moreover
    in the constitution of his body a variety of distinct organs and
    members he assimilates into his body a variety of inorganic
    substances the tissues of his body appear to be different in
    kind the vital functions which subserve nutrition growth and
    reproduction are at least analogous to mechanical physical and
    chemical changes if indeed they are not really and simply such
    it may be therefore that the ultimate material constituents of
    his body remain substantially unaltered in their passage into
    and through and out of the cycle of his vegetative life that
    they retain their elemental substantial forms while they assume
    a new nature by becoming parts of the one organic whole whose
    higher directive principle dominates and coordinates all their
    various energies283 if this be so there is in the same
    individual a multiplicity of really and actually distinct
    substances each of these moreover has its own existence
    proportionate to its essence since the existence of a created
    reality is not really distinct from its essence nor is there any
    reason for saying that any of these substances is incomplete what
    we have a right to say is that no one of them separately is a
    complete nature that each being an incomplete nature unites
    with all the others to form one complete nature inasmuch as no
    one of them separately is an adequate intrinsic principle of all
    the functions which it can discharge and is naturally destined to
    discharge by its natural union with the others whereas there
    results from their union a new fundamental principle of a
    coordinated and harmonized system of operationsin a word a new
    nature
    this line of thought implies among other things a the view
    that whereas there is no ground for admitting the existence of
    incomplete substances there is ground for distinguishing
    between complete and incomplete natures b the view that
    from the union or conjunction of an actual multiplicity of
    substances each remaining unaltered and persisting in its
    existence actually distinct from the others there can arise one
    single complete naturea nature which will be one being simply
    and really unum ens per se et simpliciter and not merely an
    aggregate of beings or an accidental unity unum per
    accidensand there does arise such a nature whenever the
    component substances not merely cooperate to discharge certain
    functions which none of them could discharge separately which
    indeed is true of an accidental union as of two horses drawing a
    load which neither could draw by itself but when they unite in a
    more permanent and intimate way according to what we call natural
    laws or laws of nature so as to form a new fundamental
    principle of such functions284 these views undoubtedly owe
    their origin to the belief that certain facts brought to light by
    the physical and biological sciences in modern times afford strong
    evidence that the elementary material constituents of bodies
    whether inorganic or living remain substantially unaltered
    while combining to form the multitudinous natural kinds or
    natures of those living or nonliving material things it was to
    reconcile this supposed plurality of actually distinct and
    diverse substances in the individual with the indubitable real
    unity of the latter that these philosophers distinguished
    between substance and nature but it is not clear that the facts
    alleged afford any such evidence of course if the philosopher
    approaches the consideration of it with what we may call the
    atomic preconception of material substances as permanent
    unchangeable entities this view will preclude all recognition of
    substantial change in the universe it will therefore force him
    to conclude that each individual composite agent has a unity
    which must be less than substantial and which because he feels
    it to be more than a mere accidental or artificial unity he
    will describe as natural as a union to form one nature but
    if he approach the evidence in question with the view that
    substantial change is possible this view involving the
    recognition of incomplete substances as real will remove all
    necessity for distinguishing between substance and nature and
    will enable him to conclude that however various and manifold be
    the activities of the individual their coordination and
    unification as proceeding from the individual point to a
    substantial unity in the latter as their fundamental principle
    a unity resulting from the union of incomplete substances
    this latter is undoubtedly the view of st thomas of practically
    all the medieval scholastics and of most scholastics in modern
    times nor do we see any sufficient reason for receding from it
    or admitting the modern distinction between substance and nature
    and if it be objected that the view which admits the reality of
    incomplete substances and substantial change is as much a
    preconception as what we have called the atomic view of substance
    our answer is once more that since we have no intellectual
    intuition into the real constitution of the substances which
    constitute the universe since we can argue to this only by
    observing and reasoning from their activities on the principle
    operari requitur esse the evidence alone must decide which view
    of these substances is the correct one does the evidence afforded
    us by a scientific analysis of all the functions inorganic
    vegetative sentient and rational of an individual man forbid us
    to conclude that he is one complete substance resulting from the
    union of two incomplete substantial principles a spiritual soul
    and a material principle and at the same time compel us to infer
    that he is one complete nature resulting from the union of a
    plurality of principles supposed to be complete as substances and
    incomplete as natures we believe that it does not nor can we see
    that any really useful purpose is served by thus setting up a real
    distinction between substance and nature from the evidence to
    hand it is neither more nor less difficult to infer unity of
    substance than unity of nature in the individual the inference in
    question is an inference from facts in the phenomenal order in
    the domain of the senses to what must be actually there in the
    noumenal order in the domain of nature or substance a domain
    which cannot be reached by the senses but only by intellect nor
    will any imagination images which picture for us the physical
    fusion or coalescence of material things in the domain of the
    senses help us in the least to conceive in any positive way the
    mode in which incomplete natures or substances unite to form a
    complete nature or substance for these latter facts belong to the
    domain which the senses cannot reach at all and which intellect
    can reach only inferentially and not by direct insight
    hence we consider the view which regards real unity of nature as
    compatible with real and actual plurality of complete substances
    in the individual as improbable at the same time we do not
    believe that this view is a necessary corollary from the real
    identification of essence with existence in created things we
    have seen that even if accidents have their own existence in so
    far as they have their own essenceas they have if essence and
    existence be really identicalnevertheless the concrete substance
    as determined by its accidents can have a really unitary
    existence unum esse corresponding to and identical with its
    composite constitution 67 similarly if the existence of each
    incomplete substance is identical with its incomplete essence
    this is no obstacle to the complete substancewhich results from
    the union of two such incomplete substantial principleshaving one
    complete unitary existence identical with its composite essence
    hence it is useless to argue against the view that a plurality of
    actually distinct and complete substances can unite to form a
    complete nature which will be really one being on the ground
    that each complete substance has already its own existence and
    that things which have and preserve their own existence cannot
    form one being such an argument is inconclusive for although
    one being has of course only one existence it has not been
    proved that this one existence cannot result from the union of
    many incomplete existences especially if these existences be
    identical with the incomplete essences which are admittedly
    capable of uniting to form one complete essence
    it may however be reasonably urged against the opinion under
    criticism that since the complete substances are supposed to
    remain complete and unchanged in their state of combination it is
    difficult to see how this combination can be a real union and not
    merely an extrinsic juxtapositionone which remains in reality a
    merely accidental conjunction even though we may dignify it with
    the title of a natural union
    and finally it may be pointed out that in this view the operations
    of the individual have not really one ultimate intrinsic
    principle at all since behind the supposed unity of nature there
    is a more fundamental plurality of actually distinct substances
72 subsistence and personalitywe have already examined the relation
between the individual and the universal between first and second
substances in connexion with the doctrine of individuation 313 and we
then saw that whatever it be that individuates the universal nature it is
at all events not to be regarded as anything extrinsic and superadded to
this nature in the individual as anything really distinct from this
nature that for instance what makes platos human nature to be platos
is not anything really distinct from the human nature that is in plato we
have now to fix our attention on the nature as individualized we have to
consider the complete individual nature or substance itself in actually
existing individual things or persons
we must remember that scholastics are not agreed as to whether there is a
real distinction or only a virtual distinction between the actual
existence and the complete individual essence or substance or nature of
created individual beings 214 furthermore we have seen that
philosophers who study the metaphysics of the inorganic world and of the
lower forms of life are unable to say with certainty what is the
individual in these domains whether it is the chemical molecule or the
chemical atom or the electron whether it is the single living cell or the
living mass consisting of a plurality of such cells 31 but we have also
seen that as we ascend the scale of living things all difficulty in
designating the genuine individual disappears that a man a horse an oak
tree are undoubtedly individual beings
bearing these things in mind we have now to inquire into what has been
called the subsistence or personality of the complete individual
substance or nature that perfection which enables us formally to
designate the latter a subsisting thing285 or a person by
personality we mean the subsistence of a complete individual rational
nature we shall therefore inquire into the meaning of the generic term
subsistentia or suppositalitas subsistence in the abstract but
let us look at it first in the concrete
a complete individual nature or substance when it exists in the actual
order really distinct and separate in its own complete entity from every
other existing being exercising its powers and discharging its functions
of its own right and according to the laws of its own being is said to
subsist or to have the perfection of subsistence in this state it
not only exists in itself as every substance does it is not only
incommunicable to any other being as every individual is in
contradistinction with second or universal substances which are as
such indefinitely communicable to individuals but it is also a complete
whole incommunicable as a mere integral or essential part to some other
whole unlike the incomplete substantial constituents or integral parts
members or organs of say an individual organic body and finally it is
incommunicable in the sense that it is not capable of being assumed into
the subsisting unity of some other superior suppositum or person all
those characteristics we find in the individual subsisting thing or
person it exists in itself and is not communicable to another
substance as an accident because it is itself a substance it is not
communicable to individuals as a universal because it is itself an
individual it is not communicable as an integral or essential part to a
whole because it is itself a complete substance and nature286 finally
it is not communicable to and cannot be assumed into the unity of a
higher personality so as to subsist by virtue of the latters subsistence
because it has a perfection incompatible with such assumption viz its
own proper subsistence whereby it is already an actually subsisting thing
or person in its own right or sui juris so to speak
    the mention of this last sort of incommunicability would be
    superfluous and indeed unintelligible did we not know from
    divine revelation that the human nature of our divine lord and
    saviour jesus christ though it is a complete and most perfect
    individual nature is nevertheless not a person because it is
    assumed into the personality of the second person of the divine
    trinity and united hypostatically or personally with this divine
    person subsists by virtue of the divine subsistence of the
    latter
we see therefore what subsistence does for a complete individual nature
in the static order it makes this nature sui juris incommunicable
and entirely independent in the mode of its actual being leaving
untouched of course the essential dependence of the created subsisting
thing or person on the creator in the dynamic order the order of
activity and development subsistence makes the complete individual nature
not only the ultimate principle by which all the functions of the
individual are discharged but also the ultimate principle or agent
which exercises these functions while the nature as such is the
ultimate principium quo the nature as subsisting is the ultimate
principium quod in regard to all actions emanating from this nature
hence the scholastic aphorism actiones sunt suppositorum that is all
actions emanating from a complete individual nature are always ascribed
and attributed to the latter as subsisting to the subsisting thing or
person in regard to an individual human person for instance whether
his intellect thinks or his will resolves or his imagination pictures
things or his eyes see or his hand writes or his stomach digests or
his lungs breathe or his head aches it is the man the person
properly that discharges or suffers all these functions though by means
of different faculties organs and members and it is to him properly that
we ascribe all of them287
now the individual human person is neither his soul nor his body nor
even both conceived as two he is one being one complete substance or
nature composed partly of a spiritual principle or soul and partly of a
material principle which the soul informs and so constitutes a living
human body hence the human soul itself whether we consider it as united
to the material principle in the living human person or as disembodied
and separate from its connatural material principle is not a complete
substance is not capable of subsisting and having its human activities
referred ultimately to itself as the subsisting personal principle which
elicits these activities no doubt the disembodied soul has actual
existence but it has not the perfection of subsistence or
personality it is not a complete individual of the human species to
which it belongs and therefore it cannot be properly called a human
person a complete subsisting individual of the human species288
    furthermore even though an individual nature be complete as a
    nature endowed with all the substantial and specific perfections
    which constitute it a complete individual of the species to which
    it belongs nevertheless if it is assumed into the personality of
    another and higher nature and subsists in personal union with the
    latter and by virtue of the latters subsistence then that
    nature not having its own proper and connatural subsistence is
    not itself a person nor can the actions which are elicited by
    means of it be ascribed ultimately to it they must be ascribed to
    the person by whose subsistence it subsists and into whose
    personality it has been assumed if an individual human nature be
    thus hypostatically or personally assumed into and united with a
    higher divine personality and subsists only by this personality
    such a human nature will be really and truly an individual nature
    of the human species the actions elicited through it and
    performed by means of it will be really and truly human actions
    but it will not be a human person while its actions will be
    really and truly the actions of the divine person and will
    therefore be also really and truly divine they will be the
    actions of the godman divine and human theandric all this we
    know only from divine revelation concerning the hypostatic union
    of the human nature of christ with the person of the divine word
    nor could we know it otherwise but all this does not modify it
    only supplements and completes what the light of reason discloses
    to us regarding the subsistence or personality of any complete
    individual nature
we are now in a position to give nominal definitions of subsistence and
personality both in the abstract and in the concrete ie definitions
which will indicate to us what exactly it is that these terms denote289
and which will thus enable us to inquire into their connotation or in
other words to ask what is it precisely that constitutes subsistence or
personality
by subsistence subsistentia suppositalitas we mean that
perfection whereby a fully complete individual nature is rendered in every
way in its being and in its actions distinct from and incommunicable to
any and every other being so that it exists and acts sui juris
autonomously independently of every other being save the creator290
by a subsisting being in the concrete  suppositum
hypostasis we mean a being endowed with this perfection of
subsistence in other words a being that is a complete individual nature
existing and acting in every way distinct from and incommunicable to any
other being so that it exists and acts sui juris autonomously
personality is simply the subsistence of a complete individual nature
that is rational intelligent
a person is simply a subsisting nature that is rational
intelligent persona est suppositum rationale the definition given by
botius is classic persona est substantia individua rationalis
naturae the individual substance of a rational naturewhere the
term individual is understood to imply actually existing and
subsisting
the special name which has thus been traditionally applied to rational
or intelligent subsisting beings as distinct from animals plants and
material thingsthe term person persona a mask personus
cf gr  from  the face countenanceoriginally
meaning a rle or character in a drama came to be applied to the
subsisting human individual and to connote a certain dignity of the
latter as compared with the lower or nonrational beings of the universe
and in fact the ascription of its actions to the subsisting being is more
deeply grounded in the subsistence of rational intelligent beings who
as free agents can more properly direct and control these actions291
73 distinction between the individual nature and its subsistence what
constitutes personalityknowing now what we mean by the terms
subsistence suppositum person and personality we have next to
inquire in what precisely does subsistence consist what is it that
constitutes a complete individual nature a subsisting being or if the
nature be rational a person subsistence connotes over and above the
mode of existing in itself which characterizes all substance the notion
that the substance or nature is individual that it is complete that it
is in every way incommunicable that it is sui juris or autonomous in
its existence and activities these notions are all positive they imply
positive perfections even incommunicability is really a positive
perfection though the term is negative but is any one of the positive
perfections thus contained in the notion of subsistence a positive
something over and above and really distinct from the perfection
already implied in the concept of a complete individual nature as such
some of those philosophers who regard the distinction between essence and
existence in creatures as a real distinction identify the subsistence
of the complete individual nature with its actual existence thus
placing a real distinction between nature and subsistence or
personality292 apart from these however it is not likely that any
philosophers guided by the light of reason alone would ever have held
or even suspected that the subsistence of an actually existing individual
nature is a positive perfection really distinct from and superadded to
the latter for we never in our natural experience encounter an existing
individual substance or nature or agent that is not distinct
autonomous independent sui juris and incommunicable in its mode of
being and acting
    rigorously however this would only prove that subsistence is a
    perfection naturally inseparable from the complete individual
    nature conceivably it might still be really distinct from
    the latter but whether or not such real distinction could be
    suspected by the unaided light of reason working on natural
    experience at all events what we know from divine revelation
    concerning the hypostatic union of the human nature of our lord
    jesus christ with the person of the divine word enables us to
    realize that there can be in the actual order of things a
    complete individual nature which is not a subsisting being or
    person for the human nature of our lord is de facto such a
    natureand ab actu ad posse valet consecutio this information
    however is not decisive in determining the character of the
    distinction between the individual substance or nature and its
    subsistence
it may be that the complete individual nature is eo ipso and identically
a subsisting being or person that it is always independent
autonomous sui juris by the very fact that it is a complete individual
nature unless it is de facto assumed into the personality of a higher
nature so that in this intercommunication with the latter in the unity
of the latters personality it is not independent autonomous sui
juris but dependent subordinate and alterius juris in this
condition it loses nothing positive by the fact that it is not now a
person and has not its own subsistence nor does it gain any natural
perfection for it was ex hypothesi complete and perfect as a nature
but it gains something supernatural inasmuch as it now subsists in a
manner wholly undue to it293 according to this view therefore
subsistence would not be a perfection really distinct from the complete
individual nature it would be a mentally distinct aspect of the latter a
positive aspect however consisting in this natures completeness its
selfsufficing autonomous character and consequent
incommunicability294
    the principal difficulty against this view is a theological
    difficulty as formulated by urraburu295 it appears to involve
    an ambiguity in the expression substantial union it is briefly
    this if the subsistence proper to a complete individual nature
    adds no positive perfection to the latter so that the latter
    necessarily subsists and is a person unless it is actually assumed
    into a higher personality and by the very fact that it is not
    actually so assumed then the human nature of christ is as
    complete in every way and in every line of substantial perfection
    by virtue of its own proper entity when actually united with the
    divine person as it would be were it not so united or as the
    person of peter or paul or any other human person is but this
    implies that there are in christ two substances complete in every
    respect now between two such substances there cannot be a
    substantial union a union which would constitute one being
    unum per se ens hence the view in question would appear to be
    inadmissible
    but it is not proved that the union of two substances complete in
    every respect cannot result in the constitution of a being that
    is really and genuinely oneunum per se ensin the case in
    which the union is a personal union the hypostatic union of the
    human nature of christ with the divine person is primarily a
    personal union whereby the former nature subsists by and in the
    divine personality it has the effect of constituting the united
    terms one subsisting being and therefore has supereminently if
    not formally the effect of a substantial union nay it is a
    substantial union in the sense that it is a union of two
    substances not of a substance and accidents and also in the
    sense that it is not a mere accidental aggregation or artificial
    juxtaposition of substances resulting merely in the constitution
    of collective or artificial unity a unum per accidens but is
    it a substantial union in the sense that it is such a union of
    substances as results in one nature most certainly not for
    this was the heresy of the monophysites that in christ there is
    only one nature resulting from the union of the human nature with
    the divine if then with urraburu we mean by nature simply
    substance regarded as a principle of action 71 and if
    furthermore the hypostatic union does not result in one nature
    neither does it result in one substance nor can it be a
    substantial or natural union in this sense296 he does not
    say of course that the hypostatic union is a substantial union
    which results in one nature or even explicitly that it results
    in one substance but he says that the two substances are
    substantially conjoined substantialiter conjunguntur and he
    continues a substantial union is such a conjunction of two
    substantial realities that there results from it one substantial
    something which is truly and properly oneunio enim
    substantialis est talis duarum rerum substantialium conjunctio
    per quam resultat unum aliquid substantiale quod vere et proprie
    sit unum297and he concludes that there is something
    substantial wanting in the human nature of christ viz
    personality which of course is most abundantly supplied in the
    hypostatic union by the divine personreliquum est ut naturae
    humanae in christo aliquid desit substantiale nempe personalitas
    quod per unionem hypostaticam cumulatissime suppleatur a
    verbo298 now this aliquid substantiale cannot be aliquid
    naturale in the sense that it is something constitutive of the
    human substance or nature for the human substance or nature of
    christ is certainly complete and perfect as a substance or nature
    it must be some complement or mode that is naturally due to it
    but supernaturally supplied by the person of the divine word299
    this brings us to the view that subsistence is a something
    positive distinct in some real way and not merely in our
    concepts from the complete individual substance
according to the more common view of catholic philosophers and
theologians subsistence is some positive perfection really distinct from
the complete individual nature but the supporters of this general view
explain it in different ways we have already referred to the view of
certain thomists who identifying subsistence with the actual
existence of the complete substance or nature place a real distinction
between the existence and the substance or nature other thomists while
defending the latter distinction point out that actual existence confers
no real perfection but only actualizes the real they hold therefore
that subsistence is not existence but is rather a perfection of the real
essential or substantial order as distinct from the existential ordera
perfection presupposed by actual existence and whose proper function is
to unify all the substantial constituents and accidental determinations
of the individual substance or nature thus making it a really unitary
beingunum ens per seproximately capable of being actualized by the
simple existential act which latter is the ultimate actuality of the real
being esse est ultimus actus300
the concrete individual nature containing as it does a plurality of
really distinct principles substantial and accidental needs some
unifying principle to make these one incommunicable reality proximately
capable of receiving a corresponding unitary existential act without such
a principle they say each of the substantial and accidental principles
in the concrete individual nature would have its own existence so that
the result would be not really one being but a being really manifold
and only accidentally oneunum per accidens this principle is
subsistence
    the human nature of our divine lord has not its own connatural
    subsistence this is supplied by the subsistence of the divine
    person moreover since the human nature in question has not its
    own subsistence neither has it its own existence existence is
    the actuality of the subsisting being therefore there is in
    christ but one existence that of the divine person whereby also
    the human nature of christ exists301
of those who deny that the distinction between the existence and the
essence of any created nature is a real distinction some hold in the
present matter the scotist view that subsistence is not a positive
perfection really distinct from the complete individual nature others
however hold what we have ventured to regard as the more common view
that personality is something positive and really distinct from nature
but they explain what they conceive subsistence to be without any
reference to existence and without distinguishing between the essential
and the existential order of reality
the most common explanation seems to be that subsistence is a unifying
principle of the concrete individual nature as stated above thus
conceived it is not an absolute reality nor is the distinction between
it and the nature a major real distinction it is a substantial mode
68 naturally superadded to the substance and modally distinct from the
latter it so completes and determines the substance or nature that the
latter not only exists in itself but is also by virtue of this mode
incommunicable in every way and sui juris302 it gives to the
substance that ultimate determinateness which an accidental mode such as a
definite shape or location gives to the accident of quantity303
    this mode is absent supernaturally from the human nature of our
    divine lord this nature is therefore communicable and the
    personality of the divine word supernaturally supplies the
    function of this absent natural mode
it must be confessed that it is not easy to understand how this or any
other substantial mode can be really distinct from the substance it
modifies and in truth the distinction is not real in the full sense it
is not between thing and thing inter rem et rem all that is
claimed for it is that it is not merely mental that it is not merely an
ens rationis which the mind projects into the reality that it is a
positive perfection of the nature or substance a perfection which though
naturally inseparable from the latter is not absolutely inseparable and
which therefore is de facto supernaturally absent from the human
nature and replaced by the divine personality in the case of the
hypostatic union
it belongs moreover to the order of substance not to that of accidents
the substantial mode differs from the accidental mode or modal accident
in this that it gives to the substance some ultimate determining
perfection which appertains to the substance as such and whereby the
substance is completed in the order of existing in itself subsistence
is not an accident even though it supervenes on the complete nature for
it determines the substance of the latter not in relation to any line of
accidental activity as a power or faculty nor as something modifying it
accidentally but as a mode which ultimately determines and perfects it in
the order of substantial reality itself in the order of existing in
itself in such a full and perfect manner as to be sui juris and
incommunicable
    the main difficulty against this view is also theological if
    subsistence is a positive perfection it either belongs to the
    complete individual nature or it does not in the former case the
    humanity of christ assumed by the divine word was not a complete
    human nature in the latter case the individual human nature can
    exist without it and both consequences are equally inadmissable
    but it may be replied that granting the first member of the
    disjunctive the consequence inferred from it does not really
    follow subsistence belongs to the complete individual nature as
    an ultimate natural complement but when it is absent and supplied
    supernaturally by the divine personality the nature is still
    complete as a nature it is wanting in no absolute or entitative
    perfection but only in a modality which is supereminently
    supplied by the divine personality neither is the consequence
    from the second member of the disjunctive a valid inference for
    though personality as a mode does not belong to the essence of an
    individual human nature no such individual nature can exist
    without some personality either its own or another just as
    extension cannot exist without some shape though any particular
    shape is not essential to it
to sum up then the doctrine of the two preceding sections what are we
to understand by a person and by personality unquestionably our
conception of person and personality concrete and abstract is mainly
determined and very rightly so by an analysis of what constitutes the
actually existing individual of the human species whatever our concept
be it must certainly be realized and verified in all human individuals
these before all other beings must be included in the denotation of our
concept of person in fact for the philosopher guided by the natural
light of reason alone the term can have hardly any other connotation he
will no doubt ascribe personality as the highest mode of being he knows
of to the supreme being but he will here ascribe it only in an
analogical and supereminent way and only from divine revelation can he
know that this supreme being has not a single but a threefold personality
again his consideration of the nature of the human soul as an embodied
substance which is nevertheless spiritual and immortal will enable him to
affirm the possibility of purely spiritual created beings and these he
will of course conceive as persons but conceiving the human soul itself
as a constituent principle of the human individual he will not conceive
the soul itself as a person
the philosopher who understands the traditional aristotelian conceptions
of substance of individual substance substantia prima of incomplete
complete and composite substances of substance considered as nature or
principle of action of substance considered as hypostasis as the
actually existing individual being which is the ultimate logical subject
of all predications and the ultimate ontological subject of all real
determinations the philosopher who understands these concepts and who
admits them to be validly grounded in experience and to offer as far as
they go a correct interpretation of reality will have no difficulty in
making up his mind about what is requisite to constitute a person
wherever he finds an existing individual being of any species a being
which even if it is really composite is nevertheless really one such a
being he will pronounce to be a subsisting individual being he may not
be able in the inorganic world or among the lower forms of life to
distinguish for certain what is the real individual from what may be
perhaps only an accidental if natural colony or group of real
individuals as a test he will always seek for the manifestation of an
internal directive principle whereby all the vital functions of the
organized mass of matter in question are coordinated in such a manner as
to make for the preservation growth and development of the whole
throughout a definite life cycle from birth to death this formative and
directive principle is evidence of an individual unity of nature and
subsistence and such evidence is abundantly present in individuals of
all the higher species in botany and zoology the individual subsisting
being will therefore be a complete individual substance or nature
existing and acting in every way distinct from and incommunicable to any
other being so that it exists and acts sui juris autonomously
if such an individual nature is not merely corporeal but organic or
animate not merely animate but sentient and not merely sentient but
rational or intelligent ie constituted at least in part by a
spiritual substantial principle whereby the individual is intelligent
and free then that individual is a person every individual of the
human species is such and all that is essential to his complete
individual human nature enters into and constitutes his person in the
concrete not merely therefore his intellect and will not merely his
soul considered as mind ie as the basis and principle of his whole
conscious and subconscious psychic life or also as the principle of his
merely organic life or also as the actualizing principle of his corporeal
nature but no less also the corporeal principle itself of his composite
being the body itself with all its parts and members and organs all
these without exception belong equally to the human person all of them
without exception go to constitute the ego304 this which is the
aristotelian and scholastic view of the human person is in perfect accord
with the commonsense view of the matter as evidenced by the ordinary
usages of language we speak intelligibly no less than correctly when we
say that a mans body is part of his person as well as his soul or mind
and we make a no less accurate intelligible and necessary distinction
when we distinguish between all that which constitutes the human person
and that whereby we know ourselves and other human individuals to be
persons yet this distinction is not kept clearly in mind by many modern
philosophers who approaching the study of personality exclusively from
the side of what the individual consciousness testifies as to the unity
and continuity or otherwise of mental life in the individual are
scandalized at the assertion that the human body can have anything to do
with human personality
74 consciousness of the personal selfin order to form the concept of
person and to find that concept verified in the data of our experience
it is absolutely essential that we be endowed with the faculty of
intelligence the spiritual power of forming abstract concepts and
secondly that having formed the concept of person as a rational or
intelligent subsisting being we be capable by the exercise of reflex
consciousness to find in our own mental life the data from which we can
conclude that this concept of person is verified in each and every one of
ourselves it is because we are endowed with intelligence that we can form
all the abstract notionsof substance individual subsistence existence
etcwhich enter into and constitute our concept of person and it is
because we can by means of this faculty reflect on our own mental
operations and infer from them that each of us is a complete individual
rational nature subsisting independently and incommunicably that we can
know ourselves to be persons
how the human individual forms these concepts and finds them verified in
his own self how he gradually comes into conscious possession of the
knowledge of his own individual being as an ego self or person are
problems for psychology305 it will be sufficient here to point out that
there are grounds for distinguishing between the individuals implicit
subjective awareness of his subsistence or selfhoodan awareness which
accompanies all his conscious mental functions and which becomes more
explicit and definite as the power of introspection and reflex
consciousness developsand the abstract quasiobjective notion of his
own personality habitually possessed by every human being306
the individual human being immediately apprehends his own existence and
his abiding unity or sameness throughout incessantly changing states in
the temporal series of his conscious activities but his knowledge of the
nature of his own being can be the result only of a long and carefully
conducted analysis of his own activities and of inferences based on the
character of these activities the former or implicit knowledge of the
self in the concrete is direct and intuitive the individual ego
apprehends itself in its states this knowledge comes mainly from
within and is subject to gradual development father maher thus describes
how the child comes gradually into possession of it
    as thoughts of pleasures and pains repeated in the past and
    expected in the future grow more distinct the dissimilarity
    between these and the permanent abiding self comes to be more
    fully realized passing emotions of fear anger vanity pride or
    sympathy accentuate the difference but most probably it is the
    dawning sense of power to resist and overcome rising impulse and
    the dim nascent consciousness of responsibility which lead up to
    the final revelation until at last in some reflective act of
    memory or choice or in some vague effort to understand the
    oftheard i the great truth is manifested to him the child
    enters as it were into possession of his personality and knows
    himself as a selfconscious being the ego does not create
    but discovers itself in jouffroys felicitous phrase it
    breaks its shell and finds that it is a personal agent with an
    existence and individuality of its own standing henceforward
    alone in opposition to the universe307
after this stage is reached the human individual easily distinguishes
between the self as the cause or subject of the states and the
states as modifications of the self this distinction is implicit in the
concomitant awareness of self which accompanies all exercise of direct
cognitive consciousness it is explicit in all deliberate acts of reflex
introspective selfconsciousness the data from which we form the abstract
concepts of substance nature individual person self etc and from
which we arrive by reasoning at a philosophical knowledge of the nature
and personality of the human individual are furnished mainly by
introspection but also in part by external observation of the universe
around us
concomitantly however with the process by which we become implicitly but
immediately aware of the ego or self as an abiding selfidentical person
in and through our own mental activity we gradually form a
quasiobjective and historical view of our own personality as one of a
number of similar personalities around us in the universe this view says
father maher
    gathers into itself the history of my past lifethe actions of my
    childhood boyhood youth and later years interwoven with them
    all is the image of my bodily organism and clustering around are
    a fringe of recollections of my dispositions habits and
    character of my hopes and regrets of my resolutions and
    failures along with a dim consciousness of my position in the
    minds of other selves
    under the form of a representation of this composite art bound
    together by the thread of memory each of us ordinarily conceives
    his complete abiding personality this idea is necessarily
    undergoing constant modification and it is in comparing the
    present form of the representation with the past whilst adverting
    to considerable alterations in my character bodily appearance
    and the like that i sometimes say i am completely changed i
    am quite another person though i am of course convinced that
    it is the same i who am changed in accidental qualities it is
    because this complex notion of my personality is an abstraction
    from my remembered experiences  that a perversion of imagination
    and a rupture of memory can sometimes induce the socalled
    illusions or alterations of personality308
when we remember that this objective conception of the self is so
dependent on the function of memory and that the normal exercise of this
faculty is in turn so dependent on the normal functioning of the brain and
the nervous system309 we can hazard an intelligible explanation of the
abnormal facts recorded by most modern psychologists concerning hypnotism
somnambulism and double or multiple consciousness310 father maher
ascribing these phenomena partly to dislocations of memory partly to
unusual groupings of mental states according to the laws of mental
associationgroupings that arise from peculiar physiological connexions
between the various neural functionings of the brain centresand partly
to semiconscious or reflex nerve processes emphasizes an important fact
that is sometimes lost sight of the fact that some section at least of
the individuals conscious mental life is common to and present
throughout the two or more states or conditions between which any
such abnormal individual is found to alternate this consideration is
itself sufficient to disprove the theoryto which we shall presently
referthat there is or may be in the individual human being a double or
even a multiple human personality
75 false theories of personalityit is plain that conscious mental
activity cannot constitute human personality or subconscious mental
activity either for all activity is of the accidental mode of being is
an accident whereas a person must be a substance of course it is the
selfconscious cognitive activity of the human individual that reveals
to the latter his own self as a person it is the exercise of reflex
consciousness combined with memory that gives us the feeling of personal
identity with ourselves throughout the changing events of our mental and
bodily life furthermore this selfconsciousness has its root in the
rational nature of the human individual and rationality of nature is
the differentiating principle which makes the subsisting individual a
person as distinct from a subsisting thing but then it is not the
feeling of personal identity that constitutes the person actual
consciousness is neither the essence nor the source nor even the index
of personality for it is only an activity and an activity which reveals
immediately not the person as such but the nature as rational311
nor does the rational substantial principle of a composite nature
constitute the latter a person but only the subsistence of the complete
composite individual nature itself
these considerations are sufficiently obvious they presuppose however
the truth of the traditional doctrine already explained in regard to the
existence nature and cognoscibility of substance philosophers who have
misunderstood and rejected and lost this traditional doctrine of substance
have propounded many varieties of unsatisfactory and inconsistent theories
in regard to what constitutes person and personality the main feature
of all such theories is their identification of personality with the
habitual consciousness of self or habitual feeling of personal identity
a feeling which however must be admitted to include memory in some
form while the function of memory in any shape or form cannot be
satisfactorily explained on any theory of the human ego which denies
that there is a human substance persisting permanently as a unifying
principle of successive mental states 634
so far as english philosophy is concerned such theories appear to have had
their origin in lockes teaching on person and personal identity
discussing the notions of identity and diversity312 he distinguishes
between the identity of an individual substance with itself in its
duration throughout time and what he terms personal identity while by
identity in general he means not abstract identity but the concrete
permanence of a thing throughout time 34 on this we have to call
attention to the fact that just as duration is not essential to the
constitution of a substance so neither is it essential to the
constitution of a complete subsisting individual substance or person 64
though it is of course an essential condition for all human apprehension
whether of substance or of person locke was wrong therefore in
confounding what reveals to us the abiding permanence identity or
sameness of a subsisting thing or person whether the self or any other
subsisting thing or person throughout its duration in time with what
constitutes the subsisting thing or person
furthermore his distinction between substantial identity ie the
sameness of an individual substance with itself throughout time and
personal identity or sameness was also an error for as long as there is
substantial unity continuity or identity of the subsisting individual
substance so long is there unity continuity or identity of its
subsistence or of its personality if it be a rational substance the
subsistence of a complete individual inorganic substance is changed as
soon as the individual undergoes substantial change we have them no
longer the same subsisting individual being so too the subsistence of
the organic individual is changed as soon as the latter undergoes
substantial change by the dissolution of life by the separation of its
formative and vital substantial principle from its material substantial
principle after such dissolution we have no longer the same subsisting
plant or animal and finally the subsistence of an individual man is
changed or interrupted or ceases by death which separates his soul his
vital principle from his body we say moreover that in the latter case
the human person ceases to exist when the identity or permanence of his
subsisting substance or nature terminates at death for personal
identity we hold to be the identity of the complete subsisting substance
or nature with itself but locke who practically agrees with what we have
said regarding the abiding identity of the subsisting individual being
with itselfwhether this individual be an inorganic individual a plant a
brute beast or a man313distinguishes at this point between identity of
the subsisting individual substance and personal identity
of identity in general he says that to conceive and judge of it aright
we must consider what idea the word it is applied to stands for it being
one thing to be the same substance another the same man and a third the
same person if person man and substance are three names standing for
three different ideas314 and struggling to dissociate person from
substance he continues thus
    to find wherein personal identity consists we must consider what
    person stands for which i think is a thinking intelligent
    being that has reason and reflection and can consider itself as
    itself the same thinking thing in different times and places
    which it does only by that consciousness which is inseparable from
    thinking and as it seems to me essential to it when we see
    hear smell taste feel meditate or will any thing we know
    that we do so thus it is always as to our present sensations and
    perceptions and by this every one is to himself what he calls
    self it not being considered in this case whether the same self
    be continued in the same or divers substances for since
    consciousness always accompanies thinking and it is that which
    makes every one to be what he calls self and thereby
    distinguishes himself from all other thinking things in this
    alone consists personal identity ie the sameness of a
    rational being and as far as this consciousness can be extended
    backwards to any past action or thought so far reaches the
    identity of that person it is the same self now it was then and
    it is by the same self with this present one that now reflects on
    it that that action was done315
the definition of person in this passage as a thinking intelligent
being etc is not far removed from our own definition but surely
conscious thought is not that which makes every one to be what he calls
self seeing that conscious thought is only an activity or function
of the rational being it is conscious thought of course including
memory that reveals the rational being to himself as a self and as
the same or identical self throughout time but unless the rational
being or the thinking intelligent being that has reason and
reflection etcwhich is lockes own definition of personwere there
all the time identical with itself exercising those distinct and
successive acts of consciousness and memory and unifying them how could
these acts even reveal the person or his personal identity to
himself not to speak of their constituting personality or personal
identity it is perfectly plain that these acts presuppose the person
the thinking intelligent being or as we have expressed it the
subsisting rational individual nature already constituted and it is
equally plain that the personal identity which they reveal is
constituted by and consists simply in the duration or continued
existence of this same subsisting individual rational nature nor could
these acts reveal any identity personal or otherwise unless they were
the acts of one and the same actually subsisting existing and persisting
substance
yet locke thinks he can divorce personal identity from identity of
substance and account for the former independently of the latter in face
of the obvious difficulty that actual consciousness is not continuous but
intermittent he tries to maintain that the consciousness which links
together present states with remembered states is sufficient to constitute
personal identity even although there may have intervened between the
present and the past states a complete change of substance so that it is
really a different substance which experiences the present states from
that which experienced the past states the question
    whether we are the same thinking thing ie the same substance
    or no  concerns not personal identity at all the question
    being what makes the same person and not whether it be the same
    identical substance which always thinks in the same person
    different substances by the same consciousness where they do
    partake in it being united into one person as well as different
    bodies by the same life are united into one animal whose identity
    is preserved in that change of substances by the unity of one
    continued life  for animal identity is preserved in identity
    of life and not of substance316
here the contention is that we can have the same person and yet not
necessarily the same identical substance because consciousness may
give a personal unity to distinct and successive substances in the
individual man just as animal life gives an analogous unity to distinct
and successive substances in the individual animal this is very
superficial for it only substitutes for the problem of human personality
the similar problem of explaining the unity and sameness of subsistence in
the individual living thing a problem which involves the fact of memory
in animals for scholastic philosophers unity of life in the living thing
involving the fact of memory in animals is explained by the perfectly
intelligible and willgrounded teaching that there is in each individual
living thing a formative and vital principle which is substantial a
forma substantialis which unites in the abiding selfidentical unity
of a complete individual composite substance the material principle of
the corporeal substances which thus go in the incessant process of
substantial change known as metabolism to form partially and to support
the substantial continuity of the living individual while the latter is
thus in constant process of material or partial substantial change it
remains as long as it lives the same complete individual substance and
this in virtue of the abiding substantial formative and vital principle
which actuates and animates it the abiding permanence or selfidentity of
the subsisting individual substance which feels or thinks and
remembers is an intelligible and indeed the only intelligible ground
and explanation of memory and of our consciousness of personal identity
but if we leave out of account this abiding continuity and selfidentity
of the subsisting individual substance or nature which is the subject
cause and agent of these acts of memory and consciousness how can these
latter in and by themselves possibly form or even indeed reveal to us
our personal identity locke felt this difficulty and he tried in vain to
meet it in vain for it is insuperable he merely suggests that the same
consciousness  can be transferred from one thinking substance to
another in which case it will be possible that two thinking substances
may make successively one person317 this is practically his last
word on the questionand it is worthy of note for it virtually
substantializes consciousness it makes consciousness which is really
only an act or a series of acts a something substantial and subsisting
we have seen already how modern phenomenists once they reject the notion
of substance as invalid or superfluous must by that very fact
equivalently substantialize accidents 61 for substance being a
necessary category of human thought as exercised on reality cannot really
be dispensed with and we see in the present context an illustration of
this fact the abiding selfidentity of the human person cannot be
explained otherwise than by the abiding selfidentical subsistence of the
individual human substance
if personal identity were constituted and determined by consciousness by
the series of conscious states connected and unified by memory then it
would appear that the human being in infancy in sleep in
unconsciousness or in a state of insanity is not a human person
philosophers who have not the hardihood to deny human personality to the
individual of the human species in these states and who on the other hand
will not recognize the possession of a rational nature or substance by
the subsisting individual as the ground of the latters personality and
personal identity have recourse to the hypothesis of a subconscious
or subliminal consciousness in the individual as a substitute if
by this they merely meant an abiding substantial rational principle of
all mental activities even of those which may be semiconscious or
subconscious they would be merely calling by another name what we call
the rational nature of man and the fact that they refer to this
principle as the subconscious self or ego shows how insistent is the
rational need for rooting personality and personal identity in something
which is a substance but they do not and will not conceive it as a
substance whereas if it is not this if it is only a process or a
function or a series or stream of processes or functions it can no
more constitute or explain or even reveal personal identity than a
series or stream of conscious states can318
unable as he was to explain how the same consciousness could persist
throughout a succession of really and adequately distinct substances
except by virtually substantializing consciousness locke nevertheless
persisted in holding that consciousness and consciousness alone including
memory which however is inexplicable on any other theory than that of a
subsisting and persisting substance or nature which remembers
constitutes personality and personal identity we have dwelt upon his
teaching mainly because all modern phenomenists try to explain personality
on the same principlesie independently of the doctrine of substance
    as a corollary from his doctrine he inferred that if a man
    completely and irrevocably loses consciousness or rather memory
    of his past life though he remains the same man he is no longer
    the same person if it be possible for the same man to have
    distinct incommunicable consciousness at different times it is
    past doubt the same man would at different times make different
    persons319 and he goes on in this sense to give a literal
    interpretation to the modes of speech we have referred to
    above320 he likewise admitted that two or more persons
    ie consciousnesses can be linked with the same individual
    human being or the same individual human soul alternately
    appearing and disappearing giving place successively to one
    another when any one of these personalities or consciousnesses
    ceases to be actual it must in lockes view cease to be in any
    sense real so that there could not be two or more personalities
    at the same time in the same individual human being modern
    psychologists however of the phenomenist school convinced that
    subconscious mental activities are not only possible but that
    the fact of such activities is well established by a variety of
    experiences have extended lockes conception of personality as
    actual consciousness to embrace groups of mental activities which
    may emerge only intermittently above the threshold of
    consciousness hence they explain the abnormal cases of double or
    multiple consciousness already referred to as being
    manifestations of really distinct personalities in one and the
    same human individual in normal human beings there is they say
    only one normally conscious personality the subconscious
    mental activities of such an individual they bulk together as
    forming this individuals subliminal or subconscious ego
    or self presumably a distinct personality from the conscious
    one in the abnormal cases of doubleconsciousness the
    subliminal self struggles for mastery over the conscious self and
    is for a time successful the two personalities thus for a time
    changing places as it were in the rarer or more abnormal cases of
    treble or multiple consciousness there are presumably three or
    more personalities engaged in the struggle each coming to the
    surface in turn and submerging the others
    it is not the fancifulness of this theory that one might object to
    so much as its utter inadequacy to explain the facts nay its
    utter unintelligibility on the principles of those who propound
    it for we must not lose sight of the fact that it is propounded
    by philosophers who purport to explain mental life and human
    personality without recourse to a substantial soul to any
    substantial basis of mental life or indeed to the concept of
    substance at all by philosophers who will talk of a mental
    process without admitting mind or soul as a substance or
    subject of that process of a series or stream of mental
    functions or activities without allowing any agent that would
    exercise those functions or any substantial abiding principle
    that would unify the series or stream and know it as such
    philosophers who regard the ego self or person as
    nothing other than the group or series or stream of mental
    states and not as anything of which these are the states and
    finally who speak of these groups of functions or activities as
    personalitieswhich they describe as struggling with one
    anotherapparently oblivious of the fact that by using such
    language they are in their thought at least transforming these
    activities into agents these states into subjects of
    states in a word these accidents into substances or else
    they are making their language and their thought alike
    unintelligible321
    of course those numerous modern philosophers who like james try
    to find a place for all the experiential facts unencumbered by
    any hypothesis like that of an individual substantial soul
    presumably save that of passing states of mind ibid p
    480 do not really leave these states suspended in midair as
    it were the imperative need for admitting the reality of
    substance always ultimately asserts itself as when james
    recognizes the necessity of admitting something more than the
    bare fact of coexistence of a passing thought with a passing
    brainstate principles of psychology i p 346apud maher
    ibid p 483 only his speculation as to what constitutes this
    something more which lies behind our mental states ibid
    p 485 is not particularly convincing for my own part he
    says i confess that the moment i become metaphysical and try to
    define the more i find the notion of some sort of an anima
    mundi thinking in all of us to be a more promising hypothesis in
    spite of all its difficulties than that of a lot of absolutely
    individual souls ibid p 346apud maher ibid this
    restatement of the medieval pantheistic theory known as averrosm
    monopsychism or the theory of the intellectus separatus cf
    de wulf history of medieval philosophy pp 381 sqq is a
    somewhat disappointing contribution to metaphysics from the most
    brilliant of our modern psychologists the difficulties of this
    more promising hypothesis had discredited it a rather long time
    before professor james resurrected it cf criticismsapud
    maher ibid
chapter x some accidentmodes of being quality
76 ontology and the accidentmodes of beingunder the ultimate category
or genus supremum of substance experience reveals to us two broadly
distinct subclasses corporeal substances bodies or material things
and spiritual substances or spirits of these latter we have direct
experience only of one class viz embodied spirits or human souls
the investigation of the nature of these belongs to psychology and from
the data of that science we may infer by the light of reason the
possibility of another class of spirits viz pure spirits beings
of whose actual existence we know from divine revelation the existence of
a supreme being whom we must conceive analogically as substance and
spirit is demonstrated by the light of reason in natural theology the
investigation of the nature of corporeal substances belongs properly to
cosmology hence in the present treatise we have no further direct
concern with the substancemode of reality322 but only with its
accidentmodes and not with all of these
not with all of them for those which belong properly to spiritual
substances or properly to corporeal substances call for special
treatment in psychology and cosmology respectively in the main only such
species of accidents as are common to matter and spirit alike will form
the subject of the remaining portion of the present volume only the
broader aspects of such categories as quality quantity and
causalityaspects which have a more direct bearing on the theory of being
and the theory of knowledge in generalcall for treatment in general
metaphysics a more detailed treatment must be sought in other departments
of philosophy
77 nature of the accident called qualityin the widest sense of the
term quality is synonymous with logical attribute in this sense
whatever can be predicated of a subject whatever logically determines a
subject in any way for our thought is a quality or attribute of that
subject in a sense almost equally wide the term is used to designate any
real determination whether substantial or accidental of a subject in
this sense the differential element or differentia specifica
determines the generic element or genus of a substance it tells us what
kind or species the substance is eg what kind of animal a man is
viz rational what kind of living thing an animal is viz sentient
what kind of body or corporeal thing a plant is viz living and hence
scholastics have said of the predicable differentia specifica that it
is predicated adjectivally or as a quality to tell us in what the
thing consists or what is its nature differentia specifica praedicatur
in quale quid it gives us the determining principle of the specific
nature or again quality is used synonymously with any accidental
determination of a substance in this sense magnitude location action
etc though they determine a subject in different accidental ways
nevertheless are all indiscriminately said to qualify it in the sense of
determining it somehow or other and are therefore called qualities in
the wide sense of accidents hence again the scholastics have said
that inasmuch as all accidents determine or qualify their subjects they
are predicated of these qualitatively and may be called in a wide sense
qualifications or qualities omnia genera accidentium qualificant
substantiam et praedicantur in quale
it is in this wide sense that we use the term when we say that the
specific nature or kind of a thing is revealed by its qualities
for the nature of a thing is revealed by all its accidents and when we
infer the nature of a thing from its activities in accordance with the
maxim qualis est operatio talis est natura we must take the term
operatio or activity to include the operation of the thing on our
cognitive faculties the states of cognitive consciousness thus aroused in
us and all the other accidents thus revealed to us in the thing by its
knowledgeeliciting action on our minds
but the term quality has been traditionally restricted after aristotle
to designate properly one particular category of accidents distinct from
the others and from substance
a definition proper of any genus supremum is of course out of the
question but it is not easy to give even a description which will convey
an accurate notion of the special category of quality and mark it off
from the other accidentcategories if we say with aristotle that quality
is that whereby we are enabled to describe what sort  quale
anything is323eg that it is white by whiteness strong by
strength etcwe are only illustrating the abstract by the concrete but
even this serves the purpose of helping us to realize what quality in
general means for we are more familiar with the concrete than with the
abstract and we can see a broad distinction between the question what
sort is that thing qualis est ista res quality and the question
how large is that thing quanta est ista res quantity or
where is that thing place or what is it doing what is
happening to it actio et passio or what does it resemble
relation etc this will help us to realize that there are accidental
modes of being which affect substances in a different way from all the
extrinsic denominations of the latter 60 and also in a different way
from quantity relation and causality and these modes of being whereby
the substance is of such a sort or in such a condition we call
qualities and if we inquire what special kind of determination of the
substance is common to qualities and marks these off from the other
accidents we shall find it to consist in this that quality is an
accidental mode of being which so affects the substance that it disposes
the latter well or ill in regard to the perfections natural to this
particular kind of substance it alters the latter accidentally by
increasing or diminishing its natural perfection we have seen that no
created substance has all the perfection natural to its kind tota simul
or ab initio 46 that it fulfils its rle in existence by development
by tending towards its full or final perfection the accidental realities
which supervene on its essence and thus alter its perfection within
the limits of its kind or species are what we call qualities they
diversify the substance accidentally in its perfection in its concrete
mode of existing and behaving by their appearance and disappearance they
do not change the essential perfection of the substance 46 they do
not effect a substantial change but they change its intermediate
accidental perfection and this qualitative change is technically known
and described as alteration324 11
hence we find quality described by st thomas as the sort of accident
which modifies or disposes the substance in itself accidens
modificativum sen dispositivum substantiaein seipsa and by albertus
magnus somewhat more explicitly as the sort of accident which completes
and perfects substance in its existence and activity accidens complens
ac perficiens substantiam tarn in existendo quam in operando325 this
notion will be conveyed with sufficient clearness if we describe quality
as that absolute accident which determines a substance after the manner
of an accidental differentia affecting the essential perfection of
the substance in regard to its existence or to its activity
hence 1 the pure actuality of the infinitely perfect being cannot admit
qualities inasmuch as quality implies only a relative and limited
perfection 2 the qualities of a corporeal substance are grounded in the
formative principle which gives that substance its specific nature and
is the principle of its tendency and development towards its final
perfection whereas its quantity is grounded in its determinable or
material principle 3 the essential differentiating principles of
substancesbeing known to us not intuitively but only abstractively and
discursively ie by inference from the behaviour of these substances
from the effects of their activitiesare often designated not by what
constitutes them intrinsically but by the accidental perfections or
qualities which are our only key to a knowledge of them for instance
we differentiate the nature of man from that of the brute beast by
describing the former as rational a term which really designates not
the essence or nature itself but one of its fundamental qualities viz
the faculty of reason
78 immediate subclasses of quality as genus supremumon account of
the enormous variety of qualities which characterize the data of our
experience the problem of classifying qualities is not a simple one its
details belong to the special sciences and to the other departments of
philosophy here we must confine ourselves to an attempt at indicating the
immediate subclasses of the genus supremum and in this context it will
not be out of place to call attention to a remarkable and in our view
quite erroneous trend of modern thought it accompanied the advent of
what is known as atomism or the mechanical conception of the universe
a conception much in vogue about half a century ago but against which
there are already abundant evidences of a strong reaction we refer to the
inclination of scientists and philosophers to eliminate quality altogether
as an ultimately distinct category of human experience by reducing all
qualities to quantity local relations and mechanical or spatial
motions of matter cf 11 in this theory all the sensible qualities
of the material universe would be really and objectively nothing more than
locations and motions of the ultimate constituents of perceptible matter
all the chemical physical and mechanical energies or forces of external
nature would be purely quantitative dispositions or configurations of
matter in motion realities that could be exhaustively known by
mathematical analysis and measurement and when it was found that
qualitative concepts stubbornly resisted all attempts at elimination or
reduction to quantitative concepts even in the investigation of the
material universe or external nature scientists and philosophers of
external nature thought to get rid of them by locating them exclusively in
the human mind and thus pushing them over on psychologists and
philosophers of the mind for further and final exorcism for a time
extreme materialists less wise than daring endeavoured to reduce even
mind and all its conscious states and processes to a mere subjective
aspect of what looked at objectively would be merely matter in
motion326 it can be shown in cosmology psychology and epistemology
that all such attempts to analyse qualities into something other than
qualities are utterly unsatisfactory and unsuccessful and we may see
even from an enumeration of some of the main classes of qualities that
such attempts were foredoomed to failure
scholastic philosophy has generally adopted aristotles division of
qualities into four great groups327 1    habitus vel
dispositio 2     potentia naturalis vel
impotentia 3     potentiae passivae et
passiones 4    forma vel figura st thomas offers the
following ground for this classification since quality he says328 is
an accidental determination of the substance itself ie of the
perfection of its concrete existence and activity and since we may
distinguish four aspects of the substance its nature itself as
perfectible its intrinsic principles of acting and receiving action
principles springing from the formative specific constituent of its
nature its receptivity of change effected by such action a receptivity
grounded in the determinable or material principle of its nature and
finally its quantity if it be a corporeal substancewe can likewise
distinguish between 1 acquired habits or dispositions such as health
knowledge virtue vice etc which immediately determine the perfection
of the substance disposing it well or ill in relation to its last end
2 intrinsic natural forces faculties powers of action
aptitudes capacities such as intellect will imagination instinct
organic vital forces physical chemical mechanical energies 3 states
resulting in a corporeal being from the action of its milieu upon it
the passions and emotions of sentient living things such as sensations
of pleasure pain anger etc the sensible qualities of matter such
as colour taste smell temperature feel or texture etc and finally
4 the quality of form or shape which is a mere determination of the
quantity of a corporeal substance
this classification is not indeed perfect for the same individual quality
can be placed in different classes when looked at from different
standpoints heat for instance may be regarded as a natural operative
power of a substance in a state of combustion or as a sensible quality
produced in that substance by the operation of other agencies but it has
the merit of being an exhaustive classification and philosophers have not
succeeded in improving on it
qualities of the third and fourth class do not call for special treatment
in the third class aristotles distinction between  
qualitates passibiles and  passiones is based upon the
relatively permanent or transient character of the quality in question
the transient quality such as the blush produced by shame or the pallor
produced by fear would be a passio329 whereas the more permanent
quality such as the natural colour of the countenance would be a
passibilis qualitas the passions or sensible changes which result
from certain conscious states and affect the organism of the sentient
living being are included in this class as passiones while the visible
manifestations of more permanent mental derangement or insanity would be
included in it as passibiles qualitates we may perhaps get a fairly
clear and comprehensive notion of all that is contained in this class as
sensible qualities by realizing that these embrace whatever is the
immediate cause or the immediate result of the sense modification
involved in any act or process of sense consciousness such sensible
qualities therefore belong in part to the objects which provoke sense
perception and in part to the sentient subject which elicits the
conscious act one of the most important problems in the theory of
knowledge and one which ramifies into cosmology and psychology is that
of determining the precise significance of these sensible qualitiesand
especially in determining whether they are qualities of an extramental
reality or merely states of the individual mind or consciousness itself
form or figure which constitutes the fourth class of quality is a
mode of the quantity of a body being merely the particular surface
termination of its extension or volume considered as a mode of abstract
or mathematical quantity it belongs to the domain of mathematics
considered in the concrete body it is the physical sensible form shape
or figure of the latter and here it may be either natural or artificial
according as it results from the unimpeded action of natural forces or
from these forces as manipulated and directed by intelligent agents it is
worthy of special note that while extension or volume is indicative of the
material principle of corporeal substances the figure or shape
naturally assumed by this volume is determined by their formative
principle and is thus indicative of their specific nature this is
already noticeable in the inorganic world where many of the chemically
different substances assume each its own distinctive crystalline form but
it is particularly in the domains of botany and zoology that the natural
external form of the living individual organism is recognized as one of
the most important grounds of its classification and one of the surest
tests of its specific nature330
79 habits and dispositionsevery created being is subject to change
capable of development or retrogression endowed with a natural tendency
towards some end which it can reach by a natural process of activity and
which constitutes for it when attained its full and final perfection
66 through this process of change it acquires accidental modes of being
which help it or hinder it dispose it or indispose it in the exercise of
its natural activities and therefore also in the concrete perfection of
its nature as tending towards its natural end such an accidental mode of
being is acquired by a series of transient actions and experiences
actiones et passiones after these have passed away it remains and not
merely as a state or condition resulting from the changes wrought in the
subject by these experiences but as a disposition towards easier
repetition of such experiences moreover it may be not a mere transient
disposition but something stable and permanent not easily removed or
annulled a dispositio difficile mobilis and just as it is essentially
indicative of past actions whereby it was acquired so too the very
raison dtre of its actuality is to dispose its subject for further and
future changes for operations and effects which are not yet actual but
only potential in this subject such an accidental mode of being is what
aristotle called  and the scholastics habitus with aristotle they
define habit as a more or less stable disposition whereby a subject is
well or ill disposed in itself or in relation to other things habitus
dicitur dispositio difficile mobilis secundum quam bene vel male
disponitur subjectum aut secundum se aut in ordine ad aliud331
the difference between a habit  and a simple disposition
 is that the former is by nature a more or less stable quality
while the latter is unstable and transient moreover the facilities
acquired by repeated action of the organs or members of men or animals
and the particular set acquired by certain tools or instruments from
continued use are more properly called dispositions than habits they
are not habits in the strict sense though they are often called habits in
the ordinary and looser usage of common speech a little reflection will
show that the only proper subjects of natural habits in the strict sense
are the spiritual faculties of an intelligent and free agent
since all natural habits are acquired by the past activities and dispose
for the future activities of a being not absolutely perfect but partly
potential and partly actual and subject to change it follows that only
finite beings can have habits but furthermore beings that are not free
that have not control or dominion of their own actions that have not
freedom of choice are determined by their nature by a necessary law of
their activity to elicit the actions which they do actually elicit such
beings are by their nature determinata ad unumn they are confined
necessarily to the particular lines of action whereby they fulfil their
rle in the actual order of things as aristotle remarks you may throw
the same stone repeatedly in the same direction and with the same
velocity it will never acquire a habit of moving in that direction with
that velocity332 the same is true of plants and animals for a habit in
the strict sense implies not merely a certain mutability in its subject
it implies and consists in a stable modification of some power or
faculty which can have its activities directed indifferently in one or
other of a variety of channels or lines the power or faculty which is
the proper subject of a habit must be a potentia dirigibilis vel
determinabilis ad diversa hence merely material powers of actionsuch as
the mechanical physical and chemical forces of inorganic nature or the
organic powers of living bodies whether vegetative or merely
sentientsince they are all of themselves of their nature
determined to certain lines of action and to these onlysuch powers
cannot become the subjects of habits of stable dispositions towards one
line of action rather than another the powers of material nature says
st thomas do not elicit their operations by means of habits for they
are of themselves already adequately determined to their particular
lines of action333
only the spiritual faculties of free agents are then the proper seat of
real habits only of free agents can we say strictly that habit is second
nature only these can direct the operations of their intellect and will
and through these latter the operations of their sense faculties both
cognitive and appetitive in a way conducive to their last end or in a way
that deviates therefrom by attaching their intellects to truth or to
error their wills to virtue or to vice and thus forming in these
faculties stable dispositions or habits334
is there any sense then in which we can speak of the sentient cognitive
and appetitive and executive powers of man as the seat of habits the
activities of those faculties are under the control of intellect and will
the acts elicited by the former are commanded by the latter they are
acts that issue primarily from the latter faculties and hence the
dispositions that result from repetition of these acts and give a facility
for further repetition of themacts of talking walking singing playing
musical instruments exercising any handicraftare partly though only
secondarily dispositions formed in these sentient faculties the
trained eye the trained ear the discriminating sense of taste the
alert sense of touch in the deaf dumb or blind or in these executive
powers whereby the latter more promptly and easily obey the command of
the higher faculties but they are primarily and principally habits of
these higher faculties themselves rendering the latter permanently apt
to command and utilize the subordinate powers in the repetition of such
acts335
unquestionably the bodily organs acquire by exercise a definite set
which facilitates their further exercise but this set is not something
that they can use themselves nor is it something that removes or lessens
a natural indeterminateness or indifference of these powers for they are
not indifferent they must act at any instant in the one way which
their concrete nature in all its surroundings actually demands they
themselves are only instruments of the higher faculties these alone have
freedom of choice between lines of action it is only the stable
modifications which these acquire which they themselves can use and
which dispose them by lessening their indeterminateness that are
properly called habits there are therefore in the organic faculties of
man dispositions which give facility of action there are moreover
organic dispositions which dispose the organism not for action but for
its union with the formative principle or soul habituales
dispositiones materiae ad formam336 aristotle gives as instances
bodily health or beauty337 but these dispositiones materiales ad
formam he does not call habits any more than the organic
dispositiones ad operationem just referred to and for this reason that
although all these dispositions have a certain degree of stability in the
organisma stability which they derive moreover from the soul which is
the formative principle that secures the continuity and individual
identity of the organismyet they are not of themselves of their own
nature stable whereas the acquired dispositions of the spiritual
faculties intellect and will rooted as they are in a subject that is
spiritual and substantially immutable are of their own nature stable and
permanent nor are all dispositions of these latter faculties to be deemed
habits but only those which arise from acts which give them the special
character of stability hence mere opinion in the intellectual order as
distinct from science or a mere inclination resulting from a few
isolated acts as distinct from a virtue or a vice in the moral order
are not habits338 habits therefore belong properly to the faculties
of a spiritual substance indirectly however they extend their influence
to the lower or organic powers dependent on and controlled by the
spiritual faculties
to the various dispositions and facilities of action acquired by animals
through training adaptation acclimatization etc we may apply
what has been said in regard to the sense faculties and executive powers
of the human body just as we may regard the internal sense faculties
memory imagination sense appetite in man as in a secondary and
subordinate way subjects of habits in so far as these faculties act under
the direction and control of human reason and will339 so also the
organic dispositions induced in irrational animals by the direction and
guidance of human reason may indeed be regarded as extensions or effects
of the habits that dispose the rational human faculties but not as
themselves in the strict sense habits340
if then habits belong properly to intellect and will and if their
function is to dispose or indispose the human agent for the attainment of
the perfection in which his last end consists we must naturally look to
psychology and ethics for a detailed analysis of them here we must be
content with a word on their origin their effects and their importance
habits are produced by acts the act modifies the faculty if for
instance nothing remained in our cognitive faculties after each transient
cognitive act had passed memory would be inexplicable and knowledge
impossible nor could the repetition of any act ever become easier than
its first performance this something that remains is a habit or the
beginning of a habit a habit may be produced by a single act the minds
first intuition of an axiom or principle produces a habit or habitual
knowledge of that principle but as a rule it requires a repetition of
any act and that for a long time at comparatively short intervals to
produce a habit of that act a stable disposition whereby it can be
readily repeated and to strengthen and perfect the habit the acts must be
formed with a growing degree of intensity and energy progress in virtue
demands sustained and increasingly earnest efforts
the natural effect of habit is to perfect the faculty341 to increase
its energy to make it more prompt to act and thus to facilitate the
performance of the act for which the habit disposes it it also engenders
and develops a natural need or tendency or desire to repeat the act
and a natural aversion from the acts opposed to the habit finally
according as the habit grows the performance of the act demands less
effort calls for less actual attention thus the habit diminishes the
feeling of effort and tends to bring about a quasiautomatic and
semiconscious form of activity
good habits are those which perfect the nature of the agent which
advance it towards the realization of its end bad habits are those which
retard and prevent the realization of this end hence the ethical
importance to the human person of forming fostering and confirming good
habits as also of avoiding resisting and eradicating bad habits can
scarcely be exaggerated
the profound and allpervading influence of habit in the mental and moral
life of man is unfortunately far from being adequately appreciated even by
those responsible for the secular moral and religious education of the
young this is perhaps mainly due to the fact that the influence of habit
on the conduct of life enormous as it is in fact is so secret so
largely unconscious that it easily escapes notice careful reflection on
our actions diligent study of the springs of action in our everyday life
are needed to reveal this influence but the more we analyse human conduct
in ourselves and others the more firmly convinced we become that human
character and conduct are mainly dependent on the formation of habits
habits are the grand conserving and perfectingor the terrible undermining
and destroyingforce of life they are the fruit of our past and the seed
of our future in them the words of leibniz find their fullest
verification the present is laden with the past and pregnant with the
future by forming good habits we escape the disheartening difficulties
of perpetual beginnings and thus the labour we devote to the acquisition
of wisdom and virtue has its first rich recompense in the facility it
gives us to advance on the path of progress
it has been truly and rightly said that all genuine education consists in
the formation of good habits
80 powers faculties and forcesa natural operative power faculty or
force  potentia facultas virtus agendi is a quality
which renders the nature of the individual agent apt to elicit certain
actions by impotence or incapacity  impotentia
incapacitas aristotle meant not an opposite kind of quality in
contradistinction to power or faculty but only a power of a weaker
order differing in degree not in kind from the real power which
renders an agent proximately capable of acting such weaker capacities
for instance as the infants power to walk or the defective eyesight of
the aged
it is to the individual subsisting person or thing that all the actions
proceeding from the latter are ascribed actiones sunt suppositorum the
suppositum or person is the principium quod agit and it acts in
accordance with its nature this latter is the principium quo agens
agit the nature is the substance or essence as a principle of the
actions whereby the individual tends to realize its end but is a created
finite nature the immediate or proximate principle of its activities
so that it is operative per se or is it only their remote principle
eliciting them not by itself but only by means of powers faculties
forces which are themselves accidental perfections of the substance and
really distinct from it qualities intermediate between the latter and
its actions being the proximate principles of the latter
no doubt when any individual nature is acted upon by other agencies when
it undergoes real change under the influence of its environment its
passive potentiality is being so far forth actualized moreover when the
nature itself acts immanently the term of such action remaining within
the agent itself to actualize or perfect it some passive potentiality
of the agent is being actualized in these cases the nature before being
thus actualized was really capable of such actualization this passive
potentiality however is itself nothing actual it implies no actual
perfection in the nature but we must distinguish carefully from this
passive or receptive potentiality of a nature its active or operative
powerspotentiae operativae these may be themselves actual
perfections in the nature accidental perfections actually in the
nature and perhaps really distinct from it
that they are indeed actual perfections of the nature is fairly obvious
it is an actual perfection of a nature to be proximately and
immediately and without any further complement or addition to its
reality capable of acting and this is true whether the action in
question be immanent or transitive if it be immanent the perfection
resulting from the action the term of the latter will be a perfection of
the agent itself and in this case the agent by virtue of its operative
power will have had the capacity of perfecting itself while if the
action be transitive the agent will have had in virtue of its operative
power the capacity of producing perfections in other things in either
case such capacity is undoubtedly an actual perfection of the agent that
possesses it hence the truth of the scholastic formula omne agens agit
in quantum est in actu patiatur vero inquantum est in potentia
furthermore all such operative powers are really distinct from the
actions which immediately proceed from them this too is obvious for
while the operative power is a stable abiding characteristic of the
agent the actions elicited by means of it are transient
but what is the nature of this operative power in relation to the nature
itself of the agent it is an actual perfection of this nature it is
moreover unlike acquired habits native to this nature born with it so
to speak naturally inseparable from it further still operative powers
would seem to be all properties 69 of their respective natures
inasmuch as it is only in virtue of the operative power that the nature
can act and there can be no nature without connatural operations whereby
it tends to realize the full and final perfection of its being the
perfection which is the very raison dtre of its presence in the actual
order of things the question therefore narrows itself down to this are
operative powers which perfect the nature of which they are properties
really distinct from this nature or are they only virtually distinct
aspects under which we view the nature itself for example when we speak
of intellect and will as being faculties of the human soul do we merely
mean that intellect is the soul itself regarded as capable of reasoning
and will the soul itself regarded as capable of willing or do we mean
that the soul is not by itself and in virtue of its own essence
capable of reasoning and willing that it can reason and will only through
the instrumentality of two realities of the accidental order really
distinct from though at the same time necessarily rooted in and
springing from the substance of the soul itself realities which we call
powers or faculties or again when we speak of a man or an animal as
having various sense facultiesinternal and external cognitive
appetitive executivedo we merely mean that the living sentient organism
is itself directly capable of eliciting acts of various kinds of
imagining desiring seeing hearing etc or do we mean that the
organism can elicit these various acts only by means of several accidental
realities really distinct from and inhering in itself
if such operative powers or faculties are naturally inseparable from the
substance in which they inhere if they are so necessarily consequent on
the nature of the latter that it cannot exist without them are they
anything more than virtually distinct aspects of the substance itself on
this question as we have already seen 69 scholastics are not agreed
st thomas and thomists generally maintain that intellect and will are
really distinct from the substance of the soul and likewise that the
sense faculties are really distinct from the substance of the animated
organism in which they inhere342 in this view the distinction is not
merely a virtual distinction between different aspects of the soul or the
organism itself grounded in the variety and complexity of the acts which
emanate from the latter the faculties are real entities of the accidental
order mediating between the substance and its actions and involving in
the concrete being a plurality which however is not incompatible with
the real unity of the latter 69
the following are some of the arguments urged in proof of a real
distinction
a existence and action are two really distinct actualities therefore
the potentialities which they actualize must be really distinct for such
is the transcendental relation between the potential and the actual that
any potential subject and the corresponding perfection which actualizes it
must belong to the same genus supremum the one cannot be a substance
and the other an accident343 now existence is the actuality of
essence and action is the actuality of operative power or faculty
but action is certainly an accident therefore the operative power which
it actualizes must also be an accident and must therefore be really
distinct from the substance of which it is a power and of which existence
is the actuality this line of argument applies with equal force to all
created natures344
in the infinite being alone are operation and substance identical no
creature is operative in virtue of its substance the actions of a
creature cannot be actualizations of its substance existence is the
actualization of its substance therefore its actions must be
actualizations of potentialities which are accidents distinct from its
substance in other words of operative powers which belong indeed
necessarily to its substance but are really distinct from the latter
this argument rests on very ultimate metaphysical conceptions but not all
scholastics will admit the assumptions it involves how for instance
does it appear that the created or finite substance as such cannot be
immediately operative even were it immediately operative its actions
would still be accidents and the distinction between creator and creature
would stand untouched the operative power must be an accident because the
action which actualizes it the actus secundus is an accident but
the consequentia has not been proved and it is not selfevident on the
theory of the real distinction is not the operative power itself an
actual perfection of the substance and therefore in some sort an
actualization of the latter and yet they are not in the same ultimate
category in eodem genere supremo the nature which is the potential
subject perfected by the operative power is a substance while the
operative power which perfects the substance by actualizing this
potentiality is an accident of course there is not exactly the same
correlation between substance and operative power as between the latter
and action but anyhow the action is in some true sense an actualization
of the substance at least through the medium of the power unless we are
prepared to break up the concrete unity of the agent by referring the
action solely to the power of the agent and isolating the substance of
the latter as a sort of immutable core which merely exists a mode of
conceiving the matter which looks very like the mistake of reifying
abstract concepts and if the action is in any true sense an actualization
of the substance we have after all a potentia and actus which are
not in the same ultimate category
    these considerations carry us of course right into what is
    perhaps the most fundamental of all metaphysical problems that of
    the mode in which finite reality is actual in its concrete
    actuality every finite real being is essentially subject to
    change its actuality is not tota simul at every instant it not
    only is but is becoming it is a mixture of potentiality and
    actuality it is ever really changing and yet the it which
    changes can in some real degree and for some real space of time
    persist or endure identical with itself as a subsisting thing or
    person how then are we to conceive aright the mode of its
    actuality take the concrete existing being at any instant of its
    actuality suppose that it is not merely undergoing change through
    the influence of other beings in its environment or through its
    own immanent action but that it is itself acting whether
    immanently or transitively if we consider that at this instant
    its existence is really distinct from its action we cannot
    mean by this that there is in it an unchanging substantial core
    which is actually merely existing and a vesture of active and
    passive accidental principles which is just now actual though
    always in a state of flux or change by acting or being acted
    on345 such a conception would conflict with the truth that the
    existing substance is ever being really and actually though
    accidentally determined changed modified improved or
    disimproved in its total concrete existing reality even when
    these changes are not so profound as to destroy its substantial
    identity and thus terminate its actuality as an individual being
    even when in other words they are not substantial they are none
    the less real and really affect the substance since they are real
    they necessarily involve the recognition of really distinct
    principles in the concrete being and preclude the view that the
    distinctions which we recognize in the everchanging modes of its
    actuality as revealed to us in time and space are all merely
    conceptual or logical distinctions projected by the mind into what
    would therefore be in fact a simple and immutable reality the
    denial of any real distinction between successive actual states
    or between coexisting principles of those states in any finite
    being would lead logically to the eleatic doctrine ie to
    denial of the reality of change on the other hand while
    recognizing that change is a reality and not a subjective mental
    illusion and that real change can be grounded only in a plurality
    of really distinct principles in the finite individual being we
    must at the same time hold that this plurality of really distinct
    principles in the individual does not destroy a real unity
    stability and selfidentical continuity of the individual being
    in the mode of its actuality throughout time not of course that
    this stability or sameness of the individual throughout time is
    complete and adequate to the exclusion of all real change but it
    is certainly a real continuity of one and the same individual
    being to deny this would be to remove all permanence from reality
    and to reduce all real being to flux or change ie to the
      of the ionian philosopher heraclitus
    we cannot get a true conception of any finite reality by
    considering it merely from the static point of view which is
    the natural standpoint of abstract thought we must view it also
    from the dynamickinetic standpoint ie not merely as an
    essence or principle of existence but as a power or principle of
    action and of consequent change evolution or decay and the
    philosophy which is the latest fashion among contemporary systems
    that of the brilliant french thinker and writer bergson has at
    all events the merit of emphasizing this important truth that if
    our philosophical analysis of experience is to be fruitful we must
    try to grasp reality not merely as it presents itself to abstract
    thought at any section drawn by the latter through the incessant
    process of its fieri or continuous actualization in time but
    also to grasp and analyse as far as possible the fieri or
    process itself and bring to light whatever we find that this
    process implies
    these considerations may help the student to estimate for himself
    the value and the limitations of the argument which has suggested
    them
b a thing cannot be really identical with a variety of things that are
really distinct from one another but the faculties of the soul are really
distinct from one another therefore they must be really distinct from the
substance of the soul the minor premiss is supported by these
considerations the vegetative and sentient operations of the human
individual are operations of the living organism while the higher
operations of rational thought and volition are operations of the soul
alone the spiritual or immaterial principle in the individual but the
immaterial principle cannot be really and adequately identical with the
animated organism therefore the powers or immediate principles of
these two classes of functions belonging as they do to two really though
not adequately distinct substantial principles cannot be really
identical with one of them viz with the soul itself the spiritual
principle again the exercise of certain functions by the human
individual is subordinate to and dependent on the previous exercise of
other functions for example actual volition is necessarily dependent and
consequent on actual thought we cannot will or desire any good without
first knowing it as a good but the immediate principle of any function or
activity cannot be dependent on or subordinate to itself therefore the
immediate principles of such controlling and controlled
activitiesintellect and will for examplemust be really distinct
faculties346
c suppose the substance or nature of an agentthe human individual
for instancewere really identical with all its powers or faculties that
these were merely the nature itself viewed under different aspects so
that there would be in reality only one operative power in the individual
then there would be no reason why the individual could not or should not
at any instant elicit one single action or operation which would be
simultaneously an act of thinking willing seeing hearing etc ie
which would have at once in itself the modalities of all human activities
but universal experience testifies on the contrary that the operations
of the individual are each of some particular mode only that he cannot
elicit every mode of human activity simultaneously that he never elicits
one single act having a variety of modes but why could he not if his
substance or nature itself were the one and only proximate principle of
all his modes of activity because the conditions for the full and
adequate exercise of this one single or proximate principle at once
substance and power are never realized but it is arbitrary to assume the
existence of a power which could never pass fully into the act connatural
to it and moreover even if these conditions are partially realized we
should see as a consequence of this some human activity which would
manifest in some degree at least all the modalities of the various human
actions of which we have experience but we have no experience of a single
human activity manifesting in any degree the modalities of the numerous
and really distinct human activities which experience reveals to us hence
the variety of these really distinct modes of activity can be explained
only by the fact that the human individual elicits them through proximate
operative principles or powers which are really distinct from one another
and from the nature itself of the individual347
    the problem of analysing and classifying the forces faculties or
    powers of the subsisting things and persons in the universe of our
    experience belongs partly to cosmology and partly to psychology
    in the latter it becomes mainly a problem of classifying our
    mental acts functions or processesour states of consciousness
    apart from the question whether or not our mental faculties are
    really distinct from one another and from the human nature or
    substance itself of the individual the problem of their proper
    classification is important from the point of view of method and
    of accurate psychological analysis we have seen already 69
    that the greatest scholastic philosophers are not unanimous in
    declaring the distinction to be real but it is at least a virtual
    distinction and even as such it gives rise to the problem of
    classification it will be sufficient here to indicate the general
    principle on which the classification proceeds wherever the
    acts are adequately distinct they proceed from distinct
    powers and the acts are adequately distinct when they have
    adequately distinct formal objects348 potentiae
    specificantur per actus et objecta the operation or act is the
    correlative of the power or faculty and the formal object or
    term of the operation is the final cause of the latter the
    end for which it is elicited on this basis aristotle and the
    scholastics distinguish two mental faculties of the higher or
    spiritual order intellect and will and in the lower or sense
    order of mental life they distinguish one appetitive faculty
    sense appetite and several cognitive sense faculties these
    latter comprise the internal sense faculties viz the sensus
    communis or unifying and associating sense the imagination
    sense memory and instinct and the external sense faculties
    comprise sight sound taste smell and touch
81 some characteristics of qualitiesa qualities  have
contraries health and illness virtue and vice science and error etc
are opposed as contraries this however is not a property of
qualities it is not verified in powers or in forms and figures and it
is verified in accidents which are not qualities eg in actio and
passio
b quality is the basis or fundamentum of all relations of
similarity and dissimilarity this attribute seems to be in the strict
sense a property of all qualities substances are similar in so far as
they have the same kind of qualities dissimilar in so far as they have
different kinds similarity of substances is the main index to identity
of nature or kind but it must not be confounded with the latter the
latter cannot always be inferred even from a high degree of similarity
some specifically distinct classes of things are very similar to one
another nor on the other hand is full and complete similarity a
necessary consequence of identity of nature individuals of the same
species are often very dissimilar very unlike one another
c qualities admit of varying degrees of intensity they can increase
or diminish in the same substance while numerically and specifically
distinct substances can have the same kind of quality in different
degrees this is manifest in regard to habits passions and sensible
qualities on the other hand it is clearly not true of form or
figure different individuals can have the same kind of natural power
in different degrees one man may be naturally of keener intellect and
stronger will than another the weak power was what aristotle called
 impotentia but whether the natural powers of the same
individual can themselves increase or decrease in strength or
intensityand not merely the habits that affect these powersis not so
clear operative powers are certainly perfected or injured by the
acquisition of good or bad habits in the view of those who deny a real
distinction between natural operative power or faculty and substance it
is of course the substance itself that is so perfected or injured
this attribute therefore is not found in all qualities but it is
found in qualities alone and not in any other category or mode of
being
how are we to conceive this variation in intensity this growth or
diminution of any quality in a substance in which such change takes
places on this point philosophers are not agreed by degree of
intensityintensio vel remissio  qualitatiswe understand the
degree or change of degree in which the same numerical quality affects
the same part or the same power of its subject thus rendering this
part or power formally more or less qualified in some particular way
this is clearly something quite different from the extension of the same
quality to different parts or its withdrawal from different parts of the
same extended subject in a corporeal extended substance there can
accordingly be question of both kinds of change intensive and
extensive while in a simple spiritual substance there can obviously be
question only of intensive change of qualities and the fact of
intensive change of qualities is an undeniable fact of experience in what
manner does it take place some authors conceive it as an addition or
subtraction of grades or degrees of the same quality others
conceiving qualities as simple indivisible entities or forms and
thence denying the possibility of distinct grades of any quality conceive
such change to take place by this simple entity affecting its subject
more or less intimately becoming more or less firmly rooted as it
were in its subject349 and they explain this more or less perfect mode
of inherence in a variety of ways all of which are grounded on certain
texts of st thomas350 the quality receives a new accidental mode
whereby it communicates itself to the subject and informs the latter
more or less perfectly or it is educed more or less fully from the
potentiality of its subject thus qualifying the latter in the degree in
which it is educed from and rooted in the latter
    these explanations are instructive as illustrating the view that
    the actual reality of the accidental mode of being consists in its
    affecting determining the subject in which it inheres st
    thomas professing that he can attach no intelligible meaning to
    addition or substraction of grades351 teaches that the habit of
    charity for example can be increased secundum essentiam by
    inhering more perfectly being more firmly rooted in its
    subject for he says since it is an accident ejus esse est
    inesse unde nihil est aliud ipsam secundum essentiam augeri quam
    eam magis inesse subjecto quod est magis eam radicari in
    subjecto augetur ergo essentialiter ita quod magis ac magis in
    subjecto esse incipiat352 and elsewhere he concludes with the
    words ponere igitur quod aliqua qualitas non augeatur secundum
    essentiam sed augeatur secundum radicationem in subjecto vel
    secundum intensionem actus est ponere contradictoria esse
    simul353
chapter xi quantity space and time
82 analysis of the concept of quantitya detailed study of quantity
including space and time and the aristotelian categories ubi quando
and situs belongs to cosmology here we shall confine ourselves mainly
to the exposition of certain elementary notions preparatory to such
detailed study and we shall assume the validity of the scholastic theory
of knowledge that a real material world exists independently of our
minds that it consists of material substances or bodies animate and
inanimate endowed with the fundamental accident of quantity or extension
that these bodies possess moreover many other real accidents such as
qualities and energies chemical physical and mechanical that they are
subject to real change local quantitative qualitative and substantial
that our concepts of space and time derived from those of extension and
change are not purely subjective or mental forms of cognition but are
objectively valid notions grounded in the reality of the corporeal
universe and giving us a genuine if inadequate insight into the nature
of this reality
among the characteristics recognized by physicists in all perceptible
matterdivisibility commensurability impenetrability passivity or
inertia subjection to external forces or energies external extension or
volume internal quantity or massthere are none more fundamental than
those of volume and mass or extension and quantity354 nowhere
however do we find a better illustration of the fact that it is
impossible to give a definition proper of any supreme category or even a
description of it by the aid of any more elementary notions than in the
attempts of philosophers to describe quantity when for instance we
describe external actual local or spatial extension as that
accident of a corporeal substance or body in virtue of which the latter so
exists that it has parts outside parts in space we have to admit at once
that the notions expressed by the terms parts outside and space are
no simpler than the notion of extension itself in fact our notions of
place locus and space spatium are derived from and
presuppose that of extension this however is no serious disadvantage
for the description such as it is indicates what we mean by the terms
local spatial external actual extension and declares this latter to
be an accident of corporeal substances
extension as it is actually in the concrete body affected by a variety
of sensible qualities is called physical extension regarded in the
abstract apart from these qualities it is called geometrical or
mathematical extension trina dimensio or extension in three
dimensions length breadth and depth if we abstract from one of these we
have extension in two dimensions superficial extension if we
abstract from two we have extension in one dimension linear
extension and if we abstract from all three we have the extreme limiting
concept of the mathematical point of these four abstract mathematical
concepts point line surface and volume each expresses the
mathematical limitation of the succeeding one
we cannot conceive a body existing by having parts outside parts in space
each part occupying exclusively a place appropriated to itself unless we
conceive the body the corporeal substance as having already a
plurality of really distinct or distinguishable parts in itself and
abstracting from all relation to space the substance must be conceived
as having a plurality of really distinct or distinguishable integral
parts of itself before these parts can be conceived as existing outside
one another each in its own place and the property in virtue of which
the corporeal substance has in itself this plurality of distinct integral
parts whereby it is capable of occupying space and of being
impenetrable divisible measurable etc is called internal
radical potential quantity or extension355
the corporeal substance itself is of course essentially composite
essentially divisible into two essential constitutive principles the
passive determinable or material principle materia prima and the
specifying determining formative principle forma substantialis then
we conceive this essentially composite substance as necessarily endowed
with the property of internal quantity whereby it is composite in
another order composed of and divisible into really distinct integral
parts each of which is of course essentially composite like the whole
itself356 finally we conceive that the corporeal substance endowed
with this property has also as a connatural but really distinct and
absolutely separable effect of the latter the accidental mode of being
called external or local extension in virtue of which it actually
occupies space and thus becomes the subject of all those qualities
whereby it is perceptible to our senses
we have next to inquire into the relations between these three distinct
objective concepts corporeal substance internal quantity and local or
external extension
83 corporeal substance quantity and extensionthe corporeal substance
is an essentially composite substance resulting from the union of two
distinct essential constitutive principles it exists in itself and is the
ultimate subject of all the determinations whereby it reveals itself to
our senses its actual extension in space is a fundamental mode or
determination of its reality but it is a mode which is distinct from the
reality itself of the corporeal substance aristotle regarded the
distinction as real in his metaphysics he declares that the three
dimensions of bodies are quantities not substances that quantity is not
a substance whereas that in which it ultimately inheres is a
substance357 in his physics he says that substance is of itself
indivisible and is made divisible by its quantity or extension358 in
his de anima359 he observes that external quantity is directly
perceptible by the senses sensibile per se while substance is only
indirectly perceptible sensibile per accidens360 from which it is
inferred that substance and extension cannot be really identical again
st thomas argues that a corporeal substance as such and so far as its
essence is concerned is indifferent to greater or less extension in
space that the whole nature or substance of a man for instance is
indifferent to and independent of his particular size at any point of
time that while he grows from childhood to manhood it is his external
quantity that changes but not his humanity his human essence nature or
substance361
considerations such as these though they do not indeed amount to cogent
proofs of a real distinction between spatial extension and corporeal
substance should make any serious philosopher hesitate to identify these
absolutely as descartes and his followers did when they declared the
essence of corporeal substance to consist in three dimensions of spatial
extension even looking at the matter from the point of view of natural
reason alone and apart altogether from any light that may be thrown upon
it for the christian philosopher by divine revelation it is only the
superficial thinker who will conclude that because extensionwhich reveals
to his intellect through the medium of external sense perception the
presence of a corporeal substanceis naturally inseparable from the
latter therefore it is really and absolutely identical with this latter
the philosopher who remembers how little is known for certain about the
ultimate essential constitution of bodies or corporeal substances will
be slow to conclude that the spatially extended mode of their being enters
into the constitution of their essence and is not rather an accidental
determination whereby these substances have their integral parts dispersed
or extended in space and thus revealed to the human intellect through
sense perception
    and if he be a christian philosopher he will naturally inquire
    whether any truth of the christian revelation will help indirectly
    to determine the question descartes and his followers were
    christian philosophers and hence it was all the more rash and
    imprudent of them in spite of what they knew concerning the
    blessed eucharist to identify the corporeal substance with its
    spatial extension they knew that by transubstantiation the bread
    and wine are changed substantially into the body and blood of
    christ but all the appearances or phenomena of bread and wine
    remain after transubstantiation the eucharistic species as they
    are called the taste colour form etc in a word all the
    sensible qualities of these substances including the extension
    in which they immediately inhere from the revealed truth that the
    substances disappear and from the manifest fact that all their
    accidents remain christian philosophers and theologians have
    rightly drawn the sufficiently obvious inference that the
    spatially extended quantity which immediately supports all the
    other sensible qualities must be itself an absolute accident
    not only really distinct but by the absolute power of god
    really separable from its connatural substance the bread and
    the wine respectively and that this extended quantity remains in
    this state of actual separation miraculously supported by the
    direct influence of the divine omnipotence and while christian
    philosophers who hold this view can defend it from all charges of
    inconsistency unreasonableness and impossibility descartes and
    his followers can defend their particular view only by the
    admission that in the case of the consecrated eucharist our senses
    are deceived in this view while no accidents of the bread and
    wine remain objectively god himself produces directly in our
    minds the subjective mental states which the bread and wine
    produced before consecration362 this gratuitous aspersion is
    cast on the trustworthiness of sense perception simply on account
    of the preconceived theory identifying the corporeal substance
    with its extension according to the common view on the other
    hand the senses are not really deceived that to which they
    testify is really there viz the whole collection of natural
    accidents of bread and wine it is not the function of the senses
    but of the intellect to testify to the presence of the substance
    of course the unbeliever looking at the consecrated species or
    the believer who looks at them not knowing that they have been
    consecrated thinks that the substance of bread and the substance
    of wine are there each is deceived intellectually the one by his
    unbelief of a truth the other by his ignorance of a fact if both
    knew of the fact of consecration and if the former believed in
    the effect of it neither would be deceived363
    while the cartesian view is thus open to such serious objections
    the only plausible difficulty against the traditional view is that
    of conceiving how the reality of a merely accidental mode of
    being such as extension can be sustained in the actual order of
    things apart from its connatural substance and yet not become
    itself eo ipso a substance needless to say we have no
    positive conception of the manner in which the divine
    omnipotence thus sustains extension but since this latter being
    an absolute accident and not a mere modal determination of the
    substance has a reality of its own the miraculous persistence of
    this reality cannot be shown to be impossible nor is it in this
    separated condition itself a substance for it still retains its
    natural aptitude for inherence in its connatural substance and
    this aptitude alone not actual inherence is of its essence
    as an accident 65 retaining this natural aptitude it cannot
    possibly become a substance it cannot be identified with the
    substantial mode of being which has essentially the very
    opposite aptitude that of existing in itself
external extension then is an absolute accident really distinct from
the corporeal substance and naturally though not absolutely inseparable
from the latter it is the natural concomitant or consequence of the
internal quantity whereby the corporeal substance has in itself a
plurality of distinct integral parts this internal quantity itself is
either an aspect of the corporeal substance itself only virtually
distinct from the latter or else in the strict sense a property
absolutely inseparable if really distinct from the substance natural
experience furnishes no example of a corporeal substance actually existing
devoid of internal quantity or internal distinction of integral
parts364 but scholastic philosophers are not agreed as to whether the
corporeal substance is itself and by its own essence a manifold of really
distinct integral parts in which case internal quantity would be merely
the aspect under which the essence is thus regarded as an integral whole
constituted by a plurality of distinct integral parts while looked at as
an essence it would be an essential whole constituted by the union of two
essential parts or principlesor whether it is formally constituted an
integral whole not by its essence which makes it only an essential
whole an essentially composite substance but by a property really
distinct though necessarily flowing from this essence viz internal
quantity according to the former view the material principle materia
prima of the composite corporeal substance is such that the essence
resulting from its union with the formative principle forma
substantialis is necessarily an integral whole with distinguishable
integral parts each of which naturally demands the spatially extended
mode of being which external extension de facto confers upon it
according to the latter view which is that of st thomas and his
followers generally the corporeal substance as such has no mode of
composition other than essential composition it is not of itself an
integral whole compounded of distinct or distinguishable integral parts
each of which would be like the whole essentially composite of itself
it is indivisible into integral parts it is therefore in this order
of being simple and not composite it has no doubt by reason of its
material principle an absolutely necessary exigence for divisibility into
distinct integral parts for integral composition in other words but this
actual integral composition this actual divisibility is the formal
effect of a property really distinct from the substantial essence itself
and this property is internal quantity the connatural but absolutely
separable complement of this internal quantity being as in the other
view local or spatial extension
in both views external extension is an absolute accident of the corporeal
substance and in the thomist view internal quantity would also appear to
be an absolute accident and not a mere mode
    it is instructive to reflect how far this scholastic doctrine
    removes us from the cartesian view which sets up an absolute
    antithesis between mind or spirit and matter or body placing the
    essence of the former in thought and that of the latter in
    extension according to the scholastic view the spiritual
    substance is an immaterial actuality or form it is
    essentially simple and not like a corporeal substance an
    essentially composite substance resulting from the union of a
    formative principle or form with a passive determinable
    material principle and since it is the material principle that
    demands the property of internal quantity and the accident of
    external extension whereby the corporeal substance becomes an
    integral whole with its parts extended in space it follows that
    the spiritual substance having no material principle in its
    constitution is not only essentially simpleto the exclusion of
    distinct principles of its essencebut is also and as a
    consequence integrally simple to the exclusion of distinct
    integral parts and of the extended or characteristically
    corporeal mode of occupying space so far there is contrast
    between the two great substantial modes of finite being matter
    and spirit but the contrast is by no means an absolute
    antithesis for if we look at the essence alone of the corporeal
    substance it is not of itself actually extended in space in the
    thomist view it is not even of itself divisible into distinct
    integral parts it differs from spirit in this that while the
    latter is essentially simple the former is essentially composite
    and has by reason of this compositeness a natural aptitude for
    divisibility into parts and for the extension of these parts in
    space an aptitude which spirit does not possess but the
    corporeal substance may exist without actual extension and
    consequently without any of those other attributes such as
    impenetrability solidity colour etc through which it is
    perceptible to our senses in this condition how does it differ
    from spirit in being essentially composite and in being perhaps
    endowed with distinguishable integral parts365 but in this
    condition the essential mode of its being has a relation to space
    which closely resembles the mode in which spirit exists in space
    it is related to space somewhat in the manner in which the soul is
    in the space occupied by the bodywhole in the whole of this space
    and whole in every assignable portion of this space so that after
    all different as matter and spirit undoubtedly are the
    difference between them is by no means that sort of cartesian
    chasm which human thought must for ever fail to bridge
by virtue of its external extension the corporeal substance exists by
having distinguishable parts outside parts in space we can conceive any
perceptible volume of matter as being perfectly continuous if it has no
actual limits or actual distinction of parts within itself but is
one individual being completely filling the whole space within its
outer surface or imperfectly continuous if while being one and
undivided it has within its volume pores or interstices whether these be
empty or filled with some other sort of matter or as made up of
contiguous integral parts if each or these is really distinct and
actually divided from every other while each actually touches with its
outer limits the adjacent limits of the parts lying next to it so that
all the internal parts or limits are coterminous or as made up of
separate discrete or distant parts no one of which actually touches any
other
it is clear that there must be in any actually extended volume of matter
ultimate parts which are really continuousunless we are to hold with
dynamists that our perception of extension is produced in our minds by
the action of extramental points or centres of force which are themselves
simple or unextended but the physical phenomena of contraction
expansion absorption undulatory and vibratory motions accompanying our
sensations of light heat and sound as well as many other physical
phenomena all point to the fact that volumes of matter which are
apparently continuous are really porous the molecular structure of
perceptible matter is an accepted physical theory and scientists also
universally accept as a working hypothesis the existence of an
imperceptible material medium pervading and filling all real space though
there is no agreement as to the properties with which they suppose this
hypothetical medium the ether to be endowed
again as regards the divisibility of extended matter it is obvious
that if we conceive extension in three dimensions geometrically
mathematically or in the abstract any such volume or extension is
indefinitely divisible in thought but if we inquire how far any
concrete actually existing volume of matter is divisible we know in the
first place that we cannot divide the body of any actual organic living
thing indefinitely without destroying its life and so its specific
character nor can we carry on the division of inorganic matter
indefinitely for want of sufficiently delicate dividing instruments but
apart from this the science of chemistry points to the fact that every
inorganic chemical compound has an ultimate individual unit the chemical
molecule which we cannot subdivide without destroying the specific
nature of the compound by resolving it into its elements or into less
complex compounds furthermore each elementary or chemically simple
bodysuch as gold oxygen carbon etcseems resolvable into units called
atoms which appear to be ultimate individual units in the sense that
if their mass can be subdivided as appears possible from researches
that have originated in the discovery of radium the subdivisions are
specifically different kinds of matter from that of the atom so divided
in the inorganic world the perceptible mass of matter is certainly not an
individual being a unum per se but only a collection of individual
atoms or molecules a unum per accidens whether the molecule or the
atom of the chemically elementary body is the individual cannot be
determined with any degree of certitude it would appear however that
every specifically distinct type of inorganic matter whether compound or
elementary requires for its existence a certain minimal volume by the
subdivision of which the type is substantially changed and this is
manifestly true of organic or living matter so that matter as it
naturally exists would appear not to be indefinitely divisible
    if in a chemically homogeneous mass of inorganic matter such as
    carbon or water the chemical molecule be regarded as the
    individual this cannot be the case in any organic living
    thing for whatever matter is assimilated into the living
    substance of such a being eo ipso undergoes substantial change
    whereby it loses the nature it had and becomes a constituent of
    the living individual the substantial individual unity of
    the organic living being seems to be compatible not merely with
    qualitative structural and functional heterogeneity of parts
    but also with perhaps even complete spatial separateness of
    these parts if the structure of the living body is really
    molecular ie if it has distances between its ultimate
    integral units so that these are not in spatial contact then the
    fact that the formative vital principle forma substantialis
    anima unifies this material manifold and constitutes it an
    individual by actualizing and vitalizing each and all of the
    material units spatially separate as they arethis fact will
    help us to realize that the formative principle of the composite
    corporeal substance has not of itself the spatial extended
    mode of being but that the substance derives the latter from its
    material principle materia prima
84 place and spacefrom the concept of the volume or actual extension of
a body we pass immediately to that of the place locus which it
occupies we may distinguish between the internal and the external
place of a body by the former we understand the outer convex surface
of the body itself regarded as a receptacle containing the volume of the
body if therefore there were only one body in existence it would have
its own internal place this is independent of other bodies not so
however the external place for by the external place of a body we mean
the immediately surrounding concave surface formed by the bodies
which circumscribe the body in question and considered formally as an
immovable container of this body this is a free rendering of aristotles
definition place is the first or immediate immovable surface or
limit of that which contains a body prima immobilis superficies ejus
quod continet366 if a hollow sphere were filled with water the inner
or concave surface of the sphere would be the external place of the
water not however this surface considered materially but formally as
a surface so that if the sphere could be removed and another
instantaneously substituted for it the water would still be contained
within the same formal surface its locus externus would remain the
same and again it is the containing surface considered as immovable
or as circumscribing that definite portion of space that constitutes the
locus externus or external place of the located body so that if the
sphere with the water were moved the latter would thereby obtain a new
external location for though the containing surface be still materially
and formally the same it is no longer the same as a locating surface
seeing that it now marks off a portion of space different from that marked
off by it before it was moved
aristotles definition defines what is known as the proper external
place of a body from this we distinguish the common external place or
location of a body understanding by the latter or locus communis
the whole collection of spatial relations of the body in question to all
the bodies in its immediate neighbourhood it is by indicating these
relations or some of them that we assign the aristotelian category or
extrinsic denomination ubi367
regarded ontologically the internal place of a body is an absolute
accident it is the accident which gives the latter concrete volume or
external extension and it is not really distinct from the latter the
external place of a body includes in addition the spatial relations of the
latter to other bodies relations grounded in the volumes of those bodies
    it is by reason of these spatial relations with certain bodies
    that a being is said to be present in a certain place a
    corporeal extended substance is said to occupy space
    circumscriptiv or by having parts outside parts in the place
    it occupies a finite or created spiritual substance is said to
    occupy space definitiv inasmuch as it can naturally exercise
    its influence only within certain more or less extended spatial
    limits as the human soul does within the confines of the
    body368 the infinite being is said to occupy space repletiv
    the actual presence of god in all real space conserving in its
    existence all created contingent reality is called the divine
    ubiquity the perfection whereby god can be present in other
    worlds and other spaces which he may actualize is called the
    divine immensity
    the local presence of a finite being to other finite beings is
    itself a positive perfectionbased on its actual extension if it
    be an extended corporeal substance or on its power of operating
    within a certain space if it be a spiritual substance the fact
    that in the case of a finite being this local presence is itself
    limited is at once a corollary and an index of the finiteness of
    the being in question only the infinite being is omnipresent or
    ubiquitous but every finite being whether corporeal or
    spiritual from the very fact that it exists at all must exist
    somewhere or have some locus internus and it must have some
    local presence if there are other corporeal extended beings in
    existence thus the local presence of a being is a finite
    perfection which seems to be grounded in the very nature itself of
    the creature369
from the concept of place we pass naturally to the more complex and
abstract notion of space it is of course by cognitive processes both
sentient and intellectual that we come into possession of the abstract
concept of space these processes are subjective in the sense that they
are processes of the individuals mental faculties distinguishing between
the processes and the object or content which is brought into
consciousness or put in presence of the mind by means of them and
assuming that this object or content is not a mere form or groove of our
cognitive activity not a mere antecedent condition requisite on the
mental side for the conscious exercise of this activity on its data but
that on the contrary it is or involves an objective extramental reality
apprehended by the mindwe go on to inquire in what this objective
reality consists in approaching the question we must first note that what
is true of every abstract and universal concept is true of the concept of
space viz that the abstractness and universality intentio
universalitatis of real being as apprehended by the intellect are
modes or forms of thought entia rationis logical conditions and
relations which are created by thought and which exist only in and for
thought while the reality itself is the object apprehended in these modes
and under these conditions universale est formaliter in mente et
fundamentaliter in re now through the concept of space we apprehend a
reality our concept of real space has for its object an actual reality
what is this reality if space is real in what does its reality consist
we answer that the reality which we apprehend through this concept is the
total amount of the actual extension or magnitude of all created and
coexisting bodies not however this total magnitude considered
absolutely and in itself but as endowed with real and mutual relations
of all its parts to one another370 relations which are apprehended by
us as distances linear superficial and voluminal
such then is the reality corresponding to our concept of real and actual
space but no sooner have we reached this concept than we may look at its
object in the abstract remove mentally all limits from it and conceive
all extended bodies as actually nonexistent what is the result the
result is that we have now present to our minds the possibility of the
existence of extended bodies and a concomitant imagination image which
memory will not allow us to banish from consciousness of a vast and
boundless emptiness an indefinite and unmeasurable vacuum in which bodies
were or may be the intellectual concept is now not a concept of any
actual object but of a mere possibility the possibility of a
corporeal extended universe this is the concept of what we call ideal
or possible space and like the concept of any other possible reality it
is derived by us from our experience of actual realityin this case from
our experience of extended bodies as actually existing the corporeal
universe has not existed from all eternity but it was possible from all
eternity when we think of that possibility as antecedent to all creation
we are thinking of bodies and of their extension as possible and the
concept of their total extension as possible is the concept of ideal or
possible space this concept is through a psychological necessity
accompanied by an imagination image of what we call imaginary space the
unlimited vacuity which preceded corporeal creation which would still
persist were the latter totally annihilated which reaches out
indefinitely beyond its actual limits which imagination pictures for us
as a receptacle in which bodies may exist but which all the time our
reason assures us is actually nothing being really only the known
possibility of corporeal creatures this familiar notion of an empty
receptacle for bodies is what we have in mind when we think of bodies as
existing in space hence we say that space as conceived by the human
mind is not a mere subjective form of cognition a mere ens rationis
inasmuch as our concept has a foundation in reality viz the actual
extension of all existing bodies nor is it on the other hand simply a
real entity because this actual extension of bodies does not really exist
in the manner in which we apprehend it under the abstract concept of
space as a mere possibility or empty receptacle of bodies space is
therefore an ens rationis cum fundamento in re
    a great variety of interesting but abstruse questions arise from
    the consideration of space but they belong properly to cosmology
    and natural theology for example is real space actually infinite
    in magnitude or finite in other words besides the whole solar
    systemwhich is in reality merely one star plus its planets and
    their satellitesis there in existence an actually infinite
    multitude of such stellar worlds it is not likely that this can
    ever be determined empirically many philosophers maintain that
    the question must be answered in the negative inasmuch as an
    actually infinite multitude is impossible others however deny
    that the impossibility of an actually infinite multitude can be
    proved371 again within the limits of the actual corporeal
    universe are there really vacant spaces or is all space within
    these limits actually or even necessarily filled with an
    allpervading ether or corporeal medium of some sort how would
    local motion be possible if all space were full of impenetrable
    matter how would the real interaction of distant bodies on one
    another be possible if there were only vacant space between them
    is the real volume or extension of a corporeal substance as
    distinct from its apparent volume which is supposed to include
    interstices or spaces not filled with that body actually or
    necessarily unchangeable or is the internal quantity of a body
    actually or necessarily unchangeable can more than one individual
    corporeal substance simultaneously occupy exactly the same space
    this is not possible naturally for impenetrability is a natural
    consequence of local extension but it is possible miraculouslyif
    all the bodies or all except one be miraculously deprived of
    local or spatial extension can the same individual body be
    present at the same time in totally different and distant places
    not naturally of course but how it can happen even miraculously
    is a more difficult question than the preceding one it is in
    virtue of its actual or local extension that a body is present
    sensibly in a definite place deprived miraculously of this
    extension it can be simultaneously in several places as our
    blessed lords body is in the eucharist but if a body has its
    natural local extension at one definite place does this extension
    so confine its presence to this place that it cannot be
    simultaneously presentmiraculously and without its local
    extensionat other places the most we can say is that the
    absolute impossibility of this is neither selfevident nor capable
    of cogent proof the body of our lord has its natural local
    extension in heavenfor heaven which will be the abode of the
    glorified bodies of the blessed after the general resurrection
    must be not merely a state or condition but a placeand at the
    same time it is sacramentally present in many places on earth
85 time its apprehension and measurementif the concept of space is
difficult to analyse and gives rise to some practically insoluble
problems this is still more true of the concept of time what then is
time exclaims st augustine in his confessions372 if no one asks
me i know but if i am asked to explain it then i do not know we reach
the notion of space through our external perception of extension by the
senses of sight and touch so also we derive the notion of time from our
perception of motion or change and mainly from our consciousness of
change and succession in our own conscious states the concept of time
involves immediately two other concepts that of duration and that of
succession duration or continuance in existence is of two kinds
permanent and successive permanent duration is the duration of an
immutable being formally and in so far as it is immutable successive
duration is the continued existence or duration of a being that is
subject to change formally and in so far as it is mutable now real
change involves a continuous succession of real states it is a
continuous process or fieri and it is the duration of a being subject
to such change that we call time or temporal duration had we no
consciousness of change or succession of states we could have no notion
of time though we might have a notion of unchanging duration if per
impossibile our cognitive activity were itself devoid of any succession
of conscious states and had for its object only unchanging reality but
since our cognitive activity is de facto successive we can apprehend
permanent or unchanging duration not as it is in itself but only after
the analogy of successive or temporal duration 86 the continuous series
of successive states involved in change is therefore the real and
objective content of our notion of time just as the coexisting total
of extension forms the content of our notion of space the concept of
space is the concept of something static that of time is the concept of
something kinetic time is the continuity of change where there is change
there is time without change time would be inconceivable change involves
succession and succession involves the temporal elements of before and
after separated by the indivisible limiting factor called the now or
present instant the past and the future are the two parts of
time while the present instant is not a part of time but a point of
demarcation at which the future flows into the past change is a reality
it is a real mode of the existence of mutable things but neither the
immediately past state nor the immediately future state of a changing
reality are actual at the present instant it is only to the permanent
abiding mind apprehending real change and endowed with memory and
expectation that the past and the future are actually and of course
only ideally not really present and it is only by holding past and
future in present consciousness by distinguishing mentally between them
by counting or measuring the continuous flow of successive states from
future to past through the present instant that the mind comes into
possession of the concept of time373 the mind thus apprehends time as
the measure of the continuous flow of successive states in things subject
to change as thus apprehended time is not merely the reality of change
it is the successive continuity or duration of change considered as a
measure of change it is that within which all changes are conceived to
happen just as space is conceived as that within which all extended
things are conceived to exist we have said that without real change or
motion there could be no time we can now add that without a mind to
apprehend and measure this motion there could be no time as st thomas
declares following aristotle si non esset anima non esset tempus374
for time as apprehended by means of our abstract and universal concept
is not simply a reality but a reality endowed with logical relations or
in other words a logical entity grounded in reality an ens rationis cum
fundamento in re
this brings us to aristotles classic definition375 which is at once
pithy and pregnant         
   tempus est numerus motus secundum prius et
posterius time is the measure of motion or change by what we conceive as
before and after or future and past in its process every change
involves its own intrinsic flow of states from future to past it is by
mentally distinguishing these states and by thus computing counting
numbering the continuous flow or change that we derive from the latter
the notion of time376 if then we consider all created things all
things subject to change we shall realize that real time commenced with
the creation of the first of them and will continue as long as they or
any of them continue to exist we thus arrive at a conception of time in
general analogous to that of space the whole continuous series of
successions in changing things from future to past regarded as that in
which these changes occur and which is the measure of them
here too as in the case of space we can distinguish real time which
is the total duration of actual changes from ideal or imaginary time
which is the conceived and imagined duration of merely possible changes
but a more important distinction is that between intrinsic or internal
time or the duration of any concrete mutable reality considered in
itself and extrinsic or external time which is some other extrinsic
temporal duration with which we compare and by which we may measure the
former duration every change or motion has its own internal time and
this is what we have been so far endeavouring to analyse if two men start
at the same instant to walk in the same direction and if one walk three
miles and the other four while the hands of a watch mark the lapse of an
hour the external time of each walk will be the same will coincide
with one and the same motion of the hands of the watch used as a measure
but the internal time of the fourmile walk will be greater than that of
the threemile walk the former will be a greater amount of change than
the latter and therefore its internal time estimated by this amount
absolutely will be greater than that of the latter estimated by its
amount absolutely377 the greater the amount of a change the greater the
internal timeduration or series of successive states which measures this
change absolutely378
just as the category where is indicated by the spatial relations of a
body to other bodies so the category when is indicated in regard to
any event or process by its commensuration or comparison with other
events or processes
this brings us to the notion of measurement to measure anything
quantitatively is to apply to it successively some quantitative unit taken
as a standard and to count the number of times it contains this unit this
is a process of mentally breaking up continuous quantity or
magnitudewhether permanent or successive ie whether extension or
motioninto discontinuous quantity or multitude if the measurement of
permanent quantity by spatial units and the choosing of such units are
difficult processes379 those of measuring successive quantity and
fixing on temporal units are more difficult still is there any natural
motion or change of a general character whereby we can measure
externally the timeduration of all other changes the motions of the
earth itselfon its axis and around the sunat once suggest themselves
and these motions form in fact the natural general standard for
measuring the time of all other events in the universe all artificial
or mechanical devices such as hourglasses watches clocks
chronometers etc are simply contrivances for the more convenient
application of that general and natural standard to all particular events
it requires a little reflection to realize that all our means of measuring
timeduration can only attain to approximate accuracy inasmuch as our
faculties of sense perception no matter by what devices they are aided
are so limited in range and penetration that fluctuations which fall below
the minima sensibilia cannot be detected it is a necessary condition of
any motion used as a standard for timemeasurement that it be regular
that the standard motions we actually employ are absolutely regular we
have no guarantee we can test their regularity only up to the point at
which our power of detecting irregularity fails
reflection will also show that our appreciation of timeduration is also
relative not absolute it is always a comparison of one flow or current
of conscious experiences with another it is the greater regularity of
astronomical motions as compared with changes or processes experienced as
taking place within ourselves that causes us to fix on the former as the
more suitable standard for the measurement of time there is indeed
writes father maher380 a certain rhythm in many of the processes of
our organic life such as respiration circulation and the recurrent
needs of food and sleep which probably contribute much to our power of
estimating duration the irregular character and varying duration of
conscious states however soon bring home to us the unfitness of these
subjective phenomena to serve as a standard measure of time moreover
our estimate of duration is largely dependent on the nature of the
estimated experiences and of our mental attitude towards them a period
with plenty of varied incident such as a fortnights travel passes
rapidly at the time whilst we are interested in each successive
experience we have little spare attention to notice the duration of the
experience there is almost complete lapse of the enumerating activity
but in retrospect such a period expands because it is estimated by the
number and variety of the impressions which it presents to recollection
on the other hand a dull monotonous or unattractive occupation which
leaves much of our mental energy free to advert to its duration is
overestimated whilst taking place a couple of hours spent impatiently
waiting for a train a few days in idleness on board ship a week confined
to ones room are often declared to constitute an age but when they
are past such periods being empty of incident shrink up into very small
dimensions similarly recent intervals are exaggerated compared with
equal periods more remote whilst as we grow older and new experiences
become fewer and less impressive each year at its close seems shorter
than its predecessor381
    from those facts it would seem perfectly legitimate to draw this
    rather surprising inference that if the rate of all the changes
    taking place in the universe were to be suddenly and
    simultaneously altered in the same directionall increased or all
    diminished in the same degreeand if our powers of perception
    were simultaneously so altered as to be readjusted to this new
    rate of change we could not become aware of the
    alteration382 supposing for instance that the rate of motion
    were doubled the same amount of change would take place in the
    new day as actually took place in the old the external or
    comparative time of all movementsthat is to say the time of
    which alone we can have any appreciationwould be the same as of
    old the new day would of course appear only half as long as the
    old to a mind not readjusted to the new conditions but this would
    still be external time but would the internal intrinsic time
    of each movement be unaltered it would be the same for the
    readjusted mind as it was previously for the mind adjusted to
    these previous conditions by an unaltered mind however by the
    divine mind for instance the same amount of motion would be seen
    to constitute the same movement under both conditions but to take
    place twice as quickly under the new conditions as it did under
    the old this again however involves a comparison and thus
    informs us merely of external or relative time if we identify
    intrinsic time with amount of change making the latter the
    measure of the former we must conclude that alteration in the
    rate of a motion does not alter its absolute time and this is
    evident when we reflect that the very notion of a rate of motion
    involves the comparison of the latter with some other motion383
    finally we have no positive conception of the manner in which
    time duration is related to or known by the divine eternal mind
    which is present to all timepast present and future
    besides the question of the relativity of time there are many
    other curious and difficult questions which arise from a
    consideration of timeduration but a detailed consideration of
    them belongs to cosmology we will merely indicate a few of them
    how far is time reversible at least in the case of purely
    mechanical movements384 had time a beginning we know from
    revelation that de facto it had but can we determine by the
    light of reason alone whether or not it must have had a
    beginning the greatest philosophers are divided as to possibility
    or impossibility of created reality existing from all
    eternity st thomas has stated as his considered opinion that
    the impossibility of creatio ab aeterno cannot be proved if a
    series of creatures could have existed successively from all
    eternity and therefore without any first term of the series
    this would involve the possibility of an actually infinite
    multitude of creatures but an actually infinite multitude of
    creatures whether existing simultaneously or successively is
    regarded by most philosophers as being selfcontradictory and
    intrinsically impossible and this although the divine essence
    being infinitely imitable ad extra and being clearly
    comprehended as such by the divine mind contains virtually the
    divine exemplars of an infinite multitude of possible creatures
    those who defend the possibility of an actually infinite multitude
    of creatures consider this fact of the infinite imitability of the
    divine essence as the ground of this possibility on the other
    hand those who hold that an actually infinite multitude is
    selfcontradictory deny the validity of this argument from
    possibility to actuality and they bring forward such serious
    considerations and arguments in favour of their own view that this
    latter has been at all times much more commonly advocated than the
    former one385 will time have an end all the evidence of the
    physical sciences confirms the truth of the christian faith that
    external time as measured by the motions of the heavens will
    have an end but the internal or intrinsic time which will be the
    measure of the activities of immortal creatures will have no
    end386
86 duration of immutable being eternitywe have seen that duration is
the perseverance or continuance of a being in its existence the duration
of the absolutely immutable being is a positive perfection identical with
the essence itself of this being it is a duration without beginning
without end without change or succession a permanent as distinct from
a successive duration for it is the duration of the necessary being
whose essence is pure actuality this duration is eternity an
interminable duration existing all together aeternitas est
interminabilis duratio tota simul existens this is the common definition
of eternity in the proper sense of the termabsolute or necessary
eternity the word interminabilis connotes a positive perfection
the exclusion of beginning and end the word tota does not imply that
the eternity has parts the expression tota simul excludes the
imperfection which is characteristic of time duration viz the
succession of before and after the definition given by botius387
emphasizes these points as also the indefectible character of immutable
life in the eternal being aeternitas est interminabilis vitae tota simul
et prefecta possessio
there is in the next place a kind of duration which has been called
hypothetical relative or borrowed eternity aeternitas
hypothetica relativa participata also called by scholastics
aeviternitas it is the duration in existence of a being that is
contingent but of its nature incorruptible immortal such as the human
soul or a pure spirit even if such a being existed from all eternity its
existence would be contingent dependent on a real principle distinct from
itself its duration therefore would not be eternity in the strict
sense on the other hand once created by god its nature would demand
conservation without end nor could it naturally cease to exist though
absolutely speaking it could cease to exist were god to withdraw from it
his conserving power its duration therefore differs from the duration
of corporeal creatures which are by nature subject to change decay and
cessation of their being a contingent spiritual substance has by nature a
beginning to its duration or at least a duration which is not essential
to it but dependent on the necessary being a duration however which is
naturally without end whereas the duration of the corporeal being has by
nature both a beginning and an end
    but philosophers are not agreed as to the nature and ground of the
    distinction between these two kinds of duration in contingent
    beings no contingent being is selfexistent neither has any
    contingent being the principle of its own duration in its own
    essence just as it cannot begin to exist of itself so neither
    can it continue to exist of itself at the same time granted that
    it has obtained from god actual existence some kind or degree of
    duration of continuance in that existence seems to be naturally
    due to its essence otherwise conservation would be not only
    really but formally a continued creation it is such indeed on the
    part of god in god there is no variety of activity but on the
    part of the creature the preservation of the latter in existence
    and therefore some degree of duration seems to be due to it on
    the hypothesis that it has been brought into existence at all the
    conserving influence of god is to its duration in existence what
    the concurring influence of god is to the exercise of its
    activities388 in this sense the duration of a finite being in
    existence is a positive perfection which we may regard as a
    property of its nature but is this perfection or property of the
    creature which we call duration a essentially successive
    in all creatures spiritual as well as corporeal and b is it
    really identical with their actual existence or with the reality
    of whatever change or actualization occurs to their existence or
    it is a mode of this existence or change really distinct from
    the latter and conferring upon the latter the perfection of
    continuity or persistence
    this at all events is universally admitted that we cannot
    become aware of any duration otherwise than through our
    apprehension of change that we have direct knowledge only of
    successive duration that we can conceive the permanent
    duration of immutable reality only after the analogy of successive
    duration or as the coexistence of immutable reality with the
    successive duration of mutable things
    now some philosophers identify successive duration with change
    and hold that successive duration is formally the duration of
    things subject to change that in so far as a being is subject to
    change its duration is successive and in so far as it is free
    from change its duration approaches the essentially permanent
    duration of the eternal immutable being that therefore the
    duration of corporeal corruptible mortal beings is par
    excellence successive or temporal duration tempus that
    spiritual beings which are substantially immutable but
    nevertheless have a successive series of spiritual activities
    have a sort of duration more perfect because more permanent than
    mere temporal duration but less perfect because less permanent
    than eternal duration aevum aeviternitas while the
    absolutely immutable being alone has perfect permanent duration
    aeternitas389 it is not clear whether according to this
    view we should distinguish between the duration of spiritual
    substances as permanent and that of their acts as successive
    or why we should not attribute permanent duration to corporeal
    substances and their permanent accidents confining successive
    duration formally to motion or change itself it is moreover
    implied in this view that duration is not any really distinct
    perfection or mode superadded to the actuality of the being that
    endures
    other philosophers hold that all duration of creatures is
    successive that no individual creature has a mixture of
    permanent and successive duration that this successive duration
    is really distinct from that which endures by means of it that it
    is really distinct even from the reality of change or motion
    itself that it is a real mode the formal function of which is
    to confer on the enduring reality a series of actualities in the
    order of succession of posterior to prior a series of
    intrinsic quandocationes analagous to the intrinsic locations
    which their extension confers upon bodies in space these
    philosophers distinguish between continuous or indefinitely
    divisible successive duration the indefinitely divisible
    parts of which are past and future and the present not a
    part but only an indivisible limit between the two parts and
    discontinuous or indivisible successive duration whose parts
    are separate and indivisible units of duration succeeding one
    another discontinuously each part being a real but indivisible
    duration so that besides the parts that are past and future
    the present is also a part which islike an instant of
    timeindivisible but which is alsounlike an instant of timea
    real duration the former kind of successive duration they ascribe
    to corporeal corruptible creatures the latter to spiritual
    incorruptible creatures this view is defended with much force and
    ingenuity by de san in his cosmologia390 where also a full
    discussion of most of the other questions we have touched upon
    will be found
chapter xii relation the relative and the absolute
87 importance of the present categoryan analysis of the concept of
relation will be found to have a very direct bearing both on the theory
of being and on the theory of knowledge for the human mind knowledge is
embodied in the mental act of judgment and this is an act of
comparison an act whereby we relate or refer one concept to
another the act of cognition itself involves a relation between the
knowing subject and the known object between the mind and reality
reality itself is understood only by our mentally recognizing or
establishing relations between the objects which make up for us the whole
knowable universe this universe we apprehend not as a multitude of
isolated unconnected individuals but as an ordered whole whose parts
are interrelated by their mutual coordinations and subordinations
the order we apprehend in the universe results from these various
interrelations whereby we apprehend it as a system what we call a law
of nature for instance is nothing more or less than the expression of
some constant relation which we believe to exist between certain parts of
this system the study of relation therefore belongs not merely to
logic or the theory of knowledge but also to the theory of being to
metaphysics what then is a relation what is the object of this mental
concept which we express by the term relation are there in the known
and knowable universe of our experience real relations or are all
relations merely logical pure creations of our cognitive activity can
we classify relations whether real or logical what constitutes a
relation formally what are the properties or characteristics of
relations these are some of the questions we must attempt to answer
again there is much ambiguity and not a little error in the use of the
terms absolute and relative in modern philosophy to some of these
sources of confusion we have referred already 5 it is a commonplace of
modern philosophy a thing accepted as unquestioned and unquestionable
that we know and can know only the relative there is a true sense in
this but the true sense is not the generally accepted one
considering the order in which our knowledge of reality progresses it is
unquestionable that we first simply perceive things successively things
more or less similar or dissimilar without realizing in what they
agree or differ to realize the latter involves reflection and
comparison similarly we perceive events in succession events some of
which depend on others but without at first noting or realizing this
dependence in other words we apprehend at first apart from their
relations or as absolute things and events which are really relative
and we do so spontaneously without realizing even that we perceive them
as absolute
the seed needs soil and rain and sunshine for its growth but these do not
need the seed the turbine needs the water but the water does not need
the turbine when we realize such facts as these by reflection
contrasting what is dependent with what is independent what is like or
unlike before or after greater or less than other things with what
each of these is in itself we come into conscious possession of the
notion of the relative and oppose this to the notion of the absolute
what we conceive as dependent we conceive as relative what we conceive
by negation as independent we conceive as absolute then by further
observation and reflection we gradually realize that what we apprehended
as independent of certain things is dependent on certain other things
that the same thing may be independent in some respects and dependent in
other respects the rain does not depend on the seed which it causes to
germinate but it does depend on the clouds the water which turns the
turbine does not depend on the turbine but it does depend on the rain
and the rain depends on the evaporation of the waters of the ocean and
the evaporation on the solar heat and this again on chemical and physical
processes in the sun and so on as far as sense experience will carry us
until we realize that everything which falls directly within this sense
experience is dependent and therefore relative similarly the accident of
quantity in virtue of which we pronounce one of two bodies to be larger
than the other is something absolute as compared with this relation
itself but as compared with the substance in which it inheres it is
dependent on the latter or relative to the latter while the substance
is absolute or free from dependence on it but if substance is absolute
as compared with accident in the sense that substance is not dependent on
a subject in which to inhere but exists in itself it is not absolute
in the sense understood by spinoza in the sense of existing of itself
independently of any efficient cause to account for its origin 64 all
the substances in the universe of our direct sense experience are
contingent dependent ab alio and therefore in this sense relative not
absolute
this is the true sense in which relativity is an essential note of the
reality of all the data of the world of our sense experience they are all
contingent or relative or conditioned existences and as kant rightly
taught this experience forces us inevitably to think of a necessary
absolute unconditioned being on whom these all depend but as can be
proved in natural theology against kant this concept is not a mere
regulative idea of the reason a form of thought whereby we systematize
our experience it is a concept the object of which is not merely a
necessity of thought but also an objectively existing reality391
    but in the thought of most modern philosophers relativism or the
    doctrine that we can know only the relative is something very
    different from all this for positivists disciples of auguste
    comte 17981857 it means that we can know only the phenomena
    which fall under the notice of our senses and the laws of
    resemblance succession etc according to which they occur all
    theological quests for supramundane causes and reasons of these
    events and all metaphysical quests for suprasensible forces
    powers influences in the events themselves as explaining or
    accounting for these latter are according to this theory
    necessarily futile the mind must rest content with a knowledge of
    the positive facts of sense and their relations relativism is
    thus another name for positivism
    for the psychological sensism of english philosophers from hobbes
    15881679 and locke 16321704 down to mill 180673 and bain
    18181903 relativism means that all conscious cognitionwhich
    they tend to reduce to modes and complexes of sensationmust be
    and can only be a cognition of the changing the transitional
    the relative392 according to an extreme form of this theory the
    mind can apprehend only relations but not the terms of any of
    these relations it can apprehend nothing as absolute moreover
    the relations which it apprehends it creates itself thus all
    reality is reduced to a system of relations for mill the supreme
    category of real being was sensation but sensation can be only
    a feeling of a relation thus the supreme category of real being
    would be relation393
    but the main current of relativism is that which has issued from
    kants philosophy and worked itself out in various currents such
    as spencers agnosticism hegels monism and renouviers
    neocriticism394 the mind can know only what is related to it
    what is present to it what is in it not what is apart from it
    distinct from it the mind cannot know the real nature of the
    extramental nor even if there be an extramental real subject and
    object in knowledge are really one individual minds are only
    selfconscious phases in the everevolving reality of the one sole
    actual being
    these are but a few of the erroneous currents of modern
    relativism a detailed analysis of them belongs to the theory of
    knowledge but it may be pointed out here that they are erroneous
    because they have distorted and exaggerated certain profound
    truths concerning the scope and limits of human knowledge
    it is true that we have no positive proper intuitive knowledge
    of the absolute being who is the first cause and last end of the
    universe that all our knowledge of the nature and attributes of
    the infinite being is negative analogical abstractive in a
    certain sense therefore he is above the scope of our faculties
    he is incomprehensible but it is false to say that he is
    unknowable that our knowledge of him inadequate and imperfect as
    it is is not genuine real and instructive as far as it goes
    again a distinct knowledge of any object implies defining
    limiting distinguishing comparing relating judging
    analysing and synthesizing it implies therefore that we
    apprehend things in relations with other things but this
    supposes an antecedent if indistinct apprehension of the
    things themselves indeed we cannot help pronouncing as simply
    unintelligible the contention that all knowledge is of relations
    and that we can have no knowledge of things as absolute how could
    we become aware of relations without being aware of the terms
    related spencer himself admits that the very reasoning whereby we
    establish the relativity of knowledge leads us inevitably to
    assert as necessary the existence of the nonrelative the
    absolute395 a necessity which kant also recognizes
    finally the fact that reality in order to be known must be
    present to the knowing mindor in other words that knowledge
    itself is a relation between object and subjectin no way
    justifies the conclusion that we cannot know the real nature of
    things as they are in themselves absolutely but only our own
    subjective mental impressions or representations of the absolute
    reality in itself unknowable396 the obvious fact that any
    reality in order to be known must be related to the knowing mind
    seems to be regarded by some philosophers as if it were a
    momentous discovery then conceiving the thinginitself the
    absolute as a something standing out of all relation to mind
    they declare solemnly that we cannot know the absolute a
    declaration which may be interpreted either as a mere truismthat
    we cannot know a thing without knowing itor as a purely
    gratuitous assertion that besides the world of realities which
    reveal themselves to our minds there is another world of
    unattained and unattainable thingsinthemselves which are as it
    were the real realities these philosophers have yet to show
    that there is anything absurd or impossible in the view that there
    is simply one world of realitiesrealities which exist absolutely
    in themselves apart from our apprehension of them and which in the
    process of cognition come into relation with our minds397
    moreover if besides this world of known and knowable realities
    there were such a world of transcendental thingsinthemselves
    as these philosophers discourse of such a world would have very
    little concern for us398 since by definition and ex hypothesi
    it would be for us necessarily as if it were not indeed the
    hypothesis of such a transcendental world is selfcontradictory
    for even did it exist we could not think of it
    the process of cognition has indeed its difficulties and
    mysteries to examine these to account for the possibility of
    truth and error to analyse the grounds and define the scope and
    limits of human certitude are problems for the theory of
    knowledge on the domain of which we are trenching perhaps too
    far already in the present context but at all events to conceive
    reality as absolute in the sense of being totally unrelated to
    mind and then to ask is reality so transformed in the very
    process of cognition that the mind cannot possibly apprehend it or
    represent it as it really isthis certainly is to misconceive and
    misstate in a hopeless fashion the main problem of epistemology
88 analysis of the concept of relationrelation is one of those ultimate
concepts which does not admit of definition proper and like other
ultimate concepts it is familiar to all two lines each measuring a yard
are equal to each other in length equality is a quantitative
relation the number 2 is half of 4 and 4 is twice 2 half and
double express each a quantitative relation of inequality if two
twin brothers are like each other we have the qualitative relation of
resemblance or similarity if a negro and a european are unlike each
other we have the qualitative relation of dissimilarity the steam of
the locomotive moves the train a relation of efficient causality of
efficient cause to effect the human eye is adapted to the function of
seeing a relation of purpose or finality of means to end and so on
the objective concept of relation thus establishes a conceptual unity
between a pair of things in the domain of some other category like
quantity quality actio and passio etc it is an ultimate mode of
reality as apprehended through human experience but while the reality of
the other accidentcategories appertains to substances considered
absolutely or in isolation from one another the reality of this category
which we call relation appertains indivisibly to two or more together
so that when one of these is taken or considered apart from the other or
others the relation formally disappears each of the other absolute
accidents is formally something aliquid  whereas the formal
function of relation is to refer something to something else ad
aliquid   the other accidents formally inhere in a subject
habent esse in subjecto relation considered formally as such does
not inhere in a subject but gives the latter a respect or bearing or
reference or ordination to or towards something else relatio dat
subjecto respectum vel esse ad aliquid aliud the length of each of two
lines is an absolute accident of that line but the relation of
equality or inequality is intelligible only of both together destroy one
line and the relation is destroyed though the other line retains its
length absolutely and unaltered and so of the other examples just given
relation then considered formally as such is not an absolute accident
inhering in a subject but is a reference of this subject to some other
thing this latter being called the term of the relation hence relation
is described by the scholastics as the ordination or respect or reference
of one thing to another ordo vel respectus vel habitudo unius ad
aliud the relation of a subject to something else as term is formally
not anything absolute aliquid in that subject but merely refers this
subject to something else as term ad aliquid hence aristotles
designation of relation as   ad aliquid to or towards
something we conceive as relations   he says those things
whose very entity itself we regard as being somehow of other things or
to another thing399
to constitute a relation of whatsoever kind three elements or factors are
essential the two extremes of the relation viz the subject of the
relation and the term to which the subject is referred and what is
called the foundation or basis or ground or reason of the relation
fundamentum relationis this latter is the cause or reason on account
of which the subject bears the relation to its term it is always
something absolute in the extremes of the relation hence it follows that
we may regard any relation in two ways either formally as the actual
bond or link of connexion between the extremes or fundamentally ie
as in its cause or foundation in these extremes this is expressed
technically by distinguishing between the relation secundum esse in and
secundum esse ad ie between the absolute entity of its foundation
in the subject and the purely relative entity in which the relation itself
formally consists needless to say the latter whatever it is does not
add any absolute entity to that of either extreme but in what does this
relative entity itself consist before attempting an answer to this
question we must endeavour to distinguish in the next section 89
between purely logical relations and relations which are in some true
sense real here we may note certain corollaries from the concept of
relation as just analysed
realities of which the objective concept of relation is verified derive
from this latter certain properties or special characteristics the
first of these is reciprocity two related extremes are as such
intelligible only in reference to each other father to son half to
double like to like etc and vice versa correlativa se invicem
connotant the second is that things related to one another are
collateral or concomitant in nature correlativa sunt simul natura
neither related extreme is as such naturally prior to the other this is
to be understood of the relation only in its formal aspect not
fundamentally fundamentally or materialiter the cause for instance is
naturally prior to its effect the third is that related things are
concomitant logically or in the order of knowledge correlativa sunt
simul cognitione a reality can be known and defined as relative to
another reality only by the simultaneous cognition of both extremes of the
relation
89 logical relationslogical relations are those which are created by
our own thought and which can have no being other than the being which
they have in and for our thought that there are such relations which
are the exclusive product of our thoughtactivity is universally
admitted the mind can reflect on its own direct concepts it can compare
and coordinate and subordinate them among themselves it thus forms ideas
of relations between those concepts ideas which the scholastics call
reflex or logical ideas or secund intentiones mentis these
relations are entia rationis purely logical relations such for
instance are the relations of genus to species of predicate to
subject the relations described in logic as the prdicabilia moreover
we can compare our direct universal concepts with the individual realities
they represent and see that this feature or mode of universality in the
concept its intentio universalitatis is a logical relation of the
concept to the reality which it represents a logical relation inasmuch
as its subject the concept and its foundation the abstractness of
the concept are in themselves pure products of our thoughtactivity
furthermore we are forced by the imperfection of the thoughtprocesses
whereby we apprehend realityconception of abstract ideas limitation
of concepts in extension and intension affirmation and negation
etcto apprehend conceptual limitations negations comparisons etc
in a word all logical entities as if they were realities or after
the manner of realities ie to conceive what is really nothing as if
it were really something to conceive the nonens as if it were an
ens to conceive it per modum entis 3 and when we compare these
logical entities with one another or with real entities the relations
thus established by our thought are all logical relations finally it
follows from this same imperfection in our human modes of thought that we
sometimes understand things only by attributing to these certain logical
relations ie relations which affect not the reality of these things
their esse reale but only the mode of their presence in our minds
their esse ideale 4
    in view of the distinction between logical relations and those we
    shall presently describe as real relations and especially in view
    of the prevalent tendency in modern philosophy to regard all
    relations as merely logical it would be desirable to classify
    logical relations and to indicate the ways in which they are
    created by or result from our thoughtprocesses we know of no
    more satisfactory analysis than that accomplished by st thomas
    aquinas in various parts of his many monumental and enduring
    works in his commentaries on the sentences400 he enumerates
    four ways in which logical relations arise from our
    thoughtprocesses in his quaestiones disputatae401 he reduces
    these to two some logical relations he says are invented by the
    intellect reflecting on its own concepts and are attributed to
    these concepts others arise from the fact that the intellect can
    understand things only by relating grouping classifying them
    only by introducing among them an arrangement or system of
    relations through which alone it can understand them relations
    which it could only erroneously ascribe to these things as they
    really exist since they are only projected as it were into
    these things by the mind thus though it consciously thinks of
    these things as so related it deliberately abstains from
    asserting that these relations really affect the things
    themselves now the mistake of all those philosophers whether
    ancient medieval or modern who deny that any relations are real
    seems to be that they carry this abstention too far they contend
    that all relations are simply read into the reality by our
    thought that none are in the reality in any true sense
    independently of our thought they thus exaggerate the rle of
    thought as a constitutive factor of known or experienced
    reality and they often do so to such a degree that according to
    their philosophy human thought not merely discovers or knows
    reality but practically constitutes or creates it or at all
    events to such a degree that cognition would be mainly a process
    whereby reality is assimilated to mind and not rather a process
    whereby mind is assimilated to reality against all such idealist
    tendencies in philosophy we assert that not all relations are
    logical that there are some relations which are not mere products
    of thought but which are themselves real
90 real relations their existence vindicateda real relation is one
which is not a mere product of thought but which obtains between real
things independently of our thought for a real relation there must be
a a real individual subject b a real foundation and c
a real individual term really distinct from the subject if the
subject of the relation or its foundation be not real but a mere ens
rationis obviously the relation cannot be more than logical if
moreover the term be not a really distinct entity from the subject then
the relation can be nothing more than a mental comparison of some thing
with itself either under the same aspect or under mentally distinct
aspects a relation is real in the fullest sense when the extremes are
mutually related in virtue of a foundation really existing in both
hence st thomas definition of a real relation as a connexion between
some two things in virtue of something really found in both habitudo
inter aliqua duo secundum aliquid realiter conveniens utrique402
now the question are there in the real world among the things which make
up the universe of our experience relations which are not merely logical
which are not a mere product of our thoughtcan admit of only one
reasonable answer that there are relations which are in some true sense
real and independent of our thoughtactivity must be apparent to everyone
whose mental outlook on things has not been warped by the specious
sophistries of some form or other of subjective idealism for ex
professo refutations of idealist theories the student must consult
treatises on the theory of knowledge a few considerations on the
present point will be sufficiently convincing here
first then let us appeal to the familiar examples mentioned above are
not two lines each a yard long really equal in length whether we know
it or not is not a line a yard long really greater than another line a
foot in length whether we know it or not surely our thought does not
create but discovers the equality or inequality the twin brothers
really resemble each other even when no one is thinking of this
resemblance the resemblance is there whether anyone adverts to it or not
the motion of the train really depends on the force of the steam it is
not our thought that produces this relation of dependence the eye is
really so constructed as to perceive light and the light is really such
by nature as to arouse the sensation of vision surely it is not our
thought that produces this relation of mutual adaptation in these
realities such relations are therefore in some true sense real and
independent of our thought unless indeed we are prepared to say with
idealists that the lines the brothers the train the steam the eye and
the lightin a word that not merely relations but all accidents and
substances all realitiesare mere products of thought ideas states of
consciousness
again order is but a system of relations of coordination and
subordination between really distinct things but there is real order in
the universe and therefore there are real relations in the universe
there is real order in the universe in the physical universe do we not
experience a real subordination of effects to causes a real adaptation of
means to ends and in the moral universe is not this still more apparent
the domestic society the family is not merely an aggregate of
individuals any one of whom we may designate indiscriminately husband or
wife father or mother brother or sister these relations of order are
real they are obviously not the product of our thought not produced by
it but only discovered apprehended by it
it is a profound truth that not all the reality of the universe which
presents itself to the human mind for analysis and interpretation not
all the reality of this universe is to be found in the mere sumtotal of
the individual entities that constitute it considering these entities
each absolutely and in isolation from the others nor does all its real
perfection consist in the mere sumtotal of the absolute perfections
intrinsic to and inherent in those various individual entities over and
above these individual entities and their absolute perfections there is a
domain of reality and of real perfections consisting in the real
adaptation interaction interdependence arrangement
coordination and subordination of those absolute entities and
perfections among themselves and if we realize this profound truth403
we shall have no difficulty in recognizing that while the
thoughtprocesses whereby we interpret this universe produce logical
relations which we utilize in this interpretation there is also in this
universe itself a system of relations which are real which are not
invented but are merely detected by our minds
according to idealists relation is a subjective category of the mind it
belongs to phenomena only on the introduction of the latter into the
understanding laws no more exist in phenomena writes kant404 than
phenomena exist in themselves the former are relative to the subject in
which the phenomena inhere in so far as this subject is endowed with
understanding just as the latter are relative to this same subject in so
far as it is endowed with sensibility this is ambiguous and misleading
of course laws or any other relations do not exist for us are not
known by us are not brought into relation to our understanding as
long as we do not consciously grasp the two terms and the foundation on
which the law or any other relation rests but there are relations whose
terms and foundations are anterior to and independent of our thought
and which consequently are not a product of thought
sensations or other feelings being given writes j s mill405
succession and simultaneousness are the two conditions to the alternative
of which they are subjected by the nature of our faculties but as m
boirac pertinently asks406 why do we apply in any particular case the
one alternative of the twofaced category rather than the other is it not
because in every case the concrete application made by our faculties is
determined by the objects themselves by an objective and real foundation
of the relation
91 mutual and mixed relations transcendental relationsthere are then
relations which are in some true sense real but in what does the reality
of a real relation consist before answering this question we must examine
the main classes of real relations
we have already referred to the mutual relation as one which has a real
foundation in both of the extremes such as the relation between father
and son or between a greater and a lesser quantity or between two equal
quantities or between two similar people407 such a relation is called
a relatio aequiperantiae a relation of the same denomination if it
has the same name on both sides as equalequal similarsimilar
friendfriend etc it is called a relatio disquiperantiae of
different denomination if it has a different name indicating a
different kind of relation on either side as fatherson
causeeffect masterservant etc
distinct from this is the nonmutual or mixed relation which has a
real foundation only in one extreme so that the relation of this to the
other extreme is real while the relation of the latter to the former is
only logical408 for instance the relation of every creature to the
creator is a real relation for the essential dependence of the creature
on the creator is a relation grounded in the very nature of the creature
as a contingent being but the relation of the creator to the creature is
only logical for the creative act on which it is grounded implies in the
creator no reality distinct from his substance which substance has no
necessary relation to any creature similarly the relation of the
finite knowing mind to the known object is a real relation for it is
grounded in a new quality viz knowledge whereby the mind is
perfected but the relation of the object to the mind is not a real
relation for by becoming actually known the object itself does not
undergo any real change or acquire any new reality or perfection we have
seen already 42 50 that all reality has a transcendental or
essential relation to intellect and to will ontological truth and
ontological goodness these relations of reality to the divine intellect
and will are formally or actually verified in all things whereas the
transcendental truth and goodness of any thing in regard to any created
intellect and will are formal or actual only when that thing is actually
known and willed by such created faculties the relations of a thing to a
mind that does not actually know and desire that thing are only
fundamental or potential truth and goodness this brings us to a
second great division of relations into essential or transcendental
and accidental or predicamental
an essential or transcendental relation is one which is involved in the
very essence itself of the related thing it enters into and is
inseparable from the concept of the latter thus in the concept of the
creature as such there is involved an essential relation of the
latters dependence on the creator so too every individual reality
involves essential relations of identity with itself and distinction
from other things and essential relations of truth and goodness to
the divine mind and created minds knowledge involves an essential
relation to a known object accidents involve the essential relation of
an aptitude to inhere in substances actio involves an essential
relation to an agens and passio to a patiens matter to form and
form to matter and so on in general wherever any subject has an
intrinsic and essential exigence or aptitude or inclination whereby there
is established a connexion of this subject with or a reference to
something else an ordination or ordo to something else there we have
an essential relation409 such a relation is termed transcendental
because it can be verified of a subject in any category and since it
adds nothing real to its subject it does not of itself constitute any new
category of real being like the logical relation it is referred to here
in order to bring out by way of contrast the accidental or predicamental
relation which is the proper subjectmatter of the present chapter
92 predicamental relations their foundations and divisionsan
accidental or predicamental relation is one which is not essential to the
related subject but superadded to and separable from the latter such
for instance are relations of equality or inequality similarity or
dissimilarity it is not involved in the nature of the subject itself but
is superinduced on the latter by reason of some real foundation really
distinct from the nature of this subject its sole function is to refer
the subject to the term while the essential or transcendental relation is
rather an intrinsic attribute or aptitude of the nature itself as a
principle of action or an effect of action the real accidental relation
is the one which aristotle placed in a category apart as one of the
ultimate accidental modes of real being hence it is called a
predicamental relation what are its principal subclasses
real relations are divided according to the nature of their foundations
but some relations are real ex utraque partemutual relations while
others are real only on the sidemixed relations moreover some real
relations are transcendental others predicamental aristotle in assigning
three distinct grounds of predicamental relations seems to have included
some relations that are transcendental410 he distinguishes411 a
relations grounded in unity and multitude b relations grounded in
efficient causality and c relations grounded in commensuration
a by unity and multitude he is commonly interpreted to mean identity
or diversity not merely in quantity but in any formal factor and
therefore also in quality and in nature or substance things that
are one in quantity we term equal one in quality similar one in
substance identical and if they are not one in these respects we call
them unequal dissimilar distinct or diverse respectively about
quantity as a foundation for real predicamental relations there can be no
difficulty indeed it is in a certain sense implied in all relationsat
least as apprehended by the human mind for we apprehend relations of
whatsoever kind by mental comparison and this involves the consciousness
of number or plurality of two things compared412 and when we
compare things on the basis of any quality we do so only by
distinguishing and measuring intensive grades in this quality after the
analogy of extensive or quantitative measurement 80 nevertheless
just as quality is a distinct accident irreducible to quantity 77 so
are relations based on quality different from those based on quantity but
what about substance or nature as a foundation of predicamental
relations for these as distinct from transcendental relations some
accident really distinct from the substance seems to be required the
substantial individual identity of any real being with itself is only a
logical relation for there are not two really distinct extremes the
specific identity of john with james in virtue of their common human
nature is a real relation but it would appear to be transcendental413
the relation of the real john and the real james to our knowledge of them
is the transcendental relation of any reality to knowledge the relation
of ontological truth this relation is essentially actual in regard to
the divine mind but only potential and accidentally actual in regard
to any created mind 42 the relation of real distinction between two
individual substances is a real but transcendental relation grounded in
the transcendental attribute of oneness which characterizes every real
being 26 27
b efficient causality actio et passio can undoubtedly be the
ground of real predicamental relations if the action is transitive414
the patiens or recipient of the real change acquires by this latter the
basis of a relation of real dependence on the cause or agens again if
the action provokes reaction so that there is real interaction each
agens being also patiens there arises a mutual predicamental relation
of interdependence between the two agencies furthermore if the agent
itself is in any way really perfected by the action there arises a real
predicamental relation which is mutual not merely a real relation of
effect to agent but also of agent to effect this is true in all cases of
what scholastics call univocal as distinct from equivocal causation
of the former in which the agent produces an effect like in nature to
itself the propagation of their species by living things is the great
example here not only is the relation of offspring to parents a real
relation but that of parents to offspring is also a real relation and
this real relation is permanent because it is grounded not merely in the
transient generative processes but in some real and abiding result of
these processeseither some physical disposition in the parents
themselves415 or some specific perfection attributed by extrinsic
denomination to the individual parents the parents are in a sense
continued in their offspring generation really perpetuates the species
the specific nature and in this sense may be said to perfect the
individual parents416 in cases of equivocal causationie where
the effect is different in nature from the cause as when a man builds a
housethe agent does not so clearly benefit by the action so that in such
cases while the relation of the effect to the cause is real some authors
would regard that of the cause to the effect as logical417 when
however we remember that the efficient activity of all created causes
is necessarily dependent on the divine concursus and necessarily
involves change in the created cause itself we can regard this change
as in all cases the ground of a real relation of the created cause to its
effect but the creating and conserving activity of the divine being
cannot ground a real relation of the latter to creatures because the
divine being is pure and unchangeable actuality acquiring no new
perfection and undergoing no real change by such activity418
c by commensuration as a basis of real relations aristotle does not
mean quantitative measurement but the determination of the perfection of
one reality by its being essentially conformed to and regulated by
another as the perfection of knowledge or science for instance is
determined by the perfection of its object this sort of commensuration
or essential ordination of one reality to another is obviously the basis
of transcendental relations some authors would consider that besides
the transcendental relation of science to its object a relation which is
independent of the actual existence of the latter there also exists an
accidental relation in science to its object as long as this latter is in
actual existence but rather it should be said that just as the
transcendental truthrelation of any real object to intellect is
fundamental potential or formal actual according as this intellect
merely can know this object or actually does know it so also the
transcendental relation of knowledge to its object is fundamental or
formal according as this object is merely possible or actually existing
we gather from the foregoing analysis that the three main classes of
predicamental relations are those based on quantity quality and
causality respectively
93 in what does the reality of predicamental relations consistwe have
seen that not all relations are purely logical there are real relations
and of these some are not merely aspects of the other categories of real
being not merely transcendental attributes virtually distinct from but
really identical with these other absolute modes of real being which we
designate as substance quantity quality cause effect etc
there are real relations which form a distinct accidental mode of real
being and so constitute a category apart the fact however that these
predicamental relations have been placed by aristotle and his followers in
a category apart does not of itself prove that the predicamental relation
is a special reality sui generis really and adequately distinct from
the realities which constitute the other categories 60 if the
predicamental relation be not a purely logical entity if it be an ens
rationis cum fundamento in re or in other words if the object of our
concept of predicamental relation has a foundation in reality eg
like the concepts of space and time then it may reasonably be placed
in a category apart even although it may not be itself formally a
reality we have therefore to see whether or not the predicamental
relation is or embodies any mode of real being adequately distinct from
these modes which constitute the other categories
the predicamental relation is real in the sense that it implies in
addition to two really distinct extremes a real foundation in one or both
of these extremes a real accident such as quantity quality or
causality that is to say considered in its foundation or cause
considered fundamentally or secundum suum esse in subjecto the
predicamental relation is real inasmuch as its foundation is a reality
independently of the consideration of the mind no doubt if the
predicamental relation adequately considered implies no other reality
than that of its foundation and terms then the predicamental relation
does not contain any special reality sui generis distinct from
substances quality quantity and other such absolute modes of real
being this however does not prevent its ranking as a distinct category
provided it adds a virtually distinct and altogether peculiar aspect to
those absolute realities now considered adequately the predicamental
relation adds to the reality it has in its foundation the actual
reference of subject to term in fact it is in this reference of subject
to term this esse ad that the relation formally consists the
question therefore may be stated thus is this formal relation of subject
to term this esse ad a real entity sui generis really distinct
from the absolute entities of subject term and foundation and in
contradistinction to these and all absolute entities a relative entity
actually existing in the real universe independently of our thought or is
it on the contrary itself formally a mere product of our thought a
product of the mental act of comparison an ens rationis an aspect
superadded by our minds to the extremes compared and to the foundation in
virtue of which we compare them
a good many scholastics and some of them men of great name419 have
espoused the former alternative considering that the reality of the
predicamental relation cannot be vindicatedagainst idealists who would
reduce all relations to mere logical entitiesotherwise than by according
to the relation considered formally ie secundum suum esse ad
an entity in the actual order of things independent of our thought adding
as an argument that if relation formally as such is anything at all if
all relation be not a mere mental fabrication it is essentially a
relative entity and that manifestly a relative entity cannot be
really identical with any absolute entity and they claim for this view
the authority of st thomas420
the great majority of scholastics however espouse the second
alternative that the relation considered formally secundum esse
ad is a product of our mental comparison of subject with term it is
not itself a real entity or a real mode superadded to the reality of
extremes and foundation
in the first place there is no need to suppose the reality of such a
relative entity entia non sunt multiplicanda prter necessitatem it is
an abuse of realism to suppose that the formal element of a relation
its esse ad is a distinct and separate reality the reality of the
praedicamental relation is safeguarded without any such postulate since
the predicamental relation considered adequately ie not merely
formally but fundamentally not merely secundum esse ad but secundum
esse in involves as its foundation an absolute accident which is real
independently of our thought the predicamental relation is not a mere
ens rationis it has a foundation in reality it is an ens rationis cum
fundamento in re this is a sufficient counterassertion to idealism and
a sufficient reason for treating relation as a distinct category of real
being
that there is no need for such a relative entity will be manifest if we
consider the simple case of two bars of iron each a yard long the length
of each is an absolute accident of each the length of either considered
absolutely and in itself is not formally the equality of this with the
other nor are both lengths considered separately the formal relation of
equality but both considered together are the adequate foundation of this
formal relation both considered together are this relation potentially
fundamentally so that all that is needed for the actual formal
relation of equality is the mental apprehension of the two lengths
together the mental process of comparison is the only thing required to
make the potential relation actual and the product of this mental process
is the formality or esse ad of the relation the actual reference of
the extremes to each other besides the absolute accidents which
constitute the foundation of the relation something more is required for
the constitution of the adequate predicamental relation this something
more however is a mind capable of comparing the extremes and not any
real entity distinct from extremes and foundation antecedently to the act
of comparison the formally relative element of the relation its esse
ad was not anything actual it was the mere comparability of the
extremes in virtue of the foundation if the esse ad were a separate
real entity a relative entity really distinct from extremes and
foundation what sort of entity could it be being an accident it should
inhere in or be a mode of its subject but if it did it would lose its
formally relative character by becoming an inherent mode of an absolute
reality while to conceive it as an entity astride on both extremes and
bridging or connecting these together would be to substitute the crude
imagery of the imagination for intellectual thought
in the second place if a subject can acquire a relation or lose a
relation without undergoing any real change then the relation
considered formally as such or secundum esse ad cannot be a
reality but a subject can acquire or lose a relation without undergoing
any real change therefore the relation considered formally as distinct
from its foundation and extremes is not a reality
the minor of this argument may be proved by the consideration of a few
simple examples a child already born is neither larger nor smaller than
its brother that will be born two years hence421 but after the birth of
the latter child the former can acquire those relations successively
without any real change in itself and merely by the growth of the
younger child again one white ball a is similar in colour to another
white ball b paint the latter black and eo ipso the former loses its
relation of resemblance without any real change in itself
    and this appears to be the view of st thomas if he writes
    another man becomes equal in size to me by growing while i remain
    unchanged in size then although eo ipso i become equal in size
    to him thus acquiring a new relation nevertheless i gain or
    acquire nothing new nihil advenit mihi de novo per hoc quod
    incipio esse alteri aequalis per ejus mutationem relation he
    says is an extramental reality by reason of its foundation or
    cause whereby one reality is referred to another422 relation
    itself considered formally as distinct from its foundation is
    not a reality it is real only inasmuch as its foundation is
    real423 again relation is something inherent but not formally
    as a relation and hence it can disappear without any real change
    in its subject424 a real relation may be destroyed in one or
    other of two ways either by the destruction or change of the
    foundation in the subject or by the destruction of the term
    entailing the cessation of the reference without any change in
    the subject425 hence too the reason alleged by st thomas
    why relation unlike the other categories of real being can be
    itself divided into logical entity and real entity ens rationis
    and ens reale because formally it is an ens rationis and
    only fundamentally or in virtue of its foundation is it an ens
    reale426 and hence finally the reason why st thomas
    following aristotle describes relation as having a lesser
    reality an esse debilius427 than the other or absolute
    categories of real being not as if it were a sort of diminutive
    entity intermediate between nothingness and the absolute modes of
    reality but because being dependent for its formal actuality not
    merely on a foundation in its subject but also on a term to which
    the latter is referred it can perish not merely by the
    destruction of its subject like other accidents but also by the
    destruction of its term while subject and foundation remain
    unchanged
if then the real relation considered formally or secundum esse ad
is not a reality the relation under this aspect is a logical not a
real accident
to constitute a mutual real relation there is needed a foundation in
both of the extremes as long as the term of the relation does not
actually exist not only does the relation not exist formally and
actually but it is not even adequately potential the foundation in the
subject alone is not an adequate foundation
to this view which denies any distinct reality to the predicamental
relation considered formally it has been objected that the predicamental
relation is thus confounded with the transcendental relation but this is
not so for the transcendental relation is always essential to its
subject whatever this subject may be while the predicamental relation
considered formally is a logical accident separable from its subject and
considered fundamentally it is some absolute accident really distinct from
the substance of the related extremes for instance the action which
mediates between cause and effect is itself transcendentally related to
both while it is at the same time the adequate foundation whereby cause
and effect are predicamentally related to each other428
if what we have called the formal element of a relation be nothing really
distinct from the extremes and foundation it follows that some real
relations between creatures are really identical with their
substances429 and to this it has been objected that no relation in
creatures can be quoad rem substantial nulla relatio says st
thomas430 est substantia secundum rem in creaturis to this it may be
replied that even in these cases the relation itself considered
adequately is not wholly identical with the substance of either extreme
it superadds a separable logical accident to these431
finally it is objected that the view which denies a distinct reality to
the formal element of a real relation to its esse ad equivalently
denies all reality to relations and is therefore in substance identical
with the idealist doctrine already rejected 90 but this is a
misconception according to idealists relations grounded on quality
quantity causality etc are exclusively in the intellect in our mental
activity and its mental products in our concepts alone and are in no
true sense characteristic of reality this is very different from saying
that our concepts of such relations are grounded in the realities
compared and that these realities are really endowed with everything that
constitutes such relations the comparative act of the intellect being
required merely to apprehend these characteristics and so to give the
relation its formal completeness432 there is all the difference that
exists between a theory which so exaggerates the constitutive function of
thought as to reduce all intellectual knowledge to a knowledge of mere
subjective mental appearances and a theory which while recognizing this
function and its products will not allow that these cast any cloud or
veil between the intellect and a genuine insight into objective reality
these mental processes are guided by reality the entia rationis which
are their products are grounded in reality moreover we can quite well
distinguish between these mental modes and products of our intellectual
activity and the real contents revealed to the mind in these modes and
processes so long therefore as we avoid the mistake of ascribing to the
objective reality itself any of these mental modes as for instance
extreme realists do when they assert the extramental reality of the
formal universal our recognition of them can in no way jeopardize the
objective validity of intellectual knowledge perhaps an excessive
timidity in this direction is in some degree accountable for the abuse of
realism which ascribes to the formal element of a relation a distinct
extramental433 objective reality
chapter xiii causality classification of causes
94 traditional concept of causethe modes of real being which we have
been so far examiningsubstance quality quantity relationare modes of
reality considered as static but it was pointed out in an early chapter
ch ii that the universe of our experience is subject to change that
it is ever becoming that it is the scene of a continuous worldprocess
which is apparently regulated by more or less stable principles or laws
these laws and processes constituting the universal order which it is
the duty of the philosopher to study and explain we must now return to
this kinetic and dynamic aspect of reality and investigate the
principles of change in things by a study of causes
as with the names of the other ultimate categories so too here the
general sense of the term cause causa  is familiar to all
while analysis reveals a great variety of modalities of this common
signification we understand by a cause anything which has a positive
influence of any sort on the being or happening of something else in
philosophy this is the meaning which has been attached traditionally to
the term since the days of aristotle though in its presentday scientific
use the term has almost lost this meaning mainly through the influence of
modern phenomenism434 the traditional notion of cause is usually
expounded by comparing it with certain kindred notions principle
condition occasion reason
a principle is that from which anything proceeds in any way
whatsoever435 any sort of intrinsic connexion between two objects of
thought is sufficient to constitute the one a principle of the other
but a mere extrinsic or time sequence is not sufficient a logical
principle is some truth from which further truths are or may be derived
a real principle is some reality from which the being or happening
of something originates and proceeds436 if this procession involves a
real and positive influence of the principle on that which proceeds from
it such a real principle is a cause but there may be a real and
intrinsic connexion without any such influence for instance in the
substantial changes which occur in physical nature the generation of the
new substantial formative principle necessarily presupposes the
privation of the one which antecedently informed the material
principle but this privatio formae has no positive influence on the
generation of the new form it is however the necessary and natural
antecedent to the generation of the latter hence although this privatio
formae is a real principle of substantial change the process or
fieri it is not a cause of the latter the notion of principle even
of real principle is therefore wider than the notion of cause437
a condition in the proper sense of a necessary condition or conditio
sine qua non is something which must be realized or fulfilled before the
event or effect in question can happen or be produced on the side of the
latter there is real dependence but from the side of the former there is
no real and positive influence on the happening of the event the
influence of the condition is negative or if positive it is only
indirect consisting in the removal of some obstacleremovens
probibensto the positive influence of the cause in this precisely a
condition differs from a cause windows for instance are a condition for
the lighting of a room in the daylight but the sun is the cause the
distinction is clear and intelligible nor may it be ignored in a
philosophical analysis of causality at the same time it is easy to
understand that where as in the inductive sciences there is question of
discovering all the antecedents positive and negative of any given
kind of phenomenon in order to bring to light and formulate the law or
laws according to which such phenomenon occurs the distinction between
cause and condition is of minor importance438
an occasion is any circumstance or combination of circumstances
favourable to the action of a free cause for instance a forced sale is
an occasion for buying cheaply night is an occasion of theft bad
companionship is an occasion of sin an occasion has no intrinsic
connexion with the effect as in the case of a principle nor is it
necessary for the production of the effect as in the case of a condition
it is spoken of only in connexion with the action of a free cause and it
differs from a cause in having no positive and direct influence on the
production of the effect it has however a real though indirect
influence on the production of the effect by soliciting and aiding the
determination of the free efficient cause to act in so far as it does
exert such an influence it may be regarded as a partial efficient cause
not a physical but a moral cause of the effect
to ask for the reason of any event or phenomenon or of the nature or
existence of any reality is to demand an explanation of the latter it
is to seek what accounts for the latter what makes this intelligible
to our minds whatever is a cause is therefore also a reason but the
latter notion is wider than the former whatever explains a truth is a
logical reason of the latter but since all truths are concerned with
realities they must have ultimately real reasons ie explanatory
principles inherent in the realities themselves the knowledge of these
real or ontological principles of things is the logical reason of our
understanding of the things themselves but the ontological principles
which are the real reasons of the things are wider in extent than the
causes of these things for they include principles that are not causes
furthermore the grades of reality which we discover in things by the
activity of abstract thought and whereby we compare classify and define
those things we apprehend as explanatory principles of the latter and
these principles though really in the things and therefore real
reasons are not causes
thus life is a real reason though not a cause of sensibility in the
animal organism the souls independence of matter in its mode of
existence is a real reason though not a cause of its spiritual
activities hence between a reason and that which it accounts for there
may be only a logical distinction while between a cause and that which it
causes there must be a real distinction 38
to understand all the intrinsic principles which constitute the essence
of anything is to know the sufficient reason of its reality to
understand all the extrinsic principles which account for its actual
existence is to know the sufficient reason of its existence and to
understand this latter adequately is to realize that the thing depends
ultimately for its actual existence on a reality or being which
necessarily exists by virtue of its own essence
    what has been called the principle of sufficient reason asserts
    when applied to reality that every existing reality must have a
    sufficient reason for existing and for being what it is439
    unlike the principle of causality which is an axiomatic or
    selfevident truth this principle is rather a necessary postulate
    of all knowledge an assumption that reality is intelligible it
    does not mean that all reality or even any single finite reality
    is adequately intelligible to our finite minds in the words of
    bossuet we do not know everything about anything nous ne savons
    le tout de rien
    in regard to contingent essences if these be composite we can
    find a sufficient reason why they are such in their constitutive
    principles but in regard to simple essences or to the simple
    constitutive principles of composite essences we can find no
    sufficient reason why they are such in anything even logically
    distinct from themselves they are what they are because they are
    what they are and to demand why they are what they are is as
    aristotle remarked to ask an idle question at the same time
    when we have convinced ourselves that their actual existence
    involves the existence of a supreme selfexistent intelligent
    being we can see that the essence of this being is the ultimate
    ground of the intrinsic possibility of all finite essences 20
    in regard to contingent existences the principle of sufficient
    reason is coincident with the principle of causality inasmuch as
    the sufficient reason of the actual existence of any contingent
    thing consists in the extrinsic real principles which are its
    causes the existence of contingent things involves the existence
    of a necessary being we may say that the sufficient reason for
    the existence of the necessary being is the divine essence itself
    but this is merely denying that there is outside this being any
    sufficient reason ie any cause of the latters existence it
    is the recognition that the principle of causality is inapplicable
    to the necessary being the principle of sufficient reason in
    this application of it is logically posterior to the principle of
    causality440
95 classification of causes aristotles fourfold divisionin modern
times many scientists and philosophers have thought it possible to explain
the order and course of nature the whole cosmic process and the entire
universe of our experience by an appeal to the operation of efficient
causes espousing a mechanical as opposed to a teleological conception
of the universe they have denied or ignored all influence of purpose
and eschewed all study of final causes furthermore misconceiving or
neglecting the category of substance and the doctrine of substantial
change they find no place in their speculations for any consideration of
formal and material causes yet without final formal and material
causes so fully analysed by aristotle441 and the scholastics no
satisfactory explanation of the world of our experience can possibly be
found let us therefore commence by outlining the traditional fourfold
division of causes
we have seen already that change involves composition or compositeness in
the thing that is subject to change hence two intrinsic principles
contribute to the constitution of such a thing the one a passive
determinable principle its material cause the other an active
determining principle its formal cause some changes in material things
are superficial not reaching to the substance itself of the thing these
are accidental involving the union of some accidental form with the
concrete preexisting substance as material materia secunda
others are more profound changes of the substance itself these are
substantial involving the union of a new substantial form with the
primal material principal materia prima of the substance
undergoing the change but whether the change be substantial or accidental
we can always distinguish in the resulting composite thing two intrinsic
constitutive principles its formal cause and its material cause the
agencies in nature which by their activity bring about change are
efficient causes finally since it is an undeniable fact that there is
order in the universe that its processes give evidence of regularity
of operation according to law that the cosmos reveals a harmonious
coordination of manifold agencies and a subordination of means to
ends it follows that there must be working in and through all nature a
directive principle a principle of plan or design a principle according
to which those manifold agencies work together in fulfilment of a purpose
for the attainment of ends hence the reality of a fourth class of
causes final causes
the separate influence of each of those four kinds of cause can be clearly
illustrated by reference to the production of any work of art when for
instance a sculptor chisels a statue from a block of marble the latter
is the material cause materia secunda of the statue the form which he
induces on it by his labour is the formal cause forma accidentalis
the sculptor himself as agent is the efficient cause and the motive from
which he worksmoney fame esthetic pleasure etcis the final cause
the formal and material causes are intrinsic to the effect they
constitute the effect in facto esse the distinction of each from the
latter being an inadequate real distinction it is not so usual nowadays
to call these intrinsic constitutive principles of things causes of the
latter but they verify the general definition of cause the other two
causes the efficient and the final are extrinsic to the effect and
really and adequately distinct from it442 extrinsic principles of its
production its fieri
this classification of causes is adequate443 it answers all the
questions that can be asked in explanation of the production of any
effect a quo ex quo per quid propter quid nor is there any
sort of cause which cannot be brought under some one or other of those
four heads what is called an exemplar cause causa exemplaris ie
the ideal or model or plan in the mind of an intelligent agent according
to which he aims and strives to execute his work may be regarded as an
extrinsic formal cause or again in so far as it aids and equips the
agent for his task an efficient cause or again in so far as it
represents a good to be realized a final cause444
the objects of our knowledge are in a true sense causes of our knowledge
any such object may be regarded as an efficient cause both physical and
moral of this knowledge in so far as by its action on our minds it
determines the activity of our cognitive faculties or again as a final
cause inasmuch as it is the end and aim of the knowledge
the essence of the soul is as we have seen 69 not exactly an efficient
cause of the faculties which are its properties but it is their final
cause inasmuch as their raison dtre is to perfect it and their
subjective or material cause inasmuch as it is the seat and support of
these faculties
the fourfold division is analogical not univocal though the matter the
form the agent and the end or purpose all contribute positively to the
production of the effect it is clear that the character of the causal
influence is widely different in each case
again its members do not demand distinct subjects all four classes of
cause may be verified in the same subject for instance the human soul is
a formal cause in regard to the composite human individual a material
cause in regard to its habits an efficient cause in regard to its acts
and a final cause in regard to its faculties
furthermore the fourfold division is not an immediate division for it
follows the division of cause in general into intrinsic and extrinsic
causes finally it is a division of the causes which we find to be
operative in the universe but the philosophical study of the universe
will lead us gradually to the conviction that itself and all the causes in
it are themselves contingent themselves caused by and dependent on a
cause outside or extrinsic to the universe a first uncaused
uncreated selfexistent necessary cause causa prima
increata at once the efficient and final cause of all things in
contrast with this uncreated first cause all the other causes we
have now to investigate are called created or second causes causae
secundae creatae
a cause may be either total adequate or partial inadequate
according as the effect is due to its influence solely or to its
influence in conjunction with or dependence on the influence of some
other cause or causes of the same order a created cause therefore is
a total cause if the effect is due to its influence independently of other
created causes though of course all created causes are dependent both as
to their existence and as to their causality on the influence of the
first cause without the activity of created efficient and final causes
the first cause can accomplish directly whatever these can
accomplishexcept their very causality itself which cannot be actualized
without them but for which he can supply eminenter similarly while it
is incompatible with his infinite perfection that he discharge the
function of material or formal cause of finite composite things he can
immediately create these latter by the simultaneous production ex
nihilo and union of their material and formal principles
a cause is said to be in actu secundo when it is actually exercising its
causal influence antecedently to such exercise at least prioritate
naturae it is said to be in actu primo when it has the expedite power
to discharge its function as cause it is in actu primo proximo while if
its power is in any way incomplete hampered or unready it is in actu
primo remoto
many other divisions of cause subordinate to the aristotelian division
will be explained in connexion with the members of this latter
96 material and formal causesthese are properly subjectmatter for
cosmology we will therefore very briefly supplement what has been said
already concerning them in connexion with the doctrine of change ch
ii by a material cause we mean that out of which anything is made
id ex quo aliquid fit matter is correlative with form from the union
of these there results a composite reality endowed with either essential
or accidental unitywith the former if the material principle be
absolutely indeterminate and the correlative form substantial with the
latter if the material principle be some actually existing individual
reality and the form some supervening accident properly speaking only
corporeal substances have material causes445 but the term material
cause is used in an extended sense to signify any potential passive
receptive subject of formative or actuating principles thus the soul is
the subjective or material cause of its faculties and habits essence of
existence genus of differentia etc
in what does the positive causal influence of a material cause consist
how does it contribute positively to the actualization of the composite
reality of which it is the material cause it receives and unites with
the form which is educed from its potentiality by the action of efficient
causes and thus contributes to the generation of the concrete composite
individual reality446
it is by reason of the causality of the formal cause that we speak of a
thing being formally such or such as correlative of material cause it
finds its proper application in reference to the constitution of corporeal
things the formative principle called forma substantialis which
actuates determines specifies the material principle and by union with
the latter constitutes an individual corporeal substance of a definite
kind is the substantial formal cause of this composite substance447
the material principle of corporeal things is of itself indifferent to any
species of body it is the form that removes this indefiniteness and
determines the matter by its union with the latter to constitute a
definite type of corporeal substance448 the existence of different
species of living organisms and different types of inorganic matter in the
universe implies in the constitution of these things a common material
principle materia prima and a multiplicity of differentiating
specifying formative principles formae substantiales that the
distinction between these two principles in the constitution of any
individual corporeal substance whether living or inorganic is not merely
a virtual distinction between metaphysical generic and specific grades
of being in the individual but a real distinction between separable
entities is a scholastic thesis established in the special metaphysics of
the organic and inorganic domains of the universe449
since the form is a perfecting actuating principle the term is often
used synonymously with actus actuality and since besides the
essential perfection which a being has by virtue of its substantial form
it may have accidental perfections by reason of supervening accidental
forms these too are formal causes
in what does the causal influence of the formal cause consist in
communicating itself intrinsically to the material principle or passive
subject from whose potentiality it is evoked by the action of efficient
causes in actuating that potentiality by intrinsic union therewith and
thus determining the individual subject to be actually or formally an
individual of such or such a kind
the material and formal causes are intrinsic principles of the
constitution of things we next pass to an analysis of the two extrinsic
causes and firstly of the efficient cause and its causality
97 efficient cause traditional concept explainedby efficient cause we
understand that by which anything takes place happens occurs id a
quo aliquid fit the world of our external and internal experience is the
scene of incessant changes men and things not only are but are
constantly becoming now every such change is originated by some active
principle and this we call the efficient cause of the change aristotle
called it   or    the kinetic or moving
principle or again       principium motus
vel mutationis in alio the principle of motion or change in some other
thing the result achieved by this change the actualized potentiality
is called the effect the causality itself of the efficient cause is
called action  motion changeand from the point of view
of the effect passio  the perfection or endowment whereby an
efficient cause acts ie its efficiency  is called active
power potentia seu virtus activa it is also called force or
potential energy in reference to inanimate agents faculty in
reference to animate agents especially men and animals this active power
of an efficient cause or agent is to be carefully distinguished from the
passive potentiality acted upon and undergoing change the former
connotes a perfection the latter an imperfection unumquodque agit
inquantum est in actu patitur vero inquantum est in potentia the scope
of the active power of a cause is the measure of its actuality of its
perfection in the scale of reality while the extent of the passive
potentiality of patiens is a measure of its relative imperfection the
actuation of the former is actio that of the latter passio the point
of ontological connexion of the two potentiae is the change motus
 this being at once the formal perfecting of the passive
potentiality in the patiens or effect and the immediate term of the
efficiency or active power of the agens or cause actio and passio
therefore are not expressions of one and the same concept they express
two distinct concepts of one and the same reality viz the change
actio et passio sunt idem numero motus this change takes place
formally in the subject upon which the efficient cause acts for it is
an actuation of the potentiality of the former under the influence of the
latter          considered in
the potentiality of this subject    hujus in hococit
is called passio considered as a term of the active power of the
cause   hujus per hocit is called actio
the fact that actio and passio are really and objectively one and the
same motus does not militate against their being regarded as two
separate supreme categories for they are objects of distinct
concepts450 and this is sufficient to constitute them distinct
categories 60
doubts are sometimes raised as st thomas remarks451 about the
assertion that the action of an agent is not formally in the latter but in
the patiens actio fit in passo it is clear however he continues
that the action is formally in the patiens for it is the actuation not
of any potentiality of the agent but of the passive potentiality of the
patiens it is in the latter that the motus or change which is both
actio and passio takes place dependently of course on the influence
of the agent or efficient cause of the change the active power of an
efficient cause is an index of the latters actuality the exercise of
this power ie action does not formally perfect the agent for it
is not an actuation of any passive potentiality of the latter it formally
perfects the patiens only immanent action perfects the agent and
then not as agent but as patiens or receiver of the actuality effected
by the action cf 103 infra
we may then define efficient cause as the extrinsic principle of the
change or production of anything by means of action principium
extrinsicum a quo fluit motus vel productio rei mediante actione
it is a first principle as compared with material and formal causes for
its influence is obviously prior in nature to theirs also as compared
with the other extrinsic cause the final cause in ordine executionis
not however in ordine intentionis the end not as realized but as
realizable not in execution but in intention discharges its function and
exerts its influence as final cause and in this order the final cause
as will appear later is the first of all causes finis est ultimus in
executione sed primus in intentione
change or production in the definition is to be understood not in the
strict sense in which it presupposes an existing subject or material but
in the wide sense in which it includes any production of new reality even
creation or production ex nihilo
action too is to be understood in the wide sense in which it includes
the action of the first cause which action is really identical with the
essence of the latter we conceive creation after the analogy of the
efficient action of created or second causes we have no proper
concept of the infinite perfection of the divine activity in all created
efficient causes not only is the action itself but also the efficiency
force power faculty which is its proximate principle really distinct
from the nature or essence of the agent the former is a substance the
latter an accident
finally the action of a created efficient cause is either transitive
transiens or immanent immanens according as the change wrought by
the action takes place in something else as when the sun heats or
lights the earth or in the cause itself as when a man reasons or
wills in the former case the action perfects not the agent but the other
thing the patiens in the latter case it perfects the agent itself
agens and patiens being here the same identical concrete
individual452
98 some scholia on causation the principle of causalitybefore
enumerating the principal kinds of efficient cause and analysing the
nature of efficient causality we may set down here certain selfevident
axioms and aphorisms concerning causation in general a the most
important of these is the principle of causality which has been
enunciated in a variety of ways whatever happens has a cause whatever
begins to be has a cause whatever is contingent has a cause nothing
occurs without a cause not everything that begins to be has necessarily
a material cause or a formal cause really distinct from itself for
instance simple spiritual beings like the human soul have no material
cause nor any formal cause or constitutive principle distinct from their
essence similarly the whole universe having been created ex nihilo
had no preexisting material cause all the material beings however
which are produced generated brought into actual existence in the course
of the incessant changes which characterize the physical universe have
both material and formal causes but the principle of causality refers
mainly to extrinsic causes it is commonly understood only of efficient
causes and only in regard to these is it selfevident we shall see that
as a matter of fact nothing happens without a final cause that
intelligent purpose pervades reality through and through this however
is a conclusion not a principle what is really a selfevident
axiomatic necessary principle is that whatever happens has an efficient
cause only the necessary selfexisting eternal being has the
sufficient reason of his actual existence in himself in his own essence
that any being which is contingent could exist independently of some
other actual being as the cause of this existence that it could have
come into existence or begun to exist from absolute nothingness or be
produced or brought into actual existence without any actual being to
produce it or that once existing and subject to change it could
undergo change and have its potentialities actualized without any actual
being to cause such change 10all this is positively unthinkable and
absolutely repugnant to our intelligence all this our reason peremptorily
declares to be intrinsically impossible nor is there question of a mere
psychological inconceivability such as might be due to a longcontinued
custom of associating the idea of a beginning with the idea of a cause
of this beginningas phenomenists generally contend453 there is
question of an impossibility which our reason categorically dictates to be
a real ontological impossibility the principle of causality is therefore
a necessary a priori selfevident principle
b every effect must have an adequate efficient cause ie a cause
sufficiently perfect sufficiently high on the scale of being to have the
active power to produce the effect in question otherwise the effect would
be partially uncaused which is impossible
c an effect cannot as such be actually more perfect than its adequate
created cause the reason is that the effect as such is really
dependent for its actuality on its adequate created cause it derives its
actuality from the latter now it is inconceivable that an agent could be
the active productive principle of a greater perfection a higher grade
of actuality than itself possesses whatever be the nature of efficient
causality actio and passio 102 or of the dependence of the
produced actuality upon the active power of its adequate efficient cause
10 the reality of this dependence forbids us to think that in the
natural order of efficient causation a higher grade of reality can be
actualized than the agent is capable of actualizing or that the agent can
naturally actualize a higher or more perfect grade of reality than is
actually its own we must however bear in mind that there is question of
the adequate created cause of an effect and that to account fully for
the actualization of any potential reality whatsoever we are forced to
recognize in all causation of created efficient causes the concursus of
the first cause
d the actuality of the effect is in its adequate created cause or
causes not actually and formally but potentially or virtually if
the cause produce an effect of the same kind as itself causa
univoca as when living organisms propagate their species the
perfection of the effect is said to be in the cause equivalently
aequivalenter if it produce an effect of a different kind from itself
causa analoga as when a sculptor makes a statue the perfection
of the effect is said to be in the cause eminently eminenter
e omne agens agit inquantum est in actu the operative power of a
being is in proportion to its own actual perfection the higher an agent
is on the scale of reality or in other words the more perfect its grade
of being the higher and more perfect will be the effects achieved by the
exercise of its operative powers in fact our chief test of the perfection
of any nature is analysis of its operations hence the maxim so often
referred to already
f operari sequitur esse qualis est operatio talis est natura modus
operandi sequitur modum essendi operation is the key to nature we know
what any thing is by what it does
g nihil agit ultra suam speciem or again omne agens agit simile
sibi these are inductive generalizations gathered from experience and
have reference to the natural operation of agents especially in the
organic world living organisms reproduce only their own kind moreover
every agency in the universe has operative powers of a definite kind
acting according to its nature it produces certain effects and these only
others it cannot produce this is in the natural order of things and
with the natural concursus of the first cause but created causes have a
passive obediential capacity potentia obedientialis whereby their
nature can be so elevated by the first cause that they can produce with
his special supernatural concursus effects of an entirely higher order
than those within the ambit of their natural powers454
h from a known effect of whatsoever kind we can argue with
certainty a posteriori to the existence of an adequate efficient
cause and to some knowledge of the nature of such a cause455 by
virtue of the principle of causality we can infer the existence of an
adequate cause containing either equivalently or eminently all the
perfections of the effect in question
99 classification of efficient causesa we have already referred to
the distinction between the first cause and second or created
causes the former is absolutely independent of all other beings both as
to his power and as to the exercise of this power the latter are
dependent for both upon the former
the distinction between a first or primary or independent cause and
second or subordinate or dependent causes can be understood not only of
causes universally but also as obtaining among created causes themselves
in general the subordination of a cause to a superior or anterior cause
may be either essential or accidental essential when the second
cause dependseither for its existence or for an indispensable complement
of its efficiencyon the present actual influence of the other cause
accidental when the second cause has indeed received its existence or
efficiency from this other cause but is now no longer dependent for its
existence or action on the latter thus living organisms are as causes
accidentally subordinate to their parent organisms they derived their
existence from the latter but are independent of these when in their
maturity they continue to exist and live and act of themselves and for
themselves but all creatures on the other hand are as causes
essentially subordinate to the creator inasmuch as they can exist and
act only in constant dependence on the ever present and ever actual
conserving and concurring influence of the creator
it is obvious that all the members of any series of causes essentially
subordinate the one to the other must exist simultaneously whether such
a series could be infinite depends therefore on the question whether an
actually infinite multitude is intrinsically possible this difficulty
cannot be urged with such force against an infinite regress in causes
accidentally subordinate to one another for here such a regress would
not involve an actually infinite multitude of things existing
simultaneously in the case of essentially subordinate causes moreover
the series whatever about its infinity must contain or rather imply
above it one cause which is first in the sense of being
independent or exempt from the subordination characteristic of all the
others and the reason is obvious since no one of them can exist or act
except dependently on another and this on another and so on it is
manifest that the series cannot exist at all unless there is some one
cause which unlike all the others exists and acts without such
subordination or dependence hence in essentially subordinate causes an
infinite regress is impossible456 in natural theology these
considerations are of supreme importance
b an efficient cause may be described as immanent or transitive
according as the term of its action remains within the cause itself or is
produced in something else the action of the first cause is formally
immanent being identical with the divine nature itself it is virtually
transitive when it is creative or operative among creatures
c an efficient cause is either a principal or an instrumental
cause when two causes so combine to produce an effect that one of them
uses the other the former is called the principal and the latter the
instrumental cause thus i am the principal cause of the words i am
writing my pen is the instrumental cause of them such an effect is
always attributed to the principal cause not to the instrumental the
notion of an instrument is quite a familiar notion an instrument helps
the principal agent to do what the latter could not otherwise do or at
least not so easily an instrument therefore is really a cause it
contributes positively to the production of the effect how does it do so
by reason of its nature or structure it influences modifies and directs
in a particular way the efficiency of the principal cause but this
property of the instrumental cause comes into play only when the latter is
being actually used by a principal cause a pen a saw a hammer a spade
have each its own instrumentality the pen will not cut nor the saw mould
iron nor the hammer dig nor the spade write for the agent that uses
them each will produce its own kind of effect when used but none of them
will produce any effect except when used though each has in itself
permanently and inherently the power to produce its own proper effect in
use457 we have instanced the use of artificial instruments but
nature itself provides some agencies with what may be called natural
instruments the semen whereby living organisms propagate their kind is
an instance in a less proper sense the various members of the body are
called instruments of the human person as principal cause instrumenta
conjuncta
the notion of an instrumental cause involves then a subordination of
the latter in its instrumental activity to a principal cause b
incapacity to produce the effect otherwise than by modifying and directing
the influence of the principal cause this property whereby the
instrumental cause modifies or determines in a particular way the
influence of the principal cause is called by st thomas an actio or
operatio of the former the distinction between the principal and the
instrumental cause being that whereas the former acts by virtue of a power
permanently inherent in it as a natural perfection the latter acts as an
instrument only by virtue of the transient motion which it derives from
the principal cause which utilizes it458
we may therefore define an instrumental cause as one which when
acting as an instrument produces the effect not by virtue of its inherent
power alone but by virtue of a power communicated to it by some principal
cause which acts through it a principal cause on the other hand is
one which produces its effect by virtue of an active power permanently
inherent in itself
the designations principal and instrumental are obviously correlative
moreover all created causes may be called instrumental in relation to
the first cause for not only are they dependent on the latter for the
conservation of their nature and active powers they are also dependent
in their action in their actual exercise of these powers on the first
cause for the concursus of the latter459 yet some created causes
have these powers permanently and can exercise them without subordination
to other creatures while others need for the exercise of their proper
functions not only the divine concursus but also the motion of other
creatures hence the former are rightly called principal created causes
and the latter instrumental created causes
d efficient causes are divided into free causes and necessary
causes a free or selfdetermining cause is one which is not determined
by its nature to one line of action but has the power of choosing or
determining itself to act or abstain when all the conditions requisite
for acting are present man is a free agent or free cause of his
deliberate actions a necessary cause or natural cause as it is sometimes
called is one which is determined by its nature to one invariable line
of action so that granted the conditions requisite for action it
cannot naturally abstain from acting in that invariable manner all the
physical agencies of the inorganic world all plant and animal organisms
beneath man himself are necessary causes
the freedom of the human will is established against determinism in
psychology460 the difficulties of determinists against this doctrine
are for the most part based on misconceptions or on erroneous and
gratuitous assumptions we may mention two of them here461 free
activity they say would be causeless activity it would violate the
law of universal causation we reply that free activity is by no means
causeless activity the free agent himself is in the fullest and truest
sense the efficient cause of his free acts it is by his causal efficient
influence that the act of free choice is determined and elicited free
causality evidently does not violate the necessary a priori principle
set forth above under the title of the principle of causality butthey
urge in the second placeit violates the law of universal causation
ie the law that every event in nature must be the result of some set
of phenomenal antecedents which necessitate it and which therefore
whenever verified must produce this result and no other and by
violating this law it removes all supposed free activities from the
domain of that regularity and uniformity without which no scientific
knowledge of such phenomena would be possible to this we reply firstly
that the law of uniform causation in nature the law which is known as the
law of the uniformity of nature and which under the title of the law
of universal causation is confounded by determinists and phenomenists
with the entirely distinct principle of causalityis not by any means a
law of necessary causation462 the statement that nature is uniform in
its activities is not the expression of an a priori necessary truth
like the principle of causality it is a generalization from experience
and experience testifies to the existence of grades in this allprevailing
uniformity in the domain of physical nature it is the expression of the
free will of the author of nature who may miraculously derogate from this
physical uniformity for higher moral ends in the domain of deliberate
human activities it is the expression of that less rigorous but no less
real uniformity which is dependent on the free will of man and just as
the possibility of miracles in the former domain does not destroy the
regularity on which the generalizations of the physical sciences are
based so neither does the fact of human free will render worthless or
unreliable the generalizations of the human sciences ethical social
political economic etc about human conduct were the appearance of
miracles in the physical domain or the ordinary play of free will in the
human domain entirely capricious motiveless purposeless the
results would of course be chaotic precarious unaccountable
unintelligible and scientific knowledge of them would be impossible for
the assumption that reality is the work of intelligent purpose and is
therefore a regular orderly expression of law in other words the
assumption that the universe is intelligible is a prerequisite condition
for scientific knowledge about the universe but determinists seem to
assume that divine providence and human free will must necessarily imply
that the whole universe of physical phenomena and human activities would
be an unintelligible chaos and having erected this philosophical
scarecrow on a gratuitous assumption they think it will gradually exorcise
all belief in divine providence and human freedom from the scientific
mind
e efficient causes are either physical or moral a physical
efficient cause is one which produces its effect by its own proper power
and actionwhether immediately or by means of an instrument for
instance the billiard player is the physical cause of the motion he
imparts to the balls by means of the cue a moral cause is one which
produces its effect by the representation of something as good or evil to
the mind of a free agent by inducing the latter through example advice
persuasion promises threats commands entreaties etc to produce the
effect in question for instance a master is the moral cause of what his
servant does in obedience to his commands the motives set forth by way of
inducement to the latter are of course final causes of the latters
action but the former by setting them forth is the moral cause of the
action he is undoubtedly more than a mere condition he contributes
positively and efficiently to the effect his physical causation however
does not reach to the effect itself but only to the effect wrought in the
mind of the servant by his command it is causally connected with the
physical action of the servant by means of an intermediate link which we
may call mental or psychical causationactio intentionalisthe
action of cognition on the mind of a cognitive agent
the agent employed by a moral cause to produce an effect physically may be
called an instrumental cause in a wide and less proper sense of this term
the instrumentality being moral not physical only free agents can be
moral causes and as a rule they are termed moral causes only when they
produce the effect through the physical operation of another free agent
what if they employ not free agents nor yet inanimate instruments but
agents endowed with sense cognition and sense appetite to produce
effects if a man set his dog at another is he the moral or the
physical cause of the injuries inflicted by the dog that he is the
principal efficient cause is unquestionable but is he the principal
physical cause and the dog the instrument we think it is more proper
to call the principal efficient cause a moral cause in all cases where
there intervenes between his physical action and the effect an
intermediate link of psychical or intentional action even though as
in the present example this psychical link is of the sentient not the
intellectual order
f the efficient cause like other causes may be either partial or
total according as it produces the effect by cooperation with other
causes or by itself alone the aim of the inductive sciences is to
discover for each kind of natural event or phenomenon the total cause in
the comprehensive sense of the whole group of positive agencies or
causes proper and negative antecedent and concomitant conditions
which are indispensable and necessitating principles of the happening
of such kind of event463
g we can distinguish between the immediate or determining the more
or less proximate and the more or less remote efficient causes of an
event thus the application of the fuse to the charge of dynamite in a
rock is the immediate or determining cause of the explosion which bursts
the rock the lighting of the fuse the placing of the charge etc the
more proximate causes the making of the fuse dynamite instruments
etc the more remote causes again the aim of the inductive sciences is
to discover the total proximate cause of events464 leaving the
investigation of ultimate causes as well as the analysis of causality
itself to philosophy
h finally we must distinguish between the individual agent itself
as cause the suppositum or person that acts the agents nature and
active power as causes and the action or exercise of this power as
cause the former the individual concrete agent is the principium
quod agit and is called the causa ut quae the nature and the
active power of the agent are each a principium quo agens agit the
remote and the proximate principle of action respectively and each is
called a causa ut qua the action of the agent is the cause of the
effect in the sense that the actual production or fieri of anything is
the immediate cause of this thing in facto esse corresponding to these
distinctions we distinguish between the cause in actu primo remoto in
actu primo proximo and in actu secundo these distinctions are of no
little importance by ignoring them and by losing sight of the intrinsic
formal and material causes of natural phenomena many modern scientists
and philosophers have confounded cause and effect with the process itself
of causation and declared that cause and effect are not distinct
realities but only two mental aspects of one and the same reality465
    the same may be said of all the distinctions so far enumerated
    they are absolutely essential to the formation of clear ideas on
    the question of causality no term in familiar use is of more
    profound philosophical significance and at the same time more
    elastic and ambiguous in its popular meanings than the term
    cause this is keenly felt in the logic of the inductive
    sciences where not only the discovery but the exact measurement
    of physical causes is the goal of research
    when we call one thing writes mr joseph466 the cause of
    another the real relation between them is not always the same
    we say that molecular action is the cause of heat that the heat
    of the sun is the cause of growth that starvation is sometimes
    the cause of death that jealousy is a frequent cause of crime we
    should in the first case maintain that cause and effect are
    reciprocally necessary no heat without molecular motion and no
    molecular motion without heat in the second the effect cannot
    exist without the cause but the cause may exist without the
    effect for the sun shines on the moon but nothing grows there in
    the third the cause cannot exist without the effect for
    starvation must produce death but the effect may exist without
    the cause since death need not have been produced by starvation
    in the fourth case we can have the cause without the effect and
    also the effect without the cause for jealousy may exist without
    producing crime and crime may occur without the motive of
    jealousy it is plain then that we do not always mean the same
    thing by our words when we say that two things are related as
    cause and effect and anyone who would classify and name the
    various modes in which two things may be causally related would do
    a great service to clear thinking
    in the popular acceptation of the term cause the same kind of
    event can have a plurality of efficient causes death for
    example may be brought about in different cases by different
    diseases or accidents but if we understand by the total efficient
    cause of any given kind of effect the sumtotal of agencies and
    conditions which when present necessitate this kind of an
    effect and which are collectively and severally indispensable
    for its production then it is obvious that a given kind of
    effect can have only one kind of such total group of antecedents
    as total cause just as any one individual effect can have only
    one individual total cause viz the one which actually produced
    it a similar total cause would produce a similar effect but
    could not produce the numerically identical individual effect of
    the other similar cause467
    the medieval scholastics discussed the question in connexion with
    the problem of individuation would alexander the great have been
    the same individual had he been born of other parents than philip
    and olympia the question is hardly intelligible the person born
    of these other parents might indeed have been as similar as you
    will to the actual alexander of history but would not and could
    not have been the actual alexander of history nowadays the
    question discussed in this connexion is not so much whether the
    same kind of natural phenomenon can be produced by different kinds
    of total causefor the answer to this question depends wholly on
    the wider or the narrower meaning attached to the term total
    cause468but rather whether or how far the inductive
    scientists ideal of searching always for the necessitating and
    indispensable cause or as it is also called the
    reciprocating or commensurate cause is a practical ideal
chapter xiv efficient causality phenomenism and occasionalism
100 objective validity of the traditional concept of efficient
causalitywe have seen how modern sensists phenomenists and positivists
have doubted or denied the power of the human mind to attain to a
knowledge of any objective reality corresponding to the category of
substance  61 sqq they treat in a similar way the traditional
concept of efficient causality and in delivering their open or veiled
attacks on the real validity of this notion they have made a misleading
use of the proper and legitimate function of the inductive sciences the
chief aim of the natural scientist is to seek out and bring to light the
whole group of necessitating and indispensable phenomenal
antecedents of any given kind of event and to formulate the natural law
of their connexion with this kind of event there is no particular
objection to his calling these antecedents the invariable or even the
necessary or necessitating antecedents of the event provided he does
not claim what he cannot proveand what as we shall see later 104 is
not true vizthat the invariability or necessity of this connexion
between phenomenal antecedents and consequents is wholly inviolable
fatal absolute in character he may rightly claim for any such
established connexion the hypothetical conditional necessity which
characterizes all inductively established laws of physical nature there
are such antecedents and consequents in the universe there are connexions
between them which are more than mere casual connexions of time
sequence which are connexions of physical law inasmuch as they are
connexions based on the natures of agencies in an orderly universe
connexions of these agencies with their natural effects all this is
undeniable moreover so long as the scientist confines himself to
inferences concerning such connexions between phenomena to inferences and
generalizations based on the assumed uniformity of nature he is working
in his proper sphere nay even if he chooses to designate these groups of
invariable phenomenal antecedents by the title of physical causes we
know what he means though we perceive some danger of confusion inasmuch
as we see him arrogating to the notion of regularity or uniformity of
connexion ie to the notion of physical law a term causality
which traditionally expressed something quite distinct from this viz
the notion of positive influence of one thing on the being or happening
of another but when phenomenist philosophers adopt this usage we cannot
feel reassured against the danger of confusion by such protestations as
those of mill in the following passage469
    i premise then that when in the course of this inquiry i speak
    of the cause of any phenomenon i do not mean a cause which is not
    itself a phenomenon i make no research into the ultimate or
    ontological cause of anything to adopt a distinction familiar in
    the writings of the scotch metaphysicians and especially of reid
    the causes with which i concern myself are not efficient but
    physical causes they are causes in that sense alone in which
    one physical fact is said to be the cause of another of the
    efficient causes of phenomena or whether any such causes exist at
    all i am not called upon to give an opinion the notion of
    causation is deemed by the schools of metaphysics most in vogue
    at the present moment to imply a mysterious and most powerful
    tie such as cannot or at least does not exist between any
    physical fact and that other physical fact on which it is
    invariably consequent and which is popularly termed its cause
    and thence is deduced the supposed necessity of ascending higher
    into the essences and inherent constitution of things to find the
    true cause the cause which is not only followed by but actually
    produces the effect no such necessity exists for the purposes of
    the present inquiry nor will any such doctrine be found in the
    following pages the only notion of a cause which the theory of
    induction requires is such a notion as can be gained by
    experience the law of causation which is the main pillar of
    inductive science is but the familiar truth that invariability
    of succession is found by observation to obtain between every fact
    in nature and some other fact which has preceded it independently
    of all considerations respecting the ultimate mode of production
    of phenomena and of every other question regarding the nature of
    things in themselves
this passagewhich expresses fairly well the phenomenist and positivist
attitude in regard to the reality or at least the cognoscibility of
efficient causesfairly bristles with inaccuracies misconceptions and
false insinuations470 but we are concerned here only with the denial
that any notion of an efficient cause can be gained from experience
and the doubt consequently cast on the objective validity of this notion
the sensism which regards our highest intellectual activities as mere
organic associations of sentient states of consciousness has for its
logical issue the positivism which contends that all valid knowledge is
confined to the existence and time and space relations of sense phenomena
in thus denying to the mind all power of attaining to a valid knowledge of
anything suprasensiblesuch as substance power force efficient cause
etcpositivism passes over into agnosticism
in refutation of this philosophy in so far as it denies that we have any
grounds in experience for believing in the real existence of efficient
causes we may set down in the first place this universal belief itself of
the human race that there are in the universe efficient causes of the
events that happen in it men universally believe that they themselves as
agents contribute by a real and positive influence to the actual
occurrence of their own thoughts reasonings wishes desires sensations
that their mental resolves to speak walk write eat or perform any
other external bodily works do really positively and efficiently
produce or cause those works that external phenomena have a real
influence on happenings in their own bodies that fire burns them and food
nourishes them that external phenomena also have a real and positive
influence on their sense organs and through these on their minds by the
production there of conscious states such as sensations finally that
external phenomena have a real and positive influence on one another that
by action and interaction they really produce the changes that are
constantly taking place in the universe that the sun does really heat and
light the earth that the sowing of the seed in springtime has really a
positive influence on the existence of crops in the harvest that the
taking of poison has undoubtedly a real influence on the death which
results from it and if any man of ordinary intelligence and plain common
sense is told that such belief is an illusion that in all such cases the
connexion between the things facts or events which he designates as
cause and effect is a mere connexion of invariable time sequence
between antecedents and consequents that in no case is there evidence of
any positive productive influence of the one fact upon the other he
will either smile incredulously and decline to take his objector
seriously or he will simply ask the latter to prove the universal
belief to be an illusion his conviction of the real and objective
validity of his notion of efficient cause as something which positively
influences the happening of things is so profound and ineradicable that
it must necessarily be grounded in and confirmed by his constant
experience of the real world in which he lives and moves not that he
professes to be able to explain the nature of this efficient influence
in which he believes even if he were a philosopher he might not be able
to satisfy himself or others on this point but being a plain man of
ordinary intelligence he has sense enough to distinguish between the
existence of a fact and its nature its explanation its quomodo
and to believe in the real existence of a positive efficient productive
influence of cause on effect however this influence is to be conceived or
explained
a second argument for the objective validity of the concept of efficient
cause may be drawn from a consideration of the principle of causality
the experience on which the plain man grounds his belief in the validity
of his notion of cause is not mere uninterpreted sense experience in its
raw and brute condition so to speak it is this sense experience
rationalized assimilated into his intelligencespontaneously and half
unconsciously perhapsby the light of the selfevident principle of
causality that whatever happens has a cause when the plain man believes
that all the various agencies in nature like those enumerated above are
not merely temporal antecedents or concomitants of their effects but
are really productive of those effects he is really applying the
universal and necessary truththat an event a happening a change
a commencement of any new actual mode of being demands the existence of
another actual being as causethe truth embodied in the principle of
causality to this that and the other event of his experience he is
locating the causes of these events in the various persons and things
which he regards as the agents or producers of these events in making
such applications he may very possibly err in detail but no actual
application of the principle at all is really required for establishing
the objective validity of the concept of cause there are philosophers
whoerroneously as we shall seedeny that the principle of causality
finds its application in the domain of created things who hold in
other words that no created beings can be efficient causes 102 and who
nevertheless recognize and quite rightly that the concept of efficient
cause is an objectively valid concept and they do so because they see
that since events beginnings happenings changes are real there must
be really and objectively existent an efficient cause of themwhatever and
wherever such efficient cause may be whether it be one or manifold
finite or infinite etc
    we have already examined humes attempt to deny the ontological
    necessity of the principle of causality and to substitute therefor
    a subjectively or psychologically necessary feeling of
    expectation grounded on habitual association of ideas kant on
    the other hand admits the selfevident necessary character of
    the principle but holds that since this necessity is engendered
    by the minds imposing a subjective form of thought on the data of
    sense consciousness the principle is validly applicable only to
    connexions within the world of mental appearances and not at all
    to the world of real being he thus transfers the discussion to
    the domain of epistemology where in opposition to his theory of
    knowledge the principle of causality can be shown to be applicable
    to all contingent reality and to be therefore legitimately
    employed in natural theology for the purpose of establishing the
    real existence of an uncaused first cause
101 origin of the concept of efficient causewe have seen that universal
belief in the real existence of efficient causes is grounded in
experience the formation of the concept and its application or extension
to the world within and around us are gradual471 active power force
energy efficiency faculty or by whatever other name we may call it is
of course experienced only in its actual exercise in action motion
production of change our first experience of its exercise is found in our
consciousness of our own personal activities mental and bodily in our
thinking willing or choosing in our deliberate control of our mental
processes and in the deliberate exercise of our sense faculties and
bodily organs in all this we are conscious of exerting power force
energy we apprehend ourselves as agents or efficient causes of our
mental processes and bodily movements we apprehend these happenings as
due to the exercise of our own power to produce them seeing other human
beings behave like ourselves we infer by analogy that they also possess
and exercise active powers like our own that they too are efficient
causes finally observing that effects like to those produced by
ourselves whether in ourselves or in the material world around us are
also consequent on certain other changes in external nature whether
organic or inorganic we infer by analogy that these corporeal things have
also powers forces energies whereby they produce these effects while
our senses testify only to time and space connexions between physical
happenings in external nature our intellect apprehends action and
interaction ie causal dependence of events on the active influence or
efficiency of physical things as agents or causes472 thus our
knowledge of the existence and nature of the forces powers and energies
which constitute material things efficient causes is posterior to and
derived by analogy from our knowledge of the mental and bodily powers
which reveal themselves to us in our conscious vital processes as
constituting our own personal efficient causality
this conception of efficient causality even in the inanimate things of
external nature after the analogy of our own vital powers as revealed
in our conscious activities is sometimes disparaged as nave
anthropomorphism it just depends on the manner and degree in which we
press the analogy observing that our earlier notion of cause is the
notion of power combined with a purpose and an end thus including
efficient and final causality newman remarks473 that accordingly
wherever the world is young the movements and changes of physical nature
have been and are spontaneously ascribed by its people to the presence and
will of hidden agents who haunt every part of it the woods the
mountains and the streams the air and the stars for good or for
eviljust as children again by beating the ground after falling imply
that what has bruised them has intelligence this is anthropomorphism
so too would be the conception of the forces or powers of inanimate
nature as powers of subconscious perception and appetition
leibniz or again as rudimentary or diminished willpower
cousin474 physical phenomena as such are without sense as newman
rightly observes and consequently we may not attribute to them any sort
of conscious efficiency whether perceptive or appetitive but newman
appears to err in the opposite direction when he adds that experience
teaches us nothing about physical phenomena as causes475 the truth
lies between these extremes taking experience in the wide sense in which
it includes rational interpretation of and inference from the data of
internal and external sense perception experience certainly reveals to us
the existence of physical phenomena as efficient causes or in other
words that there is real and efficient causality not only in our own
persons but also in the external physical universe and as to the nature
of this causality it also gives us at least some little reliable
information
by pursuing this latter question a little we shall be led to examine
certain difficulties which lie at the root of occasionalism the error
of denying that creatures or at least merely corporeal creatures can be
in any true sense efficient causes a detailed inquiry into the nature of
the active powers forces or energies of the inorganic universe ie
into the nature of corporeal efficient causality belongs to cosmology
just as a similar inquiry into vital sentient and spiritual
efficient causality belongs to psychology here we have only to ascertain
what is common and essential to all efficient causality as such what in
general is involved in the exercise of efficient causality in actio and
passio and what are the main implications revealed in a study of it
102 analysis of efficient causality or actio and passio a the
first cause and created causeswe have already referred to the universal
dependence of all created causes on the first cause and we shall have
occasion to return to it in connexion with occasionalism god has created
all second causes he has given them their powers of action he conserves
their being and their powers in existence he applies these powers or puts
them in act he concurs with all their actions he is therefore the
principal cause of all their effects and in relation to him they are as
instrumental causes deus est causa actionis cujuslibet inquantum dat
virtutem agendi et inquantum conservat eam et inquantum applicat
actioni et inquantum ejus virtute omnis alia virtus agit476
in our analysis of change 10 we saw why no finite created agent can be
the adequate cause of the new actualities or perfections involved in
change and how we are therefore obliged by a necessity of thought to
infer the existence of a first cause an unchanging infinite source of
these new actualities477
the principle upon which the argument was based is this that the
actuality of the effect is something over and above the reality which it
had in the passive potentiality of its created material cause and in the
active powers of its created efficient cause antecedently to its
production that therefore the production of this actuality this novum
esse implies the influenceby way of cooperation or concursus with
the created efficient causeof an actual being in whom the actuality of
all effects is contained in an eminently perfect way even with the divine
concursus a created cause cannot itself create because even with this
concursus its efficiency attains only to the modifying or changing of
preexisting being and in creation there is no preexisting being no
material cause no real passive potentiality to be actuated but without
this concursus not only can it not create it cannot even as an
efficient cause actuate a real preexisting potentiality and why
because its efficiency cannot attain to the production of new actuality
it determines the mode of this actuality and therein precisely lies the
efficiency of the created cause but the positive entity or perfection
of this new actuality can be produced only by the infinite changeless
inexhaustible source of all actuality cooperating with the created
cause478 103
but it might be objected perhaps created efficient causes are themselves
the adequate and absolutely independent principles of the whole actuality
of their effects they cannot be such and that for the simple reason that
they are not always in act were they such they should be always and
necessarily in act they should always and necessarily contain in
themselves and that actually and in an eminently perfect manner all the
perfections of all the effects which they gradually produce in the
universe but experience shows us that created causes are not always
acting that their active power their causality in actu primo is not to
be identified with their action their causality in actu secundo and
reason tells us that since this is so since action is something more than
active power since a cause acting has more actuality than the same
cause not acting it must have been determined or reduced to action by
some actuality other than itself this surplus of actuality or perfection
in an acting cause as compared with the same cause prior to its acting
is the divine concursus in other words an active power which is really
distinct from its action requires to be moved or reduced to its act
which is actio no less than a passive potentiality required to be
moved to its act which is passio by some really distinct actual
being a created efficient cause therefore by passing from the state of
rest or mere power to act into the state of action is perfected by
having its active power actualized ie by the divine concursus in
this sense action is a perfection of the agent but it is not an
entitative perfection of the latters essence it is not a permanent or
stable elevation or perfection of the latters powers it is not the
completion of any passive potentiality of the latter nor therefore is it
properly speaking a change of the agent as such it is as we have said
already rather an index of the latters perfection in the scale of real
being479 action really perfects the patiens and only when this is
identical in its concrete individuality with the agens is the latter
permanently perfected by the action
the action of created causes therefore depends on the action of the
first cause we derive our notion of action from the former and apply it
analogically to the latter if we compare them we shall find that
notwithstanding many differences the notion of action in general involves
a simple or unmixed perfection which can without anthropomorphism be
applied analogically to the divine action the divine action is identical
with the divine power and the divine essence in creatures essence power
and action are really distinct the divine action when creative has not
for its term a change in the strict sense 10 11 for it produces
being ex nihilo whereas the action of creatures cannot have for term
the production of new being ex nihilo but only the change of
preexisting being the divine action whether in creating or conserving
or concurring with creatures implies in god no real transition from power
to act whereas the action of creatures does imply such transition in
them such are the differences but with them there is this point of
agreement the divine action implies in god an efficiency which has for
its term the origin of new being dependently on this efficiency480
so too does the action of creatures positive efficient influence on
the one side and the origin production or fieri of new actual being
on the other with a relation of real dependence on this efficiency such
is the essential note of all efficient causality whether of god or of
creatures481
103 b actio immanens and actio transienslet us compare in the next
place the perfectly immanent spiritual causality of thought the less
perfectly immanent organic causality of living things and the transitive
physical causality of the agencies of inorganic nature the term of an
immanent action remains either within the very faculty which elicits it
affecting this faculty as a habit thus acts of thought terminate in the
intellectual habits called sciences acts of free choice in the habits
of will called virtues or vices482 or it remains at least within
the agent as when in the vital process of nutrition the various parts and
members of the living organism so interact as procure the growth and
development of the living individual which is the cause of these
functions483 in those cases the agent itself is the patiens whereas
every agency in the inorganic universe acts not upon itself but only on
some other thing transitively but immanent action no less than
transitive action is productive of real changenot of course in the
physical sense in which this term is identified with motion and
understood of corporeal change but in the metaphysical sense of an
actuation of some passive potentiality 10 11484
what then do we find common to the immanent and the transitive causality
of created causes an active power or influence on the side of the agent
an actuation of this active power either by the action of other causes
on this agent or by the fulfilment of all conditions requisite for the
action of the agent and in all cases by the concursus of the first cause
and on the side of the effect the production of some new actuality the
actuation of some passive potentiality dependently on the cause now in
action
thus we see that in all cases action or the exercise of efficient
causality implies that something which was not actual becomes actual
that something which was not now is and that this becoming this
actuation this production is really and essentially dependent on the
influence the efficiency of some actual being or beings which we
therefore call efficient causes
    104 erroneous theories of efficient causality imagination and
    thoughtare we certain of anything more about the nature of this
    connecting link between efficient cause and effect which we call
    action speculations and theories there are indeed in abundance
    some of these can be shown to be false and thus our knowledge of
    the real nature of action may be at least negatively if not
    positively perfected our concept of action is derived like all
    our concepts from experience and although we are conscious of
    spiritual action in the exercise of intellect and will yet it
    is inseparably allied with sentient action and this again with
    organic and corporeal action nor can we conceive or describe
    spiritual action without the aid of imagination images or in
    language other than that borrowed from the domain of corporeal
    things which are the proper object of the human intellect485
    now in all this there is a danger the danger of mistaking
    imagination images for thoughts and of giving a literal sense to
    language in contexts where this language must be rightly
    understood to apply only analogically
    in analysing the nature of efficient causality we might be tempted
    to think that we understood it by imagining some sort of a flow
    or transference of some sort of actual reality from agens to
    patiens it is quite true that in describing action the
    actual connecting link between agens and patiens we have to
    use language suggestive of some such imagination image we have no
    option in the matter for all human language is based upon sense
    consciousness of physical phenomena when we describe efficiency
    as an influence of cause on effect or the effect as dependent
    on the cause the former term suggests a flowing just as the
    latter suggests a hanging so too when we speak of the effect
    as arising originating springing or emanating from the
    cause486 but we have got to ask ourselves what such language
    means ie what concepts it expresses and not what
    imagination images accompany the use of it
    now when we reflect that the senses testify only to time and space
    sequences and collocations of the phenomena which we regard as
    causally connected and when we feel convinced that there is
    something more than this in the causal connexionwhich something
    more we describe in the terms illustrated abovewe must inquire
    whether we have any rational ground for thinking that this
    something more is really anything in the nature of a spatial
    transference of some actual reality from agens to patiens
    there are indeed many philosophers and scientists who seem to
    believe that there is such a local transference of some actuality
    from cause to effect that efficient causality is explained by it
    and cannot be intelligibly explained otherwise as a matter of
    fact there is no rational ground for believing in any such
    transference and even were there such transference so far from
    its being the only intelligible explanation of efficient
    causality it would leave the whole problem entirely
    unexplainedand not merely the problem of spiritual immanent
    causality to which it is manifestly inapplicable but even the
    problem of corporeal transitive causality487
    we have already referred at some length 911 to the philosophy
    which has endeavoured to reduce all change or at least all
    corporeal change to mechanical change all qualities powers
    forces energies of the universe to ultimate particles or atoms
    of matter in motion and all efficient causality to a flow or
    transference of spatial motion from particle to particle or from
    body to body a full analysis of all such theories belongs to
    cosmology but we may recall a few of the more obvious
    considerations already urged against them
    in the first place the attempt to explain all qualities in the
    material universeall the powers forces energies of matterby
    maintaining that objectively and extramentally they are all purely
    quantitative realities all spatial motions of matterdoes not
    explain the qualitative factors and distinctions in the world of
    our sense experience at all but simply transfers the problem of
    explaining them from the philosophy of matter to the philosophy of
    mind by making them all subjective after the manner of kants
    analysis of experience 11
    in the second place when we endeavour to conceive to apprehend
    intellectually how motion or indeed any other physical or real
    entity could actually pass or be transferred from agens to
    patiens whether these be spatially in contact or not we find
    such a supposition positively unintelligible motion is not a
    substance and if it is an accident it cannot migrate from subject
    to subject the idea that corporeal efficient causalityeven
    mechanical causalitycan be explained by such a transference of
    actual accidental modes of being from agens to patiens is
    based on a very crude and erroneous conception of what an
    accidental mode of being really is 65
    the more we reflect on the nature of real change in the universe
    and of the efficient causality whereby it is realized the more
    convinced we must become that there can be no satisfactory
    explanation of these facts which does not recognize and take
    account of this great fundamental fact that contingent real being
    is not all actual that it is partly potential and partly
    actual that therefore our concepts of passive potentiality and
    active power are not mere subjective mental motions with at
    best a mere regulative or systematizing function after the manner
    of kants philosophy but that they are really and objectively
    valid conceptsconcepts which from the time of aristotle have
    given philosophers the only insight into the nature of efficient
    causality which is at any rate satisfactory and intelligible as
    far as it goes
    of this great fact the advocates of the mechanical theory of
    efficient causality have in the third place failed to take
    account and it is partly because with the revival of atomism at
    the dawn of modern philosophy this traditional aristotelian
    conception of contingent being as potential and actual was lost
    sight of 64 that such a crude and really unintelligible account
    of efficient causality as a flow of motion has been able to
    find such continued and widespread acceptance
    another reason of the prevalence of this tendency to explain all
    physical efficient causality as a propagation of spatial motions
    of matter is to be found in the sensist view of the human mind
    which confounds intellectual thought with mental imagery which
    countenances only picturable factors in its explanations and
    denounces as metaphysical occult and unverifiable all
    explanatory principles such as forces powers potentialities
    etc which are not directly picturable in the imagination488
    and it is a curious fact that it is such philosophers themselves
    who are really guilty of the charge which they lay at the door of
    the traditional metaphysics the charge of offering
    explanationsof efficient causality for instancewhich are really
    no explanations for while they put forward their theory of the
    flow of motion as a real explanation of the quomodo of
    efficient causalityand the ultimate and only explanation of it
    within reach of the human mind if we are to accept their view of
    the matterthe exponent of the traditional metaphysics more
    modestly confines himself to setting forth the inevitable
    implications of the fact of efficient causality and without
    purporting to offer any positive explanation of the real nature of
    action or efficient influence he is content to supplement his
    analysis negatively by pointing out the unintelligible and
    illusory character of their proffered explanations
    in the exact methods of the physical sciences their quantitative
    evaluation of all corporeal forces whether mechanical physical
    or chemical in terms of mechanical work which is measured by the
    motion of matter through space and in the great physical
    generalization known as the law of the equivalence of energies or
    of the equality of action and reactionwe can detect yet further
    apparent reasons for the conception of efficient causality as a
    mere transference or interchange of actual physical and measurable
    entities among bodies it is an established fact not only that all
    corporeal agents gradually lose their energy or power of action by
    actually exercising this power but that this loss of energy is in
    direct proportion to the amount of energy gained by the recipients
    of their action and this fact would naturally suggest the mental
    picture of a transference of some actual measurable entity from
    cause to effect but it does not necessarily imply such
    transferenceeven if the latter were intelligible which as we
    have seen it is not the fact is quite intelligibly explained by
    the natural supposition that in proportion as the agens exhausts
    its active power by exercise the patiens gains in some form of
    actuality similarly the fact that all forms of corporeal energy
    can be measured in terms of mechanical energy does not at all
    imply that they all really are mechanical energy but only that
    natural agents can by the use of one form of energy produce
    another form in equivalent quantity and finally the law of the
    conservation of corporeal energy in the universe is explained by
    the law of the equality of action and reaction and without
    recourse to the unintelligible supposition that this sumtotal of
    energy is one unchanging and unchangeable actuality
    there is just one other consideration which at first sight appears
    to favour the transference theory of causality but which on
    analysis shows how illusory the proffered explanation is and how
    unintelligible the simplest phenomenon of change must be to those
    who fail to grasp the profound significance of the principle that
    all real being which is subject to change must of necessity be
    partly potential and partly actual we allude to the general
    assumption of physical scientists that corporeal action of
    whatsoever kind takes place only on contact whether mediate or
    immediate between the bodies in question489 now it is well to
    bear in mind that this is not a selfevident truth or principle
    but only an hypothesis a very legitimate hypothesis and one which
    works admirably but still only an hypothesis it implies the
    assumption that some sort of substancecalled the universal
    etheractually exists and fills all space serving as a medium for
    the action of gravitation light radiant heat electricity and
    magnetism between the earth and the other planets the sun and
    the stars this whole supposition is the only thinkable
    alternative to actio in distans if those bodies really act on
    one anotherand the fact that they do is undeniableand if there
    were no such medium between them then the causal influence of one
    body should be able to produce an effect in another body spatially
    distant from and not physically connected by any material medium
    with the former hence two questions is this alternative actio
    in distans imaginable ie can we form any positive
    imagination image of how this would take place and secondly
    is it thinkable conceivable intrinsically possible we
    need not hesitate to answer the former question in the negative
    but as to the latter question all we can say is that we have never
    met any cogent proof of the intrinsic impossibility of actio in
    distans the efficient action of a finite cause implies that it
    has active power and is conserved in existence with this power by
    the creator or first cause that this power is reduced to act by
    the divine concursus and that dependently on this cause so
    acting some change takes place some potentiality is actualized
    in some other finite being nothing more than this is involved in
    the general concept of efficient causality of course real
    influence on the one side and real dependence on the other imply
    some real connexion of cause with effect but is spatial
    connexion a necessary condition of real connexion is a
    physical phenomenal imaginable efflux of some entity
    out of the cause into the effect either immediately or through
    some medium as a channel a necessary condition for real
    influence there is nothing of the kind in spiritual causality
    and to demand anything of the kind for causality in general would
    be to make imagination not thought the test and measure of the
    real but perhaps spatial connexion is essential to the real
    connexion involved in this particular kind of causality
    corporeal causality perhaps but it has never been proved too
    little is known about the reality of space about the ultimate
    nature of material phenomena and their relation to our minds to
    justify anything like dogmatism on such an ultimate question it
    may well be that if we had a deeper insight into these things we
    could pronounce actio in distans to be absolutely incompatible
    with the essences of the things which do as a matter of fact
    constitute the actual corporeal universe but in the absence of
    such insight we cannot pronounce actio in distans to be
    intrinsically impossible physical scientists assume that as a
    matter of fact bodies do not act in distans granted the
    assumption to be correct it still remains an open question
    whether by a miracle they could act in distans ie whether
    or not such action would be incompatible with their nature as
    finite corporeal causes
    owing to a very natural tendency to rest in imagination images we
    are inclined not only to pronounce as impossible any process the
    mode of which is not positively imaginable but also to think that
    we rightly understand a process once we have provided ourselves
    with an imagination image of itwhen as a matter of fact this
    image may cover an entirely groundless conception or theory of the
    process hence the fairly prevalent idea that while actio in
    distans is impossible the interaction of bodies on contact is
    perfectly intelligible and presents no difficulties when a
    billiard ball in motion strikes another at rest it communicates
    some or all of its motion to the other and that is all nothing
    simpler and then all the physical chemical and substantial
    changes in the material universe are reducible to this common
    denominator the atomic philosophy with its two modest postulates
    of matter and motion is a delightfully simple philosophy but
    unfortunately for its philosophical prestige it does not explain
    causality or change nor can these facts be explained by any
    philosophy which ignores the most elementary implication of all
    real change the implication that changing reality involves real
    passive potentialities and real active powers or forces in the
    phenomena which constitute the changing reality of the universe
105 the subject of efficient causality occasionalismwe have
established the objective validity of the concept of efficient causality
and analysed its implications there have been philosophers who while
admitting the objective validity of the concept have maintained that no
creature or at least no corporeal creature can be an efficient cause
efficient influence is in their view incompatible with the nature of a
corporeal substance only spiritual substances can be efficient causes
corporeal things conditions and happenings are all only the occasions
on which spiritual substances act efficiently in and through all created
nature hence the name of the theory occasionalism there are two forms
of it the milder which admits that created spirits or minds are
efficient causes and the more extreme view according to which no
creature can be an efficient cause inasmuch as efficient causality is
essentially a divine attribute a prerogative of the divinity
this error was not unknown in the middle ages490 but it was in the
seventeenth century that certain disciples of descartesgeulincx
16251669 and malebranche 16381715expressly inferred it from the
cartesian antithesis of matter and spirit and the cartesian doctrine that
matter is essentially inert or inactive according to the gratuitous and
unproven assertion laid down by geulincx as a principle quod nescis
quomodo fiat id non faciswe do not cause our own sensations or
reasoning processes nor our own bodily movements inasmuch as we do not
know how these take place nor can bodies cause them any more than our
own created spirits inasmuch as bodies are essentially inactive
according to malebranche the mind can perceive no necessary nexus
between effects and any cause other than the divine will491 moreover
reflection convinces us that efficient causality is something essentially
divine and incommunicable to creatures492 and finally neither bodies
can be causes for they are essentially inert nor our minds and wills
for we do not know how a volition could move any organ or member of our
bodies493 yet malebranche at the cost of inconsistency with his own
principles safeguards free will in man by allowing an exclusively
immanent efficiency to spiritual causes494
such is the teaching of occasionalism our criticism of it will be
brief495
1 against the doctrine that creatures generally are not and cannot be
efficient causes we direct the first argument already outlined 100
against phenomenism and positivismthe argument from the universal belief
of mankind based on the testimony of consciousness as rationally
interpreted by human intelligence consciousness testifies not merely that
processes of thought imagination sensation volition etc take place
within our minds not merely that our bodily movements such as speaking
walking writing occur but that we are the causes of them496 it
is idle to say that we do not efficiently move our limbs because we may
not be able to understand or explain fully how an unextended volition
can move a material limb497 consciousness testifies to the fact that
the volition does move the limb and that is enough498 the fact is one
thing the quomodo of the fact is quite another thing nor is there any
ground whatever for the assertion that a cause in order to produce an
effect must understand how the exercise of its own efficiency brings
that effect about moreover malebranches concession of at least immanent
activity to the will is at all events an admission that there is in the
nature of the creature as such nothing incompatible with its being an
efficient cause
2 although malebranche bases his philosophy mainly on deductive a
priori reasonings from a consideration of the divine attributes his
system is really derogatory to the perfection of the first cause and
especially to the divine wisdom to say for instance that god created an
organ so well adapted to discharge the function of seeing as the human
eye and then to deny that the latter discharges this or any function is
tantamount to accusing god of folly there is no reason in this system why
any created thing or condition of things would be even the appropriate
occasion of the first cause producing any definite effect everything
would be an equally appropriate occasion or rather nothing would be in
any intelligible sense an appropriate occasion for any exercise of the
divine causality the admirable order of the universewith its unity in
variety its adaptation of means to ends its gradation of created
perfectionsis an intelligible manifestation of the divine perfections on
the assumption that creatures efficiently cooperate with the first cause
in realizing and maintaining this order but if they were all inert
inoperative useless for this purpose what could be the raison dtre
of their diversified endowments and perfections so far from manifesting
the wisdom power and goodness of god they would evidence an aimless and
senseless prodigality
3 occasionalism imperils the distinction between creatures and a
personal god although malebranche fervent catholic that he was
protested against the pantheism of le misrable spinoza his own system
contains the undeveloped germ of this pernicious error for if creatures
are not efficient causes not only are their variety and multiplicity
meaningless as contributing nothing towards the order of the universe
but their very existence as distinct realities seems to have no raison
dtre malebranche emphasizes the truth that god does nothing useless
dieu ne fait rien dinutile very well if then a being does
nothing what purpose is served by its existence of what use is it what
is the measure of a creatures reality if not its action and its power of
action so intimately in fact is this notion of causality bound up with
the notion of the very reality of things that the concept of an absolutely
inert inactive reality is scarcely intelligible it is almost an axiom in
scholastic philosophy that every nature has its correlative activity
every being its operation omne ens est propter suam operationem omnis
natura ordinatur ad propriam operationem hence if what we call creatures
had really no proper activity distinct from that of the first cause on
what grounds could we suppose them to have a real and proper existence of
their own distinct from the reality of the infinite being or who could
question the lawfulness of the inference that they are not really
creatures but only so many phases aspects manifestations of the one and
sole existing reality which is pantheism
4 occasionalism leads to subjective idealism by destroying all ground
for the objective validity of human science how do we know the real
natures of things by reasoning from their activities in virtue of the
principle operari sequitur esse499 but if things have no activities
no operations such reasoning is illusory how for instance do we
justify by rational demonstration in opposition to subjectivism the
commonsense interpretation of the data of sense consciousness as
revealing to us the real and extramental existence of a material universe
by arguing in virtue of the principle of causality from our
consciousness of our own passivity in external sense perception to the
real existence of bodies outside our minds as excitants of our
cognitive activity and partial causes of these conscious perceptive
processes but if occasionalism were true such inference would be
illusory and we should infer with berkeley that only god and minds
exist but not any material universe malebranche admits the possible
validity of this inference to immaterialism from his principles and
grounds his own belief in the existence of an external material universe
solely on faith in divine revelation500
it only remains to answer certain difficulties urged by occasionalists
against the possibility of attributing real efficiency to creatures
1 they argue that efficient causality is something essentially divine
and therefore cannot be communicated to creatures
we reply that while the absolutely independent causality of the first
cause is essentially divine another kind or order of causality dependent
on the former but none the less real can be and is communicated to
creatures and just as the fact that creatures have real being real
existence distinct from but dependent on the existence of the infinite
being does not derogate from the supremacy of the latter so the fact
that creatures have real efficient causality distinct from but dependent
on the causality of the first cause does not derogate from the latters
supremacy
2 they urge that efficient causality is creative and therefore infinite
and incommunicable
we reply that there is a plain distinction between creative activity and
the efficient activity we claim for creatures creation is the production
of new being from nothingness god alone the infinite being can create
and furthermore according to the common view of theistic philosophers a
creature cannot even be an instrument of the first cause in this
production of new being from nothingness and the main reason for this
appears to be that the efficiency of the creature acting of course with
the divine concursus necessarily presupposes some preexisting being as
material on which to operate and is confined to the change or
determination of new forms or modes of this preexisting reality such
efficiency subordinate to the divine concursus and limited to such an
order of effects is plainly distinct from creative activity
3 but the creature acting with the divine concursus either
contributes something real and positive to the effect or contributes
nothing the former alternative is inadmissible for god is the cause of
everything real and positive omne novum ens est a deo and in the
latter alternative which is the true one the concursus is superfluous
god does all and creatures are not really efficient causes
we reply that the former alternative not the latter is the true one but
the former alternative does not imply that the creature produces any new
reality independently of the first cause nor is it incompatible with
the truth that god is the author and cause of all positive reality omne
novum ens est a deo no doubt were we to conceive the cooperation of
god and the creature after the manner of the cooperation of two partial
causes of the same order producing by their joint efficiency some one
total effectlike the cooperation of two horses drawing a cartit would
follow that the creatures share of the joint effect would be independent
of the divine concursus and attributable to the creature alone that the
creature would produce some reality independently of the first cause but
that is not the way in which the first cause concurs with created
causes they are not partial causes of the same order each is a total
cause in its own order they so cooperate that god besides having
created and now conserving the second cause and moving the latters power
to act produces himself the whole effect directly and immediately by the
efficiency of his concursus while at the same time the second cause
thus reduced to act and acting with the concursus also directly and
immediately produces the whole effect there is one effect one change in
facto esse one change in fieri and therefore one action as considered
in the subject changed since the action takes place in this latter
actio fit in passo this change this action considered thus passively
or in passo is the total term of each efficiency the divine and the
created not partly of the one and partly of the other it is one and
indivisible it is wholly due to and wholly attained by each efficiency
not however under the same formal aspect we may distinguish in it two
formalities it is a novum ens a new actuality something positive and
actual superadded to the existing order of real contingent being but it
is not being in general or actuality in general it is some
specifically nay individually determinate mode of actuality or actual
being we have seen that it is precisely because every real effect has the
former aspect that it demands for its adequate explanation and as its
only intelligible source the presence and influence of a purely actual
unchanging infinite inexhaustible productive principle of all actual
contingent reality hence the necessity and efficacy of the divine
concursus and similarly it is because the new actuality involved in
every change is an individually definite mode of actuality that we can
detect in it the need for and the efficacy of the created cause the
nature of this latter the character and scope and intensity of its active
power is what determines the individuality of the total result to the
total production of which it has by the aid of the divine concursus
attained
4 but god can himself produce the total result under both formalities
without any efficiency of the creature therefore the difficulty remains
that the latter efficiency is superfluous and useless and entia non sunt
multiplicanda praeter necessitatem
we reply that as a matter of fact the effects produced in the ordinary
course of nature are produced by god under both formalities but also by
the created cause under both formalities inasmuch as the formalities are
but mentally distinct aspects of one real result which is as regards its
extrinsic causes individual and indivisible the distinction of these
formal aspects only helps us to realize how de facto such an effect is
due to the cooperation of the first cause and created causes that god
could produce all such effects without any created causeswe must
distinguish some such effects he could not produce without created
causes for such production would be selfcontradictory he could not
produce for instance a volition except as the act of a created will or
a thought except as the act of a created intellect or a vital change
except as the act of a living creature but apart from such cases which
would involve an intrinsic impossibility god could of course produce
without created agents the effects which he does produce through their
created efficiency it is however not a question of what could be but
of what actually is and we think that the arguments already set forth
prove conclusively that creatures are not de facto the inert inactive
aimless and unmeaning things they would be if occasionalism were the true
interpretation of the universe of our actual experience but that these
creatures are in a true sense efficient causes and that just as by their
very coexistence with god as contingent beings they do not derogate
from his infinite actuality but rather show forth his infinity so by
their cooperation with him as subordinate and dependent efficient causes
they do not derogate from his supremacy as first cause but rather show
forth the infinite and inexhaustible riches of his wisdom and omnipotence
chapter xv final causes universal order
106 two conceptions of experience the mechanical and the
teleologicalwe have seen that all change in the universe demands for its
explanation certain real principles viz passive potentiality
actualization and active power or efficiency in other words that it
points to material formal and efficient causes do these principles
suffice to explain the course of nature to the inquiring mind mechanists
say yes these principles explain it so far as it is capable of
explanation teleologists say no these principles do not of themselves
account for the universe of our experience this universe reveals itself
as a cosmos hence it demands for its explanation real principles or
causes of another sort final causes the existence of which implies
purpose plan or design and therefore also intelligence
the problem whether or not the universe manifests the existence and
influence of final causes has been sometimes formulated in this striking
fashion is it that birds have wings in order to fly or is it merely that
they fly because they have wings such a graphic statement of the problem
is misleading for it suggests that the alternatives are mutually
exclusive that we must vote either for final causes or for efficient
causes as a matter of fact we accept both efficient causes account for
the course of nature but they need to be determined by the influence of
final causes moreover the question how far this influence of final
causes extendsfinality finalitas as it is technically termedis a
secondary question nor does the advocate of final causality in the
universe undertake to decide its nature and scope in every instance and
detail any more than the physical scientist does to point out all the
physical laws embodied in an individual natural event or the biologist to
say whether a doubtful specimen of matter is organic or inorganic or
whether a certain sort of living cell is animal or vegetable the
teleologists thesis as against that of mechanism is simply that there
are final causes in the universe that the universe does really manifest
the presence and influence of final causes501
there are two ways however of conceiving this influence as permeating
the universe the conception of final causality in general is as we shall
see the conception of acting for an end from a motive with a
purpose plan or design for the attainment of something it implies
arrangement ordination adaptation of means to ends 55 now at least
there appears to be pervading the universe everywhere and directing its
activities such an adaptation the admirable equilibrium of forces which
secures the regular motions of the heavenly bodies the exact mixture of
gases which makes our atmosphere suitable for organic life the distance
and relative positions of the sun and the earth which secure conditions
favourable to organic life the chemical transformations whereby inorganic
elements and compounds go to form the living substance of plants and are
thus prepared for assimilation as food by animal organisms the
wonderfully graded hierarchy of living species in the animate world and
the mutual interdependence of plants and animals the endless variety of
instincts which secure the preservation and wellbeing of living
individuals and species most notably the adaptability and adaptation of
other mundane creatures to human uses by man himselfinnumerable facts
such as these convince us that the things of the universe are useful to
one another that they are constituted and disposed in relation to one
another as if they had been deliberately chosen to suit one another to
fit in harmoniously together in mutual coordination and subordination so
that by their interaction and interdependence they work out a plan or
design and subserve as means to definite ends this suitability of
things relatively to one another this harmony of the nature and
activity of each with the nature and activity of every other we may
designate as extrinsic finality the creator has willed so to arrange
and dispose all creatures in conditions of space and time that such
harmonious but purely extrinsic relations of mutual adaptation do de
facto obtain and continue to prevail between them under his guidance
but are these creatures themselves in their own individual natures
equally indifferent to any definite mode of action so that the orderly
concurrence of their activities is due to an initial collocation and
impulse divinely impressed upon them from without and not to any
purposive principle intrinsic to themselves individually descartes
leibniz and certain supporters of the theory of atomic dynamism regarding
the constitution of matter while recognizing a relative and extrinsic
finality in the universe in the sense explained seem to regard the
individual agencies of the universe as mere efficient causes not of
themselves endowed with any immanent intrinsic directive principle of
their activities and so contributing by mere extrinsic arrangement to the
order of the universe scholastic philosophers on the contrary following
the thought of aristotle502 consider that every agency in the universe
is endowed with an intrinsic principle of finality which constantly
directs its activities towards the realization of a perfection which is
proper to it and which constitutes its intrinsic end 4546 and while
each thus tends to its own proper perfection by the natural play of its
activities each is so related to all others that they simultaneously
realize the extrinsic purpose which consists in the order and harmony of
the whole universe thus the extrinsic and relative finality whereby all
conspire to constitute the universe a cosmos is secondary and posterior
and subordinate to the deeper intrinsic immanent and absolute finality
whereby each individual created nature moves by a tendency or law of its
being towards the realization of a good which perfects it as its
natural end
in order to understand the nature of this intrinsic and extrinsic finality
in the universe and to vindicate its existence against the philosophy of
mechanism we must next analyse the concept and investigate the
influence of what are called final causes
107 the concept of final cause its objective validity in all nature
classification of final causeswhen we speak of the end of the year or
the end of a wall we mean the extreme limit or ultimate point and the
term conveys no notion of a cause similarly were a person to say i have
got to the end of my work we should understand him to mean simply that
he had finished it but when people act deliberately and as intelligent
beings they usually act for some conscious purpose with some object
in view for the achievement or attainment of something they continue to
act until they have attained this object when they have attained it they
cease to act its attainment synchronizes with the end of their action
taking this term in the sense just illustrated probably this is the
reason why the term end has been extended from its original sense to
signify the object for the attainment of which an intelligent agent
acts this object of conscious desire induces the agent to seek it and
because it thus influences the agent to act it verifies the notion of a
cause it is a final cause an end in the causal sense for
instance a young man wishes to become a medical doctor the art of
healing is the end he wishes to secure for this purpose he pursues a
course of studies and passes certain examinations these acts whereby he
qualifies himself by obtaining a certain fund of knowledge and skill are
means to the end intended by him he need not desire these preparatory
labours for their own sake but he does desire them as useful for his
purpose as means to his end in so far as he wills them as means he
wills them not for their own sake but because of the end propter finem
he apprehends the end as a good he intends its attainment he
elects or selects certain acts or lines of action as means suitable
for this purpose an end or final cause therefore may be defined as
something apprehended as a good and which because desired as such
influences the will to choose some action or line of action judged
necessary or useful for the attainment of this good hence aristotles
definition of end as    id cujus gratia aliquid fit that for
the sake of which an agent acts
the end understood in this sense is a motive of action not only would
the action not take place without the agents intending the end showing
the latter to be a conditio sine qua non but more than this the end
as a good apprehended and willed has a positive influence on the
ultimate effect or issue so that it is really a cause
man is conscious of this finality or influence of final causes on his
own deliberate actions as an intelligent being he acts for ends and
orders or regulates his actions as means to those ends so much so that
when we see a mans acts his whole conduct utterly unrelated to rational
ends wholly at variance and out of joint with the usual ends of
intelligent human activity we take it as an indication of loss of reason
insanity furthermore man is free he chooses the ends for which he
acts he acts electiv propter fines
but in the domain of animal life and activity is there any evidence of the
influence of final causes most undoubtedly watch the movements of
animals seeking their prey observe the wide domain of animal instincts
study the elaborate and intricate lines of action whereby they protect and
foster and preserve their lives and rear their young and propagate their
species could there be clearer or more abundant evidence that in all this
conduct they are influenced by objects which they apprehend and seek
as sensible goods not that they can conceive in the abstract the ratio
bonitatis in these things or freely choose them as good for they are
incapable of abstract thought and consequent free choice but that these
sensible objects apprehended by them in the concrete do really influence
or move their sense appetites to desire and seek them and the influence
of an object on sense appetite springs from the goodness of this object
44 45 they tend towards apprehended goods they act apprehensiv
propter fines503
finally even in the domains of unconscious agencies of plant life and
inorganic nature we have evidence of the influence of final causes for
here too we witness innumerable varied complex everrenewed activities
constantly issuing in results useful to and good for the agents which
elicit them operations which contribute to the development and
perfection of the natures of these agents 46 now if similar effects
demand similar causes how can we refuse to recognize even in these
activities of physical nature the influence of final causes whenever and
wherever we find a great and complex variety of active powers forces
energies issuing invariably in effects which suit and develop and perfect
the agents in questionin a word which are good for these
agentswhether the latter be conscious or unconscious does not reason
itself dictate to us that all such domains of action must be subject to
the influence of final causes of course it would be mere unreflecting
anthropomorphism to attribute to unconscious agencies a conscious
subjection to the attracting and directing influence of such causes but
the recognition of such influence in this domain implies no nave
supposition of that sort it does however imply this very reasonable
view that there must be some reason or ground in the nature or
constitution of even an inanimate agent for its acting always in a uniform
manner conducive to its own development and perfection that there must
be in the nature of each and every one of the vast multitude of such
agents which make up the whole physical universe a reason or ground for
each cooperating constantly and harmoniously with all the others to
secure and preserve that general order and regularity which enables us to
pronounce the universe not a chaos but a cosmos now that ground or
reason in things whereby they act in such a mannernot indifferently
chaotically capriciously aimlessly unintelligibly but definitely
regularly reliably purposively intelligiblyis a real principle of
their natures impressing on their natures a definite tendency directive
of their activities towards results which as being suited to these
natures bear to these latter the relation of final causes a directive
principle need not itself be conscious the inner directive principle of
inanimate agents towards what is good for them what perfects them
what is therefore in a true and real sense their end 45 46 is not
conscious but in virtue of it they act as if they were conscious nay
intelligent ie they act executiv propter fines
    of course the existence of this principle in inanimate agencies
    necessarily implies intelligence this indeed is our very
    contention against the whole philosophy of mechanism positivism
    and agnosticism but is this intelligence really identical with
    the agencies of nature so that all the phenomena of experience
    which constitute the cosmos or universe are but phases in the
    evolution of one sole reality which is continually manifesting
    itself under the distinct aspects of nature and mind or is this
    intelligence though virtually immanent in the universe really
    distinct from itreally transcendenta supreme intelligence
    which has created and continues to conserve this universe and
    govern all its activities this is a distinct question it is the
    question of monism or theism as an ultimate interpretation of
    human experience
we conclude then that what we call finality or the influence of final
causes pervades the whole universe that in the domain of conscious
agents it is conscious instinctive when it solicits sense appetite
voluntary when it solicits intelligent will that in the domain of
unconscious agencies it is not conscious but natural or physical
soliciting the nature or appetitus naturalis of these agencies
before inquiring into the nature of final causality we may indicate
briefly the main divisions of final causes some of these concern the
domain of human activity and are of importance to ethics rather than to
ontology
a we have already distinguished between intrinsic and extrinsic
finality an intrinsic final cause is an end or object which perfects the
nature itself of the agent which tends towards it nourishment for
instance is an intrinsic end in relation to the living organism an
extrinsic final cause is not one towards which the nature of the agent
immediately tends but one which intended by some other agent is de
facto realized by the tendency of the former towards its own intrinsic
end thus the general order of the universe is an extrinsic end in
relation to each individual agency in the universe it is an end intended
by the creator and de facto realized by each individual agency acting in
accordance with its own particular nature
b very similar to this is the familiar distinction between the finis
operis and the finis operantis the former is the end necessarily and
de facto realized by the act itself by its very nature independently
of any other end the agent may have expressly intended to attain by means
of it the latter is the end expressly intended by the agent and which
may vary for one and the same kind of act for instance the finis
operis of an act of almsgiving is the actual aiding of the mendicant the
finis operantis may be charity or selfdenial or vanity or whatever
other motive influences the giver
c akin to those also is the distinction between an unconscious or
physical or natural end and a conscious or mental or intentional
end the former is that towards which the nature or appetitus
naturalis of unconscious agencies tends the latter is an end
apprehended by a conscious agent
d an end may be either ultimate or proximate or intermediate an
ultimate end is one which is sought for its own sake as contrasted with
an intermediate end which is willed rather as a means to the former and
with a proximate end which is intended last and sought first as a means to
realizing the others it should be noted that proximate and intermediate
ends in so far as they are sought for the sake of some ulterior end are
not ends at all but rather means only in so far as they present some good
desirable for its own sake are they properly ends or final causes
furthermore an ultimate end may be such absolutely or relatively
absolutely if it cannot possibly be subordinated or referred to any
ulterior or higher good relatively if though ultimate in a particular
order as compared with means leading up to it it is nevertheless capable
of being subordinated to a higher good though not actually referred to
this latter by any explicit volition of the agent that seeks it
e we can regard the end for which an agent acts either
objectivelyfinis objectivusor formallyfinis
formalis the former is the objective good itself which the agent
wishes to realize possess or enjoy the latter is the act whereby the
agent formally secures appropriates unites himself with this objective
good thus god himself is the objective happiness beatitudo objectiva
of man while mans actual possession of or union with god by knowledge
and love is mans formal happiness beatitudo formalis
f we may distinguish also between the real end finis qui or
cujus and the personal end finis cui the former is the
good which the agent desires the good for the sake of which cujus
gratia he acts the latter is the subject or person to whom he wishes
this good or for whom he wishes to procure it thus a labourer may
work to earn a sustenance for himself or also for his family the
real and the personal end are never willed separately but always as one
concrete good
g the distinction between a principal end and an accessory end
motivum impulsivum is obvious the former can move to act of itself
without the latter but the latter strengthens the influence of the
former a really charitable person while efficaciously moved to give alms
by sympathy with the poor may not be uninfluenced by vanity to let others
know of his charity
    h finally we may note the theological distinction between the
    natural end and the supernatural end of man as a rational
    and moral agent the former is the end due to mans nature the
    latter is an end which is gratuitous and undue to his nature god
    might not have created the world or man and in this sense even
    the natural end of man is a gratuitous gift of god but granted
    that god did decree to create the world and man an end
    corresponding to mans nature and powers was due to him the
    knowledge service and love of god as known to man by the light of
    natural reason but as a matter of fact god in his actual
    providence has decreed for man an incomparably higher and purely
    gratuitous end an end revealed to man by god himself an end
    entirely undue not only to man but to any and every possible
    creature the beatific vision of the divine essence for ever in
    heaven
108 causality of the final cause relation of the latter to efficient
formal and material causeswe can best analyse the influence of the
final cause by studying this influence as exerted on conscious and
intelligent agents the final cause has a positive influence of some sort
on the production happening actualization of effects what is the nature
of this influence the final cause exerts its influence by being a 
good an apprehended good it exerts this influence on the appetite of
the agent soliciting the latter to perform certain acts for the
realization attainment possession or enjoyment of this good but it
must not be conceived as the efficient cause of this movement of the
appetite nor may its influence be conceived as action an efficient
cause must actually exist in order to act but when the final cause as an
apprehended good exerts its influence on the appetite it is not yet
actual not until the agent by his action has realized the end and
actually attained it does the end as a good actually exist we must
distinguish between the end as attained and the end as intended
between the finis in executione and the finis in intentione it is not
the end as attained that is a final cause as attained it is an effect
pure and simple it is the end as intended that is a final cause and as
intended it does not yet actually exist hence its influence cannot be by
way of action perhaps it is the idea or cognition of the intended
end that exerts the peculiar influence of final cause no the idea or
cognition of the end actually exists no doubt in the conscious agent
but this is only a condition a conditio sine qua non for the
apprehended good the final cause to exert its influence nil volitum
nisi praecognitum it is not the cognition of the good however that
moves the agent to act it is not the idea of the good that the agent
desires or strives for but the good itself it is the good itself the
known good that exerts the influence and this influence consists in the
passive inclination or attraction or tendency of the appetite
towards the good a tendency which necessarily results from the very
presence of the good not really or physically of course but
representatively mentally intentionally by esse intentionale
cf 4 in the agents consciousness and which is formally the
actualization of the causal power or influence of the final cause just
as the efficient cause influences by acting says st thomas504 so
the final cause influences by being yearned for and desired
looked at from the side of the agent that undergoes it this influence is
a passive yielding this next becomes an active motion of appetite
and in the case of free will a deliberate act of intending the end
followed by acts of choosing means and finally by acts commanding the
executive faculties to employ these means
looked at from the side of the final cause the influence consists in an
attraction of appetite towards union with itself as a good the matter
cannot be analysed much further nor will imagination images help us here
any more than in the case of efficient causality it must be noted
however that the influence of the final cause is the influence not of a
reality as actual or in its esse actuale but of a reality as present
to a perceiving mind or in its esse intentionale at the same time it
would be a mistake to infer from this that the influence of the final
cause is not real it is sometimes described as intentional causality
causalitas intentionalis but this must not be taken to mean that it
is not real for it is not the esse intentionale of the good ie
the cognition of the good its presence in the mind or consciousness of
the agent that moves the latters appetite it is the apprehended good
apprehended as real as possible of actual attainment that moves the
agent to act the influence may not be physical in the sense of being
productive of or interchangeable with or measurable by corporeal
energy or in terms of mechanical work nor is it but it is none the less
real
but if the influence of a final cause really reaches to the effect of the
agents actions only through the medium of the latters appetite and
therefore through a link of intentional causality does it not at once
follow that the attribution of final causality to the domain of
unconscious and inorganic activities can be at best merely metaphorical
the attribution to such agencies of an appetitus naturalis is
intelligible indeed as a striking and perhaps not unpoetic metaphor but
to contend that it is anything more than a metaphor to claim seriously
that inanimate agencies are swayed and influenced by endsis not this
really to substitute mysticism and mystery for rational speculation and
analysis
mechanists are wont to dismiss the doctrine of final causes in the
physical universe with offhand charges of this kind they are but too
ready to attribute it to a mystical attitude of mind final causes they
say are not discovered in inanimate nature by the cold calculating
unemotional analysis to which reason submits its activities but are read
into it by minds which allow themselves to be prompted by the imagination
and emotions to personify and anthropomorphize inanimate agencies the
accusation is as plausible as it is unjust it is plausible because the
attribution of final causes to inanimate nature and of an appetitus
naturalis to its agencies seems to imply the recognition of
conscious mental intentional influence in this domain but it really
implies nothing of the sort and hence the injustice of the charge what
it does imply is the existence of a genuine analogy between the nature
and natural activities of physical agencies on the one hand and the
appetite and appetitive activities of conscious agencies on the other the
existence of this analogy is absolutely undeniable the orderly
invariable and uniformly suitable character of physical activities simply
forces our reason to recognize in physical agencies natures which tend
towards their development and which by their activities attain to what is
good for them to what perfects them in other words we have to
recognize that each by its natural line of activity attains to results
that are good and useful to it just as if it apprehended them as such
and consciously tended towards them the analogy is there and the
recognition of it so far from being a mystic interpretation of facts
is an elementary logical exercise of our reasoning faculty the
scholastics emphasized their recognition of the analogy by calling the
nature of an unconscious agentthe principle of its active tendencies
towards the realization of its own perfectionan appetitus naturalis
an expression into which no one familiar with scholastic terminology would
venture to read any element of mysticism505
every separate agency in nature has a uniform mode of activity by
following out this line of action each cooperates with all the others in
maintaining the orderly course of nature these are facts which call for
explanation they are not explained by the supposition of mechanists that
these agencies are mere efficient causes efficient causality does not
account for order it has got simply nothing to do with order or
regularity consequently the last word of the mechanical philosophy on the
fact of order in the universe isagnosticism in opposition to this
attitude we are far from contending that there is no mystery or that all
is clear either in regard to the fact of change or the fact of
regularity just as we cannot explain everything in efficient
causality so neither can we explain everything in final causality but
we do contend that the element of order development evolution even in
the physical universe can be partially explained by recognizing in its
several agencies a nature a principle of development a passive
inclination implanted in the very being of these agencies by the
intelligent author of their being
in conscious agencies this inclination or tendency to actions conformable
or connatural to their being is not always in act it is aroused by
conscious cognition perception or imagination of a good and operates
intermittently in unconscious agencies it is congenital and constantly in
act ie as a tendency not as actually operative for its actual
development due conditions of environment are required the seed will not
grow without a suitable soil temperature moisture etc in conscious
agencies the tendency considered entitatively or as a reality in them is
an accidental form in unconscious agencies it is their forma
substantialis the formative substantial principle which determines the
specific type to which their nature belongs506
in all agencies the inclination or appetite or tendency to action arises
from a form an elicited appetite from an intentional form a natural
appetite from a natural form omnis inclinatio seu appetitus
consequitur formam appetitus elicitus formam intentionalem appetitus
naturalis formam naturalem the scholastic view that final causality
pervades all things is expressed in the aphorism omne agens agit propter
finem every agency acts for an end
from our analysis of final causality it will be seen that the end
becomes a cause by exercising its influence on the agent or efficient
cause and thus initiating the action of the latter we have seen already
that material and formal causes exercise their causality dependently on
the efficient cause of the change or effect produced by the latter we now
see that the final cause the end as intended determines the action of
the efficient cause hence its causality holds the primacy as compared
with that of the other causes it is in this sense the cause of causes
causa causarum507 but while the end as intended is the starting
point of the whole process the end as attained is the ultimate term of
the latter hence the scholastic aphorism finis est primus in intentione
et ultimus in executione and this is true where the process involves a
series of acts attaining to means subordinate to an end this latter is
the first thing intended and the last attained
the final cause the end as intended is extrinsic to the effect it is
intrinsic to the efficient cause it is a forma or determinative
principle of the latter a forma intentionalis in conscious agents a
forma naturalis in unconscious agents
109 nature and the laws of nature character and grounds of their
necessity and universality scientific determinism and philosophic
fatalismby the term nature we have seen that aristotle and the
scholastics meant the essence or substance of an agent regarded as inner
principle of the latters normal activities as determining the bent or
inclination of these and therefore as in a real sense their final cause
hence aristotles definition of nature as a certain principle or cause
of the motion and rest of the thing in which that principle is rooted
fundamentally and essentially and not merely accidentally508 the
scholastics recognizing that this intentio naturae this subjection to
finality in unconscious agencies must be the work and the index of
intelligence in other words that this analogical finality in inanimate
things must connote a proper finality a properly purposive mode of
action in the author of these things conceived this nature or
intentio naturae as the impression of a divine art or plan upon the very
being of all creatures by the creator himself hence st thomass profound
and wellknown description of nature as the principle of a divine art
impressed upon things in virtue of which they move towards determinate
ends defining art as the just conception  of external works to be
accomplished509 he observes that nature is a sort of art as if a
shipbuilder were to endow his materials with the power of moving and
adapting themselves so as to form or construct a ship510 and elsewhere
he remarks that nature differs from art only in this that the former is an
intrinsic the latter an extrinsic principle of the work which is
accomplished through its influence so that if the art whereby a ship is
constructed were intrinsic to the materials the ship would be constructed
by nature as it actually is by art511
such then is the teleological conception of the nature of each
individual agency in the universe when we speak of universal nature
external nature physical nature the course of nature the
laws of nature etc we are using the term in a collective sense to
signify the sumtotal of all the agencies which constitute the whole
physical universe and furthermore in all such contexts we usually
understand by nature the world of corporeal things as distinct from
the domain of mind or spirit
the proof of this viewthat the agencies of the physical universe are not
merely efficient causes but that they act under the influence of ends
that they have definite lines of action which are natural to them and
whereby they realize their own individual development and the maintenance
of the universe as a cosmos that by doing so they reveal the influence
of intelligent purposethe proof of this view lies as we have seen in
the fact that their activities are regular uniform and mutually useful
or in other words that they are productive of order 110 bearing
this in mind let us inquire into the various meanings discernible in the
very familiar expressions laws of nature physical laws natural
laws512
we may understand firstly by a law of nature this innate tendency we have
been describing as impressed upon the very being of all created things by
the creator it is in this sense we speak of a thing acting naturally
or according to the law of its nature or according to its nature
when we see it acting according to what we conceive to be the end intended
for it acting in a manner conducive to the development of its own
individuality the preservation of its specific type or kind and the
fulfilment of its rle in the general scheme of things what this
natural mode of action is for this particular kind of thing we gather
from our experience of the regular or normal activity of things of its
kind thus we say it is a law of oxygen and hydrogen to combine in
definite proportions under suitable conditions to form water a law of
all particles of matter in the universe to tend to move towards one
another with a definite acceleration a law of living organisms to
reproduce their kind this usage comes nearest to the original meaning of
the term law a precept or command imposed on intelligent agents by a
superior for we conceive this natural tendency impressed on physical
agencies by the creator after the analogy of a precept or command and we
have good reason to do so because uniformity of conduct in intelligent
agents is the normal result of their obedience to a law imposed upon them
and we see in the activities of the physical universe an allpervading
feature of regularity
secondly we transfer the term law to this result itself of the
natural tendency of the being of the convergence of its activities
towards its end that is to say we call the uniform mode of action of
an agent a law of nature a natural or physical law this usage
which is common in the positive sciences implies a less profound a more
superficial but a perfectly legitimate mode of apprehending and studying
the changes and phenomena of the physical universe
thirdly since the several agencies of the universe coexist in time and
space since they constantly interact on one another since for the
exercise of the natural activities of each certain extrinsic conditions
of relationship with its environment must be fulfilled an accurate
knowledge and exact formulation of these relations are obviously requisite
for a scientific and practical insight into the mode of activity of any
natural agency in fact the physical scientist may and does take for
granted the natural tendency and the uniformity of action resulting
therefrom and confines himself to discovering and formulating the
relations between any given kind of action and the extrinsic conditions
requisite for its exercise such for instance would be any chemical
law setting forth the measure and the conditions of temperature
pressure etc in which certain chemical elements combine to form a
certain chemical compound to all such formulae scientists give the title
of physical laws or laws of physical nature these formulae
descriptive of the manner in which a phenomenon takes place setting forth
with the greatest possible quantitative exactness the phenomenal
factors513 that enter into and precede and accompany it are laws in a
still more superficial and still less philosophical sense but a sense
which is most commonlyand justlyaccepted in the positive or physical
sciences
    before examining the feature and characteristic of necessity and
    universality which enters into all these various conceptions of a
    physical law we have here to observe that it would make for
    clearness and for a better understanding between physics and
    metaphysics between science and philosophy between the
    investigator who seeks by observation and experiment for the
    proximate phenomenal conditions and physical causes of
    phenomena and the investigator who seeks for the ultimate real
    ground and explanation of these latter by speculative analysis of
    them and by reasoning from the scientists discoveries about
    themif it were understood and agreed that investigation into the
    scope and significance and ultimate ground of this feature of
    stability in the laws of physical nature belongs to the
    philosopher rather than to the scientist we have already called
    attention to the fact that the propriety of such an obviously
    reasonable and intelligible division of labour is almost
    universally admitted in theory both by scientists and by
    philosophers though unfortunately it is not always remembered
    in practice 100
    in theory the scientist assumes and very properly assumes that
    the agencies with which he deals are not capricious unreliable
    irregular but stable reliable regular in their mode of action
    that in similar sets of conditions and circumstances they will act
    uniformly without inquiring into the ultimate grounds of this
    assumption he premises that all his conclusions all his inductive
    generalizations about the activity of these agencies will hold
    good of these latter just in so far as they do act according to
    his general postulate as to their regularity he then proceeds by
    the inductive processes of hypothesis and experimental
    verification to determine what agencies produce such or such an
    event under what conditions they bring this about what are all
    the phenomenal conditions positive and negative antecedent and
    concomitant in the absence of any one of which this event will
    not happen and in the presence of all of which it will happen
    these are in accordance with his assumption determining causes
    of the event the knowledge of them is from the speculative point
    of view extremely important and from the practical standpoint of
    invention and applied science extremely useful as a scientist he
    has no other knowledge in view he aims at discovering the how
    the quomodo of natural phenomenahow for instance under what
    conditions and in what measure water is produced from oxygen and
    hydrogen when he has discovered all these positive and negative
    conditions his scientific knowledge of the formation of water is
    complete
    but there are other questions in regard to natural phenomena to
    which the experimental methods of the positive sciences can offer
    no reply they can tell us nothing about the wider how which
    resolves itself into a why they can give no information about
    the ultimate causes origins reasons or essences of those
    phenomena as pasteur and other equally illustrious scientists
    have proclaimed experimental science is essentially positive
    ie confined to the proximate phenomenal conditions and causes
    of things it has nothing to say nor has it any need or any right
    to say anything about the ultimate nature or first origin or
    final destiny of the things and events of the universe
    yet such questions arise and clamour insistently for solution
    how is it or why is it that natural phenomena are uniformly
    linked to certain other phenomenal antecedents or physical
    causes is it absolutely impossible inconceivable that this
    sequence should be found not to obtain in even a single individual
    instance why should there be such uniform sequences or laws
    at all are there exceptions or can there be exceptions to these
    laws of physical nature what is the character and what are the
    grounds of the necessity of these laws every living organism
    comes from a living cellnot from any living cell but from
    some particular kind of living cell but why are there such
    kinds of cells why are there living cells at all whence their
    first origin again granted that there are different kinds or
    types of living cells why should a particular kind of cell give
    rise by division and evolution to an organism of the same kind
    or type as the parent organisms why does it not always do so
    why are what biologists describe as monsters in the organic
    kingdom possible and why since they are possible are they not
    as numerous as what are recognized as the normal types or kinds of
    living organisms
    now these are questions in regard to which not only every
    professing physical scientist and every professing metaphysician
    but every thinking man must take up some attitude or other a
    refusal to consider them on the plea that they are insoluble is
    just as definite an attitude as any other nor by assuming this
    attitude does any man even though he be a specialist in some
    department of the positive or physical sciences escape being a
    metaphysician or a philosopher however much he may deprecate
    such titles for he is taking up a reasoned attitudewe presume it
    is such and not the outcome of mere prejudiceon ultimate
    questions and this is philosophy this is metaphysics when
    therefore a physical scientist either avows or insinuates that
    because the methods of physical science which are suitable for
    the discovery of the proximate causes of phenomena can tell him
    nothing about ultimate questions concerning these phenomena
    therefore there is nothing to be known about these questions he
    is not only committing himself nolens volens to definite
    philosophical views but he is doing a serious disservice to
    physical science itself by misconceiving and misstating its
    rightful scope and limits he has just an equal right with any
    other man to utilize the established truths of physical science to
    help him in answering ultimate questions nay he may even use the
    unverified hypotheses and systematic conceptions514 of physical
    science for what they are worth in helping him to determine his
    general worldview but his competence as a specialist in physical
    science does not confer upon him any special qualification for
    estimating the value of these truths and hypotheses as evidence in
    the domain of ultimate problems nor can he because he is a
    scientist or even because he may go so far as to assert the right
    of speaking in the name of science claim for his particular
    interpretation the privilege of exemption from criticism and this
    is true no matter what his interpretation may bewhether it be
    agnosticism mechanism teleologism monism or theism these
    observations may appear elementary and obvious but the
    insinuation of positivism and phenomenism that whatever is not
    itself phenomenal and verifiable by the experimental methods of
    the physical sciences is in no wise knowable and the insinuation
    of mechanists that their worldview is the only one compatible
    with the truths of science and therefore the only scientific
    philosophy justify us in reiterating and emphasizing even such
    obvious methodological considerations bearing them in mind let
    us now examine the uniformity and necessity of the laws of
    physical nature
understanding by natural law the natural inclination or tendency of the
creature to a definite line of activity this law is of itself determining
or necessitating moreover it is absolutely inseparable from the essence
of the creature granted that the creature exists it has this tendency to
exert and direct all its forces and energies in a definite normal way
for the realization of its end this nisus naturae is never absent it
is observable even where as in the generation of monsters by living
organisms it partially fails to attain its end a law of nature taken in
this sense is absolutely necessary to and inseparable from the created
agent it admits of no exceptions no agent can exist without it for it
is identical with the very being of the agent
but the uniformity of action resulting from this natural tendency the
uniform series of normal operations whereby it realizes its end is not
absolutely necessary inviolable unexceptional in the first place the
author of nature can for a higher or moral purpose prevent any created
agency supernaturally miraculously from actually exercising its active
powers in accordance with its nature for the prosecution of its natural
end but apart altogether from this abstracting from all special
interference of the first cause and confining our attention to the
natural order itself we have to consider that for any physical agency to
act in its natural or normal manner certain extrinsic conditions are
always requisite oxygen and hydrogen for instance will combine to
produce water but only under certain conditions of contact pressure
temperature etc this general requirement arises from the fact already
mentioned that physical agencies coexist in time and space and are
constantly interacting these extrinsic conditions are of course not
expressly stated in the formulation of those uniformities and quantitative
descriptions called laws of nature in the second and third
interpretations of this expression as explained above it is taken as
understood that the law applies only if and when and where all such
conditions are verified the law therefore as stated categorically does
not express an absolutely necessary universal and unexceptional truth
it may admit of exceptions
in the next place when we come to examine these exceptions to uniformity
these failures or frustrations of the normal or natural activities of
physical agencies we find it possible to distinguish roughly with
aristotle between two groups of such uniformities or laws there are
firstly those which so far as our experience goes seem to prevail
always  unexceptionally and secondly those which seem to prevail
generally for the most part    though not
unexceptionally the former would be the outcome of active powers
energies forces de facto present and prevalent always and everywhere
in all physical agencies and of such a character that the conditions
requisite for their actual operation would be always verified such for
instance would be the force of gravity in all ponderable matter and
hence the law of gravitation is regarded as allpervading universal
unexceptional but there are other natural or normal effects which are the
outcome of powers forces energies not allpervading but restricted to
special groups of agencies dependent for their actual production on the
presence of a great and complex variety of extrinsic conditions and
liable therefore to be impeded by the interfering action of numerous other
natural agencies such for instance would be the natural powers and
processes whereby living organisms propagate their kind the law
therefore which states it to be a uniformity of nature that living
organisms reproduce offspring similar to themselves in kind is a general
law admitting exceptions
operations and effects which follow from the nature of their causes are
called natural      515 some causes
produce their natural effects always      
others produce their natural effects usually as a general rule  
  516 operations and effects which are produced by the
interfering influence of extrinsic agencies   violent as
opposed to natural and not in accordance with the nature of their
principal cause are called by aristotle accidental   
   and these he remarks people commonly describe
as due to chance       517
all are familiar with events or happenings described as fortuitous
accidental exceptional unexpected with things happening by
chance by good or bad luck or fortune518 there are terms in
all languages expressive of this experiencecasus sors fortuna
 etc the notion underlying all of them is that of something
occurring unintentionally praeter intentionem agentis whether chance
effects result from the action of intelligent agents or from the operation
of physical causes they are not intendedby the deliberate purpose of
the intelligent agent in the one case or by the natural tendency the
intentio naturae of the mere physical agency in the other such an
effect therefore has not a natural cause hence it is considered
exceptional and is always more or less unexpected nature as
aristotle rightly observes519 never produces a chance effect his
meaning is that whenever such an effect occurs it is not brought about in
accordance with the natural tendency of any physical agency it results
from a collision or coincidence of two or more such agencies each acting
according to its nature the hunters act of firing at a wild fowl is an
intentional act the boys act of coming into the thicket to gather wild
flowers is an intentional act the accidental shooting of the boy is the
result of a coincidence of the two intentional acts similarly each of
all the various agencies which bring about the development of an embryo in
the maternal womb has its own immediate and particular natural effect and
only mediately contributes to the general effect of bringing the embryo to
maturity as a rule these particular effects are favourable to the general
effect but sometimes the immediate ends do not subserve this ulterior
purpose the result is accidental exceptional a deviation from the
normal type an anomaly a monster in the domain of living organisms
aristotles analysis correct so far is incomplete it assigns no
ultimate explanation of the fact that there are such encounters of
individual natural tendencies in the universe such failures in the
subordination of particular ends to wider ulterior ends as a matter of
fact these chance effects although not intended by the natures of
individual created agencies are not wholly and entirely unintended they
are not wholly aimless they enter into the general plan and scheme of
things as known and willed by the author of nature they are known to his
intelligence and willed and ruled by his providence for him there can be
no such thing as chance effects that are accidental in relation to
created causes effects that run counter to the nature or intentio
naturae of these are foreseen and willed by him and made to subserve
that wider and more general end which is the universal order of the world
that he has actually willed to create it is only in relation to the
natures of individual agencies and to the limited horizon of our finite
intelligences that such phenomena can present the aspect of fortuitous or
chance occurrences
before passing on to deal in our concluding section with the great fact
of order let us briefly compare with the foregoing explanation of nature
and its laws the attempt of mechanists to explain these without
recognizing in the physical universe any influence of final causes or any
indication of a purposive intelligence we have ventured to describe their
attitude as philosophic fatalism520 according to their view there is no
ground for the distinction between phenomena that happen naturally and
phenomena that happen accidentally or by chance all alike happen by
the same kind of general necessity the generation of a monster is as
natural as the generation of normal offspring the former when it
occurs is just as inevitably the outcome of the physical forces at work
in the particular case as the latter is the outcome of the particular set
of efficient causes which do actually produce the normal result the only
difference is that the former occurring less frequently and as the result
of a rarer and less known conjunction of physical causes than the
latter is not expected by us to occur and is consequently regarded when
it does occur as exceptional now it is quite true that what we call
chance effects or exceptional effects result just as inevitably from
the set of forces operative in their case as normal effects result from
the forces operative in theirs but this leaves for explanation something
which the mechanist cannot explain he regards a physical law merely as a
generalization beyond experience of some experienced uniformity and he
holds that all our physical laws are provisional in the sense that a wider
and deeper knowledge of the actual conditions of interaction among the
physical forces of the universe would enable us to eliminate
exceptionswhich are all apparent not realby restating our laws in such
a comprehensive way as to include all such cases we may indeed admit
that our physical laws are open to revision and restatement in this sense
and are de facto often modified in this sense by the progress of
science but the important point is this that the mechanist does not
admit the existence in physical agencies of any law in the sense of a
natural inclination towards an end or in any sense in which it would
imply intelligence design or purpose on the contrary claiming as he
does that all physical phenomena are reducible to mechanical motions of
inert masses atoms or particles of matter in space he is obliged to
regard all physical agencies as being so far as their nature is
concerned wholly indifferent to any particular form of activity521
committed to the indefensible view that all qualitative change is
reducible to quantitative 11 and all material differences to
differences in the location of material particles and in the velocity and
direction of the spatial motion impressed upon each by others extrinsic to
itself he has left himself no factors wherewith to explain the actual
order and course of the universe other than the purely indifferent
factors of essentially or naturally homogeneous particles of inert matter
endowed with local motion we emphasize this feature of indifference for
the conception of an inert particle of matter subject to mechanical motion
impressed upon it from without is the very type of an indifferent agency
what such an entity will do whether or not it will move with what
velocity and in what direction it will movein a word its entire conduct
its rle in the universe the sumtotal of its functionsnothing of all
this is dependent on itself everything depends on agencies extrinsic to
it and on its extrinsic timeandspace relations to these agencies and
these latter in turn are in the same condition as itself now is it
conceivable that agencies of this kind of themselves absolutely
indifferent to any particular kind of effect suitable or unsuitable
regular or irregular orderly or disorderly could actually produce and
maintain the existing order of the universe if they were themselves
produced by an allwise and allpowerful being and definitely
arranged in spatial relations to one another and initial mechanical
motion in definite directions and velocities impressed on the different
parts of the system there is no denying that infinite wisdom and power
could by divine concurrence even with such indifferent agencies realize
and maintain a cosmos or orderly universe such purely extrinsic
finality 106 could absolutely speaking account for the existence of
order uniformity regularity system though all the evidence furnished
by the universe of our actual experience points to the existence of
intrinsic finality also as understood by aristotle and the scholastics
but the mechanist will not allow even extrinsic finality he will not
recognize in the actual universe of our experience any evidence of a
ruling intelligence realizing a plan or design for an intelligent purpose
he denies the necessity of the inference from the data of human experience
to the existence of a guiding intelligence and what are his alternatives
he may choose one or other of two
he may restate in the more scientific and imposing terminology of modern
mechanics the crude conception of the ancient greek atomists that the
actual order of the universe is the absolutely inevitable and fatal
outcome of a certain collocation of the moving masses of the physical
universe a collocation favourable to order a collocation which just
happened to occur by some happy chance from the essentially aimless
purposeless indifferent and chaotic motions of those material masses
and particles we say chaotic for chaos is the absence of cosmos
and order is the fact that has got to be explained in the concept of
indifferent inert atoms of matter moving through space there is
emphatically no principle of order522 and hence the mechanist who will
not admit the necessity of inferring an intelligence to give these moving
masses or atoms the collocation favourable to order is forced to
explain this supposed collocation by attributing it to pure chancethe
concursus fortuitus atomorum of the ancient greeks when however we
reflect that the more numerous these atoms and the more varied and complex
their motions the smaller is the chance of a collocation favourable to
order that the atoms and motions are supposed actually to surpass any
assignable number that therefore the chance of any such favourable
collocation occurring is indefinitely smaller than any measurable
proportionwe can draw our own conclusions about the value of such a
speculation as a rational explanation of the existing cosmos and this
apart altogether from the consideration that the fact to be explained is
not merely the momentary occurrence of an orderly collocation but the
maintenance of an orderly system of cosmic phenomena throughout the
lapse of all time no orderly finite system of mechanical motions
arranged by human skill can preserve its orderly motions indefinitely
without intelligent human supervision the neglected machine will get out
of order run down wear out if left to itself and we are asked to
believe that the whole universe is one vast machine which not only goes on
without intelligent supervision but which actually made itself by
chance523
naturally such an explanation of the universe does not commend itself to
any man of serious thought whatever his difficulties may be against the
argument from the fact of order in the universe to the existence of an
intelligent designer add to this the consideration that the mechanist
theory does not even claim to account for the first origin of the
universe it postulates the existence of matter in motion in regard to
this supreme problem of the first origin of the universe the attitude of
the mechanist is avowedly agnostic and in view of what we have just
remarked about the chance theory as an explanation of the existing
order of the universe it is no matter for surprise that most mechanists
reject this theory and embrace the agnostic attitude in regard to this
latter problem also whether the agnostic attitude they assume be negative
or positive ie whether they are content to say that they themselves
at least fail to find any satisfactory rational explanation of the
origin and nature of the cosmos or contend further that no rational
solution of these problems is within the reach of the human mind their
teaching is refuted in natural theology where the theistic solution of
these problems is set forth and vindicated
110 the order of the universe a fact and its implicationsthe
considerations so far submitted in this chapter as pointing to the
existence and influence of final causes in the universe will be
strengthened and completed by a brief analysis of order and its
implications
we have seen already 55 that the apprehension of order in things implies
the recognition of some unifying principle in what is manifold what in
general is the nature of this principle it is the point of view the
standpoint from which the unifying arrangement or disposition of the
manifold is carried out in other words it is the end object or
purpose of the orderly arrangement the arrangement and the order
resulting from it will vary according to the end in viewwhether for
instance it be an arrangement of books in a library of pictures in a
gallery of materials in an edifice of parts in a machine hence st
thomass definition of order as the due adaptation of means to ends
recta ratio rerum ad finem when this adaptation is the work of human
intelligence the order realized is artificial when it is the work of
nature the order realized is natural art is an extrinsic principle of
order nature implies indeed also an intelligent extrinsic principle of
order but is itself an intrinsic principle of order the works of nature
and those of art have this feature in common that they manifest
adaptation of means to ends524
the subordination of means to ends realizes an order which has for its
unifying principle the influence of an end a final cause the group
of dynamic relations thus revealed constitutes what is called
teleological order the order of purpose or finality the
realization or execution of such an order implies the simultaneous
existence of coordinated parts or members in a system a realized whole
with complex coordinated orderly parts the principle of unity in this
system being the form of the whole this realized disposed or
constituted order is called the esthetic order 55 the order of
coordination composition constitution in ultimate analysis however
these two orders the teleological and the esthetic having as
respective unifying principles the final cause and the formal cause
are not two really distinct orders but rather two aspects of one and the
same order we have seen that in the things of nature the intrinsic end or
final cause of each is identical with its forma substantialis or formal
cause 108 but the final cause is naturally prior to the formal cause
and consequently the teleological order is more fundamental than the
esthetic
st augustines definition of order as the arrangement of a multiplicity
of things similar and dissimilar according its proper place to
each525 reveals the material cause of order in the multiplicity of
varied elements the formal cause of order in the group of relations
resulting from the arrangement or dispositio and the efficient cause
of order in the agent that disposes or arranges them the final cause
though not directly mentioned is implied in the fact that the place of
each factor in the system is necessarily determined by the function it has
to fulfil the part it is suited by its nature to play in contributing to
the realization of the end or purpose of the arrangement
if then order is the right arrangement or disposition of things
according to their destination or in the mutual relations demanded by
their ends it necessarily follows that the very existence of natural
order in the universe implies that this universe is not a work of chance
but a purposive work just as the existence of artificial order in
products of human art implies that these products are not the result of
chance but of activity influenced by final causes526
it is in fact impossible to conceive order except as resulting from the
influence of final causes right reason rejects as an utterly inadequate
explanation of the natural order of the universe the fantastic and
farfetched supposition of a chance collocation of indifferent
undetermined and aimless physical agencies527 if we find in the actual
physical universe difficulties against the view that this universe reveals
the influence of final causes such difficulties do not arise from the
fact that there is order in the universe but rather from the fact that
with this order there seems to coexist some degree of disorder also in so
far forth as there is natural order there is cogent evidence of the
influence of final causes and so necessary is this inference that even
one single authentic instance of natural order in an otherwise chaotic
universe would oblige us to infer the existence and influence of a final
cause to account for that solitary instance we mean by an authentic
instance one which evidences a real and sustained uniformity regularity
mutual coordination and subordination of factors in the behaviour of any
group of natural agencies for we allow that transient momentary
collocations and concurrences of indifferent agencies acting aimlessly
and without purpose as a matter of fact might present to our minds
accustomed to seek for orderly and purposive phenomena the deceptive
appearance of order
order then we take it necessarily implies the existence and influence
of final causes this in turn as we have already observed implies with
equal necessity the existence of intelligent purpose if then there is
natural order in the universe there must exist an intelligent will to
account for this natural order
leaving the development of this line of argument to its proper place in
natural theology there remains the simple question of fact is the
physical universe a cosmos does it reveal ordera natural order
distinct from the artificial order realized by the human mind in the
mechanical and fine arts an order therefore realized not by the human
mind but by some other mind by the divine mind the evidences of such
order superabound we have already referred to some of them 106 nor is
there any need to labour the matter two points however in connexion
with this universally recognized fact of order in the universe call for a
brief mention before we conclude they are in the nature of difficulties
against the ordinary reasonable view of the matter the view on which the
theistic argument from order is based
in accordance with the kantian theory of knowledge it is objected that the
order which we apprehend or think we apprehend in the universe is not
really in the universe of our experience but is as it were projected
into this universe by our own minds in the very process of cognition
itself it is therefore not real but only apparent not noumenal but only
phenomenal it is simply a product of the categorizing unifying
systematizing activity of our minds it is a feature of the phenomenon or
mental product ie of the noumenal datum as invested with a
category of thought but whether or not it is a characteristic of the
real universe itself mans speculative reason is by its very constitution
essentially incapable of ever discovering the theory of knowledge on
which this difficulty is based can be shown to be unsound and erroneous
for a criticism of the theory we must refer the reader to scholastic works
on epistemology it may be observed however apart from the merits or
demerits of the theory that the experienced fact of order is by no means
demolished or explained away by any questions that may be raised about the
exact location of the fact if we may so express it order is a fact an
undeniable experienced fact and it looms just as large and cries out
just as insistently for explanation with whichever of the imposing
adjectives noumenal or phenomenal a philosopher may choose to qualify
it nor do we diminish its reality by calling it phenomenal one whit more
than we increase that reality by calling it noumenal
the other difficulty arises from the existence of disorder in the
universe pessimists of the type of schopenhauer or nietzsche concentrate
their attention so exclusively on the evidences of disorder the failures
of adaptation of means to ends the defects and excesses the prodigality
and penury the pain and suffering which abound in physical naturenot to
speak of moral evilthat they become blind to all evidences of order and
proclaim all belief in order an illusion
the picture of
    nature red in tooth and claw
    with ravine528
is however the product of a morbid and distraught imagination rather
than a sane view of the facts the undeniable existence of disorder of
physical evils defects failures frustrations of natural tendency in the
universe does not obscure or conceal from the normal unbiassed mind the
equally undeniable evidences of a great and wide and generally prevailing
order nor does it conceal from such a mind the fact that the existence of
order in any measure or degree implies of necessity the existence of plan
or design and therefore of intelligent purpose also inferring from this
fact of order the existence of a supreme intelligence and inferring by
other lines of reasoning from the data of experience the dependence of the
universe on this intelligence as creator conserver and ruler the theist
is confronted with the reality of moral and physical evil 52 ie of
disorder in the universe but he does not see in this disorder anything
essentially incompatible with his established conclusion that the universe
is a finite creation of infinite wisdom and a free manifestation of the
latter to man if the actual universe is imperfect he knows that god
created it freely and might have created a more perfect or a less perfect
one knowing that god is allpowerful as he is allwise he knows that the
actual universe though imperfect absolutely is perfect relatively
in that it infallibly reveals the divine wisdom and goodness exactly in
the measure in which god has willed to reveal himself in his works
conscious on the one hand that his finite mind cannot trace in detail all
the purposes of god in nature or assign to all individual events their
divinely appointed ends he is confident on the other hand that the whole
universe is intelligible only as the working out of a divine plan and not
otherwise to his mind as a theist these lines are a clearer expression of
rationally grounded optimism than they were perhaps even to the poet who
penned them
    i trust in nature for the stable laws
    of beauty and utility spring shall plant
    and autumn garner to the end of time
    i trust in godthe right shall be the right
    and other than the wrong while he endures
    i trust in my own soul that can perceive
    the outward and the inward natures good
    and gods529
we have seen that the agencies which constitute the universal order have
each its own inner principle of finality that these agencies are not
isolated but mutually related in such ways that the ends of each subserve
an extrinsic and remoter end which is none other than this universal order
whereby we recognize the world as a cosmos the maintenance of this
order is the intrinsic end of the universe as a whole an end which is
immanent in the universe an end which is of course a good but this
universal order itself is for an end an extrinsic transcendent
end distinct from itself and this end too must be a good the
universe says st thomas530 has the good of order and another
distinct good the universal order says aristotle has itself an end a
good which is one and to which all else is ordained   
531 what can this supreme good be this absolutely ultimate
end this transcendent principle of all nature and of all natures
tendencies and activities whence comes this universal tendency of all
nature if not from the being who is the one eternal immutable prime
mover532 and whose moving influence is love533 such is the profound
thought of aristotle a thought reechoed so sublimely by the immortal
poet of christian philosophy in the closing line of the paradiso
    lamor che muove il sole e laltre stelle
the immediate factors of the universal order of nature themselves devoid
of intelligence must therefore be the work of intelligent will to
arrange these factors as parts of one harmonious whole as members of one
orderly system supreme wisdom must have conceived the plan and chosen the
means to realize it the manifestation of gods glory by the realization
of this plan such is the ultimate transcendent end of the whole created
universe the whole order of the universe writes st thomas developing
the thought of aristotle534 is for the prime mover thereof this order
has for its purpose the working out in an orderly universe of the plan
conceived and willed by the prime mover and hence the prime mover is the
principle of this universal order
the truths so briefly outlined in this closing chapter on the order and
purpose of the universe have nowhere found more apt and lucid
philosophical formulation than in the monumental writings of the angel of
the christian schools nor perhaps have they ever elsewhere appeared in a
more felicitous setting of poetic imagery than in these stanzas from the
immortal epic of the poet of the christian schools

    9 as a brief general statement of the matter this is sufficiently
      accurate and will not be misunderstood of course the general
      standpoint of ultimate causes and reasons admits within itself some
      variety of aspects thus epistemology and psychology deal with human
      thought but under different aspects psychology and ethics deal
      with human volition but under different aspects etc

   11 here is st thomas exposition and justification of the doctrine in
      the text sapientis est ordinare cujus ratio est quia sapientia
      est potissima perfectio rationis cujus proprium est cognoscere
      ordinem ordo autem quadrupliciter ad rationem comparatatur est
      enim quidam ordo quem ratio non facit sed solum considerat sicut
      est ordo rerum naturalium alius autem est ordo quem ratio
      considerando facit in proprio actu puta cum ordinat conceptus suos
      ad invicem et signa conceptuum quae sunt voces significativae
      tertius autem est quem ratio considerando facit in operationibus
      voluntatis quartus autem est ordo quem ratio considerando facit in
      exterioribus rebus quarum ipsa est causa sicut in arca et domo et
      quia consideratio rationis per habitum perficitur secundum hos
      diversos ordines quos proprie ratio considerat sunt diversae
      scientiae nam ad philosophiam naturalem pertinet considerare
      ordinem rerum quem ratio humana considerat sed non facit ita quod
      sub naturali philosophia comprehendamus et metaphysicam ordo
      autem quem ratio considerando facit in proprio actu pertinet ad
      rationalem philosophiam cujus est considerare ordinem partium
      orationis ad invicem et ordinem principiorum ad invicem et ad
      conclusiones ordo autem actionum voluntariarum pertinet ad
      considerationem moralis philosophiae ordo autem quem ratio
      considerando facit in rebus exterioribus constitutis per rationem
      humanam pertinet ad artes mechanicasin x ethic ad nichom

   19 when the term science is used nowadays in contradistinction to
      philosophy it usually signifies the knowledge embodied in what
      are called the special or positive or inductive sciencesa
      knowledge which aristotle would not regard as strictly or fully
      scientific
   20 aristotles conception of the close relation between physics or
      the philosophy of nature and those analytic studies which we
      nowadays describe as the physical sciences bears witness to the
      close alliance which he conceived to exist between sense observation
      on the one hand and rational speculation on the other this sane
      view of the continuity of human knowledge a view to which the
      schoolmen of the middle ages were ever faithful was supplanted at
      the dawn of modern philosophy in the sixteenth and seventeenth
      centuries by the opposite view which led to a divorce between
      physics and metaphysics and to a series of misunderstandings which
      still prevail with equal detriment to science and philosophy alike

   43 hence the necessity of equipping the student of philosophy with a
      knowledge of the main conclusions and theories of the sciences that
      have an immediate bearing on philosophy chemistry physics
      geology astronomy mechanics the axioms and postulates of pure and
      applied mathematics cellular biology embryology the physiology of
      the nervous system botany and zoology political economy sociology
      and ethnology nowhere is the system of combining the scientific
      with the philosophical formation of mind more thoroughly carried out
      at the present time than in the curriculum of the philosophical
      institute at the university of louvain in the college of maynooth
      not only is the study of philosophy completed by a fuller course of
      christian theologyboth disciplines thus combining to give the
      student all the essential elements of a complete philosophy of
      life iibut it is preceded by an elementary training in the
      physical sciences and accompanied by courses on the history of
      scientific theories in chemistry physics physiology and general
      biology
   44 we may mention it in passing writes mercier in his general
      introduction to philosophy logique  1 p 6it was this
      feeling of individual impotence in face of the task confronting the
      philosopher at the present day that inspired the foundation of the
      philosophical institute at the university of louvain he had
      previously outlined the project in his rapport sur les tudes
      philosophiques at the congress of mechlin in 1891 here are a few
      brief extracts from that memorable document since individual
      effort feels itself well nigh powerless in the presence of the field
      of observation which goes on widening day by day association must
      make up for the insufficiency of the isolated worker men of
      analysis and men of synthesis must come together and form by their
      daily intercourse and united action an atmosphere suited to the
      harmonious development of science and philosophy alike man has
      multiplied his power of vision he enters the world of the
      infinitely small he fixes his scrutinizing gaze upon regions where
      our most powerful telescopes discern no limits physics and
      chemistry progress with giant strides in the study of the properties
      of matter and of the combinations of its elements geology and
      astronomy reconstruct the history of the origin and formation of our
      planet biology and the natural sciences study the minute structure
      of living organisms their distribution in space and succession in
      time and embryology explores their origin the archological
      philological and social sciences reconstruct the past ages of our
      history and civilizations what an inexhaustible mine is here to
      exploit what regions to explore and materials to analyse and
      interpret finally what pioneers we must engage in the work if we
      are to have a share in garnering those treasures

   71 certain medieval philosophers had made the same mistake st thomas
      points out their error frequently cf contra gentes i c
      xxvi quia id quod commune est per additionem specificatur vel
      individuatur stimaverunt divinum esse cui nulla fit additio non
      esse aliquid proprium sed esse commune omnium non considerantes
      quod id quod commune est vel universale sine additione esse non
      potest sed sine additione consideratur non enim animal potest esse
      absque rationali vel irrationali differentia quamvis sine his
      differentiis consideretur licet enim cogitetur universale absque
      additione non tamen absque receptibilitate additionis est nam si
      animali nulla differentia addi posset genus non esset et similiter
      est de omnibus aliis nominibus divinum autem esse est absque
      additione non solum cogitatione sed etiam in rerum natura et non
      solum absque additione sed absque receptibilitate additionis unde
      ex hoc ipso quod additionem non recipit nec recipere potest magis
      concludi potest quod deus non sit esse commune sed esse proprium

      potential being presupposes actual being quamvis id quod quandoque
      est in potentia quandoque in actu prius sit tempore in potentia
      quam in actu tamen simpliciter actus est prior potentia quia

   84 the etymology of aristotles description of the essence as   
       is not easy to explain the expression   supposes a
      dative understood eg    the being proper to man
      to the question      what is the being or
      essence proper to man the answer is that which gives the
      definition of man that which explains what he is  is the
      imperfect   an archaic form for the present   or is it
      a deliberate suggestion of the profound doctrine that the essence as
      ideal or possible is anterior to its actual physical realization
      commentators are not agreed cf matthias kappes

   87 sometimes however the expression metaphysical essence is used to
      signify those objective concepts and those only without which the
      thing cannot be conceived or sometimes even the one which is
      considered most fundamental among these and therefore as not
      explicitly involving the concepts of properties which follow
      necessarily from the former while the physical essence is
      understood to signify all those real elements without which the
      thing cannot actually exist including therefore all such
      necessary properties taken in this sense the physical essence of
      man would include not merely soul and body but also such properties
      as the capacity of speech of laughter of using tools of cooking
      food etc
   88 et ex hoc patet ratio writes st thomas quare genus et species et
      differentia se habeant proportionaliter ad materiam formam et
      compositum in natura quamvis non sint idem cum illis quia neque
      genus est materia sed sumitur a materia ut significans totum nec
      differentia est forma sed sumitur a forma ut significans totum
      unde dicimus hominem esse animal rationale et non ex animali et
      rationali sicut dicimus eum esse ex corpore et anima ex corpore
      enim et anima dicitur esse homo sicut ex duabus rebus qudam tertia
      res constituta qu neutra illarum est homo enim nec est anima
      neque corpus sed si homo aliquo modo ex animali et rationali
      dicatur esse non erit sicut res tertia ex duabus rebus sed sicut

      earum rerum ex quibus constituitur ita nec intellectus recipit

   91 cf mercier ontologie pp 423 how do we know that not only
      water h2o is a possible essence but also hydrogen dioxide h2o2
      because the latter substance has been actually formed by chemists
      cf roscoe elementary chemistry lesson vi is hydrogen
      trioxyde h2o3 a possible substance we may ask chemistsand they
      may not be able to tell us with any certainty whether it is or not
   92 the actual existence of a thinking mind is of course a necessary
      condition in the actual order for the apprehension of objects in
      this abstract way but such existence is no part of the apprehended
      object that the human mind which is itself finite contingent
      allied with matter and dependent on the activity of corporeal sense
      organs for the objects of its knowledge should nevertheless have
      the power to apprehend contingent realities apart from their
      contingent actual existence in time and spaceis a fact of the
      greatest significance as regards the nature of the mind itself but
      if we try to prove the existence of god from a consideration of the
      nature and powers of the human mind our argument proceeds from the
      actual and is distinct from any argument based exclusively on the
      nature and properties of possible essences as such st augustines
      argument assumes as a fact that the human mind represents to itself
      possible essences as having reality independently both of its own
      thought and of any actual existence of such essences cf de
      munnynck praelectiones de dei existentia p 23 but is this a
      fact this is the really debatable point

   97 cf balmes fundamental philosophy bk iv ch xxvi who
      analysing the truth of the proposition two circles of equal
      diameters are equal as an example of the necessary eternal
      immutable characteristics of possible essences goes so far as to
      write italics ours what would happen if withdrawing all
      bodies all sensible representations and even all intelligences
      we should imagine absolute and universal nothing we see the truth
      of the proposition even on this supposition for it is impossible
      for us to hold it to be false on every supposition our
      understanding sees a connection which it cannot destroy the
      condition once established the result will infallibly follow
      an absolutely necessary connection founded neither on us nor on
      the external world which exists before anything we can imagine and
      subsists after we have annihilated all by an effort of our
      understanding must be based upon something it cannot have nothing
      for its origin to say this would be to assert a necessary fact
      without a sufficient reason
      it is true that in the proposition now before us nothing real is
      affirmed but if we reflect carefully we find even here the greatest
      difficulty for those who deny a real foundation to pure possibility
      what is remarkable in this phenomenon is precisely this that our
      understanding feels itself forced to give its assent to a
      proposition which affirms an absolutely necessary connection
      without any relation to an existing object it is conceivable that
      an intelligence affected by other beings may know their nature and
      relations but it is not so easy of comprehension how it can
      discover their nature and relations in an absolutely necessary
      manner when it abstracts all existence when the ground upon which
      the eyes of the understanding are fixed is the abyss of nothing
      we deceive ourselves when we imagine it possible to abstract all
      existence even when we suppose our mind to have lost sight of every
      thing a very easy supposition granting that we find in our
      consciousness the contingency of our being the understanding still
      perceives a possible order and imagines it to be all occupied with
      pure possibility independent of a being upon which it is based
      we repeat that this is an illusion which disappears so soon as we
      reflect upon it in pure nothing nothing is possible there are no
      relations no connections of any kind in nothing there are no
      combinations it is a ground upon which nothing can be pictured
      the objectivity of our ideas and the perception of necessary
      relations in a possible order reveal a communication of our
      understanding with a being on which is founded all possibility
      this possibility can be explained on no supposition except that
      which makes the communication consist in the action of god giving
      to our mind faculties perceptive of the necessary relation of
      certain ideas based upon necessary being and representative of his
      infinite essence
      balmes therefore does not mean that we could continue to see
      essences as possible were we to imagine withdrawn not merely finite
      minds but even the divine mind in such an absurd hypothesis
      nothing would appear true or false possible or impossible but he
      contends that even when we try to think away all minds even the
      divine mind we still see possible essences to be possible and from
      this he argues that since we have successfully thought away finite
      minds and the actuality of essences while the possibility of these
      latter still persists these must be grounded in the mind of god
      the actual eternal necessary being where they have eternal ideal
      being

  137 those who regard the distinction between the essence and the
      existence of an actually existing substance as real consider the
      latter as an ens unum per se the existence of a real distinction
      between the essential constitutive factors of a composite substance
      is universally regarded by scholastics as compatible with essential
      unityunitas per sein the latter such factors are really
      distinct and separable or divisible but actually undivided so
      also the union of an individual nature and its subsistence 73
      forms a unum per se unum compositionis in the view of those
      who place a real distinction between these factors

  142 we may confine our attention here to substances assuming for the
      present that accidents are individuated by the individual substances
      in which they inhere we may note further that it is only corporeal
      individuals that fall directly within our experience we can of
      course infer from the latter the actual existence of individual
      spiritual realities subsisting apart from matter viz human souls
      after death and also the possibility of purely spiritual individual
      beings such as angels but when we conceive these as individuals we
      must conceive them after the analogy of individuals in the domain of
      corporeal reality it is only through concepts derived from this
      domain and finding their proper application within it that we
      can have any knowledge of suprasensible or spiritual realities
      viz by applying those concepts analogically to the latter
  143 the formalactual distinction which scotists advocate between
      these grades of being we shall examine later
  144 cf urraburu op cit p 280 principium  intrinsicum vel

      individuo sua peculiaris ac propria individuatio
  145 in ancient greece the eleatics argued against the possibility of
      real plurality somewhat in this wise if there were really different
      beings any two of them would differ from each other only by some
      third reality and this again from each of the former by a fourth
      and a fifth reality and so on ad infinitum which would involve
      the absurdities of infinite number and infinite regress a similar
      argument was used by the medieval pantheist david of dinant to
      identify god with the material principle of corporeal reality god
      and primary matter exist and do not differ therefore they are
      identical for if they differed they should differ by something
      distinct from either and this again should differ from both by
      something distinct from all three and so on ad infinitum which
      is absurd such sophisms arise from accepting the purely abstract
      view of reality as adequate we have seen already in dealing with
      the abstract notion of being that from this point of view it must
      be recognized and admitted that the reality whereby things differ
      viz being is also the reality wherein they agree viz being
      also the paradox is restated below in regard to individuation
  146 materia  dupliciter accipitur scilicet ut signata et non
      signata et dicitur signata secundum quod consideratur cum
      determinatione dimensionum harum scilicet vel illarum non signata
      autem qu sine determinatione dimensionum consideratur secundum
      hoc igitur est sciendum quod materia signata est individuationis
      principiumst thomas de veritate q ii art 6 ad 7am
  147 cf urraburu op cit disp ii cap 2  iii pp 2713
  148 these will easily be found in any of the fuller scholastic
      treatises cf urraburu op cit disp ii cap 2 art 4

      1899 pp 171 sqqa useful book of reference for the teaching of
      st thomas
  149 a kindred view to this is the view that subsistence
      subsistentia suppositalitas or personality
      personalitas is the principle of individuation we shall see
      later in what subsistence or personality is supposed to consist
      here it is sufficient to observe that the individual nature as such
      has not necessarily subsistence or personality hence it cannot be
      individuated by this latter
  150 the consistent attitude for the thomist here would however appear
      to be a denial that such a thing would be intrinsically possible
  151 hujusmodi relatio non potest consistere nisi in quodam ordine quem
      ratio adinvenit alicujus ad seipsum secundum aliquas ejus duas
      considerationesst thomas summa theol i q xxviii art 3
      ad 2am
  152 cf science of logic vol i  59
  153 it is only the concrete and individual that as such can exist
      actually the abstract and universal as such cannot exist actually
      abstractness and universality are mental modesentia
      rationisannexed by the mind to the real content of its concepts
      considered as thoughtobjects they are themselves not real entities
      they do not affect reality as given to us in our experience but
      perhaps concreteness and individuality are also mere mental modes
      affecting reality not as given to us in our experience but only as
      subjected to the process of intellectual conception or at least as
      subjected to the process of sense perception this would appear to
      be part of the general kantian theory of knowledge that we can
      apprehend reality as concrete and individual only because space and
      time which characterize the concrete and individual mode of being
      are mental modes which must be applied to reality as a prerequisite
      condition for rendering the latter capable of apprehension in our
      experience this contention is examined in another context cf
      infra pp 145 147 151
  154 thus the recognition of a virtual distinction in a being is a sign
      of the relative perfection of the latter the being involves in
      its higher sort of unity perfections elsewhere dispersed and
      separate the being is of a higher order than if the principles of
      these perfections in it were really distinct from one another but
      the virtual distinction also seems to imply a relative
      imperfection when it is found in creatures inasmuch as here the
      thoughtobjects so distinguished are always principles of a
      plurality of really distinct accidental perfections and real
      plurality in a being is less perfect than unitycf kleutgen
      op cit  633
  155 omnis cognitio est a potentia et objecto sive a cognoscente et
      cognito ratio a priori est quia omnis cognitio saltem creata est
      expressio et imitatio atque imago vitalis objecti inquantum igitur
      est vitalis procedit a cognoscente implicat enim cognoscentem
      vivere per aliquid quod ab ipso non est sed pure illud recipit ab
      alio mere passive se habendo inquantum vero cognitio est expressio
      imitatio et imago objecti procedit ab objectosilvester maurus
      quaest philos q 2 this is the common scholastic distinction
      cognition as a product representative or expressive of reality is a
      product determined by the influence of reality as active on the
      mind as passive cognition as a vital process is active a
      reaction of mind to the influence of reality it may be remarked
      however that the cognitive process as vital has always a positive
      term our cognitive processes are partly at least processes of
      abstracting comparing relating universalizing processes which
      produce intentiones logicas or entia rationis such as the
      intentio universalitatis the relation of subject to predicate
      and other logical relations and logical distinctions and hence
      arises the difficulty when we come to reflect on our cognitive
      experience of discriminating between these logical entities and
      the reality which we interpret by means of them of discriminating
      in other words between logical and real distinctions
  156 it is not necessary of course that this implicit embodiment of all
      the others by any one of them be seen to be mutual it is
      sufficient for instance that of the concepts a b c and
      d a be seen implicitly to involve b b to involve c
      etc though not vice versa however it must be remarked that in
      the exercise of thought upon its abstract objects we feel
      something wanting to our intellectual insight as long as the
      relations we apprehend are not reciprocal in the sciences of
      abstract quantity we approximate to the ideal of establishing
      reciprocal relations throughout the whole system of the concepts
      analysed but abstract thought does not give us an adequate
      apprehension of the real it represents reality only under the
      static aspect and as abstract ie apart from the
      individualizing conditions of time and space which affect its
      concrete actual existence as revealed in sense experience were
      we to neglect the latter and consider merely what abstract thought
      gives us we should regard as really one what is one for
      thought but what is one for thought is the universal and the
      logical issue of holding the universal as such to be real is monism
      or again to put the matter in another way in so far as intellect
      sees the objects of its various abstract concepts to involve one
      another necessarily it has no reasonas long as it ignores the
      verdict of sense experience on the real manifoldness of actually
      existing beingto abstain from attributing a real unity to the
      whole system of abstract thoughtobjects which it contemplates as
      reciprocally and necessarily interrelated on the contrary it
      should pronounce that whatever plurality can be unified by the
      dialectically necessary relations discovered by thought is really
      one and must be regarded as one reality which again is
      monism but a philosophy which thus ignores sense experience must be
      onesided and misleading

  203 when the object so excels in greatness or grandeur as to exceed more
      or less our capacity to realize it we speak of it as sublime the
      sublime calls forth emotions of selfabasement reverence and even
      fear if an object possessing the other requisites of beauty is
      wanting in due magnitude we describe it as pretty or elegant

  212 at the same time it must be borne in mind that many of the judgments
      by which things are pronounced ugly or commonplace are
      erroneous this is partly because they are based on first and
      superficial sense impressions beauty must be apprehended and judged
      by the intellect and by the intellect informed with genuine
      knowledge to the eye of enlightened intelligence there are beauties
      of structure and organization in the beetle or the tadpole as well
      as in the peacock or the spaniel it is partly too because we
      unconsciously or semiconsciously apply standards of human beauty to
      beings that are merely animal to know really whether there are
      ugly monkeys we should have to consult a monkey for the beauty we
      unconsciously look for and certainly do not find in the monkey is
      the beauty of the human form and when we declare the monkey ugly
      what we really mean is that it would be ugly if it were a human
      being which is undeniablesullyprudhomme lexpression dans les

      11 had we such ideas of substances as to know what real
      constitutions produce those sensible qualities we find in them and
      how these qualities flowed from thence we could by the specific
      ideas of their real essences in our own minds more certainly find
      out their properties and discover what properties they had or had
      not than we can now by our senses and to know the properties of
      gold it would be no more necessary that gold should exist than it
      is necessary for the knowing the properties of a triangle that the
      triangle should exist in any matter the idea in our minds would
      serve for the one as well as the other
  227 sensation convinces us that there are solid extended substances
      and reflection that there are thinking ones experience assures us
      of the existence of such beingsibid book ii ch xxiii 
      29 locke protested repeatedly against the charge that he denied the
      existence of substances
  228 the notion one has of pure substance is only a supposition of he
      knows not what support of such qualities which are capable of
      producing simple ideas in us which qualities are commonly called
      accidents the idea then we have to which we give the general
      name substance being nothing but the supposed but unknown support
      of those qualities we find existing which we imagine cannot
      subsist sine re substante without something to support them we
      call that support substantiabook ii ch xxiii  2 in the
      following passage we may detect the idealistic insinuation that
      knowledge reaches only to ideas or mental states not to the
      extramental reality the secret abstract nature of substance
      whatever therefore be the secret abstract nature of substance in
      general all the ideas we have of particular distinct sorts of
      substances are nothing but several combinations of simple ideas
      coexisting in such though unknown cause of their union as makes
      the whole subsist of itself it belongs of course to the theory
      of knowledge not to the theory of being to show how groundless the
      idealistic assumption is
  229 inquiring into the causes of our impressions and ideas he
      admits the existence of bodies which cause them and minds which
      experience them we may well ask what causes induce us to believe
      in the existence of body but tis vain to ask whether there be
      body or not that is a point which we must take for granted in all
      our reasoningsa treatise on human nature part iv  ii
  230 of the definition of a substance as something which may exist by
      itself he says this definition agrees to everything that can
      possibly be conceivd and will never serve to distinguish substance
      from accident or the soul from its perceptions since all our
      perceptions are different from each other and from everything else
      in the universe they are also distinct and separable and may be
      considerd as separately existent and may exist separately and
      have no need of anything else to support their existence they are
      therefore substances as far as this definition explains a
      substanceibid  v we have no perfect idea of substance but
       taking it for something that can exist by itself tis evident
      every perception is a substance and every distinct part of a
      perception a distinct substanceibid

  236 such terms as corruptible destructible etc imply certain
      attributes of a thing which can be corrupted destroyed
      conceiving this attribute in the abstract we form the terms
      corruptibility destructibility etc so too the term
      possibility formed from the adjective possible simply implies
      in the abstract what the latter implies in the concretean active or
      passive power of a thing to cause or to become something or else
      the minds conception of the nonrepugnance of this something to
      substantialize a possibility therefore is sufficiently absurd but
      to speak of a possibility as real and at the same time to deny the
      reality of any subject in which it would have its reality is no
      less so
  237 except in the blessed eucharist here we know from divine revelation
      that the accidents of bread and wine exist apart from their
      connatural substance we cannot by the light of reason prove
      positively the possibility of such separate existence of
      accidents at the most men of the supreme genius of an aristotle
      may have strongly suspected such possibility and may have convinced
      themselves of the futility of all attempts to prove in any way the
      impossibility of such a condition of things nor can we even with
      the light of revelation do any more than show the futility of such
      attempts thus negatively defending the possibility of what we
      know from revelation to be a fact

  245 but from descartes doctrine of two passive substances so
      antithetically opposed to each other the transition to spinozism was
      easy and obvious if mind and matter are so absolutely opposed as
      thought and extension how can they unite to form one human
      individual in man if both are purely passive and if god alone puts
      into them their conscious states and their mechanical movements
      respectively what remains proper to each but a pure passivity that
      would really be common to both would it not be more consistent then
      to refer this thoughtessence or receptivity of conscious
      activities and this extensionessence or receptivity of mechanical
      movements to god as their proper source to regard them as two
      attributes of his unique and selfexistent substance and thus to
      regard god as substantially immanent in all phenomena and these as
      only different expressions of his allpervading essence this is
      what spinoza did and his monism in one form or other is the last

      long as the substance of bread and wine was there that this is true
      of accidents generally that it is not they that exist but rather

      to exist as characterized in a certain way as whiteness gives snow

      question habits acquired by repetition of such acts eg
      knowledge and virtue belonging as they do to the category of
      quality are more than mere modalities of the human subject they
      have an absolute positive entity whereby they add to the total

      he did not regard separability as the only test of a real
      distinction cf kleutgen op cit ibid

      by a necessity of thought we ascribe to an essence eg the
      corruptibility of a corporeal substance or the immortality of a

  276 the most perfect real unity is of course that which includes all
      perfection in the simplicity of its actual essence without any
      dispersion or plurality of its being without any admixture of
      accident or potentiality such is the unity of the infinite being
      alone no finite being possesses its actuality tota simul and the
      creature falls short of perfect unity in proportion as it attains to
      this actuality only by a multiplicity of real changes by a variety
      of really distinct principles and powers essential and accidental
      in its concrete mode of being in proportion as created things are
      higher or lower in the scale of being 47 they realize a higher or
      a lower grade of unity in their mode of individual existence

  341 it must not be forgotten that habit is an accident an accidental
      perfection of the substance or nature of an individual agent it
      immediately affects the operative power of the agent which
      operative power is itself an accident of this agents nature
      constituting the second subclass of the accident quality
      habit is thus at once an actuality or actualization of the
      operative power and a potentiality of further and more perfect
      acts it is intermediate between the operative power and the
      complete actualization which the power receives by the acts that
      spring from the latter as perfected by the habit faculty and habit
      form one complete proximate principle of those acts a principle
      which is at once a partial actualization of the individual agents
      nature and a potentiality of further actualization of this nature

  345 as we shall see later action as such does not perfect or change the
      agens unless when as in immanent action the agens is
      identical with the patiens action formally actualizes or perfects
      the patiens actio fit in passo but the exercise of any
      activity by an agent undoubtedly connotes or implies a perfection of
      this agent it is not however that the actual operation as such
      unless it is immanent adds a new perfection to the agent rather
      the agents power of acting revealed to us in its exercise is
      for us a measure of the actual perfection of the agent but the
      question remains is this power or perfection so far as we know it
      a substantial perfection is it the very perfection itself of the
      agents substance or nature as known to us or is it an
      accidental perfection which is for us an index of a corresponding
      degree of substantial perfection in getting our knowledge of the
      nature of a substance from a consideration of its sensible
      accidents its phenomena its operationsaccording to the rule
      operari sequitur esse qualis est operatio talis est naturacan we
      use a single inference from action to nature or must we use
      a double inference from action to power and from power to
      nature but even if we have to make the double inference this of
      itself does not prove any more than a conceptual distinction

      the bodycf nys cosmologie louvain 1903  192203
  355 the terms quantity and extension are commonly taken as
      synonymous but quantity is more properly applied to the internal
      plurality of integral parts of the substance itself extension to
      the dispersion of these parts outside one another in space
  356 hence aristotles definition in metaph iv quantum dicitur
      quod est in insita divisibile quorum utrumque aut singula unum
      quid et hoc quid apta sunt esse a quantified substance is one
      which is divisible into parts that are really in it ie partes
      integrantes parts each of which is capable of becoming a distinct
      subsisting individual thingcf nys cosmologie  154

  362 no argument in favour of this view can be based on the use of the
      term species manentibus dumtaxat speciebus panis et vini by
      the fathers of the council of trent for them as for all catholic
      philosophers and theologians of the time the scholastic term
      species used in such a context meant simply the objective
      perceptible accidents of the substance cf nys op cit

  364 and neither does revelation the body of our blessed lord exists in
      the eucharist without its connatural external extension and
      consequent impenetrability but according to the common teaching of
      catholic theologians it has its internal quantity its distinct
      integral parts organs and membersreally distinct from one another
      though interpenetrating and not spatially external to one another
      its mode of existence in the space occupied by the sacramental
      species is thus analogous to the mode in which the soul is in the
      body or a pure spirit in space
  365 we know from revelation that the body of our lord exists in this way
      in the eucharist we know too from revelation that after the
      general resurrection the glorified bodies of the just will be real
      bodies real corporeal substances and nevertheless that they will
      be endowed with properties very different from those which they
      possess in the present state that they will be immortal
      incorruptible impassible spiritual cf 1 cor xv the
      catholic philosopher who adds those scattered rays of revealed light
      to what his own rational analysis of experience tells him about
      matter and spirit will understand the possibility of such a kinship
      between the latter as will make the fact of their union in his own
      nature and person not perhaps any less wonderful but at any rate a
      little less surprising and inscrutable and this without committing
      himself to the objective idealism whereby berkeley while
      endeavouring to show the utter unreality of matter only succeeded
      in persuading himself that its reality was not independent of all

  376 the conception of variation united with sameness is not however
      the whole cognition of time for this the mind must be able to
      combine in thought two different movements or pulsations of
      consciousness so as to represent an interval between them it must
      hold together two nows conceiving them in succession yet
      uniting them through that intellectual synthetic activity by which
      we enumerate a collection of objectsa process or act which
      carries concomitantly the consciousness of its own continuous
      unitymaher psychology ch xvii
  377 that is provided we abstract from all comparison of this internal
      time duration with that of any other current of conscious
      experiences in the estimating mind as a matter of fact we always
      and necessarily compare the time duration of any particular
      experienced change with that of the remaining portion of the whole
      current of successive conscious states which make up our mental
      life and thus we feel not that the fourmile walk had a longer
      time duration than the threemile walk but rather that it took
      place at a quicker rate more rapidly than the latter but if a
      mind which had no other consciousness of change whatsoever than
      eg that of the two walks experienced successively no other
      standard change with which to compare each of them as it occurredif
      such a mind experienced each in this way would it pronounce the
      fourmile walk to have occupied a longer time than the threemile
      walkcf infra p 327
  378 this is true on the assumption that the intrinsic timeduration of
      a successive continuous change its divisibility into distinct
      nows related as before and after is really identical with
      the continuous successive states constituting the change itself
      and is not a really distinct mode superadded to this change a
      continuous series of quandocationes distinct from the change
      and giving the latter its temporal duration but many philosophers
      hold that in all creatures duration is a mode of their existence
      really distinct from the creatures themselves that have this
      duration or continued existencecf infra  86

      flow of our own conscious states and that therefore we can have no
      perception or conception of the intrinsic time duration of any
      change seems to have been overlooked by de san cosmologia pp
      5289 when he argues from our perception of different rates of
      motion in favour of the view that time duration is not really
      identical with motion or change but a superadded mode really

      to its object even though this latter be not actual but only a pure

      april 1912 reflections on some forms of monism pp 1678 the
      whole universe of direct experience displays a unity of order or
      design which pervades it through and through it is a revelation of
      intelligent purpose now a cosmos an orderly universewhich is
      intelligible only as the expression of intelligent purpose and not
      otherwiseis a system of interrelated factors but relating is
      unintelligible except as an expression of the activity of mind or
      spirit that is of something at least analogous to our mental
      activity of comparing and judging scholastic philosophers as we
      know discuss the question whether or how far the exact object of
      our relation concept is real that is whether this object is in
      itself and apart from the terms related and the foundation a mere
      ens rationis a product of our thought or whether it is in itself
      something more than this and some of them hold that there are
      relations which in themselves and formally as relations are
      something more than mere products of our thought now if there be
      such relations since they are not products of our thought we may
      fairly ask must they be the product of some thought and from our
      analysis of our very notion of what a relation is it would seem
      that they must be in some sort or other a product or expression of
      some thoughtactivity even relations between material things it
      is in determining how precisely this is or can be that the theist
      and the monist differ the theist regards all material things with
      their real relationsand all our finite human minds which apprehend
      the material world and its relations and themselves and one
      anotheras being indeed in a true sense terms or objects of the
      thought of god not however as therefore identical or
      consubstantial with the divine spirit but as distinct from it
      though dependent on it inasmuch as he holds the divine thought to
      be creative and regards all these things as its created terms
      the kinship he detects between matter and spirit lies precisely in
      this that matter is for him a created term of the divine thought
      for him too therefore matter can have no existence except as a
      term of thoughtthe creative thought of god not that the
      intelligible relations apprehended by us in matter are  identical
      in reality with the thoughtactivity of the divine mind as
      ontologists have taught cf supra 14 18 19 nor that we can
      directly infer the existence of a supreme spirit from the existence
      of matter as berkeley tried to do by erroneously regarding the
      latter merely as an essentially minddependent phenomenon because
      for the orthodox theist matter is in its own proper nature not
      spiritual mental psychical not anything after the manner of a
      thoughtprocess or endowed with the spiritmode of being if
      predicamental relations such as quality or similarity of
      material things are as those medieval scholastics contended real
      entities relative in their nature and really distinct from their
      extremes and foundations did those scholastics conceive such
      relative entities as essentially minddependent entities if they
      did they would probably have conceived them in the sense of
      berkeley as created terms of the divine thought rather than in the
      ontologist sense which would identify them with the divine thought
      itself but it is not likely that they conceived such relative
      entities as essentially thoughtdependent any more than the
      absolute material realities related to one another by means of these
      relative entities on the other hand it is not easy to see how such
      relative entities can be anything more than mere products of some
      thoughtactivity or other

  449 to special metaphysics also belongs the controverted question
      whether or not a plurality of really distinct substantial forms can
      enter into the constitution of an individual corporeal substance
      when we classify corporeal things into genera and species
      according to their natural kinds cf science of logic i 
      67 these latter are determined by the formae substantiales of
      the things classified and are called infim species numerically
      distinct individuals which have conceptually the same forma
      substantialis fall into the same infima species while if such
      individuals have conceptually and numerically distinct formae
      substanialis they fall into distinct infimae species of some
      higher common genus the wider the generic concept the larger the
      group of individuals which it unifies it is a principle of
      conceptual unity ie of universality the objects of our
      generic differential and specific concepts throughout this
      process of classification are only virtually distinct metaphysical
      grades of being in the individuals now if the forma substantialis
      which yields the unifying concept of the species infima for the
      individuals and the material principle which is the ground of the
      numerical distinction between these latter were likewise regarded
      by the scholastics as being merely virtually distinct metaphysical
      grades of being in each individual then the question of a
      plurality of really distinct forms in one and the same individual
      would have no meaning all forms in the latter would be only
      virtually distinct from one another and from the material principle
      but the scholastics did not conceive that the real ground for
      grouping individuals into species infimae was the same as that for
      grouping these latter into wider genera they regarded the relation
      between the forma substantialis and the materia prima in the
      individual as quite different from that between the generic and
      specific grades of being in the individual cf supra  38
      science of logic i  44 joseph introduction to logic pp
      936 while they considered the latter a relation of virtual
      distinction they held the former to be one of real distinction and
      while they recognized the concept of the species infima to be a
      principle of conceptual unity in grouping the individuals together
      mentally st thomas emphasized especially the rle of the forma
      substantialis on which that concept was founded as a principle of
      real unity in the individual ab eodam habet res esse et
      unitatem manifestum est autem quod res habet esse per formam

      we accept this doctrine of st thomas the arguments which he bases

  470 for instance a the ontological or true cause which
      actually produces the effect need not necessarily be the
      ultimate cause of the latter b a physical fact can be the
      cause of another in the sense of being the invariable antecedent or
      physical cause of the latter but not in that sense alone it
      may also be an efficient cause of the latter by exerting an active
      influence on the happening of this latter c whether or not
      efficiency is a mysterious and most powerful tie at any rate it
      does exist between physical facts in the universe d its
      analysis reveals not a supposed necessity of ascending  to 
      the true cause  which  produces the effect as if the
      proximate causes did not also truly produce the latter but a real
      necessity of ascending to a first cause as the source and support
      and complement of the real efficiency of these proximate causes
      e a merely logical theory of induction does not indeed demand
      any inquiry either into the efficiency of natural agencies or into
      the nature and grounds of the invariability or necessity or
      law whereby these are connected with their effects but a
      philosophical theory of induction does imply such inquiries and
      here phenomenist writers like mill have laid themselves open to two
      accusations for while professing merely to abstract from the
      problem of efficiency they have tried equivalently to deny its
      existence by proclaiming it superfluous and insoluble besides
      consciously or unconsciously misrepresenting it and similarly in
      dealing with the invariability of causal sequences in the
      universe with the necessary character of its physical laws they
      have misconceived this necessity as being mechanical fatal
      absolutely inviolable and have wrongly proclaimed its ultimate
      grounds to be unknowable agnosticism cf infra  104 science
      of logic ii part iv chs iii iv and v part v ch i
      thus while eschewing the genuine metaphysics which seeks the real
      nature and causes of the world of our experience as superfluous and
      futile they have substituted for it a masked and spurious
      metaphysics which they have wrongly fathered on physical science a
      mass of more or less superficial speculations which have not even
      the merit of consistency no philosopher starting with their views
      on the nature of the human mind can consistently claim for the
      latter any really valid or reliable knowledge of laws any more
      than of causes for the knowledge of a law even as a
      generalized fact is a knowledge that claims to pass beyond the
      limits of the individuals present and remembered experiences but
      there can be no rational justification whether psychological or
      ontological for the certain reliability of such a step in the
      philosophy which logically reduces all certain knowledge to the mere
      awareness of a flow of successive sensations supposed to constitute
      the total content of the individual consciousness and the total
      reality of human experience

  489 we might add this other fact that all kinds of corporeal activity
      and change 11 seem to involve motion or local change this does
      not prove that they all are motion or local change the
      significance of the fact lies probably in this that local motion is
      necessary for procuring and continuing physical contact between the
      interacting physical agenciescf nys cosmologie  2279

  496 we may reasonably ask the occasionalist to suppose for the moment
      that we are efficient causes of our mental processes and to tell us
      what better proof of it could he demand or what better proof could
      be forthcoming than this proof from consciousness

  498 should anyone doubt that consciousness does testify to this fact we
      may prove it inductively from the constant correlation between the
      mental state and the bodily movement i will to move my arm it
      moves i will that it remain at rest it does not move i will that

  505 in its modern usage the term intention is inseparable from the

      and lines of development and in unconscious agencies they did not
      hesitate to refer to it as intentio naturae or appetitus
