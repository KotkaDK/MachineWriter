preface
there is no lack of good manuals of botany in this country there still
seems place for an adequately illustrated book of convenient size for
field use the larger manuals moreover cover extensive regions and
sometimes fail by reason of their universality to give a definite idea
of plants as they grow within more limited areas new england marks a
meeting place of the canadian and alleghanian floras many southern
plants long after they have abandoned more elevated situations
northward continue to advance up the valleys of the connecticut and
merrimac rivers in which they ultimately disappear entirely or else
reappear in the valley of the st lawrence while many northern plants
pushing southward maintain a more or less precarious existence upon the
mountain summits or in the cold swamps of new england and sometimes
follow along the mountain ridges to the middle or southern states in
addition to these two floras some southwestern and western species have
invaded vermont along the champlain valley and thrown out pickets still
farther eastward
at or near the limit of a species the size and habit of plants undergo
great change in the case of trees to which this book is restricted
often very noticeable there is no fixed absolute dividing line between
trees and shrubs in accordance with the usual definition a tree must
have a single trunk unbranched at or near the base and must be at
least fifteen feet in height
trees that are native in new england or native in other sections of the
united states and thoroughly established in new england are described
and for the most part figured foreign trees though locally
established are not figured trees may be occasionally spontaneous
over a large area without really forming a constituent part of the
flora even the apple and pear when originating spontaneously and
growing without cultivation quickly become degenerate and show little
tendency to possess themselves of the soil at the expense of the native
growths gleditsia for example while clearly locally established has
with some hesitation been accorded pictorial representation
the geographical distribution is treated under three heads canada and
alaska new england south of new england and westward with regard to
the distribution outside of new england the standard authorities have
been followed an effort extending through several years has been made
to give the distribution as definitely as possible in each of the new
england states and while previous publications have been freely
consulted the present work rests mainly upon the observations of living
botanists
all descriptions are based upon the habit of trees as they appear in new
england unless special mention is made to the contrary the
descriptions are designed to apply to trees as they grow in open land
with full space for the development of their characteristics under
favorable conditions in forest trees there is much greater uniformity
the trunks are more slender taller often unbranched to a considerable
height and the heads are much smaller
when the trunk tapers uniformly from the ground upward the given
diameter is taken at the base when the trunk is reinforced at the base
the measurements are made above the swell of the roots when reinforced
at the ground and also at the branching point as often in the american
elm the measurements are made at the smallest place between the swell
of the roots and of the branches
a regular order has been followed in the description for the purpose of
ready comparison no explanation of the headings used seems necessary
except to state that the habitat is used in the more customary present
acceptation to indicate the place where a plant naturally grows as in
swamps or upon dry hillsides under the head of horticultural value
the requisite information is given for an intelligent choice of trees
for ornamental purposes
the order and names of families follow in the main engler and prantl
in accordance with the general tendency of new england botanists to
conform to the best usage until an authoritative agreement has been
reached with regard to nomenclature by an international congress the
berlin rule has been followed for genera and priority under the genus
for species other names in use at the present day are given as synonyms
and included in the index
only those common names are given which are actually used in some part
of new england whether or not the same name is applied to different
trees it seems best to record what is and not what ought to be common
names that are the creation of botanists have been disregarded
altogether any attempt to displace a name in wide use even by one that
is more appropriate is futile if not mischievous
the plates are from original drawings by mrs elizabeth gleason bigelow
in all cases from living specimens and they have been carefully
compared with the plates in other works so far as practicable the
drawings were made of life size with the exception of the dissected
portions of small flowers which were enlarged in this way though not
on a perfectly uniform scale they are when reduced to the necessary
space distinct in all their parts
so far as consistent with due precision popular terms have been used in
description but not when such usage involved tedious periphrase
especial mention should be made of those botanists whose assistance has
been essential to a knowledge of the distribution of species in the new
england states mainemr m l fernald new hampshiremr wm f

trees of new england
pinoide pine family conifers
abietace cupressace
trees or shrubs resinous leaves simple mostly evergreen relatively
small entire needleshaped awlshaped linear or scalelike
stipules none flowers catkinlike calyx none corolla none ovary
represented by a scale ovuliferous scale bearing the naked ovules on
its surface
abietace
larix pinus picea tsuga abies
buds scaly leaves evergreen and persistent for several years except in
larix scattered along the twigs spirally arranged or tufted
linear needleshaped or scalelike sterile and fertile flowers
separate upon the same plant stamens subtended by scales spirally
arranged upon a central axis each bearing two pollensacs surmounted by
a broadtoothed connective fertile flowers composed of spirally
arranged bracts or coverscales each bract subtending an ovuliferous
scale coverscale and ovuliferous scale attached at their bases
coverscale usually remaining small ovuliferous scale enlarging
especially after fertilization gradually becoming woody or leathery and
bearing two ovules at its base cones maturing except in pinus the
first year ovuliferous scales in fruit usually known as conescales
seeds winged roots mostly spreading horizontally at a short distance
below the surface
cupressace
thuja cupressus juniperus
leafbuds not scaly leaves evergreen and persistent for several years
opposite verticillate or sometimes scattered scalelike often
needleshaped in seedlings and sometimes upon the branches of older
plants flowers minute stamens and pistils in separate blossoms upon
the same plant or upon different plants stamens usually bearing 35
pollensacs on the underside scales of fertile aments few opposite or
ternate fruit small cones or berries formed by coalescence of the
fleshy conescales otherwise as in abietace

horticultural valuehardy in new england grows in any good soil
preferring moist locations the formal outline of the young trees
becomes broken irregular and picturesque with age making the mature
tree much more attractive than the european species common to
cultivation rarely for sale in nurseries but obtainable from
collectors to be successfully transplanted it must be handled when
dormant propagated from seed
     notethe european species with which the mature plant is often
     confused has somewhat longer leaves and larger cones a form
     common in cultivation has long pendulous branches

scotch pine sometimes incorrectly called the scotch fir
indigenous in the northern parts of scotland and in the alps and from
sweden and norway where it forms large forests eastward throughout
northern europe and asia
at southington conn many of these trees probably originating from an
introduced pine in the vicinity were formerly scattered over a rocky
pasture and in the adjoining woods a tract of about two acres in
extent most of these were cut down in 1898 but the survivors if left
to themselves will doubtless multiply rapidly as the conditions have
proved very favorable c h bissell in lit 1899
like p resinosa and p banksiana it has its foliage leaves in
twos with neither of which however is it likely to be confounded
aside from the habit which is quite different it may be distinguished
from the former by the shortness of its leaves which are less than 2
inches long while those of p resinosa are 5 or 6 and from the
latter by the position of its cones which point outward and downward at
maturity while those of p banksiana follow the direction of the

salix fragilis and salix alba
the fragilis and alba group of genus salix gives rise to puzzling
questions of determination and nomenclature pure fragilis and pure
alba are perfectly distinct plants fragilis occasional locally
rather common and alba rather rare within the limits of the united
states each species has varieties the two species hybridize with each
other and with native species and the hybrids themselves have varietal
forms this group affords a tempting field for the manufacture of
species and varieties about most of which so little is known that any
attempt to assign a definite range would be necessarily imperfect and
misleading the range as given below in either species simply points out
the limits within which any one of the various forms of that species
appears to be spontaneous

sea in the remaining new england states very common attaining its
highest development in the rich alluvium of the connecticut river
valley
     south to florida west to dakota nebraska kansas and texas
habitin the fullness of its vigor the american elm is the most
stately and graceful of the new england trees 50110 feet high and 18
feet in diameter above the swell of the roots characterized by an
erect more or less feathered or naked trunk which loses itself
completely in the branches by arching limbs drooping branchlets set at
a wide angle and by a spreading head widest near the top modifications
of these elements give rise to various wellmarked forms which have
received popular names
1 in the vaseshaped tree which is usually regarded as the type the
trunk separates into several large branches which rise slowly
diverging 4050 feet and then sweep outward in wide arches the
smaller branches and spray becoming pendent
2 in the umbrella form the trunk remains entire nearly to the top of
the tree when the branches spread out abruptly forming a broad
shallow arch fringed at the circumference with long drooping
branchlets
3 the slender trunk of the plume elm rises usually undivided a
considerable height begins to curve midway and is capped with a
onesided tuft of branches and delicate elongated branchlets
4 the drooping elm differs from the type in the height of the arch and
greater droop of the branches which sometimes sweep the ground
5 in the oak form the limbs are more or less tortuous and less arching
forming a widespreading rounded head
in all forms short irregular pendent branchlets are occasional along
the trunks the trees most noticeably feathered are usually of medium
size and have few large branches the superfluous vitality manifesting
itself in a copious fringe which sometimes invests and obliterates the
great pillars which support the masses of foliage conspicuous at all
seasons of the yearin spring when its brown buds are swollen to
bursting or when the myriads of flowers insignificant singly give in
the sunlight an atmosphere of purplishbrown when clothed with light
airy masses of deep green in summer or pale yellow in autumn or in
winter when the great trunk and mighty sweep of the arching branches
distinguish it from all other trees the roots lie near the surface and
run a great distance

overarching branches and moderate shade grows rapidly throws out few
low branches bears pruning well now so seriously affected by numerous
insect enemies that it is not planted as freely as heretofore

horticultural valuehardy throughout new england grows in all
welldrained soils but prefers a deep rich moist loam young trees
grow rather slowly and are more or less distorted and trees of the same
age often vary considerably in size and habit hence it is not a
desirable street tree but it appears well in ornamental grounds a
disease which seriously disfigures the tree is extending to new england
and the leaves are sometimes attacked by insects occasionally offered
by nurserymen and easily transplanted

cratgus
a revision of genus cratgus has long been a desideratum with
botanists the present year has added numerous new species most of
which must be regarded as provisional until sufficient time has elapsed
to note more carefully the limits of variation in previously existing
species and to eliminate possible hybrids during the present period of
uncertainty it seems best to exclude most of the new species from the
manuals until their status has been satisfactorily established by
raising plants from the seed or by prolonged observation over wide
areas

     cratgus submollis bot gaz xxxi 7 1901 the new species
     differs from the true cratgus mollis in its smaller ovate leaves
     with cuneate base and more or less winged leafstalk in the smaller
     number of its stamens usually 10 and in its pearshaped
     orangered fruit which drops in early september
     it is also probable that c arnoldiana sargent new species has
     been collected in massachusetts as c mollis it differs from c
     submollis in its broader darker green more villose leaves which
     are usually rounded not cuneate at the base in its smaller
     flowers subglobose not oblong or pearshaped crimson fruit with
     smaller spreading calyx lobes borne on shorter peduncles and
     ripening two or three weeks earlier and by its much more zigzag

horticultural valuehardy throughout new england found in a wider
range of soils than any other species of the genus but seeming to
prefer a gravelly or peaty loam in positions where its roots can reach a
constant supply of moisture it is more variable than any other of the
native maples and consequently is not so good a tree for streets where
a symmetrical outline and uniform habit are required it is
transplanted readily but recovers its vigor more slowly than does the
sugar or silver maple and is usually of slower growth its variable
habit makes it an exceedingly interesting tree in the landscape

horticultural valuehardy throughout new england prefers a rich
moist loamy soil but grows in any welldrained situation easily
transplanted usually obtainable in nurseries and can be collected
successfully it is one of the most desirable native trees for landscape
and street plantations on account of its rapid and clean growth
freedom from disease moderate shade and richly colored autumn foliage
as the leaves appear late in spring and fall early in autumn it is
desirable to plant with other trees of different habit propagated from
seed
