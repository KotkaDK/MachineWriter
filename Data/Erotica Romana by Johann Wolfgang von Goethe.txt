erotica romana
by johann wolfgang goethe
i
  heres where ive planted my garden and here i shall care for loves blossoms
    as i am taught by my muse carefully sort them in plots
  fertile branches whose product is golden fruit of my lifetime
    set here in happier years tended with pleasure today
  you stand here at my side good priapusalbeit from thieves ive
    nothing to fear freely pluck whosoever would eat
  hypocrites those are the ones if weakened with shame and bad conscience
    one of those criminals comes squinting out over my garden
  bridling at natures pure fruit punish the knave in his hindparts
    using the stake which so red rises there at your loins
ii
  tell me ye stones and give me o glorious palaces answer
    speak o ye streets but one word genius art thou alive
  yes here within thy sanctified walls theres a soul in each object
    roma eternal for me only are all things yet mute
  who will then tell me in whispers and where must i find just the window
    where one day shell be glimpsed creature wholl scorch me with love
  cant i divine yet the paths through which over and over
    to her and from her ill go squandering valuable time
  visiting churches and palaces all of the ruins and the pillars
    i a responsible man profit from making this trip
  with my business accomplished ah then shall only one temple
    amors temple alone take the initiate in
  rome thou art a whole world it is true and yet without love this
    world would not be the world rome would cease to be rome
iii
  more than ever i dreamed i have found it my happy good fortune
    cupid sagaciously led past those palazzos so fine
  he of course knows very well and i have also discovered
    what beneath tapestries rich gilded boudoirs conceal
  one may if one wishes call him a blind wanton boybut i know you
    clever cupid too well o incorruptible god
  we were by no means inveigled to enter faades so majestic
    somber cortil we passed balcony high and gallant
  hastening onward until an humble but exquisite portal
    offered a refuge to both ardent seeker and guide
  here he provides me with evrything sees that i get what i call for
    each day that passes he spreads freshly plucked roses for me
  isnt that heaven on earth say beautiful lady borghese
    what would you give to me more you nipotina what yours
  banquets and game tables operas balls promenades down the corso
    these but deprive my sweet boy of his most opportune times
  finery haughtiness do not entice me does one not lift a
    gown of the finest brocade just as one lifts common wool
  if shes to press in comfort a lover against that soft bosom
    doesnt he want her to be free from all brooches and chains
  must not the jewelry and then the lace and the bustles and whalebone
    all of it come off entire if hes to learn how she feels
  i encounter no troubles like those simple dress of rough homespun
    at but a lovers mere touch tumbles in folds to the floor
  quickly he carries the girl as shes clad in chemise of coarse linen
    just as a nursemaid might playfully up to her bed
  drapings of satin are absent the mattress is quite unembroidered
    large is this room where the bed offers its comfort for two
  jupiters welcome to more from his juno if he can get it
    let any mortal find rest softer wherever he can
  we are content with cupids delights authentic and naked
    and with the exquisite creak crack of the bed as it rocks
iv
  ask whomever you will but youll never find out where im lodging
    high societys lords ladies so groomed and refined
  tell me was werther authentic did all of that happen in real life
    lotte oh where did she live werthers only true love
  how many times have i cursed those frivolous pages that broadcast
    out among all mankind passions i felt in my youth
  were he my brother why then i d have murdered poor werther
    yet his despondent ghost couldnt have sought worse revenge
  thats the way marlborough the ditty follows the englishmans travels
    down to livorno from france thence from livorno to rome
  all of the way into naples and then should he flee on to madras
    marlborough will surely be there marlborough sung in the port
  happily now ive escaped and my mistress knows werther and lotte
    not a whit better than who might be this man in her bed
  that hes a foreigner footloose and lusty is all she could tell you
    who beyond mountains and snow dwelt in a house made of wood
v
  do not beloved regret that you yielded to me so quickly
    i entertain no base insolent thoughts about you
  arrows of cupid work divers effects some do but scratch us
    slow and insidious these poison our hearts over years
  yet with a head freshly honed and cunningly fledged certain others
    pierce to the marrow inflame rapidly there our blood
  when gods and goddesses in days of heroes made love then
    lust followed look and desire with no delay was indulged
  surely you dont think the goddess of love lost a moment reflecting
    when in idean grove anchises caught her eye
  nor did luna delay about kissing that beautiful dreamer
    jealous aurora had else hastily wakened the lad
  at the loud banquet hero regarded leanderthen promptly
    into dark waters he plunged ardently swam toward his love
  when rhea silvia princess and virgin came down to the tiber
    just to fetch water a god seized her and that is the way
  mars begat himself sons a pair of twins whom a she wolf
    suckled today a proud rome claims to be queen of the world
vi
  we are so pious we lovers discreetly we worship all powers
    hoping for favor from each god and each goddess as well
  we are like you ye victorious romans in this  for we offer
    gods of all peoples and tribes over the whole world a home
  may the egyptian black and austere out of primeval basalt
    or from the marble a greek form them charming and white
  yet the eternal ones do not object to particularism
    incense of most precious sort strewn for just one of their host
  therefore we gladly confess to singling a special immortal
    and our devotions each day pledging but solely to her
  mischievous celebrants we at these mysteries gay and so solemn
    silence exactly befits rites at which were adepts
  rather onto our heels by horrible deeds the erinyes
    we would allure even zeus punishment sooner wed dare
  under that rock or bound to a tumbling wheel wed endure it
    than wed withdraw our hearts from the delights of her cult
  sweet opportunity that is her name you should meet her
    often will she turn up ever in a new form
  daughter of proteus might well she be whom he sired upon thetis
    in metamorphoses theyve many a hero deceived
  so now the daughter beguiles the naive and bedazzles the foolish
    teases you while youre asleep when you awaken shes flown
  eagerly yields herself up to the quick to the active man only
    he discovers shes tame playful and tender and sweet
  once she appeared to me too a darkskinned girl tumbling
    over her forehead the hair down in waves heavy and dark
  round about a delicate neck curled short little ringlets
    up from the crown of her head crinkled the unbraided hair
  when she dashed by me i seized her mistaking her not lovingly
    kiss and embrace she returned knowing and teaching me how
  o how enraptured i was ah say now no more its a bygone
    but o pigtails of rome still im entrammled in you
vii
  happily now on classical soil i feel inspiration
    voices from present and past speak here evocatively
  heeding ancient advice i leaf through the works of the ancients
    with an assiduous hand daily the pleasures renewed
  throughout the night in a different way im kept busy by cupid
    if erudition is halved rapture is doubled that way
  do then i not become wise when i trace with my eye her sweet bosoms
    form and the line of her hips stroke with my hand i acquire
  as i reflect and compare my first understanding of marble
    see with an eye that feels feel with a hand that sees
  while my beloved i grant it deprives me of moments of daylight
      she in the nighttime hours gives compensation in full
  and we do more than just kiss we prosecute reasoned discussions
    should she succumb to sleep that gives me time for my thoughts
  in her embraceits by no means unusualive composed poems
    and the hexameters beat gently tapped out on her back
  fingertips counting in time with the sweet rhythmic breath of her slumber
    air from deep in her breast penetrates mine and there burns
  cupid while stirring the flame in our lamp no doubt thinks of those days when
      for the triumvirs he similar service performed
viii
  can you be cruel enough to sadden me thus with reproaches
    germans speak i suppose bitterly when theyre in love
  bear it i must when the gossips bring forth accusations im guilty
    or am i not but alas all of my guilt was with you
  clothes that youve given bear witness for envious neighbors
      that the poor widow no more grieves for her husband alone
  did you not thoughtlessly visit me in the disguise of a cleric
      muffled all up in a cloak hair all rounded behind
  who was it chose that gray monk if not you well then a prelate
    now is my loverah who is my prelate but you
  never incredible as it may sound in this clerical city
    has any cleric brought meswear it i willto his bed
  i was sufficiently poor sad to say i was young the seducers
    noted it well falconier ogled me often enough
  one of the pimps for albani with billets doux very impressive
    called me to ostia once quattro fontani next time
  who was it did not appear there why who but the very same girl who
    hated with all of her heart stockings both violet and red
  for in the end you poor girls are the ones who are sure to be cheated
    so said my father althoughmother was not much impressed
  father was right here i stand in the end being cheated and scolded
    you dont believe your own words theyre your excuse to escape
  go then unworthy of women are men we who carry your children
    next to our hearts in these hearts loyalty we bear you too
  as for you men when youve poured out your potency in our embraces
    and your desires dissipate love with them passes away
  these things expressed and taking her child from its chair my beloved
    presses it close to her heart kisses it tears in her eyes
  im now so very ashamed of myself for having permitted
    gossip of neighbors to spoil picture so eloquent
  for a short moment a fire may burn darkly while smoke swirls about it
    water dashed on the coals suddenly smothers their glow
  rapidly then renewed heat overcomes those lowering vapors
    sends up a flame that anew bright and more powerful gleams
ix
  how very happy i am here in rome when i think of the bad days
    far back there in the north wrapped in a grayish light
  over my head there the heavens weighed down so dismal and gloomy
    colorless formless that world round this exhausted man lay
  seeking myself in myself an unsatisfied spirit i brooded
    spying out pathways dark lost in dreary reflection
  here in an ther more clear now a luster encircles my forehead
    phoebus the god evokes forms clear are his colors by day
  bright with the stars comes the evening ringing with songs that are tender
    and the glow of the moon brighter than northern sun
  what blessedness mortals may know am i now dreaming or welcomes
    jupiter father as guestme to ambrosial halls
  see i lie here extending my arms toward your knees i am praying
    hospitalitys god jupiter xenius hear
  how i am come to this place i no longer can sayi was
    seized up by hebe  twas she led to this sacred hill
  did you command her a hero to seek and deliver before you
    may be she erred then forgive let her mistake profit me
  does not fortuna your daughter when strewing her glorious presents
    after the manner of girls yield to each passing whim
  you o hospitable god will by no means now banish a stranger
    from your olympian heights back to the base earth again
  poet come to your sensesforgive me jupiter is not
    romes capitoline hill second olympus to you
  suffer me jupiter here and let hermes guide me at last then
    past cestius tomb gently to orkus below
x
  when you were small you say neither did others consider you f air nor
    even your mother find praiseand i believe it
  till you grew bigger developing quietly over the years i
    picture you to myself as an unusual child
  also the blossoms on grapevines are wanting in shape and in color
    although the fruit when its ripe pleases both mankind and gods
xi
  kindling autumnal fire in a rustic convivial fireplace
    how the sticks crackle and spew flames and glittering sparks
  strikes me especially pleasant this evening  before all my tinder
    dies away into coals coals then to ashes decline
  she will be back and new faggots as well as big logs will be blazing
    making a festival where lovers will warm up the night
  then in the morning officious shell leave the bed of her lover
    rouse adroitly the flames out from their ashes anew
  cupid has lent to her above others the gift of cajoling
    up from the ashes desire just when slumbers begun
xii
  all of those greats alexander caesar and henry and fredrick
    gladly would share with me half of their hard fought renown
  could i but grant them my bed for one single night and its comfort
    but the poor wretches are held stark in cold orkian grip
  therefore ye living rejoice that love keeps you warm for a while yet
    until cold lethe anoints captures your foot in its flight
xiii
  they are for you o ye graces just a few leaves by a poet
    onto your pure altar laid buds of the rose beside
  offered in confidence  artists enjoy ateliers which are furnished
    so as to make for a space pantheonlike in decor
  jupiter lowers that godly brow while his juno looks upward
    phoebus takes forward strides shaking his curly head
  while phlegmatic minerva peers down on us frivolous hermes
    seems to be looking askance roguish though tender as well
  but its to bacchus the sensuous dreamer cythera sends glances
    bathed in sweetest desireeven in marble theyre damp
  thinking about his embrace and its pleasures she seems to be asking
    shouldnt our glorious son here at our side stand erect
xiv
  cant you hear voices beloved out on the via flamina
    reapers are now going home back from harvesting grain
  they had journeyed to rome from afar and here plaited for ceres
    wreaths which the romans today scorn to make for themselves
  festivals no longer celebrate ceres the nourishing goddess
    who replaced acorns of old giving man golden wheat
  let us commemorate her then ourselves in festival private
    two constitute a whole tribe when they are two in love
  have you by any chance heard how that mystical strange celebration
    followed victorious troops back from eleusis to rome
  greeks were the ones who began it and only to greeks they proclaimed it
    even within roman walls come to the sanctified night
  those who were not of the cult kept their distance neophytes trembled
    waiting in garments of white symbol of all that is pure
  then the initiates must aimlessly wander about through the eerie
    circles of figures as if pilgriming through their own dreams
  snakes on the ground were writhing about now virgins came bearing
    caskets securely locked richly wreathd with grain
  surely the gestures of murmuring priests must contain some deep meaning
    impatient acolytes wait anxiously hoping for light
  not until after many a testing and trial did they discover
    what within sacred ring secretive image concealed
  what was this mystery other than this   that demeter goddess
    once upon a time had to a hero been kind
  it was to jason powerful king of the cretans she granted
    of her immortal self hidden sweet parts to explore
  that made the fortune of crete the marital bed of the goddess
    soon grew pregnant with grain heavy her bounteous fields
  as for the rest of the world it languished away while ceres
    derelict of her true task dalliance offered in love
  now the initiate youths having followed this tale all astonished
    turned and beckoned their loveslove do you comprehend
  see there the sacred shade beneath that bushyboughed myrtle
    our satisfaction will there scarcely endanger a world
xv
  cupid is always a scoundrel and if you believe him hell cheat you
    heres what the hypocrite said trust me just once more this time
  i have the best of intentions toward you who have now dedicated
    i recognize it with thankslife and writings to me
  lo i have followed you hither to rome and id like to do something
    here in this far away land pleasing to such an old friend
  every traveller ive ever known has complained of poor treatment
    he whom i recommend treatment delicious receives
  youve now regarded with awe all the structures which lie here in ruins
    cultivated your eye sensing each hallowd space
  how youve revered the formative will of those ancient artists
    in their own ateliers often i ve visited them
  as for their works why i formed those myselfnow this time im boasting
    not oh come now admit what i am saying is true
  where are your own creations your service to me having slackened
    where is inventions glow now where is the color all gone
  friend do you hope you can create again the school of the ancients
    yet remains open  its gates years have not closed them to you
  i am eternally young and as teacher i still love the young ones
    wisdom that comes with old age pleases me not listen here
  wasnt antiquity young when those fortunate ancients were living
    happy then be your life too in it antiquity lives
  where will you find a fit theme for your song it is i must provide it
    as for a style truly grand love can alone give you that
  all of these claims that sophist asserted could i contradict him
    i am wont to obey when my commander decrees
  treacherous now he is keeping his word giving me themes for my poems
    while he is stealing my time potency presence of mind
  gazing into her eyes holding hands giving kisses exchanging
    syllables sweet and those words lovers alone understand
  murmuring our conversations we stutter in sweet oratory
    hymns of such sort pass away wanting prosodical tact
  goddess of morning aurora as friend of my muse i once knew you
    has the unprincipled god cupid seduced you now too
  so that these mornings you come as his sweetheart awakening me at
    his festive altar again where i must celebrate him
  here on my breast flows her hair an abundance of curls while her head rests
    pressing my arm as its bent so as to pillow her neck
  what a delicious condition if only these few tranquil moments
    could in my memory fix firmly that image of joy
  when the night rocked us to sleepbut in slumber shes moving away now
    from my side turns as she goes leaving her hand in my hand
  love in our hearts makes us one as the genuine need there stays constant
    only returning desire knows oscillation or change
  gently her hand presses mine now she opens her eyes and is looking
    into my own eyes nodont let my thoughts rest on your form
  please close your eyes theyre inebriation confusion they rob me
    all too soon of the joy quiet reflection affords
  grand are the forms of this body and nobly positioned each member
    had ariadne lain thus theseus never had fled
  only a single kiss for these lips and then o theseus leave her
    look at her eyesshes awake now youre eternally bound
xvi
  boy wont you light me a lamp but dear master theres light in the sky yet
    dont waste your oil and the wick dont close the shutters so soon
  only the houses are blocking the sun there its not yet the mountains
    until the curfew shall ring full half an hour must pass
  wretched young fellow be gone and obey me my loved one is coming
    lamplight console me till then harbinger warm of the night
xvii
  poets of old in chorus cried out against those two serpents
    making them horrible names hated in all of the world
  python the one the other the hydra of lerna these monsters
    both have now been destroyed thanks to the deeds of the gods
  firebreathing venomous once they no longer now depredate our
    flocks and meadows and woods fields of golden grain
  how is it then that some spiteful god in his wrath has
    raised from the poisonous slime offspring so monstrous again
  theres an insidious viper creeps into the loveliest gardens
    lying in wait to attack all who seek pleasure therein
  noble hesperian dragon i call you courageous and forthright
    boldly defending your own beautiful apples of gold
  as for this worm why he is not guarding at all for his presence
    sullies both garden and fruit till they deserve no defense
  secretly coiled beneath bushes where he befouls the sweet wellsprings
    turning to poisonous drool cupids lifegiving dew
  happy lucretius knew how in his day to forego love completely
    fearing not to enjoy pleasure in anyones arms
  fortunate ancient propertius for you a slave fetched the girls down
    from the aventine hill from tarpeias grove
  cynthia then when driving you out of such unchaste embraces
    found you unfaithful its true but she did find you whole
  who would today dare attempt to escape from fidelitys ennui
    love does not hold one backonly concern for ones health
  even the woman we love may afford us uncertain enjoyment
    nowhere can feminine lap safely encouch a mans head
  matrimonial beds insecure and sos fornication
    husband lover and wife pass to each other the hurt
  think of those ages of gold when jupiter followed his urges
    chose callisto one day turned to semel the next
  it was important to him to find thresholds of temples so sacred
    pure when enamoured he sought powerful entry to them
  can you imagine the ragings of juno if in loves skirmish
    poisonous weapons on her by her own spouse had been turned
  but we neopagans may not after all be abandoned entirely
    yet there is speeding a god mercifully over the earth
  quick and assiduous everyone knows him and ought to adore him
    herald of zeus hermes the healing god
  although his fathers temple be fallen and though of its pillars
    scarcely a pair yet records ancient glory adored
  nevertheless the sons place of worship still stands and forever
    will there the ardent requests alternate with the thanks
  only one favor i beg of you graces i ask it in secret
    fervent my prayer and deep out of a passionate breast
  my little garden my sweet one protect it and do not let any
    evil come near it nor me cupid will hold out his hand
  o and entrusting myself to the rascal i beg you please may i
    do so in pleasure with no danger or worry or fear
xviii
  i cannot think id have gone with julius caesar to britain
    to the popina right here florus would tug me with ease
  fogs of the dreary north remain a more baleful remembrance
    than in the kitchens of rome tribes of assiduous fleas
  after today ill remember you even more kindly tavernas
    you osterias as you are called aptly by those here in rome
  that was the place i encountered my mistress today with the uncle
    whom she so often deceives so that she can have me
  heres where i sat at a table surrounded by goodnatured germans
    over on that side the girl finding a seat for herself
  next to her mother where frequently shifting her bench she arranged
    nicely for me to perceive profile and curve of her neck
  speaks just a little more loudly than women in rome are accustomed
    significant glance as she poursmisses the glass with the wine
  so that it spills on the table and she with a delicate finger
    over its surface can draw circles in damp arabesque
  her name entwining in mine while my eyes most eagerly follow
    all that her fingertip writes she is of course well aware
  that i am watching so finally makes the v of the roman
    five with a virgule before quickly as soon as ive seen
  she interlaces the circles reducing them all to ornatest
    patternsbut still the sweet iv stood as engraved in my eye
  i sat there mutely and biting my passionate lips almost bloody
    half from delight at the ruse partly from stifled desire
  such a long time until dark then another four hours of waiting
    sun who tarries on high contemplating rome
  greater never youve nor shall you in future see greater
    than rome o sun as your priest horace enraptured foretold
  tarry no longer today go seek other realms beneath heaven
    sooner depart and leave romes seven famed hills to me
  please do the poet a favor and shorten the glorious hours
    which the painter devours eagerly filling his eyes
  cast now but one ardent glance while descending on noble faades and
    cupolas pillars andlastup at the obelisks then
  hastily plunge to the ocean come view all the sooner tomorrow
    that which for centuries now gods have let you enjoy
  italys shoreline so long overgrown with moist reeds elevations
    somberly rising to shades cast by the bushes and trees
  first were but few simple dwellings here suddenly sunlight discovered
    nations enlivening hills teeming with fortunate thieves
  onto this spot they assembled such plunder in your eye so splendid
    all earths remaining orb scarcely was worthy of note
  you watched a world being born here watched the same world sink to ruin
    and from those ruins yet arise world again greater perhaps
  o may i long by your light now behold this rome may the parc
    spin the fine thread of my life slowly taking great care
  o but come rushing the moment my love designated so sweetly
    wonderful sound already the chimes no but i heard at least three
  thus my dear muses again youve beguiled the monotony for me
    of this long interval while i was apart from my love
  all of you now farewell ill be going nowdont be offended
    for though youre proud youll concede cupid in my heart comes first
xix
  why did you fail to appear at the cot in the vineyard today love
    as i had promised i would long i awaited you there
  dear i had almost arrived when i saw by good fortune your uncle
    standing right there by the vines looking now this way now that
  stealthily i slipped away alas what a misapprehension
    you saw the scarecrow thats all nothing else drove you away
  reeds and some discarded garments all hastily cobbled together
    i helped to make it myself diligent in my own grief
  well now his wish is fulfilled the old gardners most dissolute crow has
    left on this day unscathed nice little garden and niece
xx
  while there is many an unpleasant sound i hate to hear barking
    worse than anything else bellowing dogs split my ears
  nevertheless i do like to hear and take pleasure in listening
    to the loud howl of the dog raised from a pup next door
  that is the dog that so bayed one time at my girl that he almost
    gave our secret away when she was visiting me
  now when i hear the dog barking i think my beloved is coming
    or i remember the time when long awaited she came
xxi
  i can tell not only about a discomfort far greater than others
    but of a horror besides thinking of which will arouse
  every fiber in me to revulsion my friends i confess it
    great displeasure i take lying alone in my bed
  but its a horror to fear on the pathways of love youll discover
    snakes and their venom beneath roses of eager desire
  that at the moment supreme when im yielding to pleasure so fully
    right at my head as it droops hissing disease may approach
  thats why faustina as my companion in bed makes me happy
    loving she always remains faithful as i am to her
  young men are aroused in their passions by obstacles and by excitement
    i prefer to go slow savoring pleasures secure
  is it not bliss to exchange tender kisses containing no dangers
    sucking into our lungs carefree our partners own life
  that is the way our long nights of enjoyment are passed we listen
    breast against breast to the storm pouring down rain in the wind
  morning begins to dawn we expect from these hours approaching
    blossoms that will adorn festive the coming new day
  quirites permit me the joy and may this of all pleasures on earth the
    first and the last be vouchsafed all of mankind by the god
xxii
  ah to uphold ones respectable name is not easy the lady
    fame has an ancient foe cupid my master and lord
  oh by the way have you heard of the cause of their mutual hatred
    its an old story i thinklet me just tell it again
  powerful ever the goddess but nevertheless to her fellows
    overbearing and rude quite unendurable she
  had by the gods since time out of mind at their banquets been dreaded
    yelling with brassiest voice orders to great and to small
  once in her arrogance even maintained that she had subjected
    to her own will as her slave joves most illustrious son
  one of these days o father of deities cried she in triumph
    i shall be bringing you myhercules as if new born
  dont think that hercules be still that boy whom alcmene once bore you
    his adulation of me makes him now god upon earth
  when toward olympus he gazes ive no doubt you hope that hes looking
    piously toward your knees hardly hes looking for me
  worthiest man o the vision of winning my favor makes easy
    hitherto unexplored paths under that powerful foot
  i do my part for i meet him halfway and proclaim his adventures
    praising his name in advance even before hes begun
  one day youll wed me to hercules  hero who amazons conquered
    that day will overwhelm me happily ill call him  spouse
  all of the gods kept their counsel and none would reply to the braggart
    lest in a pique she devise vengeance against one of them
  cupid escaping attention slipped off to enslave however her hero
    artlessly conquering byforce of a beautiful girl
  afterward decked out his couple in mute masquerade  lionskin
    over her shoulders the club leaned by much toil at her side
  wiry stiff hair of the hero larded with blossoms a distaff
    laid in his fist to conform strength to the dalliance of love
  scene now completed and ready to tease he goes scampering shouting
    for all olympus to hear come see these glorious deeds
  heaven and earth and the sun on his indefatigable journey
    over that infinite path never did witness the like
  everyone hastened gulled by the dissolute boy who feigning
    earnest had summoned them all fame by no means lagged behind
  which of the gods will now smile in sweet condescension on cupid
    juno delighted of course seeing a man humbled so
  fame on the other hand stood there ashamed embarrassed despairing
    first she just laughed saying gods be not deceived its a masque
  i know my hero too well to be fooled by disguises of actors
    soon though in pain she perceived hercules none but he
  vulcan had not been one thousandth so vexed to discover his playmate
    under his meshes ensnared caught with his own lusty friend
  lying just as the wiles of the net at the most crucial moment
    deftly embraced their embrace trapping their instant of joy
  how those boys bacchus and mercury guffawed and freely admitted
    sweet must be the repose lying on bosom so fine
  of this magnificent woman they turned to vulcan entreating
    do not release them just yet let us inspect them once more
  and the old cuckold was cuckold enough to comply with their wishes
    as for poor fame in all haste burning with wrath she must flee
  since then no armistice has been proclaimed to the feuding between them
    let her but favor a man hot in pursuit is the boy
  he whom fame honors most can least defend against cupid
    and her most dangrous attacks strike the most morally proud
  whoever tries to escape him is dragged down from bad deeds to worse ones
    yes he will offer you girlsif like a fool you despise
  these only then do you feel from his bow the arrows most vicious
    heat of mans love for man ardent desires toward beasts
  for those ashamed of him cupid reserves the bitterest passions
    mingling for hypocrites their pleasure in vice and remorse
  but at the same time the goddess seeks him shes watching and listning
    should find him with you ill disposed will she be
  frighten you frowning austerely contemptuously violently casting
    into the worst of repute houses hes known to frequent
  ah its the same with me too i havent escaped her the goddess
    jealously she seeks me out sweet secret love to expose
  i will submit to the ancient law and in silence revere her
    for when great lords fall out i like the greeks must atone
xxiii
  however comely be strength or free and undaunted comportment
    secrecy is for a man most important of all
  mighty subduer of cities discretion o princess of nations
    goddess whom i adore safely youve led me thus far
  now though what fate shall befall me my frivolous muse has now opened
    cupid the scampopens lips hitherto sealed so well
  difficult is it alas to conceal the shame of a monarch
    hide it can neither his crown nor a tight phrygian cap
  midas has asses ears the first servant discoverso horror
    shame of this secret so weighs midas unburdens his heart
  into the earth for safekeeping the servant must bury the story
    easing in this way the king  earth must conceal the tale
  reeds in a trice are sprouting and rustling in murmuring breezes
    midas o midas the kingbears the ears of an ass
  mine is a secret more pleasant but even more difficult keeping
    out of abundance of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth
  none of my ladyfriends dare i confide in for they would but chide me
    nor any gentleman friend lest he be rival to me
  rapture proclaim to the grove to the echoing cliffs perorate it
    one can do that if ones young or if ones lonely enough
  i to hexameters tell in pentameters i will confide it
    during the day she was joy happiness all the night long
  courted by so many suitors avoided the snares that were set her
    now by one bolder than i now by another in guile
  cleverly daintily always slipped past them and sure of the byways
    comes to her lovers embrace where he so eagerly waits
  luna dont rise yet shes coming and must not be seen by the neighbor
    breezes rustle the leaves muffle the sound of her feet
  and as for you little poems o grow and flower your blossoms
    cradling themselves in the air tepid and soft with loves breath
  wafting betray to quirites as midas reeds did with cheap gossip
    one happy couple in love and their sweet secret at last
xxiv
  i in the back of the garden the last of the gods in a corner
    ineptly formed must i stand evil the inroads of time
  cucumber vines grow entwining about this primeval lingam
    cracking it almost in two under the weight of the fruit
  faggots are heaped all about me against the cold of the winter
    which i so hate for the crows settling then down on my head
  which they befoul very shamefully summers no better the servants
    empty their bowels and show insolent naked behinds
  filth above and below i was clearly in danger of turning
    into filth myself toadstool rotten wood
  now by your efforts o noblest of artists i shall recover
    with fellow gods my just place and its no more than my due
  jupiters throne so dishonestly won it was i who secured it
    color and ivory marble and bronze not to mention the poems
  now all intelligent men look upon me in kindness they like to
    form their own image of me just as the poet has done
  nor do the girls take offense when they see meby no means the matrons
    none finds me ugly today though i am monstrously strong
  half a foot long as reward your glorious rod dear poet
    proudly shall strut from your loins when but your dearest commands
  nor shall your member grow weary until youve enjoyed the full dozen
    artful positions the great poet philainis describes
about the elegies
goethe cultivated a special italianate hand for this portfolio of
twentyfour elegies so called because he was emulating the elegiasts
of imperial rome tibullus propertius catullus  the elegies have
never before been published as here together in the cyclical form of
their original conception  experts even denied that the two priapeia i
 xxiv were by goethe at all although they are in the same hand as the
rest  to be sure these two are not numbered so that i was long
undecided as to just what their proper position might be  at one time i
imagined they must belong at the middle of the cycle where at the end of
elegy xiii priapus mother summons her son  obviously goethe just
returned north from his two years in italy 178688 and alienated from
prim courtly friends especially since he had taken a girlfriend into
his cottage had no thought of publication when he indited these
remembrances of ancient rome  but he did show them to close friends
one of whom was the wonderful dramatist friedrich schiller  in 1795
schiller undertook a new periodical die horen  this thoughtful and
responsible man initiated the journal with an essay of his own
explaining how forms of entertainment are actually at the same time our
primary modes of education  it makes for pretty difficult reading in
our present less interested epoch  but he did break the essay up with
diversions solicited from the best minds of his era  for a discussion
of all this see
professor worthys page
for now it is enough to say that among schillers examples for
aesthetic education as he called it were these elegies by his much
admired friend wolfgang goethe  editor and author made substantial
changes for proprietys sakedespite goethes having lashed out to the
contrary in the first elegy which he now suppressed along with the
final one  my attempt has beenfor the very first time by the way in
any languageto restore goethes cycle to his early conception  since
i have been unwilling to intrude with learned notes i must apologize
for goethes many classical allusions which were as familiar to his own
readership as are in our publications today the dense references to
media celebrities  modern editors of what they call the roman elegies
bring abundant annotation and often detail goethes own emendations
what i bring here is merely translated from his manuscript in the
goetheschiller archive in weima
