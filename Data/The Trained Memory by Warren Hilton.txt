chapter i
the elements of memory
sidenote four special memory processes
you have learned of the senseperceptive and judicial processes by which
your mind acquires its knowledge of the outside world you come now to a
study of the phenomenon of memory the instrument by which your mind
retains and makes use of its knowledge the agency that has power to
resurrect the buried past or power to enfold us in a paradise of dreams
more perfect than reality
in the broadest sense memory is the faculty of the mind by which we
1 retain 2 recall 3 picture to the minds eye and 4
recognize past experiences
memory involves therefore four elements retention recall
imagination and recognition
the mental treasure vault and its lost combination
illustration decorative header
chapter ii
the mental treasure vault and its lost combination
sidenote what everyone thinks
almost everyone seems to think that we retain in the mind only those
things that we can voluntarily recall that memory in other words is
limited to the power of voluntary reproduction
this is a profound error it is an inexcusable error the daily papers
are constantly reporting cases of the lapse and restoration of memory
that contain all the elements of underlying truth on this subject
sidenote causes of forgetfulness
it is plain enough that the memory seems decidedly limited in its
scope this is because our power of voluntary recall is decidedly
limited
but it does not follow simply because we are without the power to
deliberately recall certain experiences that all mental trace of those
experiences is lost to us
those experiences that we are unable to recall are those that we
disregarded when they occurred because they possessed no special
interest for us they are there but no mental associations or
connections with power to awaken them have arisen in consciousness
sidenote seeing with half an eye
things are continually happening all around us that we see with but
half an eye they are in the fringe of consciousness and we
deliberately ignore them many more things come to us in the form of
senseimpressions that clamorously assail our senseorgans but no
effort of the will is needed to ignore them we are absolutely
impervious to them and unconscious of them because by the selection of
our life interests we have closed the doors against them
in either case whether in the fringe of consciousness or entirely
outside of consciousness these unperceived sensations will be found to
be sensory images that have no connection with the present subject of
thought they therefore attract and we spare them no part of our
attention
just as each of our individual senseorgans selects from the multitude
of ether vibrations constantly beating upon the surface of the body only
those waves to the velocity of which it is attuned so each one of us as
an integral personality selects from the stream of sensory experiences
only those particular objects of attention that are in some way related
to the present or habitual trend of thought
sidenote the man on broadway
just consider for a moment the countless number and variety of
impressions that assail the eye and ear of the new yorker who walks down
broadway in a busy hour of the day yet to how few of these does he pay
the slightest attention he is in the midst of a cataclysm of sound
almost equal to the roar of niagara and he does not know it
observe how many objects are right now in the corner of your minds eye
as being within the scope of your vision while your entire attention is
apparently absorbed in these lines you see these other things and you
can look back and realize that you have seen them but you were not
aware of them at the time
let two individuals of contrary tastes take a days outing together
both may have during the day practically identical sensory images but
each one will come back with an entirely different tale to tell of the
days adventures
sidenote waxen tablets
all sensory impressions somehow or other leave their faint impress on
the waxen tablets of the mind few are or can be voluntarily recalled
just where and how memories are retained is a mystery there are
theories that represent sensory experiences as actual physiological
impressions on the cells of the brain they are however nothing but
theories and the manner in which the brain as the organ of the mind
keeps its record of sensory experiences has never been discovered
microscopic anatomy has never reached the point where it could identify
a particular idea with any one cell or other part of the brain
sidenote not how but how much
for us the important question is not how but how much not the
manner in which but the extent to which sensory impressions are
preserved now all the evidences indicate that absolutely every
impression received upon the sensorium is indelibly recorded in the
minds substance a few instances will serve to illustrate the
remarkable power of retention of the human mind
sir william hamilton quotes the following from coleridges literaria
biographia a young woman of four or fiveandtwenty who could
neither read nor write was seized with a nervous fever during which
according to the asseverations of all the priests and monks of the
neighborhood she became possessed and as it appeared by a very
learned devil she continued incessantly talking latin greek and hebrew
in very pompous tones and with most distinct enunciation sheets full
of her ravings were taken down from her own mouth and were found to
consist of sentences coherent and intelligible each for itself but with
little or no connection with each other of the hebrew a small portion
only could be traced to the bible the remainder seemed to be in the
rabbinical dialect
sidenote remembering the unperceived
the case was investigated by a physician who learned that the girl had
been a waif and had been taken in charge by a protestant clergyman when
she was nine years old and brought up as his servant this clergyman had
for years been in the habit of walking up and down a passage of his
house into which the kitchen door opened and at the same time reading to
himself in a loud voice from his favorite book a considerable number of
these books were still in the possession of his niece who told the
physician that her uncle had been a very learned man and an accomplished
student of hebrew among the books were found a collection of rabbinical
writings together with several of the greek and latin fathers and the
physician succeeded in identifying so many passages in these books with
those taken down at the bedside of the young woman that there could be
no doubt as to the true origin of her learned ravings
now the striking feature of all this it will be observed is the fact
that the subject was an illiterate servantgirl to whom the greek latin
and hebrew quotations were utterly unintelligible that normally she
had no recollection of them that she had no idea of their meaning
and finally that they had been impressed upon her mind without her
knowledge while she was engaged in her duties in her masters kitchen
several cases are reported by dr abercrombie and quoted by professor
hyslop in which mental impressions long since forgotten beyond the
power of voluntary recall have been revived by the shock of accident or
disease a man he says mentioned by mr abernethy had been born in
france but had spent the greater part of his life in england and for
many years had entirely lost the habit of speaking french but when
under the care of mr abernethy on account of the effects of an injury
to the head he always spoke french
sidenote speaking a forgotten tongue
a similar case occurred in st thomas hospital of a man who was in a
state of stupor in consequence of an injury to the head on his partial
recovery he spoke a language which nobody in the hospital understood but
which was soon ascertained to be welsh it was then discovered that he
had been thirty years absent from wales and before the accident had
entirely forgotten his native language
a lady mentioned by dr pritchard when in a state of delirium spoke a
language which nobody about her understood but which was afterward
discovered to be welsh none of her friends could form any conception of
the manner in which she had become acquainted with that language but
after much inquiry it was discovered that in her childhood she had a
nurse a native of a district on the coast of brittany the dialect of
which is closely analogous to welsh the lady at that time learned a
good deal of this dialect but had entirely forgotten it for many years
before this attack of fever
sidenote living past experiences over again
dr carpenter relates the following incident in his mental physiology
several years ago the rev s mansard now rector of bethnal green
was doing clerical duty for a time at hurstmonceaux in sussex and
while there he one day went over with a party of friends to pevensey
castle which he did not remember to have ever previously visited as he
approached the gateway he became conscious of a very vivid impression
of having seen it before and he seemed to himself to see not only the
gateway itself but donkeys beneath the arch and people on top of it
his conviction that he must have visited the castle on some former
occasionalthough he had neither the slightest remembrance of such a
visit nor any knowledge of having ever been in the neighborhood
previously to his residence at hurstmonceauxmade him inquire from his
mother if she could throw any light on the matter she at once informed
him that being in that part of the country when he was but eighteen
months old she had gone over with a large party and had taken him in
the pannier of a donkey that the elders of the party having brought
lunch with them had eaten it on the roof of the gateway where they
would have been seen from below whilst he had been left on the ground
with the attendants and donkeys
an italian gentleman says dr rush of philadelphia who died of
yellow fever in new york in the beginning of his illness spoke english
in the middle of it french but on the day of his death only italian
striking as these instances are they are not unusual everyone on
reflection can supply similar instances who among us has not at one
time or another been impressed with a mysterious feeling of having at
some time in the past gone through the identical experience which he is
living now
sidenote the flash of inspiration
on such occasions the sense of familiarity is sometimes so persistent as
to fill one with a strange feeling of the supernatural and to incline
our minds to the belief in a reincarnation
the flash of inspiration which for the lawyer solves a novel legal
issue arising in the trial of a case or for the surgeon sees him
successfully through the emergencies of a delicate operation has its
origin in the forgotten learning of past experience and study
sidenote the totality of retention
succeeding books in this course will bring to light numerous other
facts less commonly observed drawn indeed from the study of abnormal
mental states indicating that we retain a great volume of
senseimpressions of whose very recording we are at the time unaware
in other words all the evidences point to the absolute totality of our
retention of all sensory experiences they indicate that every
senseimpression you ever received whether you actually perceived and
were conscious of it or not has been retained and preserved in your
memory and can be brought to mind when you understand the proper
method of calling it into service
a vast wealth of facts is stored in the treasure vaults of your mind
but there are certain inner compartments to which you have lost the
combination
sidenote possibilities of selfdiscovery
the author of thoughts on business says it is a great day in a mans
life when he truly begins to discover himself the latent capacities of
every man are greater than he realizes and he may find them if he
diligently seeks for them a man may own a tract of land for many years
without knowing its value he may think of it as merely a pasture but
one day he discovers evidences of coal and finds a rich vein beneath his
land while mining and prospecting for coal he discovers deposits of
granite in boring for water he strikes oil later he discovers a vein
of copper ore and after that silver and gold these things were there
all the timeeven when he thought of his land merely as a pasture but
they have a value only when they are discovered and utilized
not every pasture contains deposits of silver and gold neither oil
nor granite nor even coal but beneath the surface of every man there
must be in the nature of things a latent capacity greater than has yet
been discovered and one discovery must lead to another until the man
finds the deep wealth of his own possibilities history is full of the
acts of men who discovered somewhat of their own capacity but history
has yet to record the man who fully discovered all that he might have
been
sidenote acres of diamonds
you who are a bit vain of your visits to other lands your wide reading
your experience of men and things you who secretly lament that so
little of what you have seen and read remains with you behold your
acres of diamonds are within you needing but the mystic formula that
shall reveal the treasure
the mechanism of recall
illustration decorative header
chapter iii
the mechanism of recall
sidenote the right stimulus
somehow somewhere all experiences whether subject to voluntary recall
or not are preserved and are capable of reproduction when the right
stimulus comes along
and it is a law that those experiences which are associated with each
other whether ideas emotions or voluntary or involuntary muscular
movements tend to become bound together into groups and these groups
tend to become bound together into systems
sidenote complexes of experience
such a system of associated groups of experiences is technically known
as a complex
pay particular attention to these definitions as groups of ideas and
complexes of ideas emotions and muscular movements are terms that we
shall constantly employ
you learned in a former lesson that mental experiences may consist not
only of senseperceptions based on excitements arising in the memory
nerves but also of bodily emotions the feeling tones of ideas and
of muscular movements based on stimuli arising in the motor nerves
groups consist therefore not only of associated ideas but of
associated ideas coupled with their emotional qualities and impulses to
muscular movements
all groups bound together by a mutually related idea constitute a single
complex every memory you have is an illustration of such complexes
sidenote the thrill of recollection
suppose for example you once gained success in a business deal your
recollection of the other persons concerned in that transaction of any
one detail in the transaction itself will be accompanied by the faster
heartbeat the quickened circulation of the blood the feeling of
triumph and elation that attended the original experience
sidenote complexes and functional derangements
complexes formed out of harrowing earthquakes robberies murders or
other dreadful spectacles which were originally accompanied on the part
of the onlooker by trembling perspiration and palpitation of the
heart when lived over again in memory are again accompanied by all
these bodily activities your memory of a hairbreadth escape will bring
to your cheek the pallor that marked it when the incident occurred
the formation and existence of complexes explains the origin of many
functional diseases of the bodythat is to say diseases involving no
loss or destruction of tissue but consisting simply in a failure on the
part of some bodily organ to perform its allotted function naturally and
effectively
sidenote automatically working mental mechanisms
thus in hay fever or rose cold the tears the inflammation of the
membranes of the nose the cough the other trying symptoms all are
linked with the sight of a rose or dust or sunlight or some other
outside fact to which attention has been called as the cause of hay
fever into a complex an automatically working mechanism and the
validity of this explanation of the regular recurrence of attacks of
this disease is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that a paper rose
is likely to prove just as effective in producing all the symptoms of
the disease as a rose out of natures garden
another striking illustration of the working of this principle is
afforded by two gentlemen of my acquaintance brothers each of whom
since boyhood has had unfailing attacks of sneezing upon first arising
in the morning no sooner is one of these men awake and seated upon the
edge of his bed for dressing than he begins to sneeze and he continues
to sneeze for fifteen or twenty minutes thereafter although he has no
cold and never sneezes at any other time
sidenote two classes of complexes
obviously if absolutely all mental experiences are preserved they
consist altogether of two broad classes of complexes first those that
are momentarily active in consciousness forming part of the present
mental picture and second all the othersthat is to say all past
experiences that are not at the present moment before the minds eye
there are then conscious complexes and subconscious complexes
complexes of consciousness and complexes of subconsciousness
sidenote the subconscious storehouse
and of the complexes of subconsciousness some are far more readily
recalled than others some are forever popping into ones thoughts
while others can be brought to the light of consciousness only by some
unusual and deepprobing stimulus and the human mind is a vast
storehouse of complexes far the greater part buried in
subconsciousness yet somehow like impressions on the wax cylinder of
a phonograph preserved with lifelike truth and clearness
turn back for a moment to our definition of memory you will observe
that its second essential element is recall
recall is the process by which the experiences of the past are summoned
from the reservoir of the subconscious into the light of present
consciousness we necessarily touched upon this process in a previous
book in considering the laws of association but here in relation to
memory we shall go into the matter somewhat more analytically
the laws of recall
illustration decorative header
chapter iv
the laws of recall
sidenote the law of integral recall
law i the primary law of recall is this the recurrence or
stimulation of one element in a complex tends to recall all the others
in our explanation of complex formation we necessarily cited instances
that illustrate this principle as well since recall is merely a
reverse operation from that involved in complex formation
sidenote what ordinary thinking amounts to
for example in running through a book i come upon a flower pressed
between its pages at once the memory of the friend who gave it to me
springs into consciousness and becomes the subject of reminiscence this
recalls the mountain village where we last met this recalls the fact
that a railroad was at the time under process of construction which
should transform the village into a popular resort this in turn
suggests my coming trip to the seashore and i am reminded of a business
appointment on which my ability to leave town on the appointed day
depends and so on indefinitely
far the greater part of your successive states of consciousness or even
of your ordinary thinking commonly socalled consists of trains of
mental pictures suggested one by another if the associated pictures
are of the everyday type common to everyone you have a prosaic mind
if on the other hand the associations are unusual or unique you are
happily possessed of wit and fancy
sidenote the reverse of complex formation
these instances of the action of the law of recall illustrate but one
phase of its activity they show simply that groups of ideas are so
strung together on the string of some common element that the activity
of one group in consciousness is apt to be automatically followed by
the others but the law of association goes deeper than this it enters
into the activity of every individual group and causes all the elements
of every group ideas emotions and impulses to muscular movements to
be simultaneously manifested
sidenote prolixity and terseness
there is no principle to which we shall more continually refer than this
one our explanation of hay fever a moment ago illustrates our meaning
get the principle clearly in your mind and see how many instances of
its operation you can yourself supply from your own daily experience
so far as the mere linking together of groups of ideas is concerned
this classifying quality is developed in some persons to a greater
degree than in others it finds its extreme exemplar in the type of man
who can never relate an incident without reciting all the prolix and
minute details and at the same time wandering far from the original
subject in pursuit of every suggested idea
sidenote the law of contiguity
law ii similarity and nearness in time or space between two
experiential facts causes the thought of one to tend to recall the
thought of the other
this is the associative law of contiguity considered from the standpoint
of recall the points of contiguity are different for different
individuals similarities and nearnesses will awaken all sorts of
associated groups of ideas in one person that are not at all excitable
in the same way in another whose experiences have been different
law iii the greater the frequency and intensity of any given
experience the greater the ease and likelihood of its reproduction and
recall
sidenote laws of habit and intensity
this explains why certain groups in any complex are more readily
recalled than otherswhy some leap forth unbidden why some come next
and before others why some arrive but tardily or not at all
this is how the associative laws of habit and intensity affect the power
of recall
                           
sidenote applications to advertising
there is no department of business to which the application of these
laws of recall is so apparent as the department of advertising the most
carefully worded and bestillustrated advertisement may fail to pay its
cost unless the underlying principles of choice of position selection
of medium and size of space are understood the advertisers in
metropolitan newspapers and magazines of large circulation are the ones
who have most at stake but whatever the field to be reached it is well
to bear in mind certain facts based on the laws of recall that have been
established by psychological experiment
most advertisers have a general idea that certain relative positions on
the newspaper or magazine page are to be preferred over others but they
have no conception of the real differences in relative recall value
when the great cost of space in large publications is considered the
financial value of such knowledge is evident
by a great number of tests the relative recall value of every part of
the newspaper page has been approximately determined it has been
found for example that a given space at the upper righthand corner of
the page has more than twice the value of the same amount of space in
the lower lefthand corner
sidenote effect of repetitions
many advertisers adopt the policy of repeating fullpage advertisements
at long intervals instead of advertising in a small way continually
laboratory tests have shown on the contrary that a quarterpage
advertisement appearing in four successive issues of a newspaper is
fifty per cent more effective than a fullpage advertisement appearing
only once it does not follow however that an eighthpage
advertisement repeated eight times is correspondingly more effective
for below a certain relative size the value of an advertisement
decreases much more rapidly than the cost there are of course
modifying conditions such as special sales of department stores where
occasional displays and announcements make it desirable to use either
full pages or even double pages but the great bulk of advertising is
not of this character
sidenote ratio of size to value
every year in the united states alone six hundred millions of dollars
are expended in advertising the sale of commodities and for the most
part expended in a haphazard experimental and unscientific way the
investment of this vast sum with risk of perhaps total loss or even
possible injury through the faulty construction or improper placing of
advertisements should stimulate the interest of every advertiser in the
work that psychologists have done and are doing toward the accumulation
of a body of exact knowledge on this subject
sidenote risks in advertising

chapter v
the science of forgetting
sidenote the skilled artisan
attention is the instrumentality through which the laws of recall
operate wittingly or unwittingly consciously or unconsciously every
mans attention swings in automatic obedience to the laws of recall
attention is the artisan that bit by bit and with lightning quickness
constructs the mosaic of consciousness
having the whole vast store of all present and past experiences to draw
upon he selects only those groups and those isolated instances that
are related to our general interests and aims he disregards others
sidenote how the attention works
the attention operates in a manner complementary to the general laws of
recall it is an active principle not of association but of
dissociation
you choose for example a certain aim in life you decide to become the
inventor of an aeroplane of automatic stability this choice henceforth
determines two things first it determines just which of the sensory
experiences of any given moment are most likely to be selected for your
conscious perception secondly it determines just which of your past
experiences will be most likely to be recalled
such a choice in other words determines to some extent the sort of
elements that will most probably be selected to make up at any moment
the contents of your consciousness
sidenote iron filings and mental magnets
from the instant that you make such a choice you are on the alert for
facts relevant to the subject of your ambition upon them you
concentrate your attention they are presented to your consciousness
with greater precision and clearness than other facts all facts that
pertain to the art of flying henceforth cluster and cling to your
conscious memory like iron filings to a magnet all that are impertinent
to this main pursuit are dissociated from these intensely active
complexes and in time fade into subconscious forgetfulness
sidenote the compartment of subconscious forgetfulness
by subconscious forgetfulness we mean a compartment as it were of
that reservoir in which all past experiences are stored
consciousness is a momentary thing it is a passing state it is
ephemeral and flitting it is made up in part of present
senseimpressions and in part of past experiences these past
experiences are brought forth from subconsciousness some are
voluntarily brought forth some present themselves without our conscious
volition but by the operation of the laws of association and
dissociation some we seem unable voluntarily to recall yet they may
appear when least we are expecting them it is these last to which we
have referred as lost in subconscious forgetfulness as a matter of
fact none are ever actually lost
sidenote making experience count
all the wealth of your past experience is still yoursa concrete part
of your personality all that is required to make it available for your
present use is a sufficient concentration of your attention a
concentration of attention that shall dwell persistently and exclusively
upon those associations that bear upon the fact desired
the tendency of the mind toward dissociation a function limiting the
indiscriminate recall of associated groups is also manifested in all
of us in the transfer to unconsciousness of many muscular activities
sidenote how habits are formed
as infants we learn to walk only by giving to every movement of the
limbs the most deliberate conscious attention yet in time the
complicated cooperation of muscular movements involved in walking
becomes involuntary and unconscious so that we are no longer even aware
of them
it is the same with reading writing playing upon musical instruments
the manipulation of all sorts of mechanical devices the thousand and
one other muscular activities that become what we call habitual
the moment one tries to make these habitual activities again dependent
on the conscious will he encounters difficulties
    the centipede was happy quite
    until the toad for fun
    said pray which leg goes after which
    this stirred his mind to such a pitch
    he lay distracted in a ditch
    considering how to run
all these habitual activities are started as acts of painstaking care
and conscious attention all ultimately become unconscious they may
however be started or stopped at will they are therefore still
related to the conscious mind they occupy a semiautomatic middle
ground between conscious and subconscious activities
the fallacy of most memory systems

chapter vi
the fallacy of most memory systems
sidenote practice in memorizing inadequate
it is evident that if what we have been describing as the process of
recall is true then the commonly accepted idea that practice in
memorizing makes memorizing easier is false and that there is no
truth in the popular figure of speech that likens the memory to a muscle
that grows stronger with use
so far as the memory is concerned however practice may result in a
more or less unconscious improvement in the methods of memorizing
by practice we come to unconsciously discover and employ new
associative methods in our recording of facts making them easier to
recall but we can certainly add nothing to the actual scope and power
of retention
sidenote torture of the drill
yet many books on memorytraining have wide circulation whose authors
showing no conception of the processes involved seek to develop the
general ability to remember by incessant practice in memorizing
particular facts just as one would develop a muscle by exercise
the following is quoted from a wellknown work of this character
i am now treating a case of loss of memory in a person advanced in
years who did not know that his memory had failed most remarkably
until i told him of it he is making vigorous efforts to bring it back
again and with partial success the method pursued is to spend two
hours daily one in the morning and one in the evening in exercising
this faculty the patient is instructed to give the closest attention to
all that he learns so that it shall be impressed on his mind clearly
he is asked to recall every evening all the facts and experiences of the
day and again the next morning every name heard is written down and
impressed on his mind clearly and an effort made to recall it at
intervals ten names from among public men are ordered to be committed
to memory every week a verse of poetry is to be learned also a verse
from the bible daily he is asked to remember the number of the page of
any book where any interesting fact is recorded these and other
methods are slowly resuscitating a failing memory
sidenote real cause of failing memory
as remarked by professor james it is hard to believe that the memory
of the poor old gentleman is a bit the better for all this torture
except in respect to the particular facts thus wrought into it the
occurrences attended to and repeated on those days the names of those
politicians those bible verses etc etc
the error in the book first quoted from lies in the fact that its author
looks upon a failing memory as indicating a loss of retentiveness the
real cause is the loss of an intensity of interest it is the failure
to form sufficiently large groups and complexes of related ideas
emotions and muscular movements associated with the particular fact to
be remembered there is no reason to believe that the retention of
sensory experiences is not at all times perfectly mechanical and
mechanically perfect
interest is a mental yearning it is the offspring of desire and the
mother of memory
it goes out spontaneously to anything that can add to the sum of ones
knowledge about the thing desired
sidenote the manufactured interest
a manufactured interest is counterfeit when a thing is done because it
has to be done desire dies and duty is born in proportion as a
subject is associated with duty it is divorced from interest
sidenote memory lure of a desire
if you want to impress anything on another mans mind so that he will
remember it harness it up with the lure of a desire
diffused interest is the cause of all unprofitable forgetfulness do not
allow your attention to grope vaguely among a number of things whatever
you do make a business of doing it with your whole soul turn the
spotlight of your mind upon it and you will not forget it

chapter vii
a scientific memory system for business success
sidenote importance of associates
we recall things by their associates when you set your mind to
remember any particular fact your conscious effort should be not
vaguely to will that it shall be impressed and retained but
analytically and deliberately to connect it with one or more other facts
already in your mind
sidenote cramming and willing
the student who crams for an examination makes no permanent addition
to his knowledge there can be no recall without association and
cramming allows no time to form associations
if you find it difficult to remember a fact or a name do not waste your
energies in willing it to return try to recall some other fact or
name associated with the first in time or place or otherwise and lo
when you least expect it it will pop into your thoughts
if your memory is good in most respects but poor in a particular line
it is because you do not interest yourself in that line and therefore
have no material for association blind toms memory was a blank on most
subjects but he was a walking encyclopedia on music
sidenote basic principle of thoughtreproduction
to improve your memory you must increase the number and variety of your
mental associations
many ingenious methods scientifically correct have been devised to aid
in the remembering of particular facts these methods are based wholly
on the principle that that is most easily recalled which is associated
in our minds with the most complex and elaborate groupings of related
ideas
sidenote methods of pick
thus pick in memory and its doctors among other devices presents a
wellknown figurealphabet as of aid in remembering numbers each
figure of the arabic notation is represented by one or more letters and
the number to be recalled is translated into such letters as can best be
arranged into a catch word or phrase to quote the most common
figurealphabet is this
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0

to briefly show its use suppose it is desired to fix 1142 feet in a
second as the velocity of sound t t r n are the letters and order
required fill up with vowels forming a phrase like tight run and
connect it by some such flight of the imagination as that if a man tried
to keep up with the velocity of sound he would have a tight run
sidenote scientific pedagogy
the same principle is at the basis of all efficient pedagogy the
competent teacher endeavors by some association of ideas to link every
new fact with those facts which the pupil already has acquired
in the pursuit of this method the teacher will compare all that is far
off and foreign to something that is near home making the unknown plain
by the example of the known and connecting all the instruction with the
personal experience of the pupilif the teacher is to explain the
distance of the sun from the earth let him ask if anyone there in the
sun fired off a cannon straight at you what should you do get out of
the way would be the answer no need of that the teacher might
reply you may quietly go to sleep in your room and get up again you
may wait till your confirmation day you may learn a trade and grow as
old as i amthen only will the cannonball be getting near then
you may jump to one side see so great as that is the suns distance
we shall now show you how to apply this principle in improving your
memory and in making a more complete use of your really vast store of
knowledge
rule i make systematic use of your senseorgans
sidenote how to remember names
do you find it difficult to remember names it is because you do not
link them in your mind with enough associations every time a man is
introduced to you look about you who is present take note of as many
and as great a variety of surrounding facts and circumstances as
possible think of the mans name and take another look at his face
his dress his physique think of his name and at the same time his
voice and manner think of his name and mark the place where you are
now for the first time meeting him think of his name in conjunction
with the name and personality of the friend who presented him
memory is not a distinct faculty of mind in the sense that one man is
generously endowed in that respect while another is deficient memory
as meaning the power of voluntary recall is wholly a question of
trained habits of mental operation
your memory is just as good as mine or any other mans it is your
indifference to what you would call irrelevant facts that is at fault
therefore cultivate habits of observation fortify the observed facts
you wish to recall with a multitude of outside associations never rest
with a mere halfway knowledge of things
sidenote five exercises for developing observation
to assist you in training yourself in those habits of observation that
make a good memory of outside facts we append the following exercises
a walk slowly through a room with which you are not familiar then
make a list of all the contents of the room you can recall do this
every day for a week using a different room each time do it not
halfheartedly but as if your life depended on your ability to
remember at the end of the week you will be surprised at the
improvement you have made
b as you walk along the street observe all that occurs in a space of
one block things heard as well as things seen two hours later make a
list of all you can recall do this twice a day for ten days then
compare results
c make a practice of recounting each night the incidents of the day
the prospect of having this to do will cause you unconsciously to
observe more attentively
this is the method by which thurlow weed acquired his phenomenal memory
as a young man with political ambitions he had been much troubled by
his inability to recall names and faces so he began the practice each
night of telling his wife the most minute details of incidents that had
occurred during the day he kept this up for fifty years and it so
trained his powers of observation that he became as well known for his
unfailing memory as for his political adroitness
d glance once at an outline map of some state put it out of sight
and draw one as nearly like it as you can then compare it with the
original do this frequently
sidenote invention and thoughtmemory
e have some one read you a sentence out of a book and you then repeat
it do this daily gradually increasing the length of the quotation from
short sentences to whole paragraphs try to find out what is the
extreme limit of your ability in this respect compared with that of
other members of your family
rule ii fix ideas by their associates
there are other things to be remembered besides facts of outside
observation you are not one whose life is passed entirely in a physical
world you live also within your mind is unceasingly at work with the
materials of the past painting the pictures of the future you are
called upon to scheme to plan to devise to invent to compose and to
foresee
if all this mental work is not wasted energy you must be able to recall
its conclusions when occasion requires a happy thought comes to
youwill you remember it tomorrow when the hour for action arrives
there is but one way to be sure and that is by making a study of the
whole associative mental process
review the train of ideas by which you reached your conclusion carry
the thought on in mind to its legitimate conclusion see yourself acting
upon it mark its relations to other persons note all the details of
the mental picture in other words to remember thoughts cultivate
thoughtobservation just as you cultivate senseobservation to remember
outside matters
sidenote three exercises for developing thoughtmemory
to train yourself in thoughtmemory use the following exercises
a every morning at eight oclock sharp on the minute fix upon a
certain idea and determine to recall it at a certain hour during the
day put your whole will into this resolution try to imagine what
activities you will be engaged in at the appointed hour and think of
the chosen idea as identified with those activities associate it in
your mind with some object that will be at hand when the set time comes
having thus fixed the idea in your mind forget it do not refer to it
in your thoughts with practice you will find yourself automatically
carrying out your own orders persist in this exercise for at least
three months
b every night when you retire fix upon the hour at which you wish to
get up in the morning in connection with your waking at that hour
think of all the sounds that will be apt to be occurring at that
particular time bar every other thought from your consciousness and
fall asleep with the intense determination to arise at the time set by
all means get up instantly when you awaken keep up this exercise and
you will soon be able to awaken at any hour you may wish
sidenote how to compel recollection
c every morning outline the general plan of your activities for the
day select only the important things do not bother with the details
determine upon the logical order for your days work think not so much
of how you are to do things as of the things you are to do keep
your mind on results and having made your plan stick to it be your
own boss let nothing tempt you from your set purpose make this daily
planning a habit and hold to it through life it will give you a great
lift toward whatever prize you seek
rule iii search systematically and persistently
when once you have started upon an effort at recollection persevere
the date or face or event that you wish to recall is bound up with a
multitude of other facts of observation and of your mind life of the
past success in recalling it depends simply upon your ability to hit
upon some idea so indissolubly associated with the object of search that
the recall of one automatically recalls the other consequently the
thing to do is to hold your attention to one definite line of thought
until you have exhausted its possibilities you must pass in review all
the associated matters and suppress or ignore them until the right one
comes to mind this may be a shortcut process or a roundabout process
but it will bring results nine times out of ten and if habitually
persisted in will greatly improve your power of voluntary recall
sidenote formation of correct memory habits
rule iv the instant you recollect a thing to be done do it
every idea that memory thrusts into your consciousness carries with it
the impulse to act upon it if you fail to do so the matter may not
again occur to you or when it does it may be too late
your mental mechanism will serve you faithfully only as long as you act
upon its suggestions
sidenote now
this is as true of bodily habits as of business affairs the time to act
upon an important matter that just now comes to mind is not tomorrow
or a little later but now
what you do from moment to moment tells the story of your career ideas
that come to you should be compared as to their relative importance but
do this honestly do not be swayed by distracting impulses that
inadvertently slip in and having gauged their importance give free rein
at once to the impulse to do everything that should not make way for
something more important
sidenote persistence accuracy dispatch
if for any reason action must be deferred fix the matter in your mind
to be called up at the proper time drive all other thoughts from your
consciousness give your whole attention to this one matter determine
the exact moment at which you wish it to be recalled then put your
whole self into the determination to remember it at precisely the right
moment and finally and perhaps most important of all
rule v have some sign or token this memory signal may be
anything you choose but it must somehow be directly connected with the
hour at which the main event is to be recalled
sidenote memory signs and tokens
make a business of observing the memory signs or tokens you have been
habitually using practice tagging those matters you wish to recall with
the labels that form a part of your mental machinery
make it a habit to do things when they ought to be done and in the order
in which you ought to do them habits like this are paths along which
the mind moves paths of least resistance to those qualities of
promptness energy persistence accuracy selfcontrol and so on that
create success
success in business success in life can come only through the
formation of right habits a right habit can be deliberately acquired
only by doing a thing consciously until it comes to be done
unconsciously and automatically
sidenote the mental combination revealed
every man consciously or unconsciously forms his own memory habits
good or bad form your memory habits consciously according to the laws
of the mind and in good time they will act unconsciously and with
masterful precision
amid the shadows of the pyramids bonaparte said to his soldiers
twenty centuries look down upon you and animated them to action and
victory but all the centuries says wh grove and the eternities
and god and the universe look down upon usand demand the highest
culture of body mind and spirit
a good memory is yours for the making but you must make it we can
point the way you must act
the laws of association and recall are the combination that will unlock
the treasurevaults of memory apply these laws and the riches of
experience will be available to you in every need
                           
the purpose of this book has been to make clear certain mental
principles and processes namely those of retention association and
recall incidentally as with every book in this course it contains
some facts and instructions of immediate practical utility but
primarily it is intended only to help prepare your mind to understand a
scientific system for successachievement that will be unfolded in
subsequent volume
