clouds on the horizon
it would give a very false idea of kate vernons character were we
to say that captain egertons departure did not leave a blank in the
quiet routine of her life indeed she was rather surprised to find how
closely he had linked himself with the pleasures and occupations of the
secluded little circle amongst whom accident had thrown him she missed
his ready companionship and the amusing contrariety of his opinions
and prejudices she missed the interested attention with which he
listened to every word that fell from her lips and her eye peculiarly
alive to beauty in every form missed his distinguished soldierly
figure and bold frank open face but her regrets did not even border
on the sentimental and were spoken as openly as her grandfathers
who every hour in the day for a week at least after his departure
might be heard to sayif fred egerton was here he would do this or
that for me in short kate had never dreamt of egerton as a lover
marriage was to her a distant possibilitydesirable certainly in
due time as she always considered it if happy the happiest state
of life but marriage with a soldier who could not be always near
her grandfather was something so utterly beyond the powers of her
imagination to conceive that it gave her all the ease and security she
might have felt with a brother
so the winter wore steadily away the mornings studythe afternoon
walk with her grandfatheroften to visit the sick and needythe
interchange of contrasting thought with winter and the organist kept
miss vernon too wholesomely active both in mind and body to permit the
pleasant monotony of her life to degenerate into stagnation
but the halfhour in the evening while her grandfather dosed was
the happiest portion of the day to her when she leaned back in her
chair gazing at the firelight as it danced upon the wall and cast
uncouth shadows and following some train of thought suggested by
the reading or occurrences of the day dreamed of the future or
conjured up the past and often did she feel surprise at the frequent
recurrence of the ball at carringtonof egertons farewellamong
these visionsthough at this point she ever turned resolutely away
then colonel vernon was laid up for a month with a feverish cold which
made kate rather anxious and banished every thought not connected
with the invalid
socame on the lengthening days warmer sun and more piercing winds of
early spring and one morning towards the end of march mrs otoole
laid two letters before the colonel one directed to him in a clear
bold hand bearing the marseilles postmark the other to kate
i really think this is from fred egerton said the colonel feeling
in every pocket for glasses kate my dear they were hanging round my
neck before breakfast
oh here they are dear grandpapa exclaimed she eagerly do not
mind looking at the outsideopen it
and she laid aside her own
with many a break and many a tantalising pause the colonel slowly
doled forth egertons letter it was short and contained little more
than a report of his safe arrival after a tedious journey many
expressions of sincere regard and kind enquiries for his friends
at a but breathed an indefinable tone of despondency and
restlessness of spirit unlike anything they had hitherto observed in
him
the colonel at length concluded in a sort of surprised accent as
though he expected something more and kate exclaimed
is that all do you know grandpapa i expected much greater things
from captain egertons first letter from india do you not think he
writes dejectedly
i cannot quite make him out he replied in an absent manner but i
am obliged to him for his kind remembrance of us we must tell winter
and gilpinhe was such a favorite with them now open your despatch
my dear i see it is from georgina
                                   
dearest kate began miss vernon in obedience to his commands your
last letter is now so ancient i am ashamed to mention ityour first i
did not answer because i was too much vexed at your absurd opposition
to all my plans for your benefit time has cooled my resentment and
accident has revived my affection for my pretty loveable godchild
while it has i hope awakened in your mind proper regret for the
folly of preferring a life of seclusion in a dull country town to the
brilliant lot you might have secured i forgive you as i am sure you
have punished yourself enough the immediate cause of this letter is
as follows mrs wentworth one of my closest allies at naples told
me a brother of hers met a most exquisite personage called colonel
vernon and an equally exquisite miss vernon at a i recognised
the description and immediately a vision of my happy girlish days at
dungar and of all i owed to my kind and venerated cousin rose before
my mind and deep was the selfreproach with which i thought of my
long unpardonable neglect it is the life of unchecked prosperity
i lead that makes me thus thoughtless thus inferior to you my
brighteyed recluse in whose name i once promised and vowed the three
things you have practised i am what i am and will feign nothing i
acknowledge that tardy as this letter is i doubt if i should have
penned it had not certain fleeting catspaws ruffled the smooth
surface of my life and showed me how slight are the bands that hold
back the dogs of war doubt emptiness and dissatisfaction i
fear i am selfish but nothing will do my heart so much good as the
sight of your calm sweet face and the sound of your noblehearted
grandfathers wellremembered voiceforgive me i know how guilty i
am i feel i am most unworthyyet forgive me and come leave the
seclusion nature never intended for either darcy vernon never refused
me a request in those old times when i was all but a dependent on his
bountyi trust he will not now prevent me from employing some of the
filthy lucre fortune has thrown in my way in administering to my
own enjoyment by accelerating your journey here i have written so
much longer than usual i can add nothing of the charms intrinsic or
extrinsic of fair florence to me it will be nothing if you refuse to
come
                                              yours as warmly as ever
                                                           g desmond
psmoore writes me word there has been a great search for some
papers relating to the knockdrum farm i do not exactly understand what
they want them for some lawsuit that a mr taaffe is engaged in but
you had better tell your grandfather
what a charming letter cried kate as she concluded is it not
delightful to read such a candid warmhearted acknowledgement of
error i am so glad to have heard from her at last it is so dreadful
to feel that any chilling cloud of doubt intervenes between you and
one you love
yes indeed said the colonel what a rash impulsive creature georgy
has ever been rushing into injustice one moment and atoning for it
with such graceful selfabasement the next it would be better if she
could steer clear of both extremes but let me look at that postscript
again she is as distinct as ladies usually are on legal subjects
kate handed him the letter and he continued to read and reread the
postscript for some minutes with a look of concentrated attention
then raising his eyes and speaking more to himself than to his
granddaughter
i am astonished that moore has not written to me on this matter
he said in a displeased tone if this taaffe be the nephew of old
arthur taaffe and the papers required those connected with that
judgment he stopped abruptly and sat for a few moments in deep
thought looking very grave kate also kept a respectful silence
feeling little interest in any legal matter till her grandfather
rousing himself and with his old contented look returning observed
no no no man could act such a villanous part he must be perfectly
aware it was paid years ago
what was paid grandpapa
that debt to old taaffe he advanced my father money on knockdrum and
got me to join in the bond on which of course judgments were entered
against us both i paid it years ago and simply got an acknowledgement
from him but did not go through some other form satisfying the
judgment i think they term it
well i am sure no one would ever doubt your word cried kate even
if these papers cannot be found
i am afraid my dear child the great mass of legal and moneylending
people do not come within the category of christians who believe all
things i must write to moore this very day ill be in time for the
irish post give me my desk kate
but suppose this man insists on the production of these papers and
you cannot satisfy him asked kate as she was leaving the room after
arranging the colonels writing materials
he looked up with a sudden expression of pain in his noble benevolent
countenance
we shall be beggars my child thats all
miss vernon walked into the drawingroom and opened the piano
mechanically while her thoughts were busily engaged in conjecturing
whether the lingering debility of indisposition rather than justly
grounded fears prompted her grandfathers gloomy view of lady
desmonds intelligence
shall we then really know the poverty nurse talks of shall i be
strong enough to say in sincerity thy will be done
but soon these gloomy speculations gave place to the pleasanter
topic of her cousins invitation which seemed to have escaped her
grandfathers notice
she had been thus meditating for some time when nurse entered with a
letter in her hand
the masters love miss kate and if its not too early hed like you
to go out wid him he says he does not feel so well
yes nurse i will go and get my bonnet and shawl when i have settled
this music
faith now alannah im not plaised at all with the looks iv him
how said kate suspending her occupation of replacing the books in
the musicstand and looking up anxiously in mrs otooles face which
wore an unusual look of care especially about the depressed corners of
her expressive mouth
sorra one iv me can tell why but he looks like as when a big black
cloud is beginin to be dhrawn over the sun in a fine summers day
he just sits in the chair tired like an ses he only one letther
for the post nurse ses he but be sure its in time for the irish
maal and then he give me the message i gave yes the cross iv christ
betune us an harum ses i as soon as i see j moore esquire on the
letther how are we to have luck or grace when we have any thing to say
to the man that sould dungar an give it up to the spalpeen that has it
now look miss kate thims the esquires thats going now faith an i
remember paddy moore his father carrying sacks iv corn to the mill
an meself own maid up at the big house ay then j moore esquire
yer the first esquire in yer family any ways an there was ever an
always sorra to sup when there was letthers goin back an forward betune
you an the masther
but nurse i have always heard that mr moore was an upright
honourable man and i hope grandpapas letter will be only productive
of good
well well may be so but id a mighty quare dhrame both last night
an the night afore oh ye may laugh now miss kate but no matther
i seen the masther as plain as i see yer own sweet face forenent me
slippin slippin down a steep slim place wid the say roarin mad ondher
an you houlding him for the dear life an yer round white arms all
strained an tremblin wid the weight that was too much for yez an i
couldnt help yez tho i struve an struve to run to yez an in the
struggle i woke up all in a shake an god forgive the word but its a
mighty bad dhrame intirely
no nurseyou say dreams go by contraries so it is grandpapa that
will be ascending some lofty eminence and dragging me after him
it was in the mornin asthore in the mornin i dhreamt it
never mind nurse if so god will lend these slight arms strength for
all that may be required of themdo not tell me any more dreams now
i must go to grandpapa
sweet mary shield ye darlint ejaculated mrs otoole as she looked
after her nursling but weve rested so long widout them thieving
attorneys i dont like to see them beginin their letthers agin j
moore esquire the divil go wid such esquires amen
fearful and wonderful indeed is our spiritual organisation reason
may smile at fears unsubstantiated by any tangible motive but the
instant her accents of reproof have ceased lo the same formless and
gnawing terror steals back undiminished by one iota of its influence
to depress the soul until again routed by reasons disciplined troops
a true guerilla warfare in which the irregular forces ever ready to
disperse and reassemble always repulsed but never conquered are sure
to wear out resistance in the end
so kate vernon in spite of her clear and cultivated intellect
her sound judgment and her sense of the ridiculous could not keep
nurses evil omen from dwelling on her mind more ay a thousand times
more than her grandfathers apparent anxiety about the intelligence
communicated by lady desmond and they accomplished the circuit of the
walls silently or exchanging occasional remarks very foreign from
the subject occupying both their minds
at length the colonel said abruptly
kate my child what do you think of lady desmonds invitation
oh i think it a delightful plan but you grandpapa do you think we
shall be able to accept it
at present decidedly not i must not be farther from dublin than i
ami fear i shall have much letter writing if indeed i am not obliged
to go to ireland myself if matters come right again i shall certainly
endeavour to let the priory and take you to italy this complete
retirement is not good or safe
safe said kate laughing why i thought it was quite selon les
regles of all romances that a dethroned prince and his lovely and
interesting daughter like you and i should be safe only while in
obscurity
according to old romances i grant but according to reality there is
more danger in the strong contrasts which the occasional breaks in a
life of retirement present in the tone of mind it engenders than in
the action of society at least to you kate
danger oh tempt me not to boast cried kate endeavouring to
draw her grandfather from his moralising mood you may despise old
romances but you are nevertheless assuming the tone of some melancholy
count alphonso warning a sensitive and angelic lady malvina against
the world in general dearest and best she continued in graver and
tenderer tones i must swim down the troubled current of life as you
have done before me and meet its difficulties and trialsleave me
then to the same guide by whose aid you have passed many a dangerous
rapid safely to float in a smooth though diminutive haven at last
you are right kate quite right but how much longer the smoothness
will last god only knows
well there is a god to know all and direct all and that
consciousness must rob the future of all apprehension shall i write
to lady desmond on our return and tell her of our indecision and its
causes
by all means yet dear child i wish you would accept her
invitation you want change and i could remain quite comfortably with
nurse and
do not utter such treason leave you and to amuse myself in italy
when there is a chance that so far from being able to do without me
you may peculiarly want me
my dear dear unselfish child
not a bit unselfishtout au contraire i should be miserable away
besidesbut here are our friends winter and gilpin so dearest
grandpapa leave the future to take care of itself all will be
arranged for the best
there was no time to say more as the painter and organist approached
but though the colonel made no reply some unexplained current of
feeling induced him to pass his arm through kates instead of offering
it as was his habit for her support
ha miss vernon i see you have taken advantage of a stray gleam of
sun to seduce the colonel into risking another coldthe wind is truly
detestable but as i could not keep gilpin in doors i came out with
him he has not a grain of prudence
my dear winter it is a remarkable fine day for march i am glad
gilpin you felt equal to a walk
i think you look better observed kate
yes i think i am better i feel to revive at the approach however
boisterous of spring
cospetto three months in italy would make you a new man but here
the great mystery to me is how any one who catches a cold ever loses
it
the remedy is worse than the disease imagine a depressed invalid in
a strange country without a single friend or even acquaintance and
ignorant of its language returned gilpin
wretched indeed but wait for me mr gilpin we have some thoughts of
taking a flight to italy this summer said miss vernon
corpo di baccho ill not be left behind to act as miss vernons
cicerone would be something more than commonly delightfulwhat a
state of enjoyment you would be in but what put such a move into your
head colonel
an invitation from lady desmond who is at florence said colonel
vernon our acceptance of it however is very uncertain though i see
kate is full of the project i had another letter messieurs which i
think will give you pleasurehere read it winter
bombayfred egertonche gusto
a quick glance at kate the whole party moved slowly towards abbey
gardens the colonel and winter who read the letter aloud and gilpin
close behind with kate
ad ogni uccello suo nido  bello said winter as he concluded
the epistle here am i shivering and pining for a warm sun which
many years custom has made natural to me and there is that young
scapegrace revelling in baths and slaves and sunshine dying to be
back among east winds and consumption
captain egerton does not forget his friendsas soldiers are said to
do said gilpin
pooh pshaw cried winter he was bored by a bad sea voyage
seasickness is at the bottom of half the sentimental adieus to my
native shores that you read in albums and annuals wait until he gets
among his tigershooting brother officers or the bombay belles hell
soon forget the sumtotal of all he left behindstuff
i do not quite agree with you mr winter replied kate i think
captain egerton will always remember our little circle kindly and be
delighted to see any member of it again beyond this we have no right
to expect he would not charge his memory with regrets for people who
do not let his absence interfere with their pleasures or occupations
bravo miss vernon if he was some worthy curate in a white tie and
spectacles you would not bustle up so warmly in his defence but a
handsome light dragoon with moustache and a long sword and spurs
and saucy make way for me look is another affair
wrong again mr winter said kate i see no reason why a lancers
cap may not cover as good qualities as a clerical broadbrimand i
have been too long your pupil not to appreciate form and color
good and if every lancer was like captain egerton i for one would
prefer trusting them even in a confessional to the white neckclothed
curates chimed in the organist
in truth though egerton is the type of a class i have always
disliked i cannot help liking himespecially when i think of
hispooh poohi was forgetting and winter stopped abruptly
you are mysterious said the colonel but let me see the times at
your house i want to read the indian news that came by the last mail
and to see mrs winter
do you really think you will go to italy miss vernon asked gilpin
i fear it is problematical i long to travel but grandpapa has some
business and nurse has had a dream which bodes evil for my wishes
oh the dream ought not to be classed with the business
i dare confess to you and to you only returned kate with a smile
that it seems to shake my hopes far more than the business
the philosophic miss vernonsuperstitious
no no yet you know
    it may be a sound
    a tone of music summers eve or spring
    a flower the wind the ocean which shall wound
    striking the electric chain wherewith were darkly bound
winter would say it was the east wind
perhaps so said miss vernon for alas how ignominiously physical
are the causes of many a tenderly poetic mood not that i am at all
addicted to such but
i think it is a mistake to consider everything physical as
despicable observed gilpin we hear of mere physical force mere
physical wants but the same hand made and blended our two natures and
we shall be happy and healthy in proportion as we train both to work
in harmony without giving undue preference to either
i often think we have a species of trinity within us said miss
vernon we have sense with all its powerful tendencies in one
direction and spirit with its aspirations in another while the heart
and its affections seem to be neutral ground where the claims of both
may be adjusted
i like the fancy but sense gets the upper hand in many a heart
no interrupted kate the heart may be destroyed in the struggle
but while it exists the spirit always has fair play
your sentence is too sweeping in all such warfare the variations are
so delicately shaded that
walk in colonel broke in winter never mind if mrs winter is in
or not gilpin well have some scotch broth for luncheon that will
set you up i give you no choicein you must come
sense must carry the day mr gilpin said kate smiling
                                   
some days elapsed after this conversation before a reply from mr moore
reached the colonel and the anxiety he and kate had experienced died
away into a halfforgetfulness
it is strange how events which at first strike us with such keen
force lose their sharpness of outline as the mind becomes accustomed
to what was at first a novel aspect of affairs and as nothing fresh
arises we gradually sink back into our former frame of mind or recur
to that which distressed it in momentary spasms of anxiety
so kate and her grandfather had quite recovered their usual serenity
and the former had written to lady desmond long and affectionately
rejoicing that the cloud which had for a while interposed between them
had been dispersed merely mentioning the obstacle to their journey
as a temporary annoyance and speaking of its removal as a matter of
certainty
but she did not allude to it when in conversation with the colonel as
she fancied he avoided the subject
such was their frame of mind when at the usual post hour one morning
mrs otoole entered
a letther for the masther a large blue pitiless looking envelop
such as emanate from attorneys and merchants offices implacable
places sacrificial alters where youth and joy tenderness and the
pleasant amenities of life are immolated at the shrine of the english
juggernaut business
the colonel keeping his eye fixed on it felt in his pockets for his
spectacles silently with a certain determination of manner very
different from the joyous confusion with which he sought for them when
opening fred egertons letter then with a loud hem as if he wished to
clear both throat and brains he tore open the missive
kate sat opposite gazing at him as if she could read the contents
through his countenance and although that morning she had risen with
the full conviction that the anticipated letter would only prove their
anxiety to be groundless she now felt the terrible creeping gnawing
sickening sensation of doubt and dread which makes the hand so cold
and the eye so dim when felt in its full force
this however was her first and but slight experience of care so
she sat quite still not knowing of what she thought until her
grandfather had turned over the second page of the rather lengthy
epistle and she could see the flourishing signature at the end of
it still the colonel did not speak but turned back to reread some
passage and kate was surprised to find she had not courage to ask
what news
at last her grandfather without looking up handed her the letter
observing
much what i ought to have anticipated read it my dear
kate with a sensation of extreme repugnance took the letter and read
as follows
                                           dublin march 27th 18
      my dear sir
 in reply to yours of the 21st inst on the subject of lady desmonds
 communication to miss vernon it is true that the present mr taaffe
 has raised the question as to whether the debt to his uncle was paid
 seeing on searching the records that the judgments securing it
 remain unsatisfied on the roll but as i concluded you got warrants
 to satisfy them at the time of the payment i was not uneasy on the
 subject and thought it unnecessary to trouble you until i should
 first search amongst your papers in my possession for them which as
 yet i have not done as the matter was not pressing if however you
 did not get the necessary warrants to satisfy as i begin to apprehend
 was the case from the tenor of your letter i fear we shall have some
 trouble as the present mr taaffe affects to consider himself bound
 to conclude the debt was not paid and obliged in his character
 as executor of his late uncle to call it in altho he knows in
 his heart as i firmly believe the contrary i trust however
 although you may not from your unacquaintance with law terms and
 forms recollect what sort of acknowledgment you got at the time it
 will turn up to be a warrant to satisfy or if not some document
 sufficient to induce a court of equity to stay any proceedings mr
 taaffe may be advised to institute at law on foot of the judgment
 you had better search diligently among your papers and send me
 whatever you find at all affecting this matter and in the mean time
 i will search also amongst those of yours in my possession
 with respectful compliments to miss vernon i remain my dear sir
 your faithful and obedient servant
                                                             j moore
 to colonel vernon c
 kates first feeling was that of indignant scorn at such to her
 imagination unheard of villany as that recorded in the letter she had
 just perused but she suppressed the expression of it in order to
 put the least gloomy view of the matter her simple sense presented
 before her grandfather
 after all it is not so bad she said you see mr moore only
 anticipates some trouble and surely there can be no doubt your
 word would be taken especially in ireland before any other mans
 oath
 my dear kate some trouble has a very vague meaning from a
 solicitor it may be a months quibbling or forty years litigation
 and in law there is no such thing as honour every thing must be
 proved and though judge and jury may believe me incapable of wronging
 mr taaffe of one sou yet if i cannot bring legal proof he must
 succeed
 what a dishonest wretch he must be but i always had a horror of the
 name of taaffe cried kate the proud indignant blood mounting to
 her forehead
 some association of ideas with taffys thieving propensities
 observed the colonel with an effort to be cheerful
 but dear grandpapa what is to be done this letter leaves us just
 in the same state of uncertainty we were in before
 we must search amongst all my papers dear child as moore advises
 if i find any thing bearing on the subject i will send it to him but
 i much fear i shall find nothing i destroyed a great many papers
 as useless on leaving dungar and although i do not recollect any
 connected with taaffes business among them there may have been for
 i considered it so completely settled beyond dispute that i should
 have burnt them unhesitatingly had i come across any and then
 kate we must bide our time
 and are there no more active steps to be taken could you not write
 to this nephew assure him you have paid the money and advise him not
 to expose himself to universal opprobrium by acting so base a part
 ah kate my own warm hearted child said her grandfather sadly
 god grant you may not have to struggle with the world of which you
 are so ignorant universal opprobrium is an expression frequently
 and flourishingly put forth by newspaper editors and it may be
 occasionally drawn down by the singularly flagrant acts of some
 public characters but the dread of it never yet withheld any man so
 inclined from preying on his fellows in private life and it will
 take many more years experience to convince you how utterly fruitless
 and unorthodox such a proceeding would be
 well grandpapa if i am useless as a counsellor can i not be an
 agent and assist you in your search
 yes send away the breakfast things and tell nurse to bring me the
 tin box and oak brassbound cabinet that are in my room make susan
 help her they are too heavy for her unassisted strength
 true to his character darcy vernon had room in his heart to think
 for another though borne down by the weight of a deeper anxiety
 than he had ever felt before his former reverse of fortune obliged
 him to renounce the pomps and vanities of high life and soon custom
 proved them to be trifles indeed but here was a question involving
 the possibility nay he could scarcely hide it from himself the
 probability of beggary
 athen mavourneen its the sore hearts within me this day to be
 carryin down thim onlooky boxes sure i ses to meself the minit i set
 eyes on that big baste iv a blue letther faith mee dhrames out sure
 enough an its not for the likes iv mee to be spaken to quolity but
 it was just on the tip iv mee tongue to say throw it in the fire
 kurnel jewel an dont meddle or make with the likes iv it at all at
 all sure i knew at oncet it kem from moores place be the look iv
 it oh what was in it good or bad miss kate avourneen
 nurse was too old and devoted a friend to be excluded from the
 family councils and miss vernon was too well acquainted with her
 affectionate selfforgetful nature to consider her question intrusive
 only some business dear nurse it may be troublesome or may not but
 cannot be avoided even by your good advice so just bring down the
 boxes and you shall hear more when i have more to tell and nurse
 turning back from the diningroom door should mr winter or mr
 gilpin or any one call you had better say that grandpapa and i are
 particularly engaged
 the lord look down on me soliloquised mrs otoole as she crossed
 herself with an air of alarm not see winther nor the crather iv an
 organist faith there is throuble gotherin sure enough i knew be the
 darlints two eyes there was throuble in her heart this week past
 sure we were too long quiet an happy that thim divils iv attorneys
 should remember us ill go bail it was thim that druv the captin
 off to that murtherin hot counthry an i thinkin he an mee sweet
 child id make it up betune thim the masthers as innocent as a lamb
 but lave ould nurse alone for seein as far into a mill stone as her
 naybors ow wow many a time i seen him takin the full iv his eye
 out iv her an i removin the tay things och bud its the wearisome
 world susy yer idle gowk are ye goin to lave me to pull the arrums
 out of mee liftin a ton weight here widout puttin a finger to help
 me
 and diligently did the colonel and his granddaughter untie read and
 examine and retie the numerous bundles of papers and letters
 now a packet in lady desmonds clear firm writing was laid aside now
 a smaller one in kates own hand rapturous letters describing the
 enjoyments of her memorable visit to london the only time she had
 ever been away from her grandfather now turning over large yellow
 parchments with red seals hanging from them now eagerly examining a
 pile of papers whose crabbed writing bespoke business it was weary
 work kate with all the hopeful energy of youth rapidly searching
 through each of the packets at all likely to contain a solicitors
 letter and handing them to her grandfather who latterly leaned
 wearily back in his chair and examined them languidly once his arm
 stole round her as she knelt beside the pile of papers on the floor
 and she felt how eloquent of despondency was the close embrace with
 which he held her to him but she constrained herself to receive it
 in silence and took no further notice than to kiss warmly the hand
 which pressed her to his heart as the last and best treasure left him
 you are tired and cold said she rising i will stir the fire and
 then come and put your feet on the fender and i will replace these
 packets we have examined in the box and open all lady desmonds
 letters some such paper may have got among them
 as you like as you like my dear child
 there was a long silence broken only by the rustling of the papers
 half an hour elapsed and at length vernon rousing himself said
 do not tire yourself longer give me my desk i had better tell moore
 there is not a symptom here of what we want
 wait a very little longer there is only one packet more of
 georginas let us not give up too soon dear grandpapa a few
 minutes after she came over to him with an oldlooking letter in her
 hand this is signed a taaffe look at it
 vernon took it eagerly
 ha this may be useful how could it have got among georginas
 letters
 kate read over his shoulder
                                        anne street june 23 18
  dear sir
 i have just received yours of the 21st with its enclosure many
 thanks for your obliging efforts to comply with my wishes

 them and send them to you
                                    your obliged and obedient servant
                                                            a taaffe
      to colonel vernon c
victoria dearest of grandfathers will not that utterly annihilate mr
taaffe
well i think it must be sufficient thank heaven my love you
thought of searching among georgys letters now i must write
immediately to moore and i have scarce time you can put away all
these papers
with a lightened heart kate prepared to obey and so visible was
the change from darkness to light in her countenance that nurse
exclaimed on receiving from her the letter for the post

moore to hold his prate an lave off pinin any more of his three an
four pinnys to him
no not exactly that nurse but i think we shall soon have done with

i could hardly keep him from walkin in widout by yer lave or wid yer
lave an thin he kim back wid that bit iv a note
thank you now run to the postoffice dear nurse an invitation to
tea from mr winter said kate returning to the diningroom where
the colonel was putting away his writing materials do you feel equal
to it
decidedly my deari want to have a little kindly honesty after
having had a scoundrel before my minds eye all the morning we will
go and have a rubber and a song how poor egerton used to enjoy our
little parties
and how much more he would enjoy horsewhipping mr taaffe cried
kate as she locked the tin box
i believe he would said the colonel laughing you and egerton
certainly understood each other
chapter ii
uncertainty
welcome indeed was the gleam of hope afforded by this discovery to
the colonel and kate
to their nonlegal minds it appeared that any acknowledgment of money
received was sufficient although no sum was mentioned and kate even
felt remorse for her hasty condemnation of mr taaffe as she concluded
the production of the newly found letter would settle the question at
once and for ever and draw forth an humble apology from the offender
her spirits rose even above their usual height and overleaping
with the sanguine vivacity of her age and race all intervening
probabilities she revelled in her anticipated visit to italy and
spent many a pleasant halfhour in endeavouring to overcome nurses
inveterate antipathy to thim rampagin divils the frinch under which
name she classed all foreign nations and foreigners and in exercising
her powers of persuasion to induce the winters and gilpin to join in
the pilgrimage
you know we would not travel in any extravagant style caro
maestro she said to winter as they were enjoying an april day
which seemed to have borrowed the balmy air of early summer they had
crossed the ferry and were strolling side by side her tall graceful
form and elastic step contrasting strongly with his stout puffy
figure
you had better tie a knapsack on your shoulder at once and trudge
ithumph ha not so fast if you pleaseyou walked me up that hill at
a killing pace
but seriouslylet us consider the best method of setting to work for
you cannot think how eagerly i look forward to the journey and if we
go cheaply to work mr gilpin might join us and
signorina carrissima yes i want to speak seriously replied
winter in a kinder accents than usual are you not too sanguine
about this journey you make too little of the laws uncertainties
mr moores letters seem to promise well as you read them your
grandfather and i see only and at best the promise of a long perhaps
ruinous litigation i felt so convinced that this will be the case
that from the first i strongly advised colonel vernon to endeavour
to effect a compromise it is true you have not much to divide but
remember chi lascia il poco per haver lassai n luno n laltro
avera mai i see i am acting as usual like a brute he continued
thickly i intended to say all this by degrees and tenderlybut i
plunged into it at last too abruptly my dear child it cuts me to the
heart to hear you anticipating such unalloyed enjoyment and forming
such plans when perhaps the reverse is before you and i fancy your
grandfather feels somewhat as i do though he is more sanguine than i
am
they walked on a few paces in silencekates color varying and her
heart after feeling for a second or two to stand still at this
sudden and rude shock to her bright dreams throbbing as though it
would burst its prison
bella mia dear child are you angry with me cried winter
anxiously why do you not speak
simply kind friend returned she putting her arm through his
because i could notangry with you no i am obliged to you she
added with an effort to smile and now tell me all you think and
what we ought to do
humph you are a good girl you see my dear it is more than
a month since this business began if it could have been settled
quickly it would be settled before this and successful or
unsuccessful a chancery suit is ruin there you had better know it
all
and are we absolutely embarked in this ruinous course asked kate
faintly
i fear so did you not see moores last letter
no grandpapa said there was nothing new in it
ha a mistaken tenderness there certainly was nothing new in it but
the plot thickens and i fear there is no case at present to preven
mr taaffe proceeding to revive the judgment and ultimately obtain a
receiver over your grandfathers remaining property
a receiverwhat for
to receive the rents in payment of the debt if debt there be
what all of them
yes all but do not be too much cast down remember you have few
but friends sincere who will stick by you and
dear mr winter let us be silent for a moment i want to collect my
thoughts
they walked on in silence for some time
then from what you tell me before long we may be left quite
penniless are you sure that this is a true picture of our case and
that your hatred of law does not color it
heaven grant your conjecture may be right cried winter i only tell
you my own and i think your grandfathers real view of the matter
i have been long wishing for an opportunity to do so i dreaded the
effect of the shock on your sensitive and imaginative nature and
intended to have broken it to you gradually
but continued kate not noticing the latter part of his speech
shall we have nothing left no money at all good god and grandpapa
what am i to do for himand nurse do not think me very weak but i
cannot help the terror i feel
miss vernon i vow to heaven i only intended just to prepare you a
little for the worst perhaps matters may not be so bad as your alarmed
imagination paints my great object in speaking thus to you is to show
the necessity for endeavouring to effect a compromise or at least to
come to some understanding with your grandfather as to future plans
you cannot look about you too soon i know the first shock of a thing
of this kind is terriblebut you are not one of those cowards who
defer looking danger in the face until it is too late
yes i know but what plan can we possibly think of if we are to have
all our money taken from us what are we to do
dear child be prepared for it i would in the first place begin at
once to curtail every possible outlaylook out for a tenant for the
priory take a smaller humbler abode or a thousand times better
make our house your home till matters are more decided
always kind and good murmured kate and there is nothing more you
would suggest
no except to speak freely of it all to the colonel and by so doing
creep into his complete confidence
oh mr winter cried kate with an irrepressible burst of tears
and is this to be his end i always hoped that something i knew
not what would happen to restore him to his old position and now to
think of his being obliged to live and end his days in some mean and
unsightly place
courage kateyou know not what good may be hidden up in store for
you behind this sterner dispensation i have experienced severe
poverty and i tell you none but those who have felt it can know how
few how simple and yet how satisfying are the wants and pleasures of
life
for you and i yes but for grandpapa at his age after youth
and manhood spent in the possession and enjoyment of wealth and a
dignified proposition
if i mistake not colonel vernons greatest concern will be on your
account and if he sees you content or at least resigned he will be
the same
well we can say no more now i feel how necessary it was i should
be roused from my false security and that you have acted as a true
friend in undertaking what i know must have been so painful a task
i must try and think clearly and deeply and will speak to you about
my cogitations meanwhile as we shall soon be home let us change the
subject and i will endeavour to recover my serenity before i meet
grandpapa
winter pressed the hand she held out to him with a feeling of sincere
respect and admiration for the manner in which she had borne his
communications and an earnest wish that the platform at the next
jews meeting might prove insecure and so open the ranks of the
peerage to fred egerton
though he added mentally there is no knowing the effects of
prosperity on him
is grandpapa at home nurse asked kate
no miss he said he felt lonesome and walked out to see mr gilpin
thankful for a few minutes solitary reflection she ran to her room
and hastily fastening the door threw herself into a chairnot to
think that would be by no means a correct term to apply to the
confusion of ideas and images which presented themselves to her mind
some most foreign to the subject of the conversation with winter
dungar and her early days with their bright anticipations rose
painfully clear before her eyesthe dreadful possibility of seeing her
grandfather in povertyand the insurmountable difficulty of making
nurse understand the necessity for retrenchmentthe distressing
consciousness of the necessity to think deeply struggling with
the impossibility of fixing her thoughts and a dim feeling that an
impassable barrier was about to be raised between her and the class of
which fred egerton was a representative
all these and a thousand more undefined shadowy outlines swept across
her mind while she sat so still that she felt the throbbing of her
heart as if echoed in her head and she could almost almost hear the
pulses that vibrated through her slight frame
frightened at this continued rebellion of her thoughts against her
will she threw herself on her knees silently laying the painful chaos
before the almighty ruler and searcher of hearts
if accepted as coming from god she murmured and therefore good
nothing is unbearable mr gilpin says and he is right perhaps we
may succeed in this business after all though i feel quite hopeless
after what mr winter has saidbut if we have no money could i not
earn it i have a good knowledge of musicah delightful how proud i
should be to earn it for grandpapa who has always taken such care of
me and nurse would not mind it much i like teaching ah we may be
happy yeti must speak to mr winter about it ah nurses dream may
come true but by contraries after all who can tell what strength
love and gods good help may lend even to these weak arms and she
stretched them out enough to support dear grandpapa perhapsthat
would be a proud achievement she said almost aloud as a feeling of
quiet courage swelled her heart
she proceeded to bathe her eyes and make her simple toilette
interrupted it is true by a delicious vision that would intrude
itself of fred egerton wealthy and powerful flying to save her and
hers and interposing the shield of his affectionate care between them
and every earthly ill in vain she chided herself for so farfetched
a thought instinctively she felt how readily and rapturously he would
perform such a part and however impressively she told herself she was
absurd and visionary the idea would return it was the nearest approach
to love that had ever connected itself with him in her mind and his
image once invested with this hue never again lost it
there has been so much said and said with eloquence pathos and truth
of the heroism of every day life that i fear to approach ground
already so well occupied yet i cannot pass in silence the resolution
with which kate calmed herself to meet her grandfather at dinner and
her attention now fully roused preserved that composure even while
observing a thousand minute indications of despondency which cut her
to the heart
shall i speak to him of business tonight she asked herself more
than once anxious to begin that line of conduct which winter had
pointed out to be her duty and each time as she looked at the worn
expression of that beloved and venerated face her heart answered
no not tonight let him have a good nights rest and tomorrow
tomorrow i will unflinchingly approach the subject
so she brought him his footstool and moved his chair to the right angle
with the fire
are you quite well darling said he gazing up at her as she arranged
a cushion at his back i thought you looked pale at dinner
ah fred egerton dashing and fearless as you are could you brave
danger and death with nobler courage than that which steadied kates
voice when instead of yielding to the almost irresistible inclination
to throw herself into her grandfathers arms and pour forth passionate
and tearful assurances that come what may there was a world of
inexhaustible love and energy all his own in her heart she said
gently but with a certain cheering steadiness
well always quite well dear grandpapa now take a nice sleep
god bless you kate
seating herself book in hand in the window away from the fire for
which the evening was almost too warm but which the colonel could
not bear to give up she gazed long and fixedly at the river and
the broken bank the fields the copse and an orchard to the right
now one sheet of blossom the sturdy old oak which had looked like
a rugged skeleton all the winter now bursting into leaf at the
general flush of delicate yellowish green which seemed to pervade
all vegetable nature yet the gradual close of evening beautiful as
it was impressed her with a feeling of sadness partly caused by the
emotions of the day and partly by the mournful tenderness which is so
often and so strangely induced by the contemplation of coming night in
early spring
as kate sat leaning her head against the window frame her book hanging
negligently from her hand thinking of the rich autumn scene this
view had presented when fred egerton sketched it for her some little
bustle outside the drawingroom door attracted her attention it was
opened and nurse announced
misther and missis winther miss kate
seldom had visitors been more heartily welcome their coming was an
inexpressible relief to kate and helped her well over the evening she
had almost dreaded
few in this trying world of ours do not know that there are times
when a ttette with the person we love most on earth is an
ordeal we would fain escape when we shun the slightest expression of
tenderness lest it should betray the deep and yearning affection which
swells the heart with sadness not for ourselves but for those for
whom no sacrifice would seem painful could we but save them them from
suffering
                                   
shall i brush yer hair asthore said mrs otoole as she followed
kate into her room
no dear nurse only i want a little rest
theres a shadow on yer face darlint an wont ye spake it out to
yer own ould nurse that held ye in her arms an ye a dawshy little
craythure widout a mother may be its bad news of the captin
of the captain no we have heard nothing of him but good night i
will tell you all tomorrow dear nursei am weary now
kate might have spared herself the anxious thoughts that kept her
waking as to how she should approach the painful subject of their
difficulties with her grandfather it was done for her rudely enough
by a letter from mr moore announcing in legal terms the appointment
of a receiver over their remaining property
she knew by the rigidity with which the colonels left hand grasped the
arm of his chair as he read that some more than usual bad news was
contained in the letter
i must see winter said he after a short pause i must see him
immediately he repeated rising
if there is bad news had you not better tell me first dear
grandpapa said kate boldly and calmly
my dear child you are unfit for such discussions they would only
fret you
grandpapa i am surely old enough to be your confidante if not wise
enough to be your counsellor if we are to meet with reverses it is
only in union we can find strength to bear them oh dear grandpapa
come what may let us avoid the pangs of concealment let me read that
letter
with a mute expression of surprise at the tone she had assumed he
handed her the letter which but for winters communications the day
before would have enlightened her but little as it was she felt
a curious sensation of relief that the dreaded moment was no longer
to be anticipated and that from the present hour a mutual confidence
would be established between her and her grandfather
we must leave this house of course she said musingly as she
returned the letter shall we receive any more money from ireland
not a shilling resistance is i fear useless except for my
characters sake my child my bright kate what will become of you i
can do nothing
never before had she seen the old mans firmness shaken the low moan
with which he turned away covering his face with both his hands as
if oppressed with the sense of his own helplessness struck terror
into her heart while it seemed to arm her with indomitable resolution
to uphold and cherish her beloved parent round whose declining years
such heavy shadows were gathering steadying her voice by an immense
effort and striving to still the throbbing pulses that shook her
frame she raised and tenderly kissed the hand that hung in nerveless
despondency over the back of a chair near which the colonel stood
my own dear grandpapa i know how sad all this is but for my sake
do not be so cast down do not give way to despair you have been my
guide my model all my life show me how to bear misfortune now
she paused to regain command over her traitor voice that would tremble
but kate we are beggars in another month i shall not know where
to find the price of our daily food and though georgina desmond is
wealthy and generous dependency is wretchedness
right dear grandpapa she replied almost gladly at this opening
to the proposition she feared to make and we will scorn it see i
can play well and i love to teach oh very much you will let me try
and be so happy as to earn a little for youi should be so proud
not here but in london and then we shall be always together and so
happy and independent and
you teach never cried the old man turning from her excitedly
you were born for a different fate would to god you had married that
wealthy englishman as georgy wished but
no no interrupted kate is poverty is earning ones own bread so
miserable a lot that one should prefer the unutterable wretchedness of
a marriage without affection but why dearest and best am i not to
teach how many born to as good a position as mine have done so and
if i do not what is to become of us
what indeed groaned vernon
there was a mournful pause kate not daring to break the thread of her
grandfathers thoughts and silently pressing her smooth soft cheek
against his wrinkled hand
my own consoling angel said he at last it is a sad lot for you at
your age to sink at once into oblivion and
how do you know that i am to sink into oblivion how can you tell to
what brilliant destiny this dark passage may be but an entrance dear
grandpapa time and the hours run through the darkest day let us
bear the present expecting a brighter future and now shall i send for
mr winter
yes with a deep sigh we cannot act too quickly
trembling in every nerve yet not without a feeling of relief that the
dreaded explanation was over kate penned a hasty note to mr winter
which he quickly responded to in person
the long conference that followed placed winter au fond of the
position of his friend
the farms of knockdrum worth little over two hundred pounds per annum
were all that was left to the colonel of the wreck of his property
and this poor remainder was barely sufficient to meet the claim of mr
taaffe
we will not follow the long desultory conversation that ensued nor
record the energy with which winter poured forth proverbs spanish
french and italian to prove the satanic origin of law nor the sweet
endurance with which kate endeavoured to accustom her grandfathers
mind to her project of her teaching
it was decided that the priory house and its furniture should be
disposed of at once and that the colonel and kate should take up their
abode at winters till matters could be a little more arranged and an
answer received from lady desmond to kates last letter which informed
her of the delay occasioned by taaffes proceedings
remember colonel though i think it too soon to consider miss
vernons proposition when the time comes i shall be on her side
kate we must have a talk about itand pray dine with us when
thinking is of no use it is better to have a rubber do not be too
much cast down this diluvio has shown you the crown jewel you
have still left it is only the diamond that sparkles in the dark and
now come and see poor gilpin with me you may as well when you have
answered that confounded letter heres your desk aside to kate as
the old man settled himself to write we must not leave him too much
by himself
light and pleasant is the task to paint the the various phases of
joy for whatever light touches it beautifies but rare is the skill
that can truly depict the gloom of sorrow and fascinate the eye by
a depth of shadow that admits of little variation for those who are
gliding along on the smooth waters of prosperity turn from a picture
with which they cannot sympathise and whose most exquisite touches
uninstructed by care or adversity they pronounce overdrawn and even
the treaders of rough paths wearied with the burden and heat of the
day give but a reluctant glance at what only reminds them of their
own griefs and exclaim this we know this we have felt tell us of
joy of hope of true friends and tender hearts cheat us into a happy
dream even though it lull us but for a moment even though the waking
be bitter and our souls will bless you
chapter iii
preparations
the day but one after the above conversation another summons brought
winter to the little diningroom of the priory the scene of so many
consultations
the colonel welcomed him with his usual empressement but a tremour
of the hands as he waved towards a seat with an oldfashioned and
urbane grace which scarcely the shock of an earthquake could have made
him forget indicated some excitement kates color too was heightened
and her eyes though bright had an anxious expression
you see we cannot get on without you my dear sir began the colonel
your prompt compliance with my request for an interview is most
gratifyingah the subject i wish to speak to you on is far from
unpleasant i want your opinion on a rather momentous question in
short show mr winter that letter kate
ha hum lady desmond i see what a firm hand the woman writes
it was hurriedly written and short after a few desultory remarks
apparently in reply to kates last letter it concluded thus of law
and its probable delays i can form no judgment but why they should
prevent your visit to me i cannot and will not understand they are
additional reasons i think why you should at once take up your abode
with me at least until affairs are arranged and that lowbred knaves
vile scheme is defeated i know not dearest kate how far these
proceedings may affect the great tidal wave which ebbs and flows in
mens pockets therefore whatever you may decide upon and whenever
you require it i trust your dear grandfather will not refuse to fill
up the enclosed check on my banker for whatever sum he may want it
will be a gratification to his old protge to think she can be of
use to him and if you will use it to facilitate your journey here you
will leave scarce a wish unfulfilled to yours as everg d
ha done like a princess a generous headstrong woman ill lay my
life and now a journey or not a journey thats the question let me
hear your opinion kate
oh mr winter i have none my only clear idea is that this world is
not such a bad unhappy world where we have a lady desmond and a mr
winter to leaven the whole lump it is a most tempting offer but you
will call me perverse i do not feel half so inclined to accept it as
whenas when we were more independent of it
and you colonel vernon
i am very anxious said the colonel in a hesitating manner not
usual with him at all events that kate should avail herself of such
an invitation nurse might travel with her i shall probably visit
dublin look in upon you and
pray where is the money to come from to do all this said winter
bluntly
my dear sir you forget we shall sell our furniture and let this
house
and when that is all gone you will be just where you were except that
your chief comforter will be many a league away and lady desmonds
gratitude immersed in that lethe in which impulsive peoples noblest
sentiments most frequently lose themselves
you wrong my cousin cried miss vernon
in truth i feel incapable of deciding said the colonel i do not
like the idea of throwing ourselves on lady desmond but winter
you cannot comprehend the horror with which i contemplate my kates
teachingwalking out alone meeting insolencegreat god
he covered his face with his hands and kate half appalled by the
dismal picture he had drawn clasped hers together with an appealing
look to winter who said huskily and oracularly
hear me colonel i can easily comprehend your feelings though i
am a plebeian but i tell you there is another side of the picture
at present you are in perfect sympathy with your cousin and the
electricity of mutual obligation and kindness runs freely back and
forward between you but when you have been for six months her inmate
feeling yourself dependent on her bounty for the bread you eat when a
wish for variety may tempt her to covet the rooms you occupy for some
more amusing guest less weighed down by care and when the freshness
and excitement of a generous act shall have ceased to interest a
thousand mortifying slights a thousand unimportant trifles will make
your life wretched and wear away the links that now seem to bind you
so close together
oh no no georgy could never act unkindly cried kate
my dear young lady resumed winter there are few in this curious
world of ours that cannot once or twice in their lives do a kind and
a generous action but there is not one in a thousand or a hundred
thousand that can act with uniform kindness courtesy and justice to
a dependent a creature in their powerpower it is the forcing house
of evil the woman who could quarrel with you because you would not
be happy her way is not one of these exceptions she would wound you
one day and beg your forgiveness in abject terms the next and you
doubly sensitive from feeling the impossibility of freedom would live
in a state of slavery pah never shut yourselves out from the chance
of earning independence here for such a prospect however riant
the aspect at present
ha said colonel vernon walking up and down there is a great deal
of truth in what you say but lady desmond is a woman of warm and
generous feeling and kate at least would be safe with her so
you know grandpapa i will never leave youit is useless and cruel
to talk about it
it is both my dear colonel urged winter kate would be wretched
without you nor do i think this a fitting time for you to separate
and be warned by me live on a crust and cold water if you can earn
no more rather than doom yourselves to a life of dependence
dear mr winter you are right said kate earnestly my own
grandpapa let us make up our minds to bear all hardships provided
we are together if i must teach do not make my path more difficult
by taking it so much to heart we have long lived independent of any
pleasures but those of our home these we can still have the worst
pang will be to bid this kind friend farewell but he will come and see
us sometimes and after all we may win the lawsuit and enjoy our little
fortune doubly i will write to dear georgy and affectionately decline
her kind offer and then let us set to work at once about what must be
doneshall we dearest and best kissing his hand
it must be so said the colonel after a pause it must be so and
i will never fret you more my love by opposition to your wishes
i thought it right at all events to consider the advantages lady
desmonds invitation might offer for you though i shrink from the idea
of living on any oneand to think of parting with you ah
now you talk like a man of sense said winter i will tell you what
i think you ought to write i think lady desmond will be affronted if
you reject all her offers and justly so split the difference keep
that blank check she has sent it unconditionally against a rainy
day tell her though you have no want of it at present you may and
do not mention your intention of teaching she would be hurt at your
preferring such an alternative to residing with her next year she may
return and find you happy comfortable and independent i trust things
will wear a very different aspect from that presented by the bare
announcement i am going to teach hum he added musingly langley
used to keep up a good connection in the musical world and herman he
bears an excellent character and holds a good place you must look up
your old musicmaster my dear then colonel i have known so many
people ruined before they could make the necessary changes they get
into a procrastinating habit waiting for this to be sold and that to
be paid before the totally new system of life can be commenced which
is so essential now ill tell you what ill do leave the priory and
its furniture in my hands ill get a tenant for it or make the fat
rector take it off your hands the furniture shall be disposed of by
auction and ill advance you a hundred pounds upon it if it sells
for more ill remit you the difference if for less you can pay me
when you have pitched taaffe to the inferno but i am quite certain
it will bring more then you can start when you please quietly and
when you begin to like london direct me to sell your belongings hey
anything to stop the infernal chatter of miss araminta coxthe mrs
grundy of a what say you colonel
that you are a friend indeed i will be entirely guided by your
counsels but remember you must not wrong yourself i must have all
the auctioneers accounts forwarded to me i can hardly describe to you
the relief your thus smoothing matters affords me
you give me strength and courage said kate
hum resumed winter langleyyes he can engage lodgings for you
where you are going when do you think you can start
oh said kate shrinkingly not sooner than a fortnight or three
weeks
a fortnight or three weeks cried the colonel impossible
you are a real earnest worker miss vernon interposed winter i
expected a much longer date what will become of me when you are gone
and gone on such an errand dio buono le sciagure e le allegrezza
non vengono mai sole but what do you think of doing with mrs
otoole
oh she goes with us of course replied kate
well you know best how much you pay her and whether you can afford
it returned winter
but nurse is not like a servant she is a friend she could never live
with any people but us oh do not tell me we must leave nurse said
miss vernon
we cannot accept her services for nothing observed the colonel
i will gladly engage her as cook and housekeeper at whatever wages
you give her
her wages are small said kate she would not accept higher since
we left dungar
well you must settle all that with her returned winter i am ready
to ratify any arrangement you may make and now write to lady desmond
as i suggested kate ma belle et bonne enfant you are wearied by
this long gloomy talk and i am an old bear i know it colonel but
my heart is like the coat of my prototype rough and warm
after some more general conversation they separated winter and the
colonel to visit some land the former wished to purchase and about
which he affected great anxiety to have the colonels opinion kate
to walk in solitary meditation by the river to try and collect her
thoughts before the dreaded explanation with nurse mournfully she
gazed at all the wellknown objects she had learned to love in her
tranquil happy retirement and her bright quick fancy painted in
strong contrast the life she was henceforth to lead
even if i am successful grandpapa will be so much alone she
thought and what a crowded busy terrifying place london is i am
glad fred egerton is in india i could not bear that he should meet me
perhaps walking alone in london
and the large tears stole down her cheeks at the mixture of feelings
this vision aroused turning slowly round she approached the little
landing place intending to speak a few words to elijah bush a little
rosy curlyheaded boy was seated in the boat instead of its shaggy
owner he rose as kate stopped at the end of the landing
where is elijah she enquired
please maam hes been sick these three days back
i am sorry to hear it what is the matter with him
oh maam hes got the rheumatics drefful bad
and is there no one to mind the boat but you my little man
no maam
you cannot row it

called away from the contemplation of her own trials kate feeling
her usual elasticity return ran lightly up the steep path and called
nurse to arm herself with broth and flannel for the invalid
is it pipers lane now miss kate i cannot let you go to sich a
place set up the old methody to have miss vernon nurse and tending
iv himi can take the tay and the broth and them flannels just as

its not the likes iv me ud begrudge him a taste iv broth said
nurse tying a capacious tincan up very carefully now are yes ready
avourneen its yerself has the heart for the poor an the lord ill
remimber it to you in the hour of need amin
the little boy guided them through many narrow winding ways to
a wretched habitation outside the walls and almost under the
halfruined tower of st winefred it was a miraculous place for
although all the pools seemed to be at least partly composed of soap
suds nothing looked as if it had ever been washed
here in a tolerably clean room at least by comparison they found
elijah looking more shaggy than ever stretched on some straw and
covered with a tattered peajacket after a little kindly talk and
friendly enquiries as to the old mans resources which proved to be
indeed scanty kate left him telling the small boy to call at the
priory in half an hour when she said she would give him a note to the
doctor
so good bye elijah i hope you will be better tomorrow in the mean
time take this till you are able to earn some more yourself
im a poor hand at returning thanks miss vernon said elijah with
evident feeling but he added solemnly the lord hear thee in the
day of trouble the name of the god of jacob defend thee
amen said kate fervently bending her head to the benediction
mrs otoole pausing in her occupation of transferring the broth to
an earthen vessel crossed herself and the next moment they left the
place silently
hes a mighty quare man said mrs otoole meditatively after they
had almost reached the river side without breaking a pause of unusual
duration faith he blessed ye like a clargy
and well he might he little knows how soon his kindly wishes may be
required
why avourneen
nurse said kate after a minute of troubled thought we must leave
this place
is it to go sthreelin over thim furrin parts among dirt and flays
an the lord knows what
no nurse nothing half so agreeable
ah thin what is it agrah spake out to your poor ould nurse
ah dear nurse there are sad times coming poor dear grandpapa
through some terrible law business has no money left none at all
miss kate is it the truth yer afther tellin me
too too true i cannot explain indeed i cannot understand but there
is a mr taaffe who says grandpapa owes him a great deal of money
which was really paid long ago but which as we have lost some papers
we cannot prove and he has got knockdrum and wewe have nothing
oh blessed queen of heaven that iver i should live to see the day
not even the next gale
kate shook her head and mrs otoole placing the can beside her sat
down on a log of timber by the river as if unable to support herself
under such intelligence
an you so tinderly rared an the masther ah sweet mary whatill
become iv us at all at all taaffe sure i remimber him the desavin
vagabone ye wor arthur taaffe wid a hard word for the poor an

of his toe on the lands
you know nurse that is a sort of thing happily gone by
mores the pity if it is how are yez to deal with thaves an ruffins
if it isnt with the sthrong hand
there was a pause during which nurse her hands clasped and embracing
her knees rocked herself to and fro and kate leaning against an old
thorn now bursting into primeval youth and beauty gazed sadly down
upon her
six an four is ten an four is fourteen now burst out mrs
otoole abruptly ye see miss kate me daughther is doin well in
ameriky wid her husband an denis in the hoigth iv grandure wid the

nurse my own dear nurse said kate clasping her arms round her
where is there so true a heart as yours no no this will not do
then as nurse reddened a little should we want it you shall be the
first i apply to but we shall have a hundred pounds to go on with
and lady desmond has offered us all we want and besides approaching
the last dreaded communication with a desperate attempt at gaiety
besides i am going to earn quite a fortune

got for teaching music and

affectionately taking mrs otooles hand between both her own listen
to me suppose i had been born your own daughter instead of your
having adopted me would you think me mean if i worked for the support
of my grandfather or would you approve of my leaving him and myself
to live on what we could get from the charity of others no i thought
not will the good and gracious god regard me with less favour for
endeavouring to submit and bow before the sentence he has in his
wisdom pronounced on our first parents in the sweat of thy brow

ye in throuble oh what have i done that ye would spake that way to
me and covering her face in the folds of her cloakpoor nurse sobbed
aloud

her and endeavouring to take her hand i have said this simply
because i was told to do soi never dreamti never could dream of
parting from you and that subject is at rest between us for evercome
what may we will be together do you hear me put your arms round me
and say you forgive your own kate
and nurse folded her to her heart fervently exclaiming
the blessin iv christ on ye avourneen
there was a pause for some momentsbroken at length by the sound of
footsteps seldom heard in that unfrequented spot
we must go home now said kate wiping away her tears nurse still
silent rose and lifted her can
an where is it yer going to tache that iver i should say the word
she asked with a fresh burst of grief in londonin london musha
but its a big place and sure the house o lords is there an ill go
bail the mastherill meet many a one that heard tell iv darcy vernon
in dungarwho knows miss kate but some iv thim ill spake to the
queen to make him a jidge or a gineral or the like any ways its
sich a tunderin big place that ye might be tachin in one corner and
livin like a prencess in another an no one a bit the wiser sure yer
right hand wouldnt know what the lift was doin in a big place like
that
very true nurse i dare say no one will know what i am about
the lord send said mrs otoole heartily as the fact of kates
teaching for money began to lose half its horrors in the fancied
possibility of concealing the inglorious occupation
now nurse said kate pausing at the gate of their little domain
remember our agreement you must not make bad worse to grandpapa
niver you fear darlint id bite the tongue out iv me head afore id
spake the word that id vex yer only dont send me from ye mavourneen
true to her word when the colonel after dinnerin consequence of
kates having intimated that nurse knew how affairs stoodsaid
bad times nellybad timesworse than i ever thought i should live
to see
she replied cheerfully and steadily
thrue for ye sir but theres good luck afore yez for all thatan
miss kate an meselfs goin to be as bould as lions so we are faith
ill see yez give the gobye to thim thavin attornies yet
swiftly sped the interval that remained before they left their peaceful
dwelling numerous were the arrangements to be made before the final
move and the selections of those peculiarly sacred treasures that
could not be left behind the number of which was daily swelled winter
took charge of the colonels picture but john anderson was packed
for removalmusic and drawingsa pet vase or twoher books and some
cushions for the colonel was all that kate could take with her of
her pleasant pretty home but the sofa and prie dieu at which she
had so diligently worked to give an air of greater elegance to their
little drawingroomthe arm chair so associated in her minds eye
with the noble venerable form of her grandfatherthe flower garden
now bursting into radiant beauty and which fred egerton used so much
to admire even in its autumn garball these must pass away into
strange hands she must not only leave her ark but ever think of it as
desecrated and elijah bush too he must be left and the navigators
little orphan and the keepers sickly boyall her poor peoplethe
various objects to which her full rich sympathies so freely flowed
yes many a link that bound her closely and pleasantly to her calm
and quiet life in their ecclesiastical retreat she was compelled to
break and still through all the saddening occupations which preceded
their dreaded journey kate endeavoured to keep her mind fixed upon
the future she had laid down for herself with a steadiness which
exhibited in some more high sounding and attractive cause than the mere
commonplace duty of earning bread for her parent would have drawn
forth odes and laudations from many a potent pen
nurses conduct was beyond all praise not even when alone with kate
did she indulge in anything beyond a passing condemnation of attorneys
generally and good little mrs winter only half enlightened as to the
real motives of her friends departure was invulnerable to the prying
of miss araminta cox
matters stood thus and time had run by to within a week of the removal
to london when gilpin now very weak interrupted kates practice one
morning
my dear mr gilpin said she rising to receive him with some
surprise this is most imprudent
i could not let you go without paying one more visit to the priory
his cough interrupted him
but we should have called on you i intended doing so with grandpapa
indeed you were wrong to venture out but as you are here how glad i
am to see you and the day is so fine
when do you start he asked feebly sinking back exhausted into an
arm chair kate had drawn forward
ah do not talk of that tuesday or wednesday now the time draws near
i feel my heart sink at the idea of leaving all we are accustomed to
to cast ourselves like shipwrecked mariners on the great troubled
ocean of london
and i have almost prayed that you might remain a little longer but
it is not to be so i have crawled out today my dear miss vernon
for i knew i should find you alone and i wanted to speak a few quiet
words with you i almost feared to meet you after this sad change in
all our hopes for you i have so deplored it that judging by myself
i dreaded its effects on you but your face reassures me there is no
grief scarce a grave look there i have so much wished to speak with
you
and i with you dear mr gilpin i feel it is so long since i saw you
but let us speak at once of all that has occurred i shall soon be so
weary how is it that there is none of the languor of sorrow the fever
of anxiety in your face
because i feel neitherdo you know i am half surprised to find how
the first feeling of dread at the idea of earning money has worn away
by steadfastly looking at it it reminds me of those double pictures
which appear wintry when you first look at them but hold them to
the light and the deeper richer colors of summer painted beneath
shine forth then dear grandpapa has borne up so wonderfully and poor
nurse has been so manageable and you and mr winter soso kind that
i should be an ungrateful coward to let myself feel sad except she
added as the tears sprang to her eyes at the thought of parting from
you all
gilpin was silent for a few moments and then said
my dear young lady forgive me for not knowing your noble nature
better i ought to have been certain you would be above the common
grief that mourns the possibility of losing caste as the worst of
earthly woes my chief anxiety to see you and to see you alone was to
hear fully from your own lips all the plans of which i do not like to
question the colonel too closely and to offer you a few hints which
excuse me if i presume too far may be useful to you
our plans are simple enough to remove to london where through the
interest of my old music master and one or two friends to whom mr
winter offers me introductions i hope to obtain pupils in music who
will pay me for instruction that is all
if you will allow me i will add one to an old master of mine and
these are all the introductions you will take with you
yes all mr winter mentioned the bishops wife as likely to be of
use but to say the truth i shrunk from the idea of asking her i
do not like to have the matter talked over at the little clerical
teaparties of a so much for my highmindedness
very natural and a few good professional introductions are worth
scores of mere recommendations to fashionable ladies who consider they
fulfil their promise if they mention your name to any acquaintance
who may happen to make enquiries for an instructress now if herman
i think he was your master will really back you up and give
you his junior pupils you may be very successful i am afraid my
recommendation will not prove very effectual but try it
and mr gilpin what should youthat is have you any idea what i
ought to ask for my services
you must learn all that from herman or winters friends as to
the terms on which you and your pupils families will meet accept
some hints which experience enables me to give god knows you will
teach under very different circumstances from what i did novels
and magazines teem with the most revolting instances of the slights
shown to lady teachers in my opinion all this may be very much if
not altogether avoided except by the resident governess occasional
teachers have only to observe this rule treat those with whom you
come in contact professionally as men of business do those whom they
encounter on change or in their offices once a lesson is given
the relations between pupil and teacher are at an end and you have
no more to say to each other for this purpose resist any advance
towards intimacy which maywhich will be sure to be made to you am i
speaking too freely miss vernon in thus placing the reality of your
future before you
no said kate firmly and holding out her hand to him no i feel
the need of such suggestions and i like to talk of what must be it
is good for me and there is no use in making grandpapa think of it at
all more than necessary i hope to manage so as often to cheat him into
forgetfulness of my occupation only i do trust mr winters friend may
not engage apartments for us in a wretched narrow street lady desmond
used to live in berkeley street and it was reckoned a good situation
i thought it horrible
you might try the kensington or bayswater side
any trees or flowers to be seen there
oh yes plenty
then i will beg of mr winter to suggest that locale
mrs otoole of course goes with you
of course dear nurse she is so true and selfforgetful
and cormac what will you do with him you can hardly take that huge
animal with you
not just yet he remains with the winters but will follow us when we
can arrange to have him mr winter said no one would take us in at
first with so formidable a looking companion
i should fear not but
the entrance of the colonel here cut short their private conference
he like his granddaughter expressed surprise and pleasure not
unmingled with uneasiness at the organists appearance and after
some discussion he agreed to dine with them at a somewhat earlier
hour than usual as the softness of a june evening could not possibly
they all agreed be more injurious than the morning air
and let us send for winter and his wife concluded the colonel
once more the little circle met round the hospitable board in the
priory diningroom and though the absence of many familiar ornaments
already packed gave a look of barrenness to the pretty sitting room
and bespoke the approaching departure the party was not a sad one
each tried to cheer the others and in so doing roused himself
so ended the last dinner at the priory and never again did the same
party meet under the same roof
some such presentiment touched kates heart and gave a tenderness
to her attentions an under current of feeling even to the fanciful
sallies and playful arguments with which she strove to enliven her
guests which gracefully as she ever played the part of hostess
lent an inexpressible charm to all she uttered and even mrs winter
usually unobservant seemed impressed by the peculiar sweetness of
her voice and manner and often in after life did kate look back to
that last evening as singularly agreeable despite the approaching
separation
the last oh how much of tenderness clings round that wordthe last
word or look the last even of suffering what a grasp they take of
the memory as though the soul in itself immortal cannot familiarise
its faculties with any thing so finite so sad so passing as the last
chapter iv
a new world
however kind and true by nature a man who has risen to can never
quite understand the feeling of one who has fallen from higher
fortunes the seeming trifles which can elate or depress are but
trifles to the former nor can any amount of sincere friendship ever
reveal to him the saddening effect which some insignificant occurrence
he would scarcely perceive produces on the other he cannot dream
with what terrible and intense conviction the sudden consciousness
of total change flashes on the mind that had happily halfforgotten
it at some accident of daily life to him nothing in itself a
mere contretemps which in brighter days would have only raised a
smile but which is now too sure an indication of the current straw
though it be
and winter with all his real steady affection for kate felt
half angry with her for the obstinacy with which she adhered to her
intention of travelling by the first class in the railway he could not
comprehend what she could so well feel that the moral effect produced
on her grandfather by a long journey in a conveyance which would
every moment bring the utter change of his fortunes and position so
forcibly before him would far more than counterbalance the few pounds
saved
but reiterated winter the colonel is well and remarkably strong
for his age he would not find the journey in the least fatiguing by
the second class and my dear girl i want to impress on you the
necessity of conforming at once to the changes heaven has been
pleased to send you procrastination is always bad but in the present
case peculiarly injurious
yes mr winter i know all that and as to the fatigue that is not
what i think of but imagine how wretched grandfather would feelno
you cannot imaginebut would it be worth while for the sake of the
difference to let him receive so bad an impression of his new position
at the very outset and so rudely he will have enough to suffer let
him have an easy start in short this is one of the very few points on
which i cannot accept of your guidance and all i will add is i hope
you will though unconvinced acquiesce in my decision and not mention
this controversy to grandpapa
pon my word miss vernon you put me down right royally said he
laughing and yet surprised at the air of quiet firmness with which she
announced her determination
my own dear kind master ah when shall i have an argument with you
again but you will write to me often and sometimes come to london
i will i will indeed ah kate i did not know how much you had
twined yourself round this tough old heart of mine till i found i was
to lose my bright pupil you had better make over cormac to me till
you have a house of your own
oh no no we should be incomplete without my dear old dog besides
i promised him he should join us as soon as possible
promised the dog and you look as grave as a judge
yes i said to him yesterday i am not going to leave you long
behind dear cormac and he looked up at me with his honest eyes as
though he trusted me so implicitly i could not deceive him
kate you have too much imagination for the battle of life get rid
of some of it i advise you
get rid of it and shall i pursue my way more successfully if i clip
the wings that might sometimes help to waft me over rough places
you are incorrigible you see your fancy is going to cheat you out
of nearly five pounds in this railroad business i wish you would be
advised by me and indeed strictly speaking it is your duty to
conform as soon as possible to circumstances
my strict duty oh mr winter i abjure strictness it is a thing
of mathematical precision gone vanished with the old dispensation
which providing rules for all and every thing left no room for those
exquisite shades and tints without which life as well as pictures
would have neither truth nor beauty i never like to think how much
or how little i ought to do there is one maxim on this point that
supplies to me the absence of every other freely ye have received
freely give why should i pain another to fulfil to the letter an
unimportant duty but i have settled that point
well well you are right in intention at all events and now i must
say good morning what are you going to do
why i have finished my preparations and as grandpapa is going with
you about the luggage i intend hearing the evening service in the
cathedral vespers i like the name popish though it be for the last
time ah maestro mio tomorrow
dont talk of it but ill tell mrs winter she may expect you in an
hour au revoir
kate strolled slowly through the churchyard and mounted the steps
stood for some minutes gazing at the wellknown scene from the city
wall thinking how and when shall i see it again what awaits me
in the new world into which i am about to plunge then turning
to the right she followed the rather tortuous way formed by the
time worn ramparts until she reached the narrow alley which led to
the cathedral the entrance to the cloisters at this spot was a
low vaulted passage which communicated in ancient times with the
servants offices and formed an angle with a lofty chapel now used
as an anteroom and here kate again paused as if to take the scene
into her memory to the chapter house opposite the end opening on
the cloisters was a beautiful window showing through its lacelike
and still perfect tracery the soft green grass which clothed the
quadrangle formed by the cloisters and a thorn tree grew close against
its mullions and even thrust its branches so delicately green with
the first fresh and unspeakable tints of spring through their many
openings contrasting its fair youth with the solemn grey and massive
stones around it a bright gleam of sunshine which fell slanting it
up one half the chapel through which kate advanced leaving the other
in shadow the unbroken stillness the air of deep repose which
pervaded the old pile gave something of its own calm to her feelings
which had been a little ruffled by the thousand anticipations her
argument with winter had called up the hour of evening prayer was not
yet arrived and she stood for a while gazing at the exquisite effects
of light and shade till the perfect silence woke up her fancy and she
smiled to think that it would scarce surprise her to see a plumed
and helmetted shadow fall on the stream of sunshine which bathed the
pavement with a flood of gold and even were the shadow followed by a
substantial mailed form with knightly spurs and crosshilted sword
it would seem but natural here
the distant sound of the organ warned her that the service was about to
begin and she was soon kneeling in the quiet nook she usually occupied
the next morning they left a
the last journey i made by railroad was with you to carrington said
kate to winter
she was looking a little pale and a certain anxious nervousness made
her tremble in every limb but she kept up very cheerfully
they were standing on the platform at the railway station waiting for
the train which starting from some newer and more important place
only gave a few hurried breathless moments to poor old antilocomotive
a
the colonel was looking a shade more elegant even than usual in a
large cloak which hung gracefully round his tall erect form there
was their luggage all ticketed and piled up all of home that could be
packed into trunks and kate felt singularly desolate at the idea of
being thus for the first time without any sanctuary however humble
to which as to an ark she might retreat when the fountains of the
great deep of sorrow or of disappointment were broken up and mrs
winter was there with a wellpacked basket of sandwiches and wine and
water but poor gilpin had been so unwell since his imprudent visit
to the priory that he had been obliged to leave the winters to do
the parting honours alone to their valued friends nor can we omit
to mention mrs otoole who in a black silk bonnet snowy cap and
substantial cloth cloak albeit it was early june looked the very
model of a respectable old familyservant over one arm hung miss
vernons shawl and in her left hand she carried a blue bandbox
containing divers and sundry articles thrust into it at the last
moment and secured by a red silk handkerchief
yes returned winter in reply to kates observation we were a
merry trio but we little anticipated the adventure you contrived to
get up
it was all very curious said kate with a sigh as her thoughts flew
back to that pleasant evening and its still pleasanter dnoument
a shrill piercing whistle the porters stood not to their arms but
to their trunks
uptrain coming said one of them warningly to our little party
now then dont be in a hurry colonelget the tickets all right
said winter and the huge hissing relentless monster of an engine
rushed panting by the platform do you get in and settle yourselves
colonel mrs otoole and i will see to the luggage
the colonel obeyed but kate stood by the carriage door winter soon
bustled back and in more than usually husky tones observed
all rightthere goes the bell
dearest mrs winter cried kate clasping that worthy little woman
in her arms good bye and the tears she had long with difficulty
restrained poured down her cheeks then turning to the kind rough
artist she somewhat to his surprise bestowed an equally affectionate
embrace on him with such childlike simplicity and sincere feeling
that he was inexpressibly touched my kind love to mr gilpin and i
need hardly say take care of cormac
god bless you dear kate from both the winters and she was hurried
into the carriage where nurse was already seated a jerk back and
then forward and they were swept away from the kind faces that looked
so eagerly after them
as long as the neighbouring scenery presented any familiar features
kate looked mournfully and wistfully through the window but soon too
soon they were flying beyond the limits of her longest walks and
when the distant height crowned by mowbray castle longest visible
because the highest point in the surrounding country disappeared she
dismissed her regrets turned resolutely from the contemplation of
past happiness and determined to let no selfish grief no personal
consideration whatever intervene between her heart and its great task
comforting and supporting her grandfather
and you feel quite well quite comfortable dear grandfather
yes love why this is as good as any private carriage you know i am
quite a novice in railroad travelling how do you like it nelly
faith an its an illigant coach intirely but miss kate jewel did
iver ye see anything so fast as the hedges do be runnin
yes laughed the colonel london will be down here presently
there is little ever to relate of a journey by railat least at the
time of which we write when excursion trains and concussions were
not quite such everyday events as in 18512 little occurred to vary
the even tenor of their course speed was slackened bells rung and
incomprehensible names bawled out at the due number of stations one
or two companions were added to and diminished from their number
with whom the colonel entered urbanely into conversation and about
two oclock offered them refreshment from mrs winters wellstored
basket which was thankfully accepted by his fellowtravellers who set
him down in their private opinions as some condescending nobleman
of philanthropic habits and enjoyed his sandwiches and sherry with
redoubled got could they have known he was a broken gentleman
and an irish one to boot how soon urbane condescension would have
changed to pushing forwardness and the gracious offer of a sandwich
to some deep design of getting up an acquaintance with ulterior
objects possibly still more dreadful
at length the closer ranks of houses and increasing hubbub of hissing
engines and departing trains warned them they were fast approaching
the great metropolis
the quiet and ease of their journey was at an end the moment
they stepped from the retirement of the carriage into the bustling
confusion of the platform beyond which a line of cabs were drawn
up the length of which positively appalled kate as indicative of
the immense crowd amongst whom they would have to struggle for their
luggage the additional difficulty of darkness was superadded to those
already arising from crowd and hurry for they had not left a until
considerably past noon
och holy virgin how are we iver to get the thrunks in sich a
scrimmige ejaculated mrs otoole
we must look for the van they put them in at a said kate who
was trembling with nervous anxiety and depressed at feeling how
unfitted she was for so bustling a scene
jest dont be walkin off wid the masthers portmanty said mrs
otoole laying a vigorous grasp on the arm of a railway porter
is this here yers
yes an so is the black wan an the wan wid the leather cover in the
van c
and soon the civil and expeditious porters had placed all their luggage
in a goodly pile
now said the colonel for the transit to bayswater
cab sir
yes two
the colonel and kate led the way with their light parcels and nurse
followed with an overflowing cargo
it is a strange sensation that of whirling through unknown streets by
gas light the complete ignorance of where you are going the seemingly
miraculous facility with which you are whisked round innumerable
turnings the flaring gaslight before the meaner shops and short
intervals of gloomy respectable quarters
kate felt all this strongly and sat gazing at the busy crowded
streets holding her grandfathers hand and scarcely breathing it
seemed as though she had never felt the changes that had occurred in
their lot before and wearied by the journey and the busy days that
preceded it she experienced that dread fluttering sensation half
fear half excitement that made her long oh how intensely for some
familiar face to welcome them some strong calm friend into whose arms
she might throw herself and feel safe
but fate forbid such things to be and a curtseying landlady
received them in all the glories of an afternoon toilette with an
elaborate front cunningly secured with three rows of narrow black
velvet round the head and a profusion of cherrycolored ribbons in her
cap
here hester carry up the carpet bags mr langley was here today
maam and said we might hexpect you about height oclock but its
near nine now what would you please to take ill have candles lighted
in a moment
and she ushered them into a small parlour furnished with a most
obdurate looking horsehair sofa six horse hair chairs ranged round
the walls an impracticable arm chair and a small round table
covered with a bright red cloth a diminutive looking glass over the
mantelpiece on which were displayed a few cheap ornaments and
a chiffonnier of mock rosewood with warped doors completed the
inventory
tea i think kate will be the most acceptable refreshment if you
will be so good as to let us have some tea mrs mrs 
the colonel paused
crooks said the amiable lady
ah yes mrs crooks
certainly sir and she retired as the servant entered with two
tall candles unsteadily thrust into very short candlesticks
it is unnecessary to describe the wretchedness of such an arrival the
total derangement of all established comforts and london lodginghouse
tea and milk and the professional rapidity with which the servant
clatters down the plates and deals out the knives the illcleaned
britannia metal teapot the pale market looking butter all all so
unlike home
nurse who had taken miss vernons sac de nuit to her room now came
to the rescue
ah dont be breakin yer heart sthrivin to make tay an the wather
not half biled there smelling the tea which kate had put out and
setting it down with a look of disgust athen tis little iv ye kem
from chayney any how sure i put a dust iv the rale sort into me
banbox the last thing an its well them villains at that moiderin
station didnt lose it an me box an all have a taste iv buthered
toast here me good girl just bile up that kittle an when its bilin
mad run up wid it stay ill go down meself
and mrs otoole prepared them a very refreshing cup of tea which they
insisted on her sharing and largely did she contribute to enliven
their first repast in the mighty metropolis by her shrewd caustic
remarks on the various little events of their journey
sure its so quiet we might think ourselves in the priory she said
after a pause another bit of toast miss kate yer white wid the
journey and the scrimmage alanah
yes replied the colonel it is singularly quiet here
but listen to that distant continuous roar said kate what is it
she asked of the girl who was removing the tea things
plase maam its the busses
they were located in one of the numerous albert groves or victoria
terraces which congregate near and diverge from the main bayswater
road
after some more desultory conversation the little party retired to
the rest they so much needed kate and nurse first carefully arranging
the colonels room but long after she had laid her head on the hard
and diminutive lodginghouse pillow kates busy fancy kept sleep
aloofthe fact that she was actually in london was almost incredible
that the dreaded parting with the winters and the priorythe terrible
exchange of all the sweet sanctities of home for the uncertainties
and insecurity of lodgingsthat all this so long anticipated was
absolutely accomplished and that from this time forward a new world
of actionof realityof sober stern existence lay before her such
thoughts as these were potent enemies to sleep then her last visit to
the great city and its gaieties and studies presented themselves
and lady desmonds probable returnfollowed by a natural chain of
associations and finally the priory with its pretty garden and the
neighbouring woods in all their glories of autumnas they looked the
day she found fred egerton seated with her grandfather rose before her
minds eye and all the pleasant incidents of that happy time unrolled
themselves before herclearly at first but at length strangely
mingled with memories of dungar and older days still once or twice
she strove to reunite the broken chain of thought but slowly they all
faded and the hours of a short summers night sped on their way and
gradually her spirit woke from the first deep sleep that fell upon it
and wearied by the heaviness that had of late weighed it down fled
joyously to the scenes of its early childhood and summoned to its
side the friends it loveduntil a flood of morning sunshine pouring
into her room woke her and her eyes fell upon the broad comely
countenance of mrs otoole
athen the blessin iv christ on ye jewel sure the angels was
whisperin to ye in heavenye wor smilin so swate in your sleep
oh nurse why did you awake me so soon i mean
soon ejaculated mrs otoole sure its nine oclock so it is an
you that was always up at seven
nine is it possible but nurse are morning dreams always true
sure i told ye so a hundred times an ye always laughed at me was
it dreamin ye wor alanah
yes of dungar and of such strangebut go dear nursei will ring
soon for you have you seen grandpapa this morning how did you sleep
yourself
hes not rung his bell yet an i was as snug as any duchess
to kates infinite delight morning displayed a garden some ten feet
square in front of their new abode sufficient to satisfy the elastic
conscience of the builder in calling the row of houses in which it
was situated victoria gardens true it was not in that perfection
of keeping so grateful to eyes susceptible of the beautiful but still
the green of a few ragged lilacs and laburnums with the perfume of a
mignionette bed was most refreshing and so much better than anything
she had ventured to hope forthat she felt inexpressibly cheered
the colonel too had slept wellat least till daylight when he had
been rather disturbed by the screams of a parrot a great pet mrs
otoole informed them of their landlady breakfast over and the
times secured for her grandfather kate was soon immersed in a long
confidential letter to winter and his wife
their late breakfast had encroached more than she thought upon the
morning and she felt surprise when the landlady announced mr langley
and winters old friend entered he was a long pale man with lightish
hair and whey coloured whiskers his manners cold and shy impressed
kate with an uneasy feeling that it would be impossible to set him at
ease
very much obliged by your early visit said the colonel rising with
his usual suave cordiality we have to thank you for procuring for
us such comfortable apartmentsmy granddaughter miss vernon
mr langley bowed and in so doing upset a ricketty chair whereupon
he endeavoured to restore it to its former position and in the
struggle dropped his hat and gloves at last his composure a little
restored by the graciousness of his new acquaintances he gathered
courage to ask coldly after winter and still more slightly for his
wife to which the colonel replied by giving very copious details
of their friends and kate thought he listened with more interest
than he ventured to express in words some general conversation then
ensuedtheir journey and the old city of a were discussed mr
langley glanced once or twice at his hat which had unfortunately got
into an inaccessible corner and kate began to fear that this first
interview to which she had looked as to a mine of information
whereby to form her plans and guide her future proceedings would pass
away in the vain repetition of polite nothings while the colonel in
his highbred anxiety to entertain his visitor seemed to forget there
was any more serious subject to discuss beyond the decline of the
drama or the prospects of the ministry
it was always with extreme reluctance that kate ever broached any
subject connected with the realities of their position in the
presence of her grandfather now that all the necessary changes had
been made and to this natural difficulty was added the awkwardness
of introducing important queries apropos to nothing at last taking
advantage of a pause in the colonels eloquence of which mr langley
seemed inclined to avail himself to depart she plunged boldly
because desperately into the subject uppermost in her thoughts
i am most anxious to lose no time in endeavouring to get pupils mr
winter mentioned to you i suppose
yes said langley turning to her with more of complacency than his
manner had hitherto exhibited his painters eye probably caught by
her expressive countenance and graceful figure yes he mentioned
your intentionand ithat is i hope you will not disapprove i told
some friends of mine professors of music and they wish to hear you
play and then they will be able to judge how far they can forward your
views
thank you cried kate glancing nervously at the colonel to whose
high and usually pale forehead the color rose at this proposed
exhibition of his refined noble and graceful grandchild you are
most kind to have anticipated my arrival but she added covering her
face playfully with her hands i never shall have courage for such an
exhibition such an ordeal
but if they never hear you perform how can they recommend you asked
langley in a matteroffact tone
i did but jest replied kate and am ready to do whatever you may
recommend
of course if it is repugnant to miss vernon however friendly and
judicious your suggestion mr langley i cannot permit her began the
colonel in disturbed accents
dearest grandpapa this matter is between mr langley and myselfyou
may listenbut are not to interfere am i not right mr langley
he bowed startled into silent admiration by the extreme beauty of her
smile
i am silenced said the colonel
winter mentioned resumed langley after a moments pause that
you were a pupil of hermanns i would advise your renewing your
acquaintance with him he is one of the first masters in the
fashionable world at present
i fully intend writing to him tomorrow and
why not today interposed langley with increasing warmth and
merely ask him to appoint an interviewbe sure you see himwriting is
of little usebesides he has a daughteri mean twoamiable girls
i am toldindeed i know one of them miss vernon addressing the
colonel can therefore call on him with perfect propriety for he
could never otherwise see her his time is so much occupied
the colonel again reddening to the roots of his hair made a silent
inclination of his head too much overcome at the idea of kates
being compelled to call on any man to be able to infringe upon her
injunction
unfortunately resumed langley i have no one to do the honors of my
house but my sister who lives close by here intends to do herself
the pleasure of calling on you miss vernon and hopes to fix some
evening when i can introduce you to some professional friendsbut i
see you have no piano
we shall be most happy to make your sisters acquaintance my piano
is still at a but i hope to have it early next weekonly i am
sure i cannot think where it can stand in this diminutive chamber
but it is essential you so soon lose the facility of execution
winter tells me you play well and he is no mean judge
i trust you may be of the same opinion but the degree of perfection
required from musicians appals me
nothing mediocre goes down now returned langley with an emphasis
not very encouraging and as i believe i have paid you a long visit
rising nervously my sister would have accompanied me but one of her
little boys is ill i hope she may soon be releasedi mean be able
to call on you she knows several people about here all with young
families ah good morning miss vernon good morning sir
i shall take an early opportunity of returning your visit said the
colonel accompanying him to the door
pray do and as mr winter tells me miss vernon is a lover of
paintings perhaps she might like to take a look at my studio
oh thank you cried kate who had followed them i shall be
delighted
good morning then
this seems promising dear grandpapa said kate settling back to her
writing with a sunny smile i am so glad i saw mr langley before i
closed my letter he appears friendly though certainly not brilliant
promising kate cried the colonel playing nervously with his
glasses and holding the paper aside in one hand promising it is
unutterably repugnant to my feelings to think that you will have
to exhibit your paces or your performance rather to secure the
suffrages of a set of fiddlers and to wait upon a fat german who
i remember used to seem to abjure water and wore a ring on his
thumb this mr langley seems to forget what is due to a gentlewoman
altogether or to be totally ignorant of it and only that i was
afraid of vexing you my love i would have told him so coldblooded
john bull
i should indeed have been greatly distressed had you done so said
kate you know dearest and best i am only known to him in my new
character and is it not unreasonable to be displeased with him
because he endeavours according to his judgment which i believe to be
the true one to forward my views
instinct might have told him yours was a peculiar case to tell you
to call on a german musicmaster
pooh grandpapa as mr winter would say if you and i were staying
at the clarendon en route to paris you would be the first to
encourage me in paying a visit to my old master why
it is a totally different thing this old german
true and it may be prejudice but under the circumstances i would
prefer visiting a german to an english musicmaster my own dear
grandpapa we must be content to lose the shadow if we can secure the
substance and now i must proceed to finish my letter
hastily finishing her long crossed epistle to the winters she
proceeded to pen a billet to hermann recalling herself to his
recollection and expressing a strong desire for an interview with
him this was placed selon les rgles in an envelop when a grand
difficulty presented itselfthe addresshe used to live in baker
street but i forget the number she rung
would mrs crooks be so good as to let me see a directory
please em shes not got one
how provoking and it is just post hour
send that note on chance suggested the colonel and we can get the
right address from langley if it fails
good she replied and sent both her epistles at once to the post
the day notwithstanding the promise of the morning proved wet but
langleys long visit and her long letter made it pass quickly to
kate she now put away her writing materials singing snatches of her
favourite songs to her grandfathers surprise and looking bright as
an embodied gleam of sunshine the idea of speedy action was cheering
beyond measure to her energetic earnest spirit and though it may
lower her in the estimation of sentimentalists and evangelicals she
was too young and too lighthearted not to feel considerable pleasure
at the idea of a soire at langleys sisters
are ye ready for yer dinner miss kate an would the masther mind the
girl layin the cloth enquired mrs otoole putting in her head
certainly not replied the colonel
i have not seen you all day nurse said kate what have you been
doing
i wint out to get some chops for yer dinners an the thief iv a
butcher asks me ninepince a pound for thim is it jokin ye are
ses i mum ses he as if he was bothered is it plum cake ye do
be feedin yer sheep on ses i to go be afther askin ninepince a
pound for thim chops ses i wid that he ups and he ses his mate was
the best an the chapest in the place an id get nothin ondher it
an sure enough i wint to ivery butcher widin two miles an sorra one
iv thim ud give the chops for less an some asked more theres london
for ye but it ud break yer heart to see the woman sthrivin to brile
thim on the hanful iv coals in wan corner iv the grate i wish yed
spake to her to let me cook for yes but nurse suddenly paused and
held up her hand to enforce silence as an approaching jingle announced
the coming dinner apparatus
have you dined yourself dear nurse asked kate
sure i tuck a cup iv tay an an egg sorra sich an egg iver i seen
ye know its a fast day miss kate
their dinner was soon despatched the half cold half raw chops so
different from their simple yet tempting fare at home offering little
to induce its prolongation after its removal kate looked wistfully
from the window
it does not rain now grandpapa would you not like a stroll into
kensington gardens i should like so much too to find out some
library for how shall we get over this evening without music or work
or books or chess oh i forgot nurse has unpacked the chessboard
i am not inclined for walking or chess either my love indeed i am
singularly knocked up i should like a book however
but i am sure a little walk would do you good dear grandpapa
no my dear i will take a sleep and if you like to go out nurse
can go with you it will be a pleasure to her too
after settling the colonel to the best of her ability in the
impracticable armchair kate summoned mrs otoole who most readily
obeyed her call heartily tired of the society of mrs crooks for as
she said emphatically theres no divarshin in thim english
after enquiring their way to the nearest circulating library kate
and mrs otoole set out on their exploring expedition the rain had
ceased and a rich yellow evening sun shone out in full lustre
how new everything looks here nurse said kate when they had walked
a few minutes in silence how different from dear old a
in troth it does miss kate but thim gardens as they call thim
is mighty fine an did ye iver see sich dawshy little houses wid
balconies afore
never indeed they give me the idea of handsomely ornamented
mansions seen through an inverted telescope for there is a little of
everything about them
athen wan good ould red stone house like what was in a is
worth a score iv thim
the extreme newness of everything notwithstanding its prettiness and
neatness was displeasing to kates eye accustomed as it had been to
the mellow tints and picturesque irregularity of a
it is remarkable how much more congenial both to heart and mind are
indefinite and irregular outlines as if the more perfect finish
was all too cramped too finite to satisfy the boundless and formless
imaginations of mans heart as tupper beautifully says
    thinkest thou the thousand eyes that shine with rapture on a ruin
    would have looked with half their wonder on a perfect pile
    and wherefore notbut that light tints suggesting unseen beauties
    fill the complacent gazer with self grown conceits
the library was without much difficulty found and the demure damsel
who there represented the muses in reply to kates enquiries handed
her a catalogue in which she soon lost herself as one usually does in
the vain attempt to discover favorite authors widely separated by an
inexorable alphabetical arrangement
have you nothing by the authoress of the cup and the lip asked
kate
yes maam but its out this work is a good deal called for
presenting a volume open at the title page
kate glanced at it zarifa a tale of the passions
no thank you said miss vernon
just got this in maam trials and trifles by one who has
experienced both
let me look at it if you please ah this is rather too sentimental
have you the knight of gwynne
yesm
then i will take it and pray send the times every morning to no
 victoria gardens for colonel vernon if you please
a rather stout gentleman with longish fair hair and an umbrella under
his arm who had entered the shop a few minutes before and stood with
two letters in his hand waiting until the shopwoman was at leisure to
attend to him and in a position that commanded an excellent view of
kates profile started at these words
vernon said he in good english but with a foreign accent do i
speak to my gentle pupil ah you remember
mr herman she exclaimed after a moments hesitation how
fortunate how happy i am to have met you i have just written to you
it is most curious resumed her cidevant master shaking her hand
warmly and respectfully i do not think i ever entered a shop in
this neighbourhood before but i have just come from madame ms
establishment where i for my sins give lessons once aweek and you
have you been long in town how is the graffin your cousin i suppose
with you
no she is at florence i am with grandpapa close to this we only
arrived in london yesterday and i have already written a note to
you though i had forgotten your precise address
oh the old place baker street no 33 and you want lessons again
well you did me great credit and though i have not one moment in the
day disengaged except to snatch a hasty meal ill break through my
regulations and give you the evening hour
thank you very much said kate interrupting with difficulty the
flow of his eloquence but i do not want to take lessons i wrote to
ask you to appoint a day and hour when i might call on youany hour
will suit methen i will tell you the object of my visit
call upon me repeated hermann with surprise well well i am
afraid i must not offer to save you that trouble for i am in such
request just at present ah if you would not mind calling so early as
twelve oclock i generally snatch a hasty lunch at that hour if i am
not at home when you come my daughter will endeavour to entertain you
until my return and now i must run away
but what day mr herman cried kate anxiously
oh the day after tomorrow i shall have a little more time
infinitely pleased to have met you dear lady and to perceive you have
the same appearance of good health as hey ho shouted the good
natured musico rushing breathlessly after an omnibus into which an
active conductor rapidly crammed him and he was swept off
this little adventure quite excited kate and although capable of
exerting great selfcommand her temperament was too finely organised
not to be both nervous and sensitive so the arm she passed through
nurses was not the steadiest as they turned to leave the shop
och what makes ye thrimble so agra
do i tremble nurse i suppose it must be the surprise of meeting mr
herman how fortunate i accept it as a good omen
faith hes mighty like a pearso big at one end an small at the
other sure hes like the side iv a house round the shoulders an his
two little feet ud stand in a tay cup an what wide throwsers he has
do you not remember him when we were at lady desmonds three years
ago
och now was that the garman that used to be tachin ye the piania
kate nodded
och then my gracious but hes grawn very fat
miss vernon was too much engrossed by her own reflections on the
probable result of this rencontre to encourage nurses garrulity till
the beauty of the magnificent old trees in kensington drew her from
her thoughts and she pointed her companions attention to the long
alleys with their graceful leafy arches that stretch along each side
of the broad walk from the bayswater entrance
and deeply did mrs otoole enjoy the confidential chat in which her
idolized nurseling indulged her especially the perspective of an
evening party
sure its taydious to be always alone with an ould gintleman like the
master god bless him any how though faith its himself is the height
of good company
i never tire of him nurse
no in coorse not but miss kate jewel yell be lavin him some day
with some grand lord yell see at thim parties
i do not fancy lords are so very plentiful at the bayswater
soires replied kate laughing at nurses simplicity
a then yell never see wan thats grander or pleasanter nor the
captin i niver tuck to any one as i tuck to him to see the illigant
bould step iv him an the bright face iv him an he as tindher
hearted as an infant och sure miss kate theres some fairy gift
about a rale gentleman jist hear wan say how are ye an ye feel the
better iv it as if he was in airnest an plaised to see ye but wan iv
thim squireens faith its like rubbin the coat iv a cat the wrong way
to hear wan iv thim sthrivin to spake civil
very true nurse there is some mysterious charm about good manner
but it must spring from the heart and i believe when all are true
christians all will be real gentlemen
athin is it sarious ye are miss kate
after a little more conversation they returned to the colonel whom
they found awake but still reclining with an air of lassitude in
the arm chair kate at once and with much animation commenced an
account of her meeting with herman but the indifference with which her
grandfather received the intelligence so important in her estimation
checked her ardour and seemed to throw her back on herself it is
indeed wonderful the effect which sympathy or no sympathy produces
the colonels coldness did not alter the fact of the lucky rencontre
or of hermans kindness of manner and yet it seemed to dissolve her
air castles about numerous pupils friendly associates and a happy
busy life of useful occupation not unmingled with amusement into a
chilling mist as night winds condense the vapours which have been
spread by the suns heat
well let us have tea my dear what book did you get
the knight of gwynne grandpapa
ah i suppose that is meant for my old friend maurice fitzgerald it
will remind me forcibly of days i had better forget
i hope it will amuse you said poor kate the tears springing to her
eyes at such unwonted depression and contrariety on her grandfathers
part
tea over and the remaining daylight of a summers eveningwhich in
town has anything but a cheering effectshut out miss vernon lit the
candles and after a diligent search unearthed a small and rather
delapidated footstool from beneath the sofa which she placed under
the colonels feet endeavouring with unwearied sweetness to cheer
him and draw him from himself and his position till at length he
gave the wishedfor command
read some of that book for me my dear
yes dearest grandpapa and as poor nurse is all alone among
strangers may i ask her to bring in her work and listen too
certainlycertainly
this was quickly done and kates object to provide amusement for
the colonel fulfilled as nurses shrewd remarks on whatever subject
was brought before her were sure to interest and amuse her indulgent
master
he leaned back his head and closed his eyes as if but half inclined
to listen soon however the varied modulations of kates musical
intellectual voice and the sound of familiar names fixed his
attention and transported him in imagination to other scenes and
other times and at length fully drawn from the contemplation of
the present it was with something of his old brightness of eyes and
lightness of step that the colonel retired for the night
well nelly those were pleasant times and right good fellows i
think lever has hit off some of them capitally yet i could give him a
few hints hey kate good night my lovei will take a walk with you
tomorrow
and kate laid her head on her pillow blessing lever for having
effected by his lighthearted familiar style what no writer
however profound or grand pathetic or even religious would in all
probability have accomplished
chapter v
the new world continued
the morning of miss vernons visit to her cidevant musicmaster
rose bright and clear and smiling at her own care it was with rather
more than usual attention to her appearance she arranged her simple
toilette for thought she i am to meet his daughterand women judge
so much more critically of dress than men
the colonels announcement of his intention to accompany her called
forth all her tact to avoid the escort she remembered keenly
the effect produced on him by mr langleys plain unvarnished
communications and as he had now apparently forgotten them and
returned to his usual happy easy frame of mind she dreaded the
renewal of those unpleasant sensations which had so disturbed him by
the discussion of the important questions of pounds shillings and
pence which she was nerving herself to approach boldly besides she
did not feel quite certain how herman would take the intelligence she
had to communicate then she dreaded that the kind old man might fancy
himself de trop
i am afraid dear grandpapa we must start so early you will not have
time to read the paper comfortably
it cannot take more than halfanhour to drive from this to baker
street
i intended walking cabs are so expensive
why kate my love you are grown quite miserly
finally she managed to insinuate a strong necessity that he should
return mr langleys call and fix a day for her to visit his studio
and carried her point that she and mrs otoole should walk to baker
street by the park while the colonel was pacified by the paper and
the projected visit to langley
good bye my own dear grandpapaam i looking nice
yes darling like a rosebud as you are
and he gazed proudly at her over his glasses as she stood before him
in her simple elegant muslin dress straw bonnet with plain white
ribbon and large soft barge shawl
there isnt the like iv her in buckingham palace said mrs otoole
with a confidential nod as she followed her out of the room
keep to the parks till you come to the marble arch then down oxford
streetany one will show you the way to portman square and
oh thank you mrs crooks once i am in portman square i shall know
my way
kate was not quite so agreeable a companion as usual during this walk
as she felt considerable nervousness about the approaching interview
nurse too greatly disliking the errand on which they were bound
spoke little except an occasional ejaculation of pious discontent or
a growl at the various conductors who kindly invited them to ride in
their omnibusses
their walk was therefore silent and fatiguing but baker street was
gained at last
not at home m said a smart girl with a cap at the back of her
head in reply to miss vernons enquiries
and miss herman
oh miss herman is at home mplease walk this way
nurse will you wait for me
and kate followed the servant up a handsomely carpeted staircase
miss herman was working something in a frame she was more
englishlooking than her father with a profusion of fair hair and in
a very handsome morning costume
i have expected to see miss vernon she said rising to receive her
visitor with much graciousness and rather too much ease my father
told me he expected a visit from one of his former pupils
i was so fortunate as to meet him accidentally the day before
yesterday and was delighted to renew my acquaintance with him
i have often heard my father speak of you and of your great taste
for music you were quite one of his pet pupils i expect him in
immediately
and the two young ladies were soon excellent friends the more so as
kates new acquaintance was quite able to make up for any silence or
preoccupation on her part caused by the nervous anxiety with which
we watch for an important interview
miss herman was evidently rather curious as to the object of kates
visit to her father and kate saw no reason why she should not gratify
her curiosity for preoccupied as she was any other topic was
irksome and though not exactly of the stamp she had been accustomed
to it was so long since she had enjoyed a conversation with a lady at
all near her own age that she found it a pleasant variety yet it was
with a sensation of relief that poor kate hailed her exclamation
there is my fathers knock
in another moment he bustled into the room
rather late dear lady but much pleased to see you
luncheon directly gertrude
then seating himself by kate as his daughter left the room
now let me hear in what i can serve you my dear miss vernon for i
got your note all safe
kate hesitated a moment and then her color rising yet with a certain
playfulness and without any preface said
you thought i wanted to take lessons from you my dear sirno i want
pupils myself
herman uttered a slight groan
i was apprehensive of something of the kind when i read your note
yet i turned from the idea as quite preposterous and your noble
relative
she knows nothing of my intention but my dear mr herman continued
kate with a firmness and decision that surprised even herself let
us not waste time in deploring what is inevitable believe me there
is a strong necessity for the step i am about to take which does not
considered in the abstract offer any great attractions the question
is can you and will you kindly put me in the way of carrying out my
views to say that i have been your pupil would i am sure be greatly
in my favour but i want more than that to introduce me in my new
career
dear lady i happen it is true to be rather the fashion as a musical
teacher just at present and i should be most happy to serve you
but though i gave you lessons for three or four months i cannot say
i trained you and i have some pupils brought up to music as their
profession whom i must consider first besides though you had great
talent as an amateur it is a different thing for a teacher ahhave
you kept up your music
yes most diligently replied kate who felt her cheeks hot and her
hands cold during this speech of hermans
well then rising and opening a grand piano let me hear you play
and i will tell you exactly what i think now you must hear the truth
it is all ask
miss vernon threw aside her bonnet and shawl and seated herself
at the piano but her memory seemed suddenly clouded by the very
necessity for clearness nay her physical vision by the intense
anxiety to acquit herself well and while the room swam before her
the only distinct image she could perceive was hermann standing
opposite with a look of severe criticism on his countenance but
this moment of suffering did not lastkate was making rapid strides
in the acquirement of that selfcommand without which the empire
of the world is but a wider range for the sceptred slave i must be
calmi will not be false to myself she thought and pressing her
hands to her eyes for an instant she conjured up the organists pale
benevolent face as it used to look when he listened to her playing
and thus placed her spirit once more within the calm influence of
her old cloistered home then with a true and steady finger began
a fantasia composed by hermann himself he started at the first
notesand listened with wrapt attention quite as much the effect of
her performance as his own will his daughter enteredhe held up
a warning finger to enjoin silenceshe came to listen but whether
there was one listener or a thousand was now a matter of indifference
to kate who absorbed in the music and revelling in the tones of
a magnificent instrument after nearly a weeks fast poured forth
the really beautiful composition with a fervour of feeling and a
perfection of execution that quite astonished her hearers and when
at length after some beautiful and difficult runs the piece ended
with sustained chords the german burst into exclamations of delight
in his native tongueechoed by his daughter while kate agitated by
her success stood quite stillsilent from her utter inability to
articulate
but it is wonderful how well you have remembered my instructions i
shall certainly mention you everywhere as my pupilmy advanced pupil
and now we will have our luncheonlet me offer you my arm do you
sing
yes
ah then we will first have a song
no no mr herman i was foolishly nervous about playing and now i
feel hardly able to speak much less to sing
well then you must come and have a glass of wine to restore you
during the progress of the luncheon kate learned many particulars as
to the usual rates of remuneration c and was surprised to find it
so low
as a beginner you can hardly hope to get much said hermann who was
devouring veal pie and pickled cabbage with great appetite but i
hope to be of use to you here too i will try to get you the best terms
i can and you will agree to whatever i arrange
of course you are most kind my dear sir but how soon do you think
you will be able to get me some pupils
we shall seewe shall seeyou must not be in a hurry and gertrude
give me that portfolio here said he here is a simple air
harmonise it in four parts at your leisure and enclose it to me that
will show me what you know of theory if you would consent to play and
sing at private concerts you might make a very good thing of it and
with your figure and face i
hush hush cried kate with an involuntary action and holding up
her hand as if to repel by physical force the idea suggested by
herman it is useless to mention such a plan
well well as you likebut it is the pleasantest and most lucrative
line by far and now dear lady i must run awayi am beyond my time
and the old duchess of l is as sharp as a needle about a minute
more or less of the lesson god bless youwrite your address in my
book i might lose your noteyou are a pupil i may well be proud of
good bye and he bustled off
after a few more civil words with miss herman and writing her name and
address in the book herman kept for the purpose kate took her leave
i hope to have the pleasure of calling on you said miss herman
i shall be most happy to see you and to introduce you to grandpapa
if i do not call soon pray excuse me as i have many engagements are
there any omnibusses pass near your house
oh yes several i think i had better take one going backthey are
not very disagreeableare they
why have you never been in an omnibus said miss herman with some
surprise
never as yet
and nurse having appeared from the lower regions kate shook hands
once more with her lively goodhumoured new acquaintance and
departed in high spirits at the result of her visit
i am very tired nurse and i am sure so are you
is it tired miss kate not a bit iv it sure wasnt i aitin the
best iv cauld beef an dhrinkin the best iv ale down in the
housekeepers parlour they seem mighty nice kind of people an there
was wan of thim with the quarest cap
there dear nurse call that omnibus
och sure miss kate ye wouldnt be afther goin into wan iv the like
iv thim its nothins but the counterjumpers goes in thim
no matter the sooner i get used to them the better said miss
vernon resolute not to do things by halves but to descend freely and
therefore gracefully so do not let another pass nurse for indeed i
am very tired
oh blessed bridget oh marciful moses look at this did iver i
think tostop will ye have ye no eyes in yer head ye thief ye wor
niver tired bawlin to us to go wid yez whin we didnt want ye
bayswater mumyes mum and kate and mrs otoole were crammed
into a vehicle apparently full to overflowing at least so kate
thought though the conductor assured them he had not got his number
the occupants as usual would not at first open their ranks and it
was not until after some moments of uneasy balancing and staggering
that our two novices in omnibus travelling were accommodated with
seats as far as possible from the door of the carriage nurse who
was of tolerable dimensions reducing two angular old maiden ladies
to scarcely visible lines while poor kate with a feeling of deep
repugnance was squeezed between a fat elderly man and the upper end
of the conveyance the road appeared interminable and owing to their
unacquaintance with it and their inexperience of omnibus travel they
were carried far beyond their destination
never had the sight of her grandfathers face been so welcome to kate
as when she saw him looking from the window on their return after the
various small but not the less trying trials of the day and joyous
was the tone in which she exclaimedvictoria dearest grandpapa as
she threw off her bonnet and shawl
come and tell me all about it dearest said he holding out his hand
to her
she seated herself beside him and detailed her interview with herman
brightening the brighter parts and subduing the darker with exquisite
pious tact and then turning from the subject of her own plans which
always fretted the old gentleman enquired what his movements had been
and if there was a letter from the winters
no none said the colonel
well i will go and get ready for dinner and afterwards we will have
a short stroll in the gardens perhaps this evenings post may bring us
a letter from our friends nurse is a capital chaperone and i am glad
you did not go dear grandpapa it would have been quite too much for
you
after this nothing could surpass the unbroken but rather gloomy quiet
in which kates days slipped by her piano having arrived was a great
source of enjoyment to her and lent wings to many a heavy hour
winter though kind was like most men a tardy correspondent and kate
was ashamed of writing as often as her heart dictated lady desmond
too engrossed by some new pleasure or occupation wrote though
affectionately but seldom and at times the sad feeling that to the
friends who are afar we are as nothing scarcely missed and merely
remembered through the importunate efforts of our own pen would
steal over kates mind in spite of every effort of reason and common
sense for hers was a nature too noble too unexacting to doubt the
kindness or the truth of those who professed either yet it is hard
very hard not to become restless and complaining when day after
day the letter carrier hurries past or worse still his startling
though hoped for knock thrills every pulse and there is nothing for
you oh you who are still left in peace and security amongst all that
has been endeared to you in childhood and in youth amongst kindred and
familiar faces and scenes of beauty associated with happiness and
disregarded in the full certainty of possession think well before you
charge the absent with querulous avidity for letters you cannot know
you cannot dream the intense longing with which we turn from the looks
and tones the places and the people around us and conjure up old
scenes and voices long unheard and then ask again and again with a
mournful tenderness unspeakable in its depth shall i never see them
more while a gloomy echo from our own unspoken presage answers they
are gonethey are all passed by ay passed indeed for what is gone
is eternally passed by speak to them that they go forward is the
message of god to mankind as to the israelites of old forward we must
go onon in sin or in righteousness there is no pause and what is
left is left for ever
kate felt an extraordinary longing to have the old hound cormac with
her once more and wrote on the subject to mr winter as usual when
any positive question was to be answered his reply was prompt
cannot you leave the dog where he is wrote the testy little artist
i tell you he will be a troublesome customer even here he is quite
savage and we have to throw him his meat from a civil distance
poor cormac sighed kate who was reading the letter aloud to her
grandfather how unhappy he must be when he is so cross he will
become irretrievably savage if we do not remove him may i write about
him dear grandpapa at once
oh yes my dear said the colonel
besides resuming the letter your lodgings are too dear already
and cormac will be an addition to them i dare say you find your money
slipping away fast enough i hope you remember you have a balance of
thirty pounds in my hands after the sale of the furniture so do not
think about cormac at present poor gilpin is very ill and cannot last
long what is herman about i think he is a humbug and whats become
of langleys sister that was to have called on you i remember her a
good humoured woman that murdered the kings english her husband is
very well off she ought to have some girls to be taught
the letter ended with a kind message from mrs winter who seldom
wrote and left an uneasy unpleasant impression on kates mind
well i will write about cormac i so long to have him to walk with
me she said after a moments thought beginning her letter with
excuses for so imprudent a proceeding to her terrible mentor she
continued
the complete disappearance of all the agents through whom i hoped to
achieve such great things from the little stage of my life is indeed
marvellous and so dispiriting that i felt inclined to most unbecoming
impatience when i read your letter in which you as usual set forth
so forcibly important points but second thoughts are best maestro
mio let us give them the benefit of our doubts both miss herman and
mrs storey may be out of town or unwell or any thing you like and
while it is better for my heart and spirits to fancy my cidevant
musicmaster moving heaven and earth though unsuccessful in my behalf
than to imagine him playing me false by culpable negligence let me
think so i must wait so let the imagination i so often indulged in
happier days show her gratitude by lightening the interval of wretched
doubt is this right if you think so say it for i am not heaven
knows so strong that i can dispense with the wholesome encouragement
of friendly approbation and though there is great support in the
whisperings of an approving conscience yet it is wonderfully
comforting to have its accents echoed by a voice one loves by the
arrangements i have made here cormacs advent will add nothing to our
expenses and i am sure his absence will be a relief to you
miss vernon went to euston square accompanied by mrs otoole to meet
him and the joy of the old hound at sight of her was quite touching
we are afraid to go near him maam said the porter who led them to
where he was chained hes the fiercest dog we ever had charge on
but kate fearlessly went up to him and unfastened his chain while
he almost overpowered her by his uncouth caresses to the dread of
the beholders then sitting close by her his head stretched up that
he might look in her face and only noticing mrs otoole by an
occasional lick he remained as docile as a lamb
kate and nurse walked gaily home with him feeling they had gained the
addition of a friend to their society indeed cormac conducted himself
with so much discretion that the smiling because regularly paid
landlady observed he was a perfect hangel in disposition
as if pleasures and pains were equally gregarious mr langley called
just as they were going to tea he was livelier than usual and
explained his own and his sisters apparent inattention by informing
them that she had been obliged to take her little boy to the isle of
wight for change of air that he had accompanied them for the same
purpose and had there met miss herman who was on a visit to her
married sister thus were all kates doubts satisfactorily cleared up
and the very lightness of heart which these few words of explanation
produced proved to her how heavily their silence and apparent neglect
had preyed upon her spirits it was no wonder therefore that langley
felt surprised he had not before been struck by the brilliancy as well
as the sweetness of her face she played and sang for him too for the
first time and although he said little was evidently charmed by a
degree of excellence he was in no wise prepared for
he left them at an early hour after an offer of books from his
collection considerably cheered by his visit he had been much more
agreeable than usual indeed there was something in the noble manner
of colonel vernon in the grace and piquancy of his grandchild in
her perfect freedom from all idea of self and spirited intelligent
assumption of her right to think for herselfthat attracted the
taciturn though well informed langley in no common degree he had a
bad opinion of women in generallike many men he divided them into
two classes fools and knaves and could not imagine the combination of
heart and intellectyet kates original observations surprised him
by their freshness while it was impossible to look upon her sweet
but noble countenanceand doubt that if ever the spirit of truth had
stamped its impress on a human soul that soul was hers
chapter vi
resignation
nearly two months had elapsed since the vernons left a and affairs
wore much the same aspect as the first days of their arrival in town
miss herman had called on kate on her return from the isle of wight
and kate had selon les regles returned the visit and not liking
to trespass on hermans time unnecessarily had written merely to ask
some trifling question and thus remind him of his promise in reply
to which she received a vague assurance of his readiness to serve her
and a recommendation to patience
meantime parliament was within a few days of its prorogationtown
fast thinningand the season to all intents and purposes over this
was indeed a trying time and no portion of it so trying as when the
colonel sunk into his evening sleep kate then ventured to release her
thoughts from the books or work on which she always endeavoured to
fix them in his presence lest he should think her preoccupied or
depressed and sometimes gazing from the window at the slowly closing
eveningsometimes fixing her eyes on the beloved face which freed
from constraint bore a pained expressiontoo truly indicative of
internal feelingoccasionally an uneasy sigh would escape him or some
muttered word and oh the inexpressible tenderness and anguish that
would then swell his grandchilds heart
did you ever watch one you loved asleep if not you never knew of
how much love your nature was capable yet these communings with self
like jacobs wrestling with the angel left a blessing behindthough
the frequent bitter passionate questionswhy is it so why is he
who would turn aside rather than tread upon a worm whose strong
warm heart was chiefly pleased in shewing mercy and pitywhy is he
thus tried and left desolate now when the years are come in which
he has no pleasure would rise to her lips and hard hard was it
to suppress them for kate vernons heart beat with too strong too
passionate a pulse not to feel that chastening was very grievous nor
could she frame unreal words of resignationwhen the strong turmoil of
her breast lay open to the allseeingshe could but cry from out its
troubled depthsbehold o lord and see
one morning her grandfather was reading aloud to hershe sometimes
made him do soit fixed his attention morewhen the door was
opened suddenly and a lady presented herself unannounced she was
richly dressed in rather showy colors and held a large embroidered
laceedged handkerchief in her hand the colonel and kate both rose
miss vernon i presume
yes she replied advancing
the visitor presented a card and kate glancing at it exclaimed
ah mrs storeygrandpapamr langleys sister
and mutual civilities were exchanged
the new comer was slightly consequential inclined to talk of her
husbands firm as of a subject of universal and recognized interest
she was a little patronising too but evidently charmed and subdued by
the inexpressible tone of deference and esteem which characterised the
colonels manner to women and to which few ladies connected with even
the most eminent firms are accustomed
i am come on a double errand said she to kate after explaining
about her long delayed visitone to hand you this note the other
to beg you and colonel vernon will kindly consent to join a small
circle of friends at my house on thursday evening though i have made
the request rather unceremoniously
you are very kind i am sure grandpapa and myself will have great
pleasure
yes certainly chimed in the colonel though i seldom do so gay a
thing as to appear at a soiree
then i shall expect you at halfpast eight as it is to be an early
party of a few friends only and now miss vernon read that note
kate opened it and read as follows
  dear mrs storey
 i should like to see the young person of whom your brother spoke to
 me as i wish mary and angelina to begin music without any further
 delay they have quite forgotten what they learned at mrs birchs
 can miss vernon teach singing i shall be at home for her at one
 oclock on tuesday next
                                       with kind regards to mr s
                                           i am yours very sincerely
                                                           a potter
  st cecilia terrace
  brompton saturday evening
i am very glad to get a summons at last said kate smiling i was
beginning to fear pupils were an unattainable good the note is from a
friend of mrs storeys grandpapa she continued anxious to prevent
the old gentleman from reading it as she justly thought the wording
of it might ruffle his pride who requires instruction in music for
her two daughters and wishes me to call upon her on tuesday how do
you go to brompton from hence mrs storey
the most agreeable way is through kensington gardens then across the
knightsbridge road
thank you that sounds as if it would be a pleasant walk
oh very pleasant indeed will you excuse me for running away very
abruptly but i do not think i should have made time to call only
for mrs potters note another time i hope we shall be able to
improve our acquaintance miss vernon good morning pray dont come
to the door halfpast eight miss vernon a few friends my brother
brings some professors of music and she chattered out of the room
overpowering kates every effort to thank her for her kindness
nurse was in readiness to open the hall door with a look of extreme
displeasure on her countenance
i niver seen the like iv thim english she said indignantly
hesther was washin the steps whin she come upis miss vernon at
home ses she yes ses hesther ill call mrs otoole an away
she runs for me but me lady couldnt wait i suppose so in she walks
widoutby yer lave or with yer lave instead of waiting to be
announced like a christian
no matter nurse she brought me good news replied kate
well my love i congratulate you that your pious wishes are likely
to be accomplished said the colonel as she returned to the room
this mrs storey appears to be a good sort of woman
oh i am delighted with her and no wonder she has rekindled the
almost extinct flame of hope i do trust i may succeed with her friend
do come out dearest grandpapa i feel too glad to stay in the house
the next day was tuesday and kate escorted by mrs otoole and
cormac started at an early hourto keep mrs potters appointmentas
they had to explore their waythis they accomplished without much
difficulty and leaving nurse and cormac to wait her return kate
followed a rather seedy manservant in plain clothes up a dingy
staircase into a very handsomelyfurnished but uninhabitedlooking
drawingroom with richlybound books geometrically placed on round
tables vases filled with wax flowers alabaster cupids and a grand
rosewood piano she had hardly glanced at all this finery when the
door was opened hastily and a fat and rather redfaced woman her hair
done up into little round flat curls secured with pins who breathed
audibly after mounting the stairs came quickly into the room
ah i beg pardon she involuntarily exclaimed as kates slight
elegant figure met her eye i understood miss vernon was here
i am miss vernon replied kate quietly
oh or as she pronounced it ho indeed then will you just step
down to the front parlour that stupid man did not know who you were
indeed
the front parlour at no  st cecilia terrace was like all other
front parlours of its class there were horsehair chairs and sofa
dyed moreen curtains and the cast off furniture of humbler days a
former and less splendid house no books and a large workbasket
two young ladies that might be twelve and sixteen years of age rose
on their entrance but did not long suspend the labours of their busy
needles there was a third person whose semigenteel dress and
hurried anxious expression of face and surrounding circle of shreds
of every hue and texture declared her to bethe very reasonable girl
who goes out dressmaking
now miss vernon began mrs potter rapidly almost before she was
seated i want these two young ladies to be taught music i understand
you were a pupil of hermans
i was
and can you teach singing
yes
well
why said kate i cannot possibly be considered a fair judge
well i should like some reference as to your capabilities
i have none to offer if you are not satisfied with mr langleys
opinion
oh yes he is a very good judge
perhaps you will let me hear you play returned mrs potter sweeping
off a mingled pile of silk merino and fringe from a very antique piano
of course replied kate drawing off her gloves
ah she exclaimed shrinking back at the discordant tones which her
first touch drew forth this is rather out of tune and has not got
the additional keys i could not play anything on this instrument
well theres the grand upstairs said mrs potter with more
respect than her manner had yet testified at this raising of
difficulties on the part of kate come along girls
they ascended to the decorated apartment before described and there
although she found the grand rosewood as it was termed by the
family to be deplorably out of tune also kate performed a noisy
introduction and march which she guessed would be most likely to suit
her auditors a song was then demanded and given and mother and
daughters exchanged glances which said very plainlyweve drawn a
prize
well im sure thats very nice began mrs potter i have no
objection to engage you
then came the discussion of terms the greatest trial poor kate had yet
encountered it was so difficult to name her price so hard to bear
the attempt to beat her down yet all things must have an end and at
length she was finally engaged then with what a feeling of relief
she walked briskly on to meet mrs otoole who was loitering about in
waiting for her young mistress
how valuable poor mr gilpins hints have been to me thought she
what exquisite torture that whole interview would have been had i
not by his advice made up my mind to treat and think of the whole
affair as a business transaction which could not touch me really
nurse was less curious than usualthe subject was one that could
only give her pain and grief so she contented herself with kates
general assurance that all was satisfactorily settled the colonel
notwithstanding all his consideration for his loving selfforgetting
child could not suppress a groan when he heard all the particulars
she thought fit to give
ah dear kate what costs us so dear brings but little into our
exchequer
but i shall get more pupils you know and then
well gods will be done
the lessons at brompton began the next day and kate was surprised
to find how rapidly the time flew in the endeavour to convey her own
knowledge to her pupils then the walk back accompanied by cormac who
lay outside the hall door like a chiselled effigy of watchfulness all
the time the lesson lasted was charming the welcome from nurse and
grandpapa how grateful the task to work for them all i ask of thee
oh mighty parent is abundance of work she often murmured almost
aloud
thus cheered she wrote in a strain of unwonted gaiety to winter
promising him an account of mrs storeys soire at which nurse
was determined her darling should appear in most recherch costume
but to her dismay the object of all this care refused to appear in
anything but a demitoilette
an why wont ye show yer illigant white neck an arums just to let
them see what weve got in ould ireland
you see it will be a small party nurse and at all events i would
rather look too little than too much dressed besides it is of no
consequence yet that is not quite true she added with a frank
smile i should not like to look frightful
so she had her own way and wore the style of dress she preferred
nurse produced a very handsome bouquet just at the critical moment
when the toilette was un fait accompli and kate was thinking how
unfinished her costume looked without what had hitherto been with her
an invariable accompaniment
oh nurse how lovely and you have got these for me ah you spoil
your child but i am so glad to have them now i am indeed mise a
ravir and shall value them a thousand times more as your gift than
if they were from
the captin put in mrs otoole slily
yes far more said kate and she spoke the truth for the moment
some slight delay in procuring a cab rendered their appearance at mrs
storeys later than they had intended and her rooms were more than
half full when they entered there was the usual group of gentlemen
near the door conversing in under tones with each other there was
the same spare sprinkling of broad cloth amongst the silks satins
and muslins seated stiffly round the walls or rigidly enthroned on
ottomans the same half dozen of bolder spirits more at home with the
company than those about the door amongst whom the facetious man
for there is always such at third rate parties shone conspicuous
entreating the ladies to teach him the language of flowers or
propounding farfetched conundrums ending invariably with do you
give it up
tea and coffee was being handed round by two most respectablelooking
men whose faces seemed strangely familiar to kate until she
remembered that she saw them almost daily at the gate of kensington
gardens mounting guard over the bath chairs which they had there for
hire and young ladies were gently nibbling small squares of cake and
then depositing them in their saucers as if ashamed of being guilty of
so sublunary an occupation in short there was every thing that could
possibly be expected at a soire of the class we are describing
the appearance of colonel vernon with his elegantlooking
granddaughter drew general attention and a whisper of curiosity ran
round the room as each one felt instinctively there was something
in the newly arrived guests different from themselves miss vernon
advanced through the numerous company to her total strangers with
the quiet selfpossession which so peculiarly distinguished her and
which had struck egerton so forcibly at the memorable ball where they
had first met it was so different from the assured manner of a veteran
society hunter or the look at me air of a professed beauty and
seemed to say there is no position so lofty where i should be out of
place
mrs storey welcomed her new acquaintance with great warmth advancing
rapidly to meet them with a huge bouquet held fiercely in her hand
like a lancer charging the foe
very glad to see you miss vernon and your grandpa looking so
wellmr storey colonel vernon miss vernon c
mr storey was a rubicund jolly looking man not yet absolutely fat
but promising well for the time to come slightly bald with small
twinkling eyes and an inveterate affection for the letter r moreover
he constantly held his hands in his trowsers pockets laughed often a
fat laugh had an unmistakeable air of prosperity and was altogether
what mrs storey called very good company
happy to see you miss vernon happy to see you sir just a few
friends what my friend jones calls a tea fight thats his
interpretation of a soire
langley here disengaged himself rather abruptly from a group of two
or three bold confidentlooking girls and pale dishevelled men
evidently artistic to greet the vernons very warmly for him
let me get you a seat miss vernon said mrs storey drawing kate
towards the group mr langley had just left sorry i was out when you
called yesterday did you arrange with mrs potter
yes and i have to thank you and mr langley for procuring me my first
pupils
oh i was very glad
miss dent said mrs storey to one of the dashing looking young
ladies before mentioned let me introduce miss vernon you are both
very musical miss vernon plays beautifully i am told we hope to hear
her farther on in the eveningmiss charlotte dent
and kate to her dismay was left to the tender mercies of these
evidently very fashionable girls who were en grande tenue
with the lowest cut dresses and shortest sleeves permissible in
society
been long in town said the eldest after a deliberate survey of
miss vernons simple costume in a bold and rather deep toned voice
kate replied courteously and turned to see what had become of the
colonel he was engaged apparently in interesting conversation with
mr langley and satisfied that he did not feel lonely she gave her
attention to the people round her
were you ever in town before continued her examiner
oh yes for some time three years ago
horrid place at this time of year i am counting the days until i
start for germany
here one of langleys dishevelled friends from some change in the
surrounding group for the rooms were now almost crowded suddenly
stepped back and in so doing trod on miss vernons dress he begged
pardon with much empressement in a manner which bespoke him to be no
common man he was pale thin and foreignlooking with deep sunk
flashing eyes wild hair and an unsteady expression of countenance
i am always doing these sort of things and have vowed a hundred times
never to brave the dangers of a soire again but he shrugged his
shoulders
passato lpericolo gabbato lsanto said kate gaily and archly
judging from his air and manner that this scrap of poor winters lore
would be understood
la signorina parla litaliano he exclaimed joyously
so little that i dare not venture to begin a conversation in it she
replied as she did not consider it impossible to speak to a stranger
without a formal introduction
yet you pronounce it correctly said the wild looking man
you think so
yes and although it is not my native tongue i love it as if it
were
so did the friend from whom i learned what little i know of it and
the proverb i have just said yet no not quite so well as his own
tongue for he was english
your emphasis would imply that you think i am not nor am i
mr winter used to say
winter he interrupted is he the painter who has buried himself so
strangely in some monastic tomb some old city en province
the same
then you are the young lady langley spoke of
yes
maraviglia
why are you surprised asked kate smiling
he only repeated maraviglia
miss dent will you kindly play us something said mrs storey
sailing up bouquet in hand
with pleasure mrs storey but really you must send for my music for
mr jones has been making me laugh so i could not remember a note if i
was to die for it it is in the cloak room
while miss dent was making numerous preparations for the proposed
exhibition langley for the first time left vernon and came over to
kate who feeling pleased to speak to her only acquaintance at least
of any standing received him with a brilliant smile making room for
him beside her on the sofa with her usual unpremeditated grace
i see my friend galliard has made your acquaintance miss vernon
without my assistance
ah out of evil cometh good thanks to mademoiselle said the man he
called galliard gaily tore her dress she pardoned the penitent and
permitted him to speak voil tout
a warning husshsh silenced him and taking a large pinch of snuff
he assumed a critical air as miss dent struck a powerful blow on an
unfortunate chord and started off at a brisk gallop up the keys her
execution was really remarkable and the music she performed full of
physical difficulties there were interminable shakes and thundering
chords crossing of the hands and rushing from one extreme of the keys
to the other at last the performance amid a crash of chords came to
a sudden end upon which the talkers startled at hearing their own
voices all at once so loud stopped too and clapped their hands
miss dent rose with a triumphant air gathered together her gloves fan
and bouquet and stood at the end of the instrument as mrs storey
called it laughing and talking noisily with the numerous beaux who
surrounded her
now miss vernon may i call upon you said the lady of the house
approaching
kate rose with a smile and addressing langley in a low tone said
will you kindly stay with grandpapa while i play and do not let him
come near me
she took mr storeys arm as she spoke and moved to the piano
galliard and two or three more of langleys friends followed
with every appearance of interest very different from the degree
of attention they bestowed on miss dent kate felt little or no
nervousness her trial and success at hermans had set her mind at
ease and she at once began a very lovely fantasia composed by gilpin
at her request and meant to convey the feeling of sweet peacefulness
she had described to him as often stealing over her heart when after
the last notes of the evening service had scarce died away she stood
in the priory church yard where it overlooked the river and saw its
waters silvered by the moonbeams
the music was of the mendelssohn school of which the organist was a
great admirer and kate played it well she knew every note by heart
from the first solemn sustained chords to the noble march and tender
aria with which it concludes
the talkers frequently begun but were as frequently hushed by the
indignant chut chut of the connoisseurs and when she quietly
rose from the piano the emphatic good very good she can play
a remarkable composition testified the satisfaction of langleys
professional friends while they left the task of noisy plaudits to
the indiscriminating multitude
kate now in her turn the centre of a little group had to answer many
questions as to the author of the music she had played and with her
usual eagerness to exalt a friend she pronounced a glowing eulogium on
the organist as a man and a musician
he has genius undoubtedly said galliard but can genius be
satisfied with the obscurity of a little provincial town
he is happy there said kate
happy galliard repeated with a cynical accent
a man must be very happy when he allows it replied miss vernon
e vero cried galliard laughing
or so very proud that he will not admit the contrary suggested
langley
if you knew mr gilpin began kate when their hostess advancing
interrupted her and begged for a song to which request kate at once
acceded
then the hostess proposed a quadrille and introduced a young
gentleman redolent of eau de mille feurs with an elaborately
worked shirt front lined with pink and a white pastry face to kate
whispering in a jocose manner is quite a catch junior partner
in the great firm of jones brown and tuckett and with a knowing
nod she walked away leaving kate half amused at the extraordinary
confidences of her communicative hostess but feeling through all that
had she still been heiress of dungar and any strange chance had thrown
mrs storey in her way the acquaintanceship would have been conducted
on very different terms
she stood up very goodhumouredly however and replied to all her
partners vapid remarks very readily yet somehow tuckett junior
though he was the glass of fashion and the mould of form to
hammondcourt mincinglane did not feel at his ease with her and
she in the innocence of her heart believing that all firms dwelt in
the city and never dreaming that a man could be so silly as to blush
because he was a worker instead of an idler put him to torture by her
unconscious questions
i am anxious to explore the city she said while the side couples
were dancing la poule i suppose you know all its charming nooks by
heart
aw no indeed its a place i have too great a distaste for to stay
in except when obliged
for shame said kate a citizen of famous london town ought
to know and prize the various interesting locales in the mighty
capital
shall i get you an ice said her partner sullenly
no no thank you replied kate shaking her head rather mournfully
as she remembered the last time a similar question had been put to
her and taking her seat near the colonel who was standing with
langley and galliard she dismissed tuckett junior with a gracious
inclination of the head
soon after the colonel complaining of fatigue and kate glad to
escape her goodhumoured hosts frequently expressed wish that she
would polkar took her leave of the soire langley and galliard
attended them to the carriage which awaited them
mr langley tells me he saw our friend egertons name in some paper
promoted to a majority said the colonel
did he oh where cried kate
it was in the gazette i took it up while waiting for lord h 
whose portrait i am painting
what did it say asked kate folding her shawl round her
ohthe honourable frederic egerton to be major in the lancers
without purchase vice some one i forget the name deceased
i dare say it cost him some hard cash though it is there stated
without purchase i understand all that come kate good night
mr langley bon soir monsieur au plaisir de vous voir said the
colonel
the frenchman bowed profoundly and they drove away
the colonel was not animated after this piece of gaiety as he used to
be in former days it seemed to have depressed him and he complained
of slight cold mrs otoole was woefully disappointed to find that
there was neer a lord nor even an honourable good or bad at the
party
to think iv yer playin an singin for the likes iv thim she
exclaimed indignantly
what have i said to make you think so contemptuously of the very
respectable people amongst whom we have spent i confess a rather
slow evening as my eloquent partner would term it
och no matther sure its thim thats the only quolity goin now
well niver mind miss kate well lave thim all yet
i hope so sighed kate
chapter vii
letters
the next morning just as kate was preparing to write a long letter to
the winters one from the kindhearted little artist was put into her
hand it was sealed with black wax and announced the death of poor
gilpin he had suffered a good deal but towards the last fell into a
calm sweet sleep out of which he suddenly awoke with a look of bright
happiness such as they had never seen on his face before as if had
heard a summons inaudible to their ears
i come he said and feebly laying his hand on winters passed to
where his treasure was without a sigh
there was little in the letter besides the account of the good mans
death he had left a memorandum of the persons amongst whom his books
and music were to be distributed he had desired kindly messages
to one or two friends and the last name he uttered was that of kate
vernon
she read the letter aloud calmly but the intonation of her voice
indicated deep emotion at its conclusion there was a pause which
neither the colonel nor his granddaughter were inclined to break both
were hushed and awed by this description of their friends passage to
the world of spirits
the large round pearly tears weighed down kates long lashes and
slowly rolled over her cheeks without any effort on her part to
restrain them she was unconscious that she wept
at last the old man broke the silence saying
let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like
his
amen replied his granddaughter oh dearest grandpapa she
continued at length he has entered into his rest and though it is
an awful thought to us that he still exists but where no mortal eye
can see him what an exchange from the many woes and struggles of his
warfare here to the boundless bliss of heaven he had many sorrows
and yet surely the coming shadow of a great deliverance rested on
his spirit long before he was freed how sensitive he wasabout
his appearance i meanhow keenly alive to every glance and yet how
resolutely he used to brace up his soul to love and to endure
i suppose we shall soon hear from winter again said the colonel
after another pause
i suppose so returned kate dreamily ah nurse she exclaimed
a few moments after as mrs otoole entered about some household
matter he is gonehe is happyour kind gentle friend mr gilpin
the heavens be his bed said mrs otoole crossing herself och
whin was he taken miss kate
two days ago
athin twas he was fit to go faith he was worth a score iv clargy to
the poor an at the first goin to a i used to think it beneath
ye to be talkin an walkin wid a poor crathure iv an organist but
i was proud to spake to him aftherwards meself for he always looked
as if hed a taste iv heaven inside iv him so he did sure its no
wondher this is such a miserable place to be in wid sich min as
misther gilpin an the masther whipt off likelike a pooff or robbed
iv their own an sich chaps as taaffe an moore or thim in their
coaches an desavin the world faith its beyant me entirely so it
is
and beyond many a wiser head than either yours or mine nelly said
the colonel kindly we must leave all that to god
thrue for ye sir and she retired murmuringoch blessed jasus
resave yer soul mee poor gilpin its a saint on airth ye wur
so kates letter was written in a very different strain from what she
had intended and then she strolled with her grandfather in kensington
gardens the old man seemed feeble and depressed he took kates arm
as he often did of late and spoke much of his own advancing years
and his anxiety in the event of his death for her in a tone that
thrilled her heart with fear and anguish she strove to turn the
conversationbut it would not do
i have no doubt that you alone would find a happy home under
georginas roof but i wish i might see you happily married and in
a house of your own before i am called away i fear from moores
intelligence brief and scanty as it is there is no chance of our
gaining this fatal lawsuit so that you will be totally unprovided
for and he sighed deeply our relations are so few and
oh hush hush dearest and best cried kate you cannot dream what
pain you inflict on me by such words do not fear for me i never
know dread on my own account for the future you do not know the
strong courage of my hearti did not know it myself till of late we
cannot provide against future ills why then darken the present by
anticipating them let us leave it all to god as you told nurse this
morning believe me i fear nothing except hearing you speak in this
manner
the old man was silent for a while and then resumed
we little thought the day fred egerton rushed back so gallantly to
rescue our poor friend how soon that pleasant little party would be
scattered
little indeed echoed kate next week it will be a year since the
ball at carrington where i first met him
the colonel smiled and sighed
he will be sorry to hear of poor gilpins death i wonder he has not
written
good morning miss vernon said langley coming up behind them i
hope you caught no cold last night how do you do colonel vernon
the colonel informed him of gilpins death and he seemed rather
interested as the compositions of the organist which kate had played
the night before had pleased him greatly then they talked of great
musicians and mozarts requiem and the strange circumstances under
which it is said to have been composed
how much i love those wild mysterious german stories they have an
indescribable charm for me said kate
why asked langley in his blunt manner
that is exactly what i cannot answer
i never like what i do not understand
how is it you are a painter then asked kate in her turn
i do not see what that has to do with the subject on which we were
speaking he returned startled at this attack
how is it that you can give expression to a face with your pencil
which you could not convey in words even a landscape may speak the
painters soul far more than the most eloquent description so it is
that glimpses of what is far beyond our nature to comprehend faint
though they be give us an idea of space and might far more than any
even perfectly comprehended explanation as mistwreaths hide but
magnify the depths seen from a mountain
a very poetical definition miss vernon
i speak but my thoughts said kate steadily though she blushed and
felt uneasy as enthusiasts always do when the quick current of their
imagination is checked by some son of earth who dignifies his dulness
by the name of strong common sense
well miss vernon i must think of what you say about painting
ah you must have enthusiasm and imagination to be a painter though
you are too english not to be ashamed of your better self
that is what galliard says
who is this monsieur galliard asked the colonel
oh a very curious medleyhis father was french his mother
englishand his life has been divided between france italy and
englandhe is half a musician half a painter but wholly a writer for
newspapers and reviews foreign and domestic he is well thought of
however notwithstanding some vulnerable pointsknows lots of people
and is a very likely person to push you on well miss vernon
the colonel winced at this conclusion
you are very kind said kate i quite begin to think you a real
friend now i am more accustomed to you
langley stared astonished old enough to be miss vernons father it
was extraordinary the influence this fair bright noble creature
whose every word and thought were so at variance with the maxims of his
workaday world was gaining over him
meanwhile they had reached the vernons lodgings before he had
recovered the fit of musing into which kates words had thrown him
i am glad you think me your friend he said at length interrupting
an exposition of the state of the ancienne regime as it existed
when he was in france into which the colonel had diverged apropos to
galliard
i am quite sure you are no humbug as my partner of last night
would say returned kate laughing
and they parted
lady desmonds letters were rather more frequent at this time and
though they evinced as usual warm affection and sincere interest in
the fortunes of her relatives there was a restlessness and despondency
in their tone which spoke of a spirit ill at ease she frequently said
she would return to them as they would not come to her but months
flew by and still she was among the distinguished english at present
in florence and kate who in spite of herself yearned for her
return as for the first beam of the rising sun as something that
would create a change for the better in the face of affairs and also
longed to see the fair face of a much loved relative felt that the
only reason why she did not quite despair of seeing lady desmonds
promises fulfilled was because she dared not deprive herself of that
hope the colonel too clung to it with an eagerness almost painful
at times and it was evident this feverish anxiety was connected with
some intention of putting kate under her guardianship
and so their life rolled onthe only break in its monotony was a
slight difference between mrs crooks the landlady and mrs otoole
which arose from their mutual affection for the parrot nurse asserted
it was a mighty knowledgeable craythur iv a bird and poll verified
the statement of her admirer by repeating various phrases she learnt
from mrs otoole in a rich county clare brogue the poverty of the
kitchen fire was a constant source of vexation to mrs otoole
hesther och girl alivewill ye rouse up that fire a bit was her
constant cry and poll never beheld the much enduring handmaid of mrs
crooks without screaming hesther hesther rouse up the fire a bit
hesther ye divil ah speak pretty poll mr crooks would then
exclaim dont say such ugly wordssay dear mistress ye divil
poll would reply
faith it would make ye break yer heart laughing sir said nurse
who was detailing the events of their warfare to the colonel and
kate one evening spake pretty ses she an dont be hollowin
out thim vulgar hirish words ses she och god help ye woman ses
i its little ye know the differ between whats vulgar an whats
genteel in this counthry ses i yed lave a poor queen to go sarve

blackest dirt iv london for a halfpenny though yer pocket was full iv
goold guineas all the timethats yer gintility in england sis i
an as for style an rale quolity faith its so little
dear nurse interrupted kate gravely i wish you had not made such
a long and irritating speech to mrs crooks you must let me settle
your differences and in future turn a deaf ear to any casual remarks
that may hurt your national vanitythey are not worth noticing
och my gracious miss kate is an impident thief iv a lodginghouse
keeper to be let to have her talk about her betthers anbe the
powers theres the post cried nurse interrupting herself an i
dhreamt i had a letther from she ran out hastily and returned
almost immediately with a disappointed look its for the masther

indian postmark fell from it from egerton i do believe cried the
colonel but nowithin that again was another enclosure the address
written in an intoxicated looking hand and much blotted for mrs
otoole at the kurnels in england
its for you nurse said kate with a heavy sensation of deep
disappointment weighing down her heart
ill engage its from dinny athin read it for me jewil
so kate disengaging its folds from the stiff adhesion of a large
red wafer and taking the liberty of correcting some very prominent
errors of orthography and transferring small into capital is read as
follows

                                                       dinnis otoole

well its a very pleasing satisfactory letter nelly said the
colonel and i am heartily glad to hear so good an account from your
son eh kate is there a postscript
no but i was reading over the concluding partit is rather
confusedcorporal morrisson appears to write for dennis in the third
person and then dennis himself comes in again in the first person
but dear nurse i congratulate you with all my heart i think my
fosterbrother will now get on remarkably well
sorra fear iv him now sure there was always luck in the captins
face an hell be back yet wid a pocket full iv goold and set us all
right i pray god amin now ill just get the specks an read it all
over meself sure i can make it out beautiful afther miss kate readin
it
and so after a few more ejaculations nurse retired
it is very curious began the colonel
that captain egerton did not write himself interrupted kate quickly
yes i cannot understand it that letter indicates the kindliest
feelings towards us and yet i wonder he would not wish for some more
direct communication with us than through dennis otoole
do letters ever go astray
oh scarcely this one you see has arrived safe but what surprises me
is that he enclosed it without a line
indolence about writing i suppose said kate with a sigh
but now i have the address i shall certainly write
will you dear grandpapa
well perhaps it would be better decidedlylet me see what days the
indian mail leaves we can find it out at the postoffice you must
remind me my love
yes grandpapa
then she went to the piano and played dreamily for a long time seeing
neither notes or music but a tableaudennis otoole and captain
egerton while the words of the latter i will not have kate vernons
foster brother a drunkard seemed to meet her eye wherever she
turned it and brought the speaker too vividly before her one of
egertons most distinguishing characteristics was a chivalrous delicacy
of feeling towards women generally kate had often observed it with
silent but profound approbation and she could well imagine the tender
consideration with which he would treat even a dog that had belonged to
one he loved and something whispered to her that she was this oneit
was but very rarely that such a thought flashed across her mind yet
although she felt that the course of probabilities held out little
or no chance of their again meeting till the lapse of many years had
fixed their destinies wide apart still the conviction that she was
loved and not forgotten thrilled through her heart with an ecstasy so
exquisite so strange that she shrunk from it startled at the depths
of her own nature thus revealed even while she thanked god that he
had never become necessary to her happiness
no there is much of joy in life for me and much of peace though
in all human probability we shall never meet again no i do not love
him but i could ah heavens yes how much
and she lay down to sleep perfectly resigned that their lots in life
should be cast widely separate yet the vision conjured up by dennys
letter of egertons evidently unaltered interest in all that concerned
her contributed largely to the dilation of heart with which she poured
forth her prayers and thanksgivings to her father which is in heaven
chapter viii
an adventure and a surprise
autumn was now rapidly merging into winter the unbroken routine of
kates life only lent swifter wings to time for events like marked
distances serve often but to show our tardy progress sometimes
langley would look in for half an hours chat and galliard still more
rarely but though formerly so fond of society their visits seemed
now more than the colonel wished for or was equal to and although
she never permitted the dreadful thought to dwell on her mind yet the
consciousness that he was unusually silent and averse to move that
his cheek had lost its firm round ruddy look and that he often sent
his dinner away untouched would seize her with a sense of anguish
nurse with loves quick perception always stoutly denied that any
thing ailed him
it ill do nayther iv thim any good to be thinkin that a way she
would say to herself miss kate the crayther has enough to put up
with an as to me poor darlin masther it ud take a better cordial
than iver kem out iv a poticarys shop to do him any good
these apprehensions about her grandfather were weighing heavily on
kates heart one humid gloomy afternoon she was returning home after
giving some music lessons escorted as usual by her faithful cormac
as she hurriedly crossed the road for it was late at kensington
gore to enter the gardens by the gate near the ancient and diminutive
barrack usually occupied by a small party of light dragoons two
gentlemen stopped opposite to it one a large heavy man mounted on
a splendid dark chesnut horse whose broad chest and clean strong
muscular limbs showed him to be a weight carrier the riders back
was to the gardens and his eyes fell on kate and her companion as
she came up the other about middle height slight distinguished
looking but simply dressed stood on the footway leaning his right
arm on the neck of his friends horse and occasionally waving his
left hand as if to enforce his words the peculiar turn of this last
described individuals head and the careless arrangement of his wavy
hair reminded kate of egerton or rather stamped him as belonging to
egertons class for one of the indications of gentlemanlike appearance
is the turn of the head and the manner of wearing the hat
by george what a splendid dog exclaimed the equestrian
interrupting his companion who turning slowly round caught a glimpse
of kate as she passed her color heightened by her rapid walk and
cormac as usual keeping close to her side a new keeper was standing
at the gate as she was about to enter and said civilly though
authoritatively
no dogs admitted maam
but he always accompanies me said kate and never frightens any
one not even the birds the last keeper never objected to his coming
through
but my orders are strict and he is such a large dog
well i really cannot go back again continued miss vernon smiling
and shaking her head i saw a lady go in just before me with a dog
yes but she had a string to him
oh i can soon manage that cried kate fastening one end of her
handkerchief to cormacs collar now may i go through
the man smiled and made way for her
while stooping to fasten the handkerchief the gentleman we have
above described as leaning across the neck of his friends horse
walked past glancing at kate quickly and keenly she did not observe
him but turning up the broad walk proceeded towards home lost in a
wandering maze of sweet and bitter thought as she approached the water
near the palace she paused a moment to notice a peripatetic duck of
large dimensions and brilliant plumage for whom she generally carried
a bit of bread or biscuit and who made long marches in quest of
dainties that might possibly be missed by adhering closely to his more
natural element cormac sat down gravely while his mistress addressed
a few words of apology to her feathered pensioner
no bread or biscuit today poor duck but i will not forget you
tomorrow
and she stood looking at the creature as it waddled awkwardly round
and round her quite regardless of the dog at that moment the
gentleman before mentioned came up beside her and slightly raising
his hat said politely and easily
how is it that you are alone
kate turned quickly and met a piercing gaze from a pair of deep
set but stern looking black eyes she was naturally courageous and
the idea of any one intentionally insulting her never occurred to
her mind the strangers tone too was perfectly wellbred and his
words such as might be addressed to some familiar acquaintance so
without hesitation or the slightest apprehension or embarrassment and
meeting his bold glance steadily she replied calmly with a slight
inclination of the head
you mistake me i do not know you and moved on towards home to her
surprise however the stranger kept by her side and after a moments
silence apparently somewhat surprised at her composure he resumed
softening still more a very musical and refined voice
you are both right and wrong i do not mistake you for any other
person but i am unfortunately unacquainted with you and unless i take
a bold step such as i have now done may remain so therefore pray
forgive me
kate walked on in silence her heart throbbing with indignation to be
addressed by a stranger and one too apparently of her own rank in
life one whom under different circumstances would perhaps have
been presented by some smiling or dignified hostess these thoughts
flashed liked lightning through her brain and left no room for fear
as she kept a resolute silence after another short pause the stranger
again turning his cold sallow but intellectual countenance towards
hers resumed
it is absurd your persevering in this unbroken silence i generally
carry out my resolves and to exchange a few sentences with a person
not formally introduced to you cannot possibly be an injury speak i
entreat you give me but the slightest clue to your name and position
and i will speedily contrive the necessary introductionwill not that
satisfy you he added in a slightly sarcastic tone and suddenly
placing himself in her way she stopped and keeping still silent for
a moment more to collect her thoughts and get the fiery indignation
that swelled her heart under controul
sir said she deliberately and with a determination of tone and
manner that surprised him unless your appearance sadly belies you
you should be too much a gentleman not to feel by instinct that i
am a lady your excuses for your presumptuous insolence only adds
to it but she continued with a curl of the lip and a flash
of indignant contempt from her dark grey eyes that deepened them
to blue i laugh at your attempt to stop me here cormac to
the hound who had already uttered one or two ominous growls she
untied the handkerchief watch him good dog and if he stirs she
stopped and looking once more full in the strangers face turned
suddenly so as to place the hound between them and walked lightly
away yet not too fast the stranger thus left planted bit his lip
then laughing slightly attempted to pass the dog who in heraldic
attitude couchant kept his fierce eyes fixed on his charge at whose
slightest movement he displayed his sharp white fangs
pshaw what a mistake to address such a girl sans ceremonie what
an awkward predicament it would be absurd to enter into a contest with
such a brute unarmed for nothing muttered kates admirer who did
not look like a man deficient in courage here good dog i say and
he again attempted to pass but cormac sprang to his feet with a savage
growl and again the haughty looking elegant was baffled
meantime kates slight figure disappeared in the distance and a
moment after cormac pricking his ears at some sound unheard by his
opponent with a final growl darted at full speed down the walk by
which his mistress had vanished she was waiting a few paces beyond
the gate where she had to the best of her ability uttered the
whistle which had recalled her faithful guardian and now hurrying her
pace almost to a run they speedily reached home but not before the
persevering stranger had caught sight of the flutter of her dress as
she turned the corner of victoria gardens
how late you are my child you seem flushed and breathless
yes dear grandpapa i was detained at mrs potters and of course
that made me late with my other pupils then i walked so fast but i
will run up stairs and take off my bonnet
oh nurse she exclaimed throwing herself into mrs otooles arms
i have had such a frightno not a fright but i am so indignant to
think that he should dare to
och what is it good or bad take breath asthore
and kate with many charges not to tell her grandfather recounted her
adventure to nurse
och bad manners to him exclaimed that sympathising confidante
the rale divil he was to go spake that away to a lady like you bad
luck to his impidence did he think yed thank him for wantin to know
ye i wish i come across him faith id make his hair stand on ind
the schamin vagabone but why are ye cryin avick about a thief
iv a pickpocket ill go bail its yer purse he wanted sure a rale
gintleman ud know betther
i cant help it nurse they are the bitterest tears i ever shed not
on account of that wretched man but to think that such a thing ever
occurred and may occur again
sorra bit iv it ill go wid ye me own self ivery day to potters an
the other place an let me see if me gintleman dare say pays to ye
whist och jewel theres the masther callindhry yer eyes
for several days the faithful nelly escorted her young mistress in her
walks but the adventurous stranger never appeared and by degrees
kate began to look upon her fright and indignation as an unpleasant but
unreal phantom
one evening kate had yielded to the entreaties of mrs storey and her
juvenile olive branches to join a birthday merrymaking in honor
of the son and heir having attained his eighth year and for once she
left her grandfather to read alone nurse of course guarded her
during her short transit between their abode and that of her hosts
and having carefully removed her nurslings shawl and bonnet plodded
slowly homeward to make the masthers tay for the birthday fte
began at halfpast six thinking sadly enough of the past and of her
dear masters sinking strength and spirits she turned into the little
street or terrace in which they lived
pray said a very languid gentlemanlike voice close beside her
pray do you not live at no  down here
may be i do may be i dont replied mrs otoole eyeing the speaker
sharply and with what she considered consummate caution
well returned her interrogator whom it is needless to say was the
same individual whose insolence had so annoyed kate and whose really
elegant appearance would have enlisted her in his favour but for her
prepossessions against him i presume you know your own residence
at all events i shall feel obliged to you if you will let me know the
name of the young lady whom you sometimes escort through kensington
gardens of course as the utterance of it will cause considerable wear
and tear of your lungs accept this remuneration
what is it ye want with her name asked mrs otoole
that cannot possibly concern you tell it to me and take this
keep yer money replied mrs otoole with supreme disdain divil
another word good nor bad will ye get from me till ye tell me what
ye want her name for
ah said the gentleman musingly you seem so respectable a person
i have no objection to tell you that having unfortunately offended
the lady by speaking to her in the gardens i am anxious this apology
should reach her hand and he showed a note he held will you be the
bearer of it he continued insinuatingly
ill tell ye what it is returned nurse firing up in spite of her
determination to be cool and cautious ill bear nayther yer notes nor
yer impidince id like to see the man woman or child that daur be
carryin notes for ye to miss no matther she continued hastily
checking herself its not the likes iv ye an oudacious chap that
daured to spake to yer betthers widout by yer lave or wid yer lave
shed so much as look at faith if i see a sign iv ye about the place
to frighten me darlint ill just give ye up to the polis ill go bail
its the spoons yer more used to be lookin afther than the ladies
though ye have a good coat on yer back an look as if it wasnt a
stranger to ye
my good woman said the object of this tirade with a halfsurprised
halfamused air as mrs otoole paused for breath you are the most
impracticable person i ever met i do not understand you
well then ill spake plain enough for ye if ye were a gintleman
yed niver have gone to spake to me darlin young lady in the way ye
did the other dayyed have known yer own sort an the differ betune
a bit iv a dressmaker and a raale lady an ye may look as fine an
as proud as ye like but ill see ye yet gettin up stairs to the
tune of turn the millso goodby te ye an ye may put yer note in
the fire but if i see ye about here be this book kissing her hand
ill give ye up to the polis for a suspicious characther that
has his eye on the plate and off walked mrs otoole glowing with
triumph and honest indignation
the stranger muttered something very like a curse then laughing
slightly he said half aloud as if in the habit of speaking his
thoughts
the most extraordinary specimen of indignant virtue i ever
encounteredwhy she is as incorruptible as the hound and just as
fierce so adieu ma belle tearing the note a houri would not be
worth the trouble such guardianship entails besides the ridicule of
appearing to the charges her eloquent duenna threatens he thought
a moment turned and walked slowly back to the main road where a
plainly appointed cab with a horse of great beauty and value and an
irreproachable tiger awaited him
kate thought nurses movements unusually rapid as they returned from
mrs storeys but that considerate personage said not a syllable of
her interview with the unknown until that most confidential moment
when the stiffness of drawingroom manner and costume is exchanged for
a robe de chambre and kates long rich brown tresses were submitted
to mrs otoole and the brush
sure that dark browed divil was spyin about whin i kem back fum
storeys
what that dreadful man who spoke
yes agra an miss kate fur all i tould him i thought him a
pickpocketfaith i believe hes a gran gintleman i know be the
look iv him see now if he isnt a lord i never seen one an they
were as thick as parsley at dungar i was frightened to have the likes
iv him ramblin about here so i jist spoke up bould an pretended to
think he was a pickpocket or the like an threatened him wid the
polis an i think i settled him any how
i have no doubt you acted quite right dearest nurse and i should
like to have heard you giving him his tag as you would term it but
surely he will never take the trouble to come here again i thought
it was only a passing impertinenceperhaps he was really sorry and
wished to apologiselet us give him the benefit of a doubt and so
they dismissed the subject which slumbered for many months beforebut
we must not anticipate
not many days after this break in the routine of their lives as kate
and the colonel were one evening talking by the firelight of a
and the wintersthe sound of approaching wheels broke the stillness
which generally settled over victoriagardens at the close of day the
sound drew nearer and suddenly ceased at their house
some mistake said miss vernon as both she and her grandfather
paused in their conversation to listen to that vague watchfulness so
often felt by those whose hearts are full of the future because the
present is sad then the gardengate creaked on its hinges and heavy
steps approached rapidly the bell was rung loudly and though she
could not tell why kates heart beat more quickly as she listened
for the next sounds for each movement is clearly audible through the
slight walls of a modern built house in the outlets of london the
door was opened and a husky whispering ensued to which the servants
voice repliedyes mr vernons at home and in another moment mrs
otooles hearty tones were heard in joyous welcome
athen is it yerself thats in it masha but its the masther an
miss kate will be proud to see ye walk in maamill settle the
cabman then the parlourdoor was thrown wide open and in walked
mrs winter in a large plaid cloakfollowed by a mass of coats and
comforters over which twinkled joyously the artists little beadlike
eyes
then came the joyous confusion of question and answer and wonder and
welcome and kate felt a sudden accession of life and strength
but to what do we owe this happy surprise she reiterated as she
knelt at mrs winters feet to change her boots for a pair of warm
slippers
indeed my dear it is one of winters fits he would not let me
write nor write himselfhe said we might disappoint you and
ourselves
yes broke in winter disencumbering himself of his numerous
wrappings i knew youyou would have been killing the fatted calf
and roasting turkeys and all sorts of things and we should have been
late and teased you with expectation so i said leave your pen
alone sue and here we are stopped at the first house with furnished
apartments on it engaged themthen all right ready for a dish
of tea and chat and then turn inclose herealbertplace why
colonel you do not look as if london agreed with you but you bella
mi you look quite yourself
but what has induced you to visit the great babylon said the
colonel when the first hubbub of welcome was over and they were
assembled round the teatable
we are going on the continent said mrs winter with some importance
is it possible cried kate
you do not speak seriously said the colonel
why not ive got a cold and ive no idea of remaining to be cut off
like poor gilpin by the east winds returned winter
is that your only reason asked kate
why not exactly but a has become such a desert now that you and
gilpin are gone life is not worth having there
i do not like the idea of having the sea between us said the colonel
nor i added his granddaughter
nor i but we will not be long away and i intend to paint while
abroad such a picture as will make the royal academicians die of
envy said winter
and added mrs winter we have let our house very advantageously to
a cousin of canon joness who commands the new regiment
but you will not run away too soon asked kate
no we shall remain three or four weeks in london
i am rejoiced to hear it said the colonel
oh delightful cried kate
we will talk over our plans tomorrow said winter tonight let us
hear of your own proceedings how do you like my friend langley
oh i like him very much returned kate i am sure there is much
good in him though he wont show it and seems so cold and cautious
even with himself that i dare not take it upon myself to say he will
be glad to see even you
well i can tell you he writes enthusiastically of you replied
winter
non e possibile
and so the conversation flowed on in a thousand interrogative channels
all indicative of the same warm and friendly interest which still
unabated linked the quartette oh how much more closely than the
ties of blood
winter in obedience to a warning glance from kate reserved his
questionings as to her success in teaching for a ttette
and his good little wife followed his example on this as on all
other subjects the poor organists deathbed was redescribed and
the grand following as mrs otoole would term it that graced
his funeral discussed and in spite of the to them unaccustomed
fatigue of a journey the interchange of intelligence was prolonged to
a late hour for travellers and when they parted for the night kate
felt her own hopeful joyous self again to think that such true and
tried friends were near that she should meet them in the morning and
once more be able to pour out the fears and anxieties which no want
of confidence in her grandfather but a tenderness of affection too
considerate to grieve him kept pent up within her own bosom till
their weight oppressed her once more she would take counsel of that
clear strong warmheart which no selfinterest no conventional
falsity clouded or obscured and though their stay is but short was
her concluding thought as sleep closed her snowy lids with its downy
weight thank god they are come i will enjoy their presence and
not think of the sorrow of parting until it comes
but a young spirit must be somewhat initiated in grief before it can
attain this philosophy if it ever can be attained for however the
heart may purpose to enjoy the present and disregard the future
there is still something of omnipresence in its nature that gives an
actuality to anticipated joy or sorrow it cannot wile away
the period of the winters stay in london was one of great enjoyment
to kate for though what is termed the dead season there were quite
enough of pictures to be seen and concerts to be heard to employ the
mornings and sometimes the evenings most agreeably and until their
arrival kate had seen nothing of the great metropolis
it seemed as if the advent of the warmhearted practical little artist
had broken the sad depressing spell which had been gathering closer
and closer round her spirit since she had left a winter was a
stout and active pedestrian and leaning on his arm kate bade defiance
to the most persevering and mysterious stranger that ever crossed
heroines path the colonel too was wonderfully revived by the presence
of his kind and valued friends and strange to say even cormac who
when left at a was too savage to be approached by his temporary
keeper was most sociable and condescending with him in london
one morning mr langley called and after sitting in a sort of
preoccupied silence for some time with some hesitation and much
awkwardness suggested that he wished to invite his friend winter and
his wife to dinner and as the colonel and miss vernon were so fond of
their society perhaps they would consent to encounter the discomfort
of a bachelors mnage and meet them
the colonel and kate assented most graciously and the party
reinforced by galliard and mr and mrs story met the next day at
what winter termed grub hour
contrary to her expectations kate spent a most agreeable day langley
like many shy persons shone in his own house winter was most
amusingly argumentative galliard witty and the colonel cheerful
and urbane as usual while mrs storeys repeated apologies for the
irregularities of a bachelors mnage and mr winters reiterated
assurances that every thing was in admirable order kept up an under
current of polite commonplace that amused kate exceedingly by its
contrast to the prevailing tone of the conversation
you have visited the british museum enquired galliard
only once said kate and that hurriedly i long to go again
there is a great lot of trash there observed winter
what treason returned galliard it has all cost money and john
bull is content
of course said langley you will have your sneer at john bull
why not i am you know half english
come mr langley said kate the english you will admit are not
very sparing of their neighbours
they do not make much allowance for any peculiarities except their
own certainly remarked colonel vernon
you are in such a decided minority you celts you had better hold
your tongues cried winter
but what is it you call trash at the british museum asked kate
oh the mummies and the wigs and all that such an embarras of
mummies can hardly be conceived said winter
i wish we could bring the gheber mode of disposing of the dead into
fashion again i shall certainly leave a clause in my will that my body
shall be burned observed galliard
law mr galliard what an idea said mrs storey
why not my dear madam
i always liked zoroaster and the fire worshippers said kate their
system appears to me the least degrading of all ancient religions
humph miss vernon used to insist that the round towers of ireland
were built by the western ghebers remarked winter
it is quite possible responded galliard
any thing so far beyond our historical period may be possible
observed langley
ah said galliard you consider them anterior to the celtic
invasions miss vernon
the author whose writings on the subject i have read thought so
replied kate
galliards strong point is celtic antiquity said their host
it is a subject full of profound and melancholy interest he replied
why melancholy asked winter
because rejoined galliard of the contrast between their past and
present
the strongest proof they were an inferior race said langley
otherwise they would not have given way so rapidly before the saxons
a thoroughly english observation cried galliard you are poor and
powerless therefore you deserve to be so
thats not a fair commentary said langley
there are two causes which to a reflective mind sufficiently
explain the deterioration of the celtic race morally and physically
observed galliard thoughtfully
and they are asked kate
their quick fancy and unselfish nature
how do you make that out said winter
first the saxon sees distinctly but one end or object to the
attainment of which his every faculty is devoted the celts livelier
imagination presents him with half a dozen at all of which he grasps
with equal eagerness and thus his powers are divided and dispersed
secondly a saxons first thought is of himself and in this he is
consistent while owing to the peculiarity of fallen humanity the
celts selfforgetfulness is inconsistent thus place a saxon where
you will he possesses in himself a nucleus round which all his
energies hopes and projects centre and having a centre stands
while the celt works one day for himself the next for a friend the
next to spite an enemy the next to do him a service and so he is
finally nowhere your saxon will have no objection to do all this in
a lump if it does not interfere with his own interests and galliard
leaned back and took snuff
so said colonel vernon our greatest errors spring from our noblest
qualities
the noblest qualities of mankind it is mans fate returned
galliard
you argue ingeniously but said langley
but truly interrupted galliard what was it chained the french
nation to napoleon imagination what enabled bruce to conquer edward
at bannockburn imagination what rivets the heart of the irish peasant
to the flattering demagogue or arms his hand against his landlord
imagination
and the want of a cogitative nose put in winter
theres an upset for you mounseer said mr storey
really said mrs storey i think mrs winter we had better leave
the gentlemen to fight it out
they all rose
and continued galliard as he opened the door though the want of
imagination may render the saxon successful its presence always makes
the celt beloved
you are right said miss vernon as she passed him with a bow
but pleasant intervals soon come to an end and the last week of mr
and mrs winters intended stay approached before it arrived however
miss herman paid kate a visit and introduced her to some additional
pupils with whom however she agreed not to begin her lessons until
after her friends departure
i cannot bear to think of losing you said kate one cold sharp
evening winter had walked to meet her on her way back from brompton
do pray put off your departure till after christmas i have so dreaded
christmas alone in london and you have nothing to hurry you away
hum let me see i have already delayed a fortnight longer than i
intended another week will not make much difference ha you little
witch i cannot say you nay but after that not an hour
ten thousand thousand thanks dear kind friend you have made me so
happy
now we are ttette tell me how affairs go on any news of the
lawsuit
why yes grandpapa gets frequent letters from mr moore who it
seems is always filing bills and making motions very slow ones i
fear for they never seem to produce any result
winter groaned
and yourselves how ishow isyou know i am a bearhow is the
purse
marvellously considering how fast your hundred went but nurse has
got quite into the london ways and quite saves us a fortune now and
my pupils and the new ones oh we shall do very wellifif dear
grandpapa only could look like his own old self
well i have thirty pounds of his i must not run away with have you
lady desmonds cheque
yes quite safe
well be sure you keep it sickness may come a thousand things how
is your lady cousin
quite well always in her letters talking of coming home and never
coming
just as i expected
and you are bent on wintering at pau
yes and in the spring we intend crossing the pyrenees i long to see
more of spain but kate if you want me really if in short illness
shouldthat is should the time ever come you might want a home sue
and myself look upon you as a daughter write to me at once wherever
i may be
good god mr winter do you think grandpapa so ill do you
anticipate
dear child no a thousand times no but at parting i should like you
to feel that it is only distance that can separate us and that at
any and every time i shall feel as a father towards you and a proud
father
my dear dear friend surely god has been very gracious to me i will
not try to thank you in words they sound so cold
they walked on in silence which winter broke by exclaiming abruptly
that letter of nurses son was most characteristic there is some good
stuff in the writer
then after another pause as if he had expected some remark from kate
it is odd egerton should send it without a line i cannot make it
out only that letters seldom miscarry i should say he had written a
despatch himself independent of the other but pooh that is highly
improbable has mrs otoole replied to her sons epistle
yes that is i acted as her secretary last week when do you think
the letter will reach dennis
oh heaven knows they are up the country and i fancy not very
settled perhaps in two or three months
kate sighed
hey miss vernon what was that sigh for
oh i was thinking of last christmas we were a very pleasant party
though poor captain i mean major egerton was so terribly in the
blues about leaving england and now how different everything is how
silently and gradually a great gulf has been opened between the past
and the present
well well it is melancholy enough not to be either a pleasant or a
profitable subject of cogitation forward forward as your favourite
longfellow says
    let the dead past bury its dead
    act act in the living present
    heart within and god oer head
a word in season how good it is returned miss vernon smiling
pensively
well here we are i wonder what mrs winter will say to your powers
of persuasion
she will be delightedshe dreads the journey
pooh not she as long as i am with her she thinks all must go well
a pattern wife sighed kate
yes no wife can be happy if she does not feel this ah kate kate i
wish you had a good husband
like yourself eh mr winter but alas
now no quizzing if you please im glad we are at the end of our
trajet if you are going to laugh at me
the gradually silent change in the colonels health and spirits
which had escaped the everyday watchfulness of even kates tender
guardianship struck winter whose perception was quickened by the to
him unshaded transition from light to gloom caused by the cessation
of their daily intercourse with grief and dismay nor did he rest
until he had persuaded his venerated friend to accompany him to an
eminent physician though the colonel protested he had not a single
symptom of which he could reasonably complain the doctor felt his
pulse looked at his tongue and tried his lungs asked a good many
questions seemingly irrelevant as to his spirits c wrote a short
prescription recommended horse exercise took his fee and bowed them
out winter looked dissatisfied and as he handed the colonel into the
cab which was waiting for them suddenly recollected he had forgotten
his snuffbox he returned to the room but in vain for the bland
physician merely repeatednothing physical i assure you sirmental
depressionimaginative disorder
have you found your box asked the colonel with a significant smile
at least to winters conscience it appeared so the worthy artist
reddened and replied gruffly in the affirmative
kate never before felt so profoundly sad as the day the winters
started for dover when she had parted from them at a there was
the bustle and excitement of the journey and the expected arrival at a
new place to divert her thoughts now she had full time to feel how
much alone she was how much dependent on her own judgment her own
strength her own efforts
the travellers did not leave till after an early dinner and the long
desolate evening its usual occupations broken in upon and deranged
dragged its weary length slowly by though the colonel by a brave
effort seemed more cheerful than usual and talked of paris and the
people he had known there and of bordeaux and how the claret used
to be smuggled into the west of ireland of hoche and of the french
invasion and mrs otoole brought in her work and both endeavoured to
keep up their darlings heart
she could only remember that it was the anniversary of egertons
departure for india and that tomorrow she was to give an early lesson
to her new pupils
good night dearest grandpapa and do not forget to take your bottle
you coughed a great deal today
chapter ix
trials
before entreating the reader to imagine the lapse of some months
unbroken by any event we must record one which was a fertile theme
of conversation and conjecture to our recluses kate was met by mrs
otoole almost at the garden gate one morning about a fortnight
after the winters had left them as she returned from her daily
perambulations
och come in agra sure theres great news entirely theres
the captins been murthuring all afore him in ingee an such a
tundherin battle the masthers tired waitin for ye
whats all this nurse is telling me grandpapa
oh the indian mail is in and has brought an account of a hardfought
battle between our fellows and those desperate sikhs egertons name is
most honourably mentioned langley has very kindly sent me the second
edition of the times there it is read it for yourself
and kate untying her bonnet seized the paper and throwing herself
into the nearest chair read the official account which dry as it
was sufficed to flush her cheek and set all her pulses throbbing
 lieutenant colonel a having been severely wounded in the
 beginning of the action major egerton led the  lancers in
 repeated charges on the enemies guns which were defended with a
 courage and determination indicative of european training but they
 were in the possession of the lancers before four oclock i have
 great pleasure in drawing your lordships attention to the conduct
 of this regiment generally and in particular to that of the gallant
 officer in command whom i beg to recommend to your lordships notice
ah that is delightful i dare say captain egerton does not regret
having gone to india now it does not say if he was wounded are there
any private letters turning the paper in every direction
no not until next mail i fancy
what news for mr and mrs winter she continued how he will
rejoice and grumble and pooh pooh over it
och the crathure exclaimed mrs otoole who as usual on any
occasion of excitement was always at hand his soul ud niver rouse
up at the word iv a fight hes not got the blood in his vains for it
sure its only the ould stock thats niver to say in rale pleasure if
theyre not in the middle iv divilmint an danger jest look at miss
kates eyes like two dimints this minit though ill go bail shes
as white as a sheet at the sight iv a cutfinger her hearts chargin
the sicks with the captin sicks indeed faith he sickened thim sure
enough but it was on a boys milk ye wor rared avourneen so its no
wondher
i do feel excited said kate laughing some strange sympathy
withi do not know what for in how many things i am a coward
i believe it is the blood in your veins kate returned the
colonel nurse is right
athen if poor little misther gilpin the heavens be his bed was
alive now what a power iv rale sinse hed talk about it wouldnt
he lay all the battles to the divils door well theyre terrible
heartbreakin things entirely an the dear knows where me poor
dinny is this blessed nightmay be asleep in a ditch orbut faith
any ways hes alive i feel that as sure as if i seen him livin
fornent me
the great news occupied many a circle beside that which we are
attempting to describe and day after day brought further particulars
private letters and all the copious information so abundantly supplied
by that fourth estate of the british empire the public press in many
of these egertons name was mentioned always with praise often
with enthusiasm his coolness and undaunted gallantry in some hand
to hand encounters and the desperate stand made by the regiment he
commanded under great disadvantages left an impression of something
chivalrous and heroic even on the minds of strangers kate indeed
calling to mind the maxims of winter and the organist sometimes felt
that she ought not to feel so much delight in a courage that after
all is generally shared by every healthy man still in spite of her
reasoning egertons image invested with a prestige it never before
possessed constantly occupied her mind perhaps she did not know how
dauntless was her own nature and that there is irresistible attraction
even to the most intellectual in the courage physical though it be
than can face death and danger as if at home and at ease in the midst
of boththis contempt of what it is natural to dread must partake more
of the soul than philosophers allow and is one certain element of
greatness
and so the winter slipped rapidly over there was little to mark its
flight the constant sameness of occupation without any incident to
mark it lent its wings to time yet was it not all heaviness a day of
somewhat lighter spirits and greater strength would sometimes lend
its brightening influence to the colonel and kate revelled in the
unwonted sunshine or langley would lend her some new work suggestive
of much thought and clearing for the moment the mist which wraps
itself round spiritual things granting a passing glimpse catching
a faint echo of the glorious harmony with which all nature blends in
the great creators scheme of happiness and then the sameness or
obscurity which an hour before seemed oppressive in its meanness
acquired dignity from the thought that it had its place allotted in
the mighty whole and she would turn with perfect content to bend
her bright intelligence to the perfect comprehension and performance
of those everyday duties which act to society as mortar to a wall
filling up the crevices binding the unadhesive parts and keeping the
whole together
two months had fully elapsed since the news of the battle of  had
reached england letters from the winters had announced them safely
settled at pau and charmed with it and one cold bleak evening kate
was engaged arranging some lines she had selected from amongst many
written by gilpins sister to a very beautiful air bequeathed to her
by the organist the work did not progress as rapidly as it seemed as
her thoughts were divided by many mundane subjects principally the
necessity for looking out for cheaper lodgings
nurse says it is so hard to manage i must ask her to meet me
tomorrow on my way home and look for some other housei mean rooms
i am afraid to mention it to dear grandpapa he is so ill and worn out
with that dreadful coughit is much worse today how i wish georgina
would write it is nearly a year since she invited us to join her at
florence and talked of returning oh how alone we are i wonder shall
i ever ever live near my old friends or among my own people again
god forgive the murmuring thought
and here her reflections were broken by the colonel who suddenly
starting from an uneasy slumber coughed with more than usual
violence then as kate with some vague idea of assisting him flew to
his side it suddenly stopped with a choking sound and he fell back
the blood pouring from his mouth
to summon nurse to send for a doctor was the work of a moment and
before their anxious efforts to recall the colonel to consciousness
were successful he arrived then there were innumerable questions to
answer and various restoratives to be procured and kate had literally
no time to feel the terror and dismay which afterwards rushed upon her
mind
the old man lay long insensible and it was during a pause occasioned
by the exhaustion of every remedy that could possibly be applied in
haste that he breathed faintly at last and opening his eyes smiled
when he met those of his beloved grandchild the doctor immediately
forbad his speaking and directed that every precaution for the
preservation of extreme quiet around him should be taken
this is the great point he observed when after a lengthened visit
he was about to take leave i will write a prescription and see it
made up myself he must take it every two hours in a glass of port
wine but if he should be very sound asleep do not disturb him his
strength must be kept up
kate took her station by her grandfathers bedside nurse stationed
herself in the next room and the long watches of the night passed
slowly over
the colonel lay motionless and deadly pale but he did not sleep for
whenever kate stole softly to his side at the appointed times for his
taking the medicine he always as if by instinct opened his eyes and
who can tell who can venture to depict the crowd of images too vague
for thought too clear for dreams which thronged kates mind as she
sat listening now to each scarce audible breath from the invalid now
to the loud beating of her own heart it was not fear or sorrow that
seemed to hold her faculties in a strange tension but an agonised
absorption in the present danger a dread none the less intense
because it was vague that her darkest hour was at hand connected
prayer was out of the question but frequent ejaculations for help for
strength rose unconsciously to her lips towards morning the colonel
sank into a quiet profound sleep and leaving nurse in charge of him
with directions to call her the moment he awoke kate threw herself
into his vacant chair and strove to still her throbbing pulses and
hush her troubled spirit to repose
when she had left her grandfathers room she thought sleep was too
effectually frightened away by the terrors of the past night but the
strength and vigor of youth cannot be so soon unstrung rest is too
natural to that age and though it was disturbed slumber stole over
her unconsciously and day had dawned fully when waking with a start
and feeling as though her short absence from him was a neglect of a
sacred duty she stole softly and quickly to his room
he had but just awoke mrs otoole said and now lay gazing with a
troubled expression in his eyes towards the door he smiled when he
saw kate and his lips moved she stooped to hear and he whispered
faintly but earnestlywritegeorgina with a pause between each
word
i understand dearest grandpapa said kate quickly to relieve his
evident anxiety i will write to georgina desmond by this days post
and a look of greater contentment gradually composed the invalids
countenance which appeared so worn and haggard that kates eyes
filled with tears every time she looked at him
the doctor called early and expressed himself quite satisfied with
kates account of the patients past night his pulse too was a
little stronger
endeavour to keep him quiet and free from anxiety he is at present
free from fever and i should find some difficulty had we both fever
and weakness to contend with do not let him talk much
the day wore slowly over like the night diversified only by the
writing of the promised letter to lady desmond and the colonel seemed
much easier when he was told it had been despatched
soon the cares and duties of the sickroom became matters of course
the colonel decidedly gathered strength he was able to converse a
little with his grandchild without much exhaustion and frequently made
her read aloud to him he never wearied of the gospel of st john of
the psalms and the seventh and concluding chapters of revelation
nurse and kate divided the night into two watches the former taking
the first watch when the colonel was most likely to sleep and kate
the remainder to be ready with a few sympathising words when after
his broken sleep his restless weakness caused him to move uneasily
on his pillow or to repeat in her low soft tones his favorite
psalms and passages of the gospels when his eyes met hers with that
anxious gaze which made her heart ache so well did she understand
its source as for the apprehension of losing him it was a thought
on which she never dwelt for an instant she felt instinctively how
utterly it would unfit her for the preservation of that calm cheerful
aspect so necessary to her beloved grandfathers well being yet the
terrorstriking thought would press upon her mind in spite of all her
efforts to repel it when that troubled glance met hers by the dim
uncertain watchlight and her lips almost of themselves whispered the
words of comfort and of strength to which her heart turned as much to
still its own dread as to calm the anxiety she feared would injure her
grandfather
poor faithful mrs otoole never told her beads so fervently and
so often before for loving both master and nurseling she could fear
for the future to which kate never gave a thought her round comely
face faded from its bright rose to a yellowish tinge and the corners
of her mouth were drawn down lower than ever while her aspirations to
hesther and her denunciations of hesthers stupidity were rather
encreased than lessened in acerbity as if to make up for the enforced
softness with which they were whispered
it was about a fortnight after the colonel was first taken ill and he
had begun to ask anxiously for letters when he astonished the doctor
by expressing a desire to get up and go into the sittingroom
my dear sir it is much too soon do you feel greater strength
sometimes i think i am stronger and sometimes weaker replied the
old man with a sigh but i feel i should be quite as comfortable and
quiet in my armchair as in bed and more cheerful more like myself
you may as well humour me he added with a sad smile and paused
exhausted by so long a speech
well returned the doctor after a prolonged feeling of his pulse
in order to give himself time to think perhaps as you feel in this
way it may do you no harm wait till the day after tomorrow and take
plenty of arrowroot and wine and beef tea in the interval
kate could scarcely believe her ears when she heard the welcome
permission given she was not present when the colonel asked for it
and considered it an undoubted proof of amendment she looked so
bright and spoke so cheerily when she announced the fact to nurse
that mrs otoole took courage to make a disclosure she had withheld
for several days
ye know miss kate she began her apron folded round one arm and
rubbing the other hand confusedly up and down the table its three
days since last sathurday
yes nurse well what then

the colonel persisted in his intention of getting up on the
appointed day and though he almost fainted when the transit to
the sittingroom was accomplished he seemed more cheerful at
least he listened with more seeming attention and interest to kates
conversation for he was too weak to converse himself
from this period he rose each day about noon and kate was grieved
to observe how much his anxiety about the past exhausted his little
strength she asserted her conviction that lady desmond was on her
homeward road and though that generally quieted him for the moment it
was only to be done over again the next day
nurse kept watch at the hall door to anticipate that dreadful short
sharp knock that has made and will make many a heart stand still
with nameless dread and still kates daily report was
the post has just come dear grandpapa no letters for us
so time slipped by and both nurse and kate began to share the
colonels uneasiness at lady desmonds silence and nonappearance
though of course they suppressed all expression of it before him
at length the post did bring a letter for colonel vernon but it was
from winter a few lines only expressing surprise at kates long
silence and enclosing one directed to his care for the colonel
it bore the southampton postmark and was from fred egerton the
colonel was at first so much affected by the extreme disappointment he
experienced at not receiving any letter from lady desmond that was
some before he desired to have egertons despatch read to him not
until he was fairly established in his easy chair and recovered from
the fatigue of dressing which kate noticed sadly continued the same
from day to day no visible improvement of strength taking place
now my love let me hear this disappointing letter though it is very
ungracious in me to call it so
and kate who had had no time of late to think of fred egerton felt
her voice trembling with the strange gush of delight that filled her
whole heart with a sudden and delicious life when the long looked for
writing met her eye and which she had not yet succeeded in stilling
the letter was too long for a full insertion here after expressing a
hope that the colonels silence did not proceed from any intention to
repudiate his acquaintance and that he would not consider a third
attempt at a correspondence importunate fred egerton proceeded to
give a short but clear description of the country round him alluding
briefly to the battle of  an account of which he supposed had
reached them he enquired kindly for the winters and said he had heard
from burton who had passed through a in the summer of gilpins
death and that they colonel and miss vernon had left the old city
i presume therefore that my last letter as well as one i enclosed
for mrs otoole from her son were delayed in reaching you if they
ever did reach you pray remember me kindly to my good nurse many a
time i have longed to hear her rich brogue near me when i lay parched
with fever by the way will you tell miss vernon i am busily engaged
training her fosterbrother in the way he should go ill not say any
thing of his past but i anticipate great things for his future
 well the excitement of a battle is intense and its horrors intense
 also should i meet miss vernon again though perhaps she is no
 longer miss vernon i shall be able to satisfy her curiosity about a
 battle
 poor colonel a died of his wounds a fortnight ago he was as
 fine fellow as ever breathed i was close by him when he fell and i
 felt that a thousand of those infernal sikhs would not make up for
 such a life they say i am sure of the lieutenant colonelcy heaven
 and the horse guards only know if they will give it i will take it
 and be thankful but i have no money to purchase and i will not ask
 egertons interest
 may i hope you will answer this letter if it is not too much
 trouble perhaps winter if he is near you will act as your
 amanuensis dare i suggest miss vernon i long for some news from
 my friends for i feel anxious somehow since i heard you had left
 a and the old priory i have a sketch of it which i often set
 up before me as i smoke my last cigar before turning in to ensure
 pleasant dreams once more my dear sir pray write
                                              with the warmest esteem
                                                     faithfully yours
                                                    fred b egerton
a kind warmhearted letter said the colonel at its conclusion in
the slow faint tone now usual with him i am gratified to find him
so thoughtful of the past ah if he stopped
if what asked kate carelessly as she was rereading the letter
nothing dear child he returned despondingly you had better tell
nurse she will like to hear of denny
glory be to god ejaculated mrs otoole as kate read the passage
relating to her son aloud an so theyre comin home
no dear nurse captain egerton says if i ever revisit england
well sure its all the same whin people niver intend a thing they
niver talk iv it but whin they begin to wish for it they begin to
talk iv it an whin theyve talked a bit they must do it
the colonel smiled at mrs otooles logic and not many minutes after
the doctor came in
pulse very unsteady said he gravely and interrogatively to kate
any disturbing cause
he has been disappointed about a letter he hoped to receive
ah these letters are bad very bad he is not getting on as i could
wish added the doctor to mrs otoole as she followed him to the
hall door to receive his parting instructions could you not get up
some pious fraud about this letter invent one eh
oh god bless ye docther its not possible any ways sure if it was
im the woman would do it
well i suppose so but i tell you i dread another bursting of a
blood vessel and then the doctor paused shook his head drew on his
glove and departed in the teeth of a bitter march wind and a cloud of
dust
it seems a very cold wretched day said the colonel as kate took up
her work is poor cormac never let into the house now
oh yes grandpapa he generally lies outside the door but i did not
like to let him in for fear of disturbing you
he would not disturb me i wish to see him
miss vernon rose and opening the door admitted cormac who testified
his joy at beholding his master in a quiet subdued manner and the
colonel welcomed his faithful follower with a warmth that kate feared
would be too much for his strength stroking the dogs head feebly
from time to time and gazing at him abstractedly as if his spirit
had flown back to the scenes and time when he was still vigorous and
cormac gambolled with all the vivacity of youth now the old hound
sat grave and still his dull filmy eye returning his masters gaze
and kate suppressed the deep sighs which rose from her heart as she
saw these old companions side by side thus changed thus sinking in
the unequal conflict with time and adversity and behind them memory
raised the dark curtain of the present and the bright happy past
broke forth with more than its pristine freshness she saw those two
languid forms instinct with life glowing with animation she heard
her grandfathers clear musical laugh ring forth as he sprang upon
his favourite horse and held him steady with a powerful hand she
heard the hounds deep joyous bark as after a few gambols round the
impatient horse he bounded forward in a swift and sudden race only
to return with headlong speed she saw her grandfathers stately form
with those of his highborn gay companions sweep round a bend of the
avenue and as the sound of their voices and the tramp of their horses
died away in the distance she heard the dash and roar of the restless
atlantic against the cliffs she saw the parklike lawn the stately
wood the bold blue hills anda faint voice like the echo of her
grandfathers from another world recalled her to the present
give cormac poor fellow some bread and milk before he goes away
a few days passed and still no letter one evening pleased to see the
colonel sleeping peacefully in his chair kate dropped her work and
gave herself up to reverie she had hardly had time to think of fred
egertons letter and the tone of warm remembrance it breathed
i wonder shall i ever see him again ah no what folly to think of
it yet if he was here he would give grandpapa hope and courage and
to me he is so bright and strong but thank god his letter came with
its cheering words just when i most wanted something to raise my heart
a little nurse thinks he will come back but that is only a dream
and after all if he did it would make no difference to me
her thoughts rambled on in this way for some time over many a varied
topic till she was roused by cormacs very unusual efforts to gain
admittance without leave well come in good dog but be quiet and
the hound immediately placed himself by his masters chair and kate
was speaking to him in a low voice when the postmans knock they had
so long guarded against but did not expect at that unaccustomed hour
shook the frail walls of the habitation and kate rose from her chair
trembling for her grandfather
he woke suddenly startled but not so much as kate had feared and at
the same moment nurse entered with a letter
from georgina cried kate opening it with trembling haste she read
aloud
good heavens dearest kate how unfortunate that i should have come
here
she writes from lucca
your letter was not forwarded to me for ten days after i left
florence i start tomorrow for england and god grant the passes
may not be snowed up i hope to reach you as soon almost as this
does keep up your spirits tell the colonel i know his wishes i
fully understand his anxiety for your writing the courier waits for
my letter god bless youyours in haste and much afflictiong
desmond
what is the date asked the colonel feebly
it has none except the place she evidently writes in the greatest
haste
look at the cover
it is so rubbed and soiled i can make nothing out but a fir and
marzo
she will be here tomorrow said the colonel with sudden decision
my god i thank thee he murmured kate my love i feel exhausted
some wine
she flew to get it and after taking a little he leaned back
drowsily she settled the cushions for his head and knelt down to feel
if his feet were cold he stretched out his hand feebly and laid it on
her head the old hound whom they had not noticed drew closer and
licked the hand that had so often caressed him
god bless you darling from the hour of your birth you have been an
unalloyed blessing to me
kate rose and kissed him fondly
go to sleep dearest grandpapa
yes for she will be here tomorrow i feel so happy kate
thank heaven she ejaculated and returning to her seat watched
the sleeper for some time rejoicing to see an expression of almost
heavenly happiness and calm gradually stealing over his features
the old hound too shared her vigil laying his head couched on his
forepaws his eyes fixed on his master so she sat sometimes raising
her heart to god with a feeling of thankfulness though she knew not
why except that she ever looked in spite of her cooler reason to
lady desmonds return as to a great deliverance
the evening closed in and still her grandfather lay in calm unbroken
repose the old dog at length grew restless he raised his head and
half rose up as if to approach his master and when kate spoke to him
lay down again with a low complaining whine miss vernon rung
i wish said she as mrs otoole entered you would take cormac
away i never saw him so troublesome before i am afraid he will
disturb grandpapa from that sweet sound sleep
come with me cormac
the hound wagged his tail turning his dull eyes on her for a moment
but immediately refixing them on his master with a watchful air
his ears erected as if in expectation mrs otoole crossed the
room quickly and stooping to look into the old mans face started
back clasping her hands with an expression of awe and terror on her
countenance
nurse exclaimed kate springing to her side what what is the
matter
hush hush mee own darlint child whispered mrs otoole hes not
therehes with the blessed saints in heaven
