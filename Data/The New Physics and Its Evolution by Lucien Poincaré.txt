prefatory note
m lucien poincar is one of the distinguished family of
mathematicians which has during the last few years given a
minister of finance to the republic and a president to the
acadmie des sciences he is also one of the nineteen
inspectorsgeneral of public instruction who are charged with the
duty of visiting the different universities and lyces in
france and of reporting upon the state of the studies there
pursued hence he is in an excellent position to appreciate at
its proper value the extraordinary change which has lately
revolutionized physical science while his official position has
kept him aloof from the controversies aroused by the discovery of
radium and by recent speculations on the constitution of matter
m poincars object and method in writing the book are
sufficiently explained in the preface which follows but it may
be remarked that the best of methods has its defects and the
excessive condensation which has alone made it possible to
include the last decades discoveries in physical science within
a compass of some 300 pages has perhaps made the facts here
noted assimilable with difficulty by the untrained reader to
remedy this as far as possible i have prefixed to the present
translation a table of contents so extended as to form a fairly
complete digest of the book while full indexes of authors and
subjects have also been added the few notes necessary either for
better elucidation of the terms employed or for giving account
of discoveries made while these pages were passing through the
press may be distinguished from the authors own by the

authors preface
during the last ten years so many works have accumulated in the
domain of physics and so many new theories have been propounded
that those who follow with interest the progress of science and
even some professed scholars absorbed as they are in their own
special studies find themselves at sea in a confusion more
apparent than real
it has therefore occurred to me that it might be useful to write
a book which while avoiding too great insistence on purely
technical details should try to make known the general results
at which physicists have lately arrived and to indicate the
direction and import which should be ascribed to those
speculations on the constitution of matter and the discussions
on the nature of first principles to which it has become so to
speak the fashion of the present day to devote oneself
i have endeavoured throughout to rely only on the experiments in
which we can place the most confidence and above all to show
how the ideas prevailing at the present day have been formed by
tracing their evolution and rapidly examining the successive
transformations which have brought them to their present
condition
in order to understand the text the reader will have no need to
consult any treatise on physics for i have throughout given the
necessary definitions and set forth the fundamental facts
moreover while strictly employing exact expressions i have
avoided the use of mathematical language algebra is an admirable
tongue but there are many occasions where it can only be used
with much discretion
nothing would be easier than to point out many great omissions
from this little volume but some at all events are not
involuntary
certain questions which are still too confused have been put on
one side as have a few others which form an important collection
for a special study to be possibly made later thus as regards
electrical phenomena the relations between electricity and
optics as also the theories of ionization the electronic
hypothesis etc have been treated at some length but it has
not been thought necessary to dilate upon the modes of production
and utilization of the current upon the phenomena of magnetism
or upon all the applications which belong to the domain of
electrotechnics

chapter i
the evolution of physics
the now numerous public which tries with some success to keep abreast
of the movement in science from seeing its mental habits every day
upset and from occasionally witnessing unexpected discoveries that
produce a more lively sensation from their reaction on social life is
led to suppose that we live in a really exceptional epoch scored by
profound crises and illustrated by extraordinary discoveries whose
singularity surpasses everything known in the past thus we often hear
it said that physics in particular has of late years undergone a
veritable revolution that all its principles have been made new that
all the edifices constructed by our fathers have been overthrown and
that on the field thus cleared has sprung up the most abundant harvest
that has ever enriched the domain of science
it is in fact true that the crop becomes richer and more fruitful
thanks to the development of our laboratories and that the quantity
of seekers has considerably increased in all countries while their
quality has not diminished we should be sustaining an absolute
paradox and at the same time committing a crying injustice were we
to contest the high importance of recent progress and to seek to
diminish the glory of contemporary physicists yet it may be as well
not to give way to exaggerations however pardonable and to guard
against facile illusions on closer examination it will be seen that
our predecessors might at several periods in history have conceived
as legitimately as ourselves similar sentiments of scientific pride
and have felt that the world was about to appear to them transformed
and under an aspect until then absolutely unknown
let us take an example which is salient enough for however arbitrary
the conventional division of time may appear to a physicists eyes it
is natural when instituting a comparison between two epochs to
choose those which extend over a space of half a score of years and
are separated from each other by the gap of a century let us then
go back a hundred years and examine what would have been the state of
mind of an erudite amateur who had read and understood the chief
publications on physical research between 1800 and 1810
let us suppose that this intelligent and attentive spectator witnessed
in 1800 the discovery of the galvanic battery by volta he might from
that moment have felt a presentiment that a prodigious transformation
was about to occur in our mode of regarding electrical phenomena
brought up in the ideas of coulomb and franklin he might till then
have imagined that electricity had unveiled nearly all its mysteries
when an entirely original apparatus suddenly gave birth to
applications of the highest interest and excited the blossoming of
theories of immense philosophical extent
in the treatises on physics published a little later we find traces
of the astonishment produced by this sudden revelation of a new world
electricity wrote the abb hay enriched by the labour of so many
distinguished physicists seemed to have reached the term when a
science has no further important steps before it and only leaves to
those who cultivate it the hope of confirming the discoveries of their
predecessors and of casting a brighter light on the truths revealed
one would have thought that all researches for diversifying the
results of experiment were exhausted and that theory itself could
only be augmented by the addition of a greater degree of precision to
the applications of principles already known while science thus
appeared to be making for repose the phenomena of the convulsive
movements observed by galvani in the muscles of a frog when connected
by metal were brought to the attention and astonishment of
physicists volta in that italy which had been the cradle of the
new knowledge discovered the principle of its true theory in a fact
which reduces the explanation of all the phenomena in question to the
simple contact of two substances of different nature this fact became
in his hands the germ of the admirable apparatus to which its manner
of being and its fecundity assign one of the chief places among those
with which the genius of mankind has enriched physics
shortly afterwards our amateur would learn that carlisle and
nicholson had decomposed water by the aid of a battery then that
davy in 1803 had produced by the help of the same battery a quite
unexpected phenomenon and had succeeded in preparing metals endowed
with marvellous properties beginning with substances of an earthy
appearance which had been known for a long time but whose real nature
had not been discovered
in another order of ideas surprises as prodigious would wait for our
amateur commencing with 1802 he might have read the admirable series
of memoirs which young then published and might thereby have learned
how the study of the phenomena of diffraction led to the belief that
the undulation theory which since the works of newton seemed
irretrievably condemned was on the contrary beginning quite a new
life a little laterin 1808he might have witnessed the discovery
made by malus of polarization by reflexion and would have been able
to note no doubt with stupefaction that under certain conditions a
ray of light loses the property of being reflected
he might also have heard of one rumford who was then promulgating
very singular ideas on the nature of heat who thought that the then
classical notions might be false that caloric does not exist as a
fluid and who in 1804 even demonstrated that heat is created by
friction a few years later he would learn that charles had enunciated
a capital law on the dilatation of gases that pierre prevost in
1809 was making a study full of original ideas on radiant heat in
the meantime he would not have failed to read volumes iii and iv of
the mecanique celeste of laplace published in 1804 and 1805 and he
might no doubt have thought that before long mathematics would
enable physical science to develop with unforeseen safety
all these results may doubtless be compared in importance with the
present discoveries when strange metals like potassium and sodium
were isolated by an entirely new method the astonishment must have
been on a par with that caused in our time by the magnificent
discovery of radium the polarization of light is a phenomenon as
undoubtedly singular as the existence of the x rays and the upheaval
produced in natural philosophy by the theories of the disintegration
of matter and the ideas concerning electrons is probably not more
considerable than that produced in the theories of light and heat by
the works of young and rumford
if we now disentangle ourselves from contingencies it will be
understood that in reality physical science progresses by evolution
rather than by revolution its march is continuous the facts which
our theories enable us to discover subsist and are linked together
long after these theories have disappeared out of the materials of
former edifices overthrown new dwellings are constantly being
reconstructed
the labour of our forerunners never wholly perishes the ideas of
yesterday prepare for those of tomorrow they contain them so to
speak in potentia science is in some sort a living organism which
gives birth to an indefinite series of new beings taking the places of
the old and which evolves according to the nature of its environment
adapting itself to external conditions and healing at every step the
wounds which contact with reality may have occasioned
sometimes this evolution is rapid sometimes it is slow enough but it
obeys the ordinary laws the wants imposed by its surroundings create
certain organs in science the problems set to physicists by the
engineer who wishes to facilitate transport or to produce better
illumination or by the doctor who seeks to know how such and such a
remedy acts or again by the physiologist desirous of understanding
the mechanism of the gaseous and liquid exchanges between the cell and
the outer medium cause new chapters in physics to appear and suggest
researches adapted to the necessities of actual life
the evolution of the different parts of physics does not however
take place with equal speed because the circumstances in which they
are placed are not equally favourable sometimes a whole series of
questions will appear forgotten and will live only with a languishing
existence and then some accidental circumstance suddenly brings them
new life and they become the object of manifold labours engross
public attention and invade nearly the whole domain of science
we have in our own day witnessed such a spectacle the discovery of
the x raysa discovery which physicists no doubt consider as the
logical outcome of researches long pursued by a few scholars working
in silence and obscurity on an otherwise much neglected subject
seemed to the public eye to have inaugurated a new era in the history
of physics if as is the case however the extraordinary scientific
movement provoked by rntgens sensational experiments has a very
remote origin it has at least been singularly quickened by the
favourable conditions created by the interest aroused in its
astonishing applications to radiography
a lucky chance has thus hastened an evolution already taking place
and theories previously outlined have received a singular development
without wishing to yield too much to what may be considered a whim of
fashion we cannot if we are to note in this book the stage actually
reached in the continuous march of physics refrain from giving a
clearly preponderant place to the questions suggested by the study of
the new radiations at the present time it is these questions which
move us the most they have shown us unknown horizons and towards the
fields recently opened to scientific activity the daily increasing
crowd of searchers rushes in rather disorderly fashion
one of the most interesting consequences of the recent discoveries has
been to rehabilitate in the eyes of scholars speculations relating to
the constitution of matter and in a more general way metaphysical
problems philosophy has of course never been completely separated
from science but in times past many physicists dissociated themselves
from studies which they looked upon as unreal wordsquabbles and
sometimes not unreasonably abstained from joining in discussions which
seemed to them idle and of rather puerile subtlety they had seen the
ruin of most of the systems built up a priori by daring
philosophers and deemed it more prudent to listen to the advice given
by kirchhoff and to substitute the description of facts for a sham
explanation of nature
it should however be remarked that these physicists somewhat deceived
themselves as to the value of their caution and that the mistrust
they manifested towards philosophical speculations did not preclude
their admitting unknown to themselves certain axioms which they did
not discuss but which are properly speaking metaphysical
conceptions they were unconsciously speaking a language taught them
by their predecessors of which they made no attempt to discover the
origin it is thus that it was readily considered evident that physics
must necessarily some day reenter the domain of mechanics and thence
it was postulated that everything in nature is due to movement we
further accepted the principles of the classical mechanics without
discussing their legitimacy
this state of mind was even of late years that of the most
illustrious physicists it is manifested quite sincerely and without
the slightest reserve in all the classical works devoted to physics
thus verdet an illustrious professor who has had the greatest and
most happy influence on the intellectual formation of a whole
generation of scholars and whose works are even at the present day
very often consulted wrote the true problem of the physicist is
always to reduce all phenomena to that which seems to us the simplest
and clearest that is to say to movement in his celebrated course
of lectures at lcole polytechnique jamin likewise said physics
will one day form a chapter of general mechanics and in the preface
to his excellent course of lectures on physics m violle in 1884
thus expresses himself the science of nature tends towards mechanics
by a necessary evolution the physicist being able to establish solid
theories only on the laws of movement the same idea is again met
with in the words of cornu in 1896 the general tendency should be to
show how the facts observed and the phenomena measured though first
brought together by empirical laws end by the impulse of successive
progressions in coming under the general laws of rational mechanics
and the same physicist showed clearly that in his mind this connexion
of phenomena with mechanics had a deep and philosophical reason when
in the fine discourse pronounced by him at the opening ceremony of the
congrs de physique in 1900 he exclaimed the mind of descartes
soars over modern physics or rather i should say he is their
luminary the further we penetrate into the knowledge of natural
phenomena the clearer and the more developed becomes the bold
cartesian conception regarding the mechanism of the universe there is
nothing in the physical world but matter and movement
if we adopt this conception we are led to construct mechanical
representations of the material world and to imagine movements in the
different parts of bodies capable of reproducing all the
manifestations of nature the kinematic knowledge of these movements
that is to say the determination of the position speed and
acceleration at a given moment of all the parts of the system or on
the other hand their dynamical study enabling us to know what is the
action of these parts on each other would then be sufficient to
enable us to foretell all that can occur in the domain of nature
this was the great thought clearly expressed by the encyclopdists of
the eighteenth century and if the necessity of interpreting the
phenomena of electricity or light led the physicists of last century
to imagine particular fluids which seemed to obey with some difficulty
the ordinary rules of mechanics these physicists still continued to
retain their hope in the future and to treat the idea of descartes as
an ideal to be reached sooner or later
certain scholarsparticularly those of the english schooloutrunning
experiment and pushing things to extremes took pleasure in proposing
very curious mechanical models which were often strange images of
reality the most illustrious of them lord kelvin may be considered
as their representative type and he has himself said it seems to me
that the true sense of the question do we or do we not understand a
particular subject in physics iscan we make a mechanical model
which corresponds to it i am never satisfied so long as i have been
unable to make a mechanical model of the object if i am able to do
so i understand it if i cannot make such a model i do not
understand it but it must be acknowledged that some of the models
thus devised have become excessively complicated and this
complication has for a long time discouraged all but very bold minds
in addition when it became a question of penetrating into the
mechanism of molecules and we were no longer satisfied to look at
matter as a mass the mechanical solutions seemed undetermined and the
stability of the edifices thus constructed was insufficiently
demonstrated
returning then to our startingpoint many contemporary physicists
wish to subject descartes idea to strict criticism from the
philosophical point of view they first enquire whether it is really
demonstrated that there exists nothing else in the knowable than
matter and movement they ask themselves whether it is not habit and
tradition in particular which lead us to ascribe to mechanics the
origin of phenomena perhaps also a question of sense here comes in
our senses which are after all the only windows open towards
external reality give us a view of one side of the world only
evidently we only know the universe by the relations which exist
between it and our organisms and these organisms are peculiarly
sensitive to movement
nothing however proves that those acquisitions which are the most
ancient in historical order ought in the development of science to
remain the basis of our knowledge nor does any theory prove that our
perceptions are an exact indication of reality many reasons on the
contrary might be invoked which tend to compel us to see in nature
phenomena which cannot be reduced to movement
mechanics as ordinarily understood is the study of reversible
phenomena if there be given to the parameter which represents
time1 and which has assumed increasing values during the duration
of the phenomena decreasing values which make it go the opposite way
the whole system will again pass through exactly the same stages as
before and all the phenomena will unfold themselves in reversed
order in physics the contrary rule appears very general and
reversibility generally does not exist it is an ideal and limited
case which may be sometimes approached but can never strictly
speaking be met with in its entirety no physical phenomenon ever
recommences in an identical manner if its direction be altered it is
true that certain mathematicians warn us that a mechanics can be
devised in which reversibility would no longer be the rule but the
bold attempts made in this direction are not wholly satisfactory
footnote 1 ie the timecurveed
on the other hand it is established that if a mechanical explanation
of a phenomenon can be given we can find an infinity of others which
likewise account for all the peculiarities revealed by experiment
but as a matter of fact no one has ever succeeded in giving an
indisputable mechanical representation of the whole physical world
even were we disposed to admit the strangest solutions of the problem
to consent for example to be satisfied with the hidden systems
devised by helmholtz whereby we ought to divide variable things into
two classes some accessible and the others now and for ever unknown
we should never manage to construct an edifice to contain all the
known facts even the very comprehensive mechanics of a hertz fails
where the classical mechanics has not succeeded
deeming this check irremediable many contemporary physicists give up
attempts which they look upon as condemned beforehand and adopt to
guide them in their researches a method which at first sight appears
much more modest and also much more sure they make up their minds
not to see at once to the bottom of things they no longer seek to
suddenly strip the last veils from nature and to divine her supreme
secrets but they work prudently and advance but slowly while on the
ground thus conquered foot by foot they endeavour to establish
themselves firmly they study the various magnitudes directly
accessible to their observation without busying themselves as to their
essence they measure quantities of heat and of temperature
differences of potential currents and magnetic fields and then
varying the conditions apply the rules of experimental method and
discover between these magnitudes mutual relations while they thus
succeed in enunciating laws which translate and sum up their labours
these empirical laws however themselves bring about by induction the
promulgation of more general laws which are termed principles these
principles are originally only the results of experiments and
experiment allows them besides to be checked and their more or less
high degree of generality to be verified when they have been thus
definitely established they may serve as fresh startingpoints and
by deduction lead to very varied discoveries
the principles which govern physical science are few in number and
their very general form gives them a philosophical appearance while
we cannot long resist the temptation of regarding them as metaphysical
dogmas it thus happens that the least bold physicists those who have
wanted to show themselves the most reserved are themselves led to
forget the experimental character of the laws they have propounded
and to see in them imperious beings whose authority placed above all
verification can no longer be discussed
others on the contrary carry prudence to the extent of timidity
they desire to grievously limit the field of scientific investigation
and they assign to science a too restricted domain they content
themselves with representing phenomena by equations and think that
they ought to submit to calculation magnitudes experimentally
determined without asking themselves whether these calculations
retain a physical meaning they are thus led to reconstruct a physics
in which there again appears the idea of quality understood of
course not in the scholastic sense since from this quality we can
argue with some precision by representing it under numerical symbols
but still constituting an element of differentiation and of
heterogeneity
notwithstanding the errors they may lead to if carried to excess both
these doctrines render as a whole most important service it is no
bad thing that these contradictory tendencies should subsist for this
variety in the conception of phenomena gives to actual science a
character of intense life and of veritable youth capable of
impassioned efforts towards the truth spectators who see such moving
and varied pictures passing before them experience the feeling that
there no longer exist systems fixed in an immobility which seems that
of death they feel that nothing is unchangeable that ceaseless
transformations are taking place before their eyes and that this
continuous evolution and perpetual change are the necessary conditions
of progress
a great number of seekers moreover show themselves on their own
account perfectly eclectic they adopt according to their needs such
or such a manner of looking at nature and do not hesitate to utilize
very different images when they appear to them useful and convenient
and without doubt they are not wrong since these images are only
symbols convenient for language they allow facts to be grouped and
associated but only present a fairly distant resemblance with the
objective reality hence it is not forbidden to multiply and to modify
them according to circumstances the really essential thing is to
have as a guide through the unknown a map which certainly does not
claim to represent all the aspects of nature but which having been
drawn up according to predetermined rules allows us to follow an
ascertained road in the eternal journey towards the truth
among the provisional theories which are thus willingly constructed by
scholars on their journey like edifices hastily run up to receive an
unforeseen harvest some still appear very bold and very singular
abandoning the search after mechanical models for all electrical
phenomena certain physicists reverse so to speak the conditions of
the problem and ask themselves whether instead of giving a
mechanical interpretation to electricity they may not on the
contrary give an electrical interpretation to the phenomena of matter
and motion and thus merge mechanics itself in electricity one thus
sees dawning afresh the eternal hope of coordinating all natural
phenomena in one grandiose and imposing synthesis whatever may be the
fate reserved for such attempts they deserve attention in the highest
degree and it is desirable to examine them carefully if we wish to
have an exact idea of the tendencies of modern physics
chapter ii
measurements
 1 metrology
not so very long ago the scholar was often content with qualitative
observations many phenomena were studied without much trouble being
taken to obtain actual measurements but it is now becoming more and
more understood that to establish the relations which exist between
physical magnitudes and to represent the variations of these
magnitudes by functions which allow us to use the power of
mathematical analysis it is most necessary to express each magnitude
by a definite number
under these conditions alone can a magnitude be considered as
effectively known i often say lord kelvin has said that if you
can measure that of which you are speaking and express it by a number
you know something of your subject but if you cannot measure it nor
express it by a number your knowledge is of a sorry kind and hardly
satisfactory it may be the beginning of the acquaintance but you are
hardly in your thoughts advanced towards science whatever the
subject may be
it has now become possible to measure exactly the elements which enter
into nearly all physical phenomena and these measurements are taken
with ever increasing precision every time a chapter in science
progresses science shows itself more exacting it perfects its means
of investigation it demands more and more exactitude and one of the
most striking features of modern physics is this constant care for
strictness and clearness in experimentation
a veritable science of measurement has thus been constituted which
extends over all parts of the domain of physics this science has its
rules and its methods it points out the best processes of
calculation and teaches the method of correctly estimating errors and
taking account of them it has perfected the processes of experiment
coordinated a large number of results and made possible the
unification of standards it is thanks to it that the system of
measurements unanimously adopted by physicists has been formed
at the present day we designate more peculiarly by the name of
metrology that part of the science of measurements which devotes
itself specially to the determining of the prototypes representing the
fundamental units of dimension and mass and of the standards of the
first order which are derived from them if all measurable quantities
as was long thought possible could be reduced to the magnitudes of
mechanics metrology would thus be occupied with the essential
elements entering into all phenomena and might legitimately claim the
highest rank in science but even when we suppose that some magnitudes
can never be connected with mass length and time it still holds a
preponderating place and its progress finds an echo throughout the
whole domain of the natural sciences it is therefore well in order
to give an account of the general progress of physics to examine at
the outset the improvements which have been effected in these
fundamental measurements and to see what precision these improvements
have allowed us to attain
 2 the measure of length
to measure a length is to compare it with another length taken as
unity measurement is therefore a relative operation and can only
enable us to know ratios did both the length to be measured and the
unit chosen happen to vary simultaneously and in the same degree we
should perceive no change moreover the unit being by definition
the term of comparison and not being itself comparable with anything
we have theoretically no means of ascertaining whether its length
varies
if however we were to note that suddenly and in the same
proportions the distance between two points on this earth had
increased that all the planets had moved further from each other
that all objects around us had become larger that we ourselves had
become taller and that the distance travelled by light in the
duration of a vibration had become greater we should not hesitate to
think ourselves the victims of an illusion that in reality all these
distances had remained fixed and that all these appearances were due
to a shortening of the rule which we had used as the standard for
measuring the lengths
from the mathematical point of view it may be considered that the two
hypotheses are equivalent all has lengthened around us or else our
standard has become less but it is no simple question of convenience
and simplicity which leads us to reject the one supposition and to
accept the other it is right in this case to listen to the voice of
common sense and those physicists who have an instinctive trust in
the notion of an absolute length are perhaps not wrong it is only by
choosing our unit from those which at all times have seemed to all men
the most invariable that we are able in our experiments to note that
the same causes acting under identical conditions always produce the
same effects the idea of absolute length is derived from the
principle of causality and our choice is forced upon us by the
necessity of obeying this principle which we cannot reject without
declaring by that very act all science to be impossible
similar remarks might be made with regard to the notions of absolute
time and absolute movement they have been put in evidence and set
forth very forcibly by a learned and profound mathematician m
painlev
on the particularly clear example of the measure of length it is
interesting to follow the evolution of the methods employed and to
run through the history of the progress in precision from the time
that we have possessed authentic documents relating to this question
this history has been written in a masterly way by one of the
physicists who have in our days done the most by their personal
labours to add to it glorious pages m benoit the learned director
of the international bureau of weights and measures has furnished in
various reports very complete details on the subject from which i
here borrow the most interesting
we know that in france the fundamental standard for measures of length
was for a long time the toise du chtelet a kind of callipers
formed of a bar of iron which in 1668 was embedded in the outside wall
of the chtelet at the foot of the staircase this bar had at its
extremities two projections with square faces and all the toises of
commerce had to fit exactly between them such a standard roughly
constructed and exposed to all the injuries of weather and time
offered very slight guarantees either as to the permanence or the
correctness of its copies nothing perhaps can better convey an idea
of the importance of the modifications made in the methods of
experimental physics than the easy comparison between so rudimentary a
process and the actual measurements effected at the present time
the toise du chtelet notwithstanding its evident faults was
employed for nearly a hundred years in 1766 it was replaced by the
toise du prou so called because it had served for the measurements
of the terrestrial arc effected in peru from 1735 to 1739 by bouguer
la condamine and godin at that time according to the comparisons
made between this new toise and the toise du nord which had also
been used for the measurement of an arc of the meridian an error of
the tenth part of a millimetre in measuring lengths of the order of a
metre was considered quite unimportant at the end of the eighteenth
century delambre in his work sur la base du systme mtrique
dcimal clearly gives us to understand that magnitudes of the order
of the hundredth of a millimetre appear to him incapable of
observation even in scientific researches of the highest precision
at the present date the international bureau of weights and measures
guarantees in the determination of a standard of length compared with
the metre an approximation of two or three tenthousandths of a
millimetre and even a little more under certain circumstances
this very remarkable progress is due to the improvements in the method
of comparison on the one hand and in the manufacture of the standard
on the other m benoit rightly points out that a kind of competition
has been set up between the standard destined to represent the unit
with its subdivisions and multiples and the instrument charged with
observing it comparable up to a certain point with that which in
another order of ideas goes on between the gun and the armourplate
the measuring instrument of today is an instrument of comparison
constructed with meticulous care which enables us to do away with
causes of error formerly ignored to eliminate the action of external
phenomena and to withdraw the experiment from the influence of even
the personality of the observer this standard is no longer as
formerly a flat rule weak and fragile but a rigid bar incapable of
deformation in which the material is utilised in the best conditions
of resistance for a standard with ends has been substituted a
standard with marks which permits much more precise definition and
can be employed in optical processes of observation alone that is in
processes which can produce in it no deformation and no alteration
moreover the marks are traced on the plane of the neutral fibres2
exposed and the invariability of their distance apart is thus
assured even when a change is made in the way the rule is supported
footnote 2 the author seems to refer to the fact that in the
standard metre the measurement is taken from the central one of three
marks at each end of the bar the transverse section of the bar is an
x and the reading is made by a microscopeed
thanks to studies thus systematically pursued we have succeeded in
the course of a hundred years in increasing the precision of measures
in the proportion of a thousand to one and we may ask ourselves
whether such an increase will continue in the future no doubt
progress will not be stayed but if we keep to the definition of
length by a material standard it would seem that its precision cannot
be considerably increased we have nearly reached the limit imposed by
the necessity of making strokes of such a thickness as to be
observable under the microscope
it may happen however that we shall be brought one of these days to
a new conception of the measure of length and that very different
processes of determination will be thought of if we took as unit for
instance the distance covered by a given radiation during a
vibration the optical processes would at once admit of much greater
precision
thus fizeau the first to have this idea says a ray of light with
its series of undulations of extreme tenuity but perfect regularity
may be considered as a micrometer of the greatest perfection and
particularly suitable for determining length but in the present
state of things since the legal and customary definition of the unit
remains a material standard it is not enough to measure length in
terms of wavelengths and we must also know the value of these
wavelengths in terms of the standard prototype of the metre
this was determined in 1894 by m michelson and m benoit in an
experiment which will remain classic the two physicists measured a
standard length of about ten centimetres first in terms of the
wavelengths of the red green and blue radiations of cadmium and
then in terms of the standard metre the great difficulty of the
experiment proceeds from the vast difference which exists between the
lengths to be compared the wavelengths barely amounting to half a
micron3 the process employed consisted in noting instead of this
length a length easily made about a thousand times greater namely
the distance between the fringes of interference
footnote 3 ie 12000 of a millimetreed
in all measurement that is to say in every determination of the
relation of a magnitude to the unit there has to be determined on the
one hand the whole and on the other the fractional part of this
ratio and naturally the most delicate determination is generally that
of this fractional part in optical processes the difficulty is
reversed the fractional part is easily known while it is the high
figure of the number representing the whole which becomes a very
serious obstacle it is this obstacle which mm michelson and benoit
overcame with admirable ingenuity by making use of a somewhat similar
idea m mac de lpinay and mm perot and fabry have lately effected
by optical methods measurements of the greatest precision and no
doubt further progress may still be made a day may perhaps come when
a material standard will be given up and it may perhaps even be
recognised that such a standard in time changes its length by
molecular strain and by wear and tear and it will be further noted
that in accordance with certain theories which will be noticed later
on it is not invariable when its orientation is changed
for the moment however the need of any change in the definition of
the unit is in no way felt we must on the contrary hope that the
use of the unit adopted by the physicists of the whole world will
spread more and more it is right to remark that a few errors still
occur with regard to this unit and that these errors have been
facilitated by incoherent legislation france herself though she was
the admirable initiator of the metrical system has for too long
allowed a very regrettable confusion to exist and it cannot be noted
without a certain sadness that it was not until the 11th july 1903
that a law was promulgated reestablishing the agreement between the
legal and the scientific definition of the metre
perhaps it may not be useless to briefly indicate here the reasons of
the disagreement which had taken place two definitions of the metre
can be and in fact were given one had for its basis the dimensions
of the earth the other the length of the material standard in the
minds of the founders of the metrical system the first of these was
the true definition of the unit of length the second merely a simple
representation it was admitted however that this representation had
been constructed in a manner perfect enough for it to be nearly
impossible to perceive any difference between the unit and its
representation and for the practical identity of the two definitions
to be thus assured the creators of the metrical system were persuaded
that the measurements of the meridian effected in their day could
never be surpassed in precision and on the other hand by borrowing
from nature a definite basis they thought to take from the definition
of the unit some of its arbitrary character and to ensure the means
of again finding the same unit if by any accident the standard became
altered their confidence in the value of the processes they had seen
employed was exaggerated and their mistrust of the future
unjustified this example shows how imprudent it is to endeavour to
fix limits to progress it is an error to think the march of science
can be stayed and in reality it is now known that the tenmillionth
part of the quarter of the terrestrial meridian is longer than the
metre by 0187 millimetres but contemporary physicists do not fall
into the same error as their forerunners and they regard the present
result as merely provisional they guess in fact that new
improvements will be effected in the art of measurement they know
that geodesical processes though much improved in our days have
still much to do to attain the precision displayed in the construction
and determination of standards of the first order and consequently
they do not propose to keep the ancient definition which would lead
to having for unit a magnitude possessing the grave defect from a
practical point of view of being constantly variable
we may even consider that looked at theoretically its permanence
would not be assured nothing in fact proves that sensible
variations may not in time be produced in the value of an arc of the
meridian and serious difficulties may arise regarding the probable
inequality of the various meridians
for all these reasons the idea of finding a natural unit has been
gradually abandoned and we have become resigned to accepting as a
fundamental unit an arbitrary and conventional length having a
material representation recognised by universal consent and it was
this unit which was consecrated by the following law of the 11th july
1903
the standard prototype of the metrical system is the international
metre which has been sanctioned by the general conference on weights
and measures
 3 the measure of mass
on the subject of measures of mass similar remarks to those on
measures of length might be made the confusion here was perhaps still
greater because to the uncertainty relating to the fixing of the
unit was added some indecision on the very nature of the magnitude
defined in law as in ordinary practice the notions of weight and of
mass were not in fact separated with sufficient clearness
they represent however two essentially different things mass is the
characteristic of a quantity of matter it depends neither on the
geographical position one occupies nor on the altitude to which one
may rise it remains invariable so long as nothing material is added
or taken away weight is the action which gravity has upon the body
under consideration this action does not depend solely on the body
but on the earth as well and when it is changed from one spot to
another the weight changes because gravity varies with latitude and
altitude
these elementary notions today understood even by young beginners
appear to have been for a long time indistinctly grasped the
distinction remained confused in many minds because for the most
part masses were comparatively estimated by the intermediary of
weights the estimations of weight made with the balance utilize the
action of the weight on the beam but in such conditions that the
influence of the variations of gravity becomes eliminated the two
weights which are being compared may both of them change if the
weighing is effected in different places but they are attracted in
the same proportion if once equal they remain equal even when in
reality they may both have varied
the current law defines the kilogramme as the standard of mass and
the law is certainly in conformity with the rather obscurely expressed
intentions of the founders of the metrical system their terminology
was vague but they certainly had in view the supply of a standard for
commercial transactions and it is quite evident that in barter what
is important to the buyer as well as to the seller is not the
attraction the earth may exercise on the goods but the quantity that
may be supplied for a given price besides the fact that the founders
abstained from indicating any specified spot in the definition of the
kilogramme when they were perfectly acquainted with the considerable
variations in the intensity of gravity leaves no doubt as to their
real desire
the same objections have been made to the definition of the
kilogramme at first considered as the mass of a cubic decimetre of
water at 4 c as to the first definition of the metre we must
admire the incredible precision attained at the outset by the
physicists who made the initial determinations but we know at the
present day that the kilogramme they constructed is slightly too heavy
by about 125000 very remarkable researches have been carried out
with regard to this determination by the international bureau and by
mm mac de lpinay and buisson the law of the 11th july 1903 has
definitely regularized the custom which physicists had adopted some
years before and the standard of mass the legal prototype of the
metrical system is now the international kilogramme sanctioned by the
conference of weights and measures
the comparison of a mass with the standard is effected with a
precision to which no other measurement can attain metrology vouches
for the hundredth of a milligramme in a kilogramme that is to say
that it estimates the hundredmillionth part of the magnitude studied
we mayas in the case of the lengthsask ourselves whether this
already admirable precision can be surpassed and progress would seem
likely to be slow for difficulties singularly increase when we get to
such small quantities but it is permitted to hope that the physicists
of the future will do still better than those of today and perhaps
we may catch a glimpse of the time when we shall begin to observe that
the standard which is constructed from a heavy metal namely
iridiumplatinum itself obeys an apparently general law and little
by little loses some particles of its mass by emanation
 4 the measure of time
the third fundamental magnitude of mechanics is time there is so to
speak no physical phenomenon in which the notion of time linked to
the sequence of our states of consciousness does not play a
considerable part
ancestral habits and a very early tradition have led us to preserve
as the unit of time a unit connected with the earths movement and
the unit today adopted is as we know the sexagesimal second of mean
time this magnitude thus defined by the conditions of a natural
motion which may itself be modified does not seem to offer all the
guarantees desirable from the point of view of invariability it is
certain that all the friction exercised on the earthby the tides
for instancemust slowly lengthen the duration of the day and must
influence the movement of the earth round the sun such influence is
certainly very slight but it nevertheless gives an unfortunately
arbitrary character to the unit adopted
we might have taken as the standard of time the duration of another
natural phenomenon which appears to be always reproduced under
identical conditions the duration for instance of a given luminous
vibration but the experimental difficulties of evaluation with such a
unit of the times which ordinarily have to be considered would be so
great that such a reform in practice cannot be hoped for it should
moreover be remarked that the duration of a vibration may itself be
influenced by external circumstances among which are the variations
of the magnetic field in which its source is placed it could not
therefore be strictly considered as independent of the earth and the
theoretical advantage which might be expected from this alteration
would be somewhat illusory
perhaps in the future recourse may be had to very different phenomena
thus curie pointed out that if the air inside a glass tube has been
rendered radioactive by a solution of radium the tube may be sealed
up and it will then be noted that the radiation of its walls
diminishes with time in accordance with an exponential law the
constant of time derived by this phenomenon remains the same whatever
the nature and dimensions of the walls of the tube or the temperature
may be and time might thus be denned independently of all the other
units
we might also as m lippmann has suggested in an extremely ingenious
way decide to obtain measures of time which can be considered as
absolute because they are determined by parameters of another nature
than that of the magnitude to be measured such experiments are made
possible by the phenomena of gravitation we could employ for
instance the pendulum by adopting as the unit of force the force
which renders the constant of gravitation equal to unity the unit of
time thus defined would be independent of the unit of length and
would depend only on the substance which would give us the unit of
mass under the unit of volume
it would be equally possible to utilize electrical phenomena and one
might devise experiments perfectly easy of execution thus by
charging a condenser by means of a battery and discharging it a given
number of times in a given interval of time so that the effect of the
current of discharge should be the same as the effect of the output of
the battery through a given resistance we could estimate by the
measurement of the electrical magnitudes the duration of the interval
noted a system of this kind must not be looked upon as a simple jeu
desprit since this very practicable experiment would easily permit
us to check with a precision which could be carried very far the
constancy of an interval of time
from the practical point of view chronometry has made in these last
few years very sensible progress the errors in the movements of
chronometers are corrected in a much more systematic way than
formerly and certain inventions have enabled important improvements
to be effected in the construction of these instruments thus the
curious properties which steel combined with nickelso admirably
studied by mched guillaumeexhibits in the matter of dilatation
are now utilized so as to almost completely annihilate the influence
of variations of temperature
 5 the measure of temperature
from the three mechanical units we derive secondary units as for
instance the unit of work or mechanical energy the kinetic theory
takes temperature as well as heat itself to be a quantity of energy
and thus seems to connect this notion with the magnitudes of
mechanics but the legitimacy of this theory cannot be admitted and
the calorific movement should also be a phenomenon so strictly
confined in space that our most delicate means of investigation would
not enable us to perceive it it is better then to continue to
regard the unit of difference of temperature as a distinct unit to be
added to the fundamental units
to define the measure of a certain temperature we take in practice
some arbitrary property of a body the only necessary condition of
this property is that it should constantly vary in the same direction
when the temperature rises and that it should possess at any
temperature a wellmarked value we measure this value by melting ice
and by the vapour of boiling water under normal pressure and the
successive hundredths of its variation beginning with the melting
ice defines the percentage thermodynamics however has made it
plain that we can set up a thermometric scale without relying upon any
determined property of a real body such a scale has an absolute value
independently of the properties of matter now it happens that if we
make use for the estimation of temperatures of the phenomena of
dilatation under a constant pressure or of the increase of pressure
in a constant volume of a gaseous body we obtain a scale very near
the absolute which almost coincides with it when the gas possesses
certain qualities which make it nearly what is called a perfect gas
this most lucky coincidence has decided the choice of the convention
adopted by physicists they define normal temperature by means of the
variations of pressure in a mass of hydrogen beginning with the
initial pressure of a metre of mercury at 0 c
mp chappuis in some very precise experiments conducted with much
method has proved that at ordinary temperatures the indications of
such a thermometer are so close to the degrees of the theoretical
scale that it is almost impossible to ascertain the value of the
divergences or even the direction that they take the divergence
becomes however manifest when we work with extreme temperatures it
results from the useful researches of m daniel berthelot that we must
subtract 018 from the indications of the hydrogen thermometer
towards the temperature 240 c and add 005 to 1000 to equate
them with the thermodynamic scale of course the difference would
also become still more noticeable on getting nearer to the absolute
zero for as hydrogen gets more and more cooled it gradually exhibits
in a lesser degree the characteristics of a perfect gas
to study the lower regions which border on that kind of pole of cold
towards which are straining the efforts of the many physicists who
have of late years succeeded in getting a few degrees further forward
we may turn to a gas still more difficult to liquefy than hydrogen
thus thermometers have been made of helium and from the temperature
of 260 c downward the divergence of such a thermometer from one of
hydrogen is very marked
the measurement of very high temperatures is not open to the same
theoretical objections as that of very low temperatures but from a
practical point of view it is as difficult to effect with an ordinary
gas thermometer it becomes impossible to guarantee the reservoir
remaining sufficiently impermeable and all security disappears
notwithstanding the use of recipients very superior to those of former
times such as those lately devised by the physicists of the
reichansalt this difficulty is obviated by using other methods
such as the employment of thermoelectric couples such as the very
convenient couple of m le chatelier but the graduation of these
instruments can only be effected at the cost of a rather bold
extrapolation
md berthelot has pointed out and experimented with a very
interesting process founded on the measurement by the phenomena of
interference of the refractive index of a column of air subjected to
the temperature it is desired to measure it appears admissible that
even at the highest temperatures the variation of the power of
refraction is strictly proportional to that of the density for this
proportion is exactly verified so long as it is possible to check it
precisely we can thus by a method which offers the great advantage
of being independent of the power and dimension of the envelopes
employedsince the length of the column of air considered alone
enters into the calculationobtain results equivalent to those given
by the ordinary air thermometer
another method very old in principle has also lately acquired great
importance for a long time we sought to estimate the temperature of a
body by studying its radiation but we did not know any positive
relation between this radiation and the temperature and we had no
good experimental method of estimation but had recourse to purely
empirical formulas and the use of apparatus of little precision now
however many physicists continuing the classic researches of
kirchhoff boltzmann professors wien and planck and taking their
startingpoint from the laws of thermodynamics have given formulas
which establish the radiating power of a dark body as a function of
the temperature and the wavelength or better still of the total
power as a function of the temperature and wavelength corresponding
to the maximum value of the power of radiation we see therefore the
possibility of appealing for the measurement of temperature to a
phenomenon which is no longer the variation of the elastic force of a
gas and yet is also connected with the principles of thermodynamics
this is what professors lummer and pringsheim have shown in a series
of studies which may certainly be reckoned among the greatest
experimental researches of the last few years they have constructed a
radiator closely resembling the theoretically integral radiator which
a closed isothermal vessel would be and with only a very small
opening which allows us to collect from outside the radiations which
are in equilibrium with the interior this vessel is formed of a
hollow carbon cylinder heated by a current of high intensity the
radiations are studied by means of a bolometer the disposition of
which varies with the nature of the experiments
it is hardly possible to enter into the details of the method but the
result sufficiently indicates its importance it is now possible
thanks to their researches to estimate a temperature of 2000 c to
within about 5 ten years ago a similar approximation could hardly
have been arrived at for a temperature of 1000 c
 6 derived units and the measure of a quantity of energy
it must be understood that it is only by arbitrary convention that a
dependency is established between a derived unit and the fundamental
units the laws of numbers in physics are often only laws of
proportion we transform them into laws of equation because we
introduce numerical coefficients and choose the units on which they
depend so as to simplify as much as possible the formulas most in use
a particular speed for instance is in reality nothing else but a
speed and it is only by the peculiar choice of unit that we can say
that it is the space covered during the unit of time in the same way
a quantity of electricity is a quantity of electricity and there is
nothing to prove that in its essence it is really reducible to a
function of mass of length and of time
persons are still to be met with who seem to have some illusions on
this point and who see in the doctrine of the dimensions of the units
a doctrine of general physics while it is to say truth only a
doctrine of metrology the knowledge of dimensions is valuable since
it allows us for instance to easily verify the homogeneity of a
formula but it can in no way give us any information on the actual
nature of the quantity measured
magnitudes to which we attribute like dimensions may be qualitatively
irreducible one to the other thus the different forms of energy are
measured by the same unit and yet it seems that some of them such as
kinetic energy really depend on time while for others such as
potential energy the dependency established by the system of
measurement seems somewhat fictitious
the numerical value of a quantity of energy of any nature should in
the system cgs be expressed in terms of the unit called the erg
but as a matter of fact when we wish to compare and measure
different quantities of energy of varying forms such as electrical
chemical and other quantities etc we nearly always employ a method
by which all these energies are finally transformed and used to heat
the water of a calorimeter it is therefore very important to study
well the calorific phenomenon chosen as the unit of heat and to
determine with precision its mechanical equivalent that is to say
the number of ergs necessary to produce this unit this is a number
which on the principle of equivalence depends neither on the method
employed nor the time nor any other external circumstance
as the result of the brilliant researches of rowland and of mr
griffiths on the variations of the specific heat of water physicists
have decided to take as calorific standard the quantity of heat
necessary to raise a gramme of water from 15 to 16 c the
temperature being measured by the scale of the hydrogen thermometer of
the international bureau
on the other hand new determinations of the mechanical equivalent
among which it is right to mention that of mr ames and a full
discussion as to the best results have led to the adoption of the
number 4187 to represent the number of ergs capable of producing the
unit of heat
in practice the measurement of a quantity of heat is very often
effected by means of the ice calorimeter the use of which is
particularly simple and convenient there is therefore a very
special interest in knowing exactly the meltingpoint of ice m
leduc who for several years has measured a great number of physical
constants with minute precautions and a remarkable sense of precision
concludes after a close discussion of the various results obtained
that this heat is equal to 791 calories an error of almost a calorie
had been committed by several renowned experimenters and it will be
seen that in certain points the art of measurement may still be
largely perfected
to the unit of energy might be immediately attached other units for
instance radiation being nothing but a flux of energy we could in
order to establish photometric units divide the normal spectrum into
bands of a given width and measure the power of each for the unit of
radiating surface
but notwithstanding some recent researches on this question we
cannot yet consider the distribution of energy in the spectrum as
perfectly known if we adopt the excellent habit which exists in some
researches of expressing radiating energy in ergs it is still
customary to bring the radiations to a standard giving by its
constitution alone the unit of one particular radiation in
particular the definitions are still adhered to which were adopted as
the result of the researches of m violle on the radiation of fused
platinum at the temperature of solidification and most physicists
utilize in the ordinary methods of photometry the clearly defined
notions of m blondel as to the luminous intensity of flux

 7 measure of certain physical constants
the progress of metrology has led as a consequence to corresponding
progress in nearly all physical measurements and particularly in the
measure of natural constants among these the constant of gravitation
occupies a position quite apart from the importance and simplicity of
the physical law which defines it as well as by its generality two
material particles are mutually attracted to each other by a force
directly proportional to the product of their mass and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between them the
coefficient of proportion is determined when once the units are
chosen and as soon as we know the numerical values of this force of
the two masses and of their distance but when we wish to make
laboratory experiments serious difficulties appear owing to the
weakness of the attraction between masses of ordinary dimensions
microscopic forces so to speak have to be observed and therefore
all the causes of errors have to be avoided which would be unimportant
in most other physical researches it is known that cavendish was the
first who succeeded by means of the torsion balance in effecting
fairly precise measurements this method has been again taken in hand
by different experimenters and the most recent results are due to mr
vernon boys this learned physicist is also the author of a most
useful practical invention and has succeeded in making quartz threads
as fine as can be desired and extremely uniform he finds that these
threads possess valuable properties such as perfect elasticity and
great tenacity he has been able with threads not more than 1500 of
a millimetre in diameter to measure with precision couples of an
order formerly considered outside the range of experiment and to
reduce the dimensions of the apparatus of cavendish in the proportion
of 150 to 1 the great advantage found in the use of these small
instruments is the better avoidance of the perturbations arising from
draughts of air and of the very serious influence of the slightest
inequality in temperature
other methods have been employed in late years by other experimenters
such as the method of baron etvs founded on the use of a torsion
lever the method of the ordinary balance used especially by
professors richarz and krigarmenzel and also by professor poynting
and the method of m wilsing who uses a balance with a vertical beam
the results fairly agree and lead to attributing to the earth a
density equal to 5527
the most familiar manifestation of gravitation is gravity the action
of the earth on the unit of mass placed in one point and the
intensity of gravity is measured as we know by the aid of a
pendulum the methods of measurement whether by absolute or by
relative determinations so greatly improved by borda and bessel have
been still further improved by various geodesians among whom should
be mentioned m von sterneek and general defforges numerous
observations have been made in all parts of the world by various
explorers and have led to a fairly complete knowledge of the
distribution of gravity over the surface of the globe thus we have
succeeded in making evident anomalies which would not easily find
their place in the formula of clairaut
another constant the determination of which is of the greatest
utility in astronomy of position and the value of which enters into
electromagnetic theory has today assumed with the new ideas on the
constitution of matter a still more considerable importance i refer
to the speed of light which appears to us as we shall see further
on the maximum value of speed which can be given to a material body
after the historical experiments of fizeau and foucault taken up
afresh as we know partly by cornu and partly by michelson and
newcomb it remained still possible to increase the precision of the
measurements professor michelson has undertaken some new researches
by a method which is a combination of the principle of the toothed
wheel of fizeau with the revolving mirror of foucault the toothed
wheel is here replaced however by a grating in which the lines and
the spaces between them take the place of the teeth and the gaps the
reflected light only being returned when it strikes on the space
between two lines the illustrious american physicist estimates that
he can thus evaluate to nearly five kilometres the path traversed by
light in one second this approximation corresponds to a relative
value of a few hundredthousandths and it far exceeds those hitherto
attained by the best experimenters when all the experiments are
completed they will perhaps solve certain questions still in
suspense for instance the question whether the speed of propagation
depends on intensity if this turns out to be the case we should be
brought to the important conclusion that the amplitude of the
oscillations which is certainly very small in relation to the already
tiny wavelengths cannot be considered as unimportant in regard to
these lengths such would seem to have been the result of the curious
experiments of m muller and of m ebert but these results have been
recently disputed by m doubt
in the case of sound vibrations on the other hand it should be noted
that experiment consistently with the theory proves that the speed
increases with the amplitude or if you will with the intensity m
violle has published an important series of experiments on the speed
of propagation of very condensed waves on the deformations of these
waves and on the relations of the speed and the pressure which
verify in a remarkable manner the results foreshadowed by the already
old calculations of riemann repeated later by hugoniot if on the
contrary the amplitude is sufficiently small there exists a speed
limit which is the same in a large pipe and in free air by some
beautiful experiments mm violle and vautier have clearly shown that
any disturbance in the air melts somewhat quickly into a single wave
of given form which is propagated to a distance while gradually
becoming weaker and showing a constant speed which differs little in
dry air at 0 c from 33136 metres per second in a narrow pipe the
influence of the walls makes itself felt and produces various effects
in particular a kind of dispersion in space of the harmonics of the
sound this phenomenon according to m brillouin is perfectly
explicable by a theory similar to the theory of gratings
chapter iii
principles
 1 the principles of physics
facts conscientiously observed lead by induction to the enunciation of
a certain number of laws or general hypotheses which are the
principles already referred to these principal hypotheses are in the
eyes of a physicist legitimate generalizations the consequences of
which we shall be able at once to check by the experiments from which
they issue
among the principles almost universally adopted until lately figure
prominently those of mechanicssuch as the principle of relativity
and the principle of the equality of action and reaction we will not
detail nor discuss them here but later on we shall have an
opportunity of pointing out how recent theories on the phenomena of
electricity have shaken the confidence of physicists in them and have
led certain scholars to doubt their absolute value
the principle of lavoisier or principle of the conservation of mass
presents itself under two different aspects according to whether mass
is looked upon as the coefficient of the inertia of matter or as the
factor which intervenes in the phenomena of universal attraction and
particularly in gravitation we shall see when we treat of these
theories how we have been led to suppose that inertia depended on
velocity and even on direction if this conception were exact the
principle of the invariability of mass would naturally be destroyed
considered as a factor of attraction is mass really indestructible
a few years ago such a question would have seemed singularly
audacious and yet the law of lavoisier is so far from selfevident
that for centuries it escaped the notice of physicists and chemists
but its great apparent simplicity and its high character of
generality when enunciated at the end of the eighteenth century
rapidly gave it such an authority that no one was able to any longer
dispute it unless he desired the reputation of an oddity inclined to
paradoxical ideas
it is important however to remark that under fallacious
metaphysical appearances we are in reality using empty words
when we repeat the aphorism nothing can be lost nothing can be
created and deduce from it the indestructibility of matter this
indestructibility in truth is an experimental fact and the
principle depends on experiment it may even seem at first sight
more singular than not that the weight of a bodily system in a given
place or the quotient of this weight by that of the standard
massthat is to say the mass of these bodiesremains invariable
both when the temperature changes and when chemical reagents cause the
original materials to disappear and to be replaced by new ones we may
certainly consider that in a chemical phenomenon annihilations and
creations of matter are really produced but the experimental law
teaches us that there is compensation in certain respects
the discovery of the radioactive bodies has in some sort rendered
popular the speculations of physicists on the phenomena of the
disaggregation of matter we shall have to seek the exact meaning
which ought to be given to the experiments on the emanation of these
bodies and to discover whether these experiments really imperil the
law of lavoisier
for some years different experimenters have also effected many very
precise measurements of the weight of divers bodies both before and
after chemical reactions between these bodies two highly experienced
and cautious physicists professors landolt and heydweiller have not
hesitated to announce the sensational result that in certain
circumstances the weight is no longer the same after as before the
reaction in particular the weight of a solution of salts of copper
in water is not the exact sum of the joint weights of the salt and the
water such experiments are evidently very delicate they have been
disputed and they cannot be considered as sufficient for conviction
it follows nevertheless that it is no longer forbidden to regard the
law of lavoisier as only an approximate law according to sandford and
ray this approximation would be about 12400000 this is also the
result reached by professor poynting in experiments regarding the
possible action of temperature on the weight of a body and if this be
really so we may reassure ourselves and from the point of view of
practical application may continue to look upon matter as
indestructible
the principles of physics by imposing certain conditions on
phenomena limit after a fashion the field of the possible among
these principles is one which notwithstanding its importance when
compared with that of universally known principles is less familiar
to some people this is the principle of symmetry more or less
conscious applications of which can no doubt be found in various
works and even in the conceptions of copernican astronomers but which
was generalized and clearly enunciated for the first time by the late
m curie this illustrious physicist pointed out the advantage of
introducing into the study of physical phenomena the considerations on
symmetry familiar to crystallographers for a phenomenon to take
place it is necessary that a certain dissymmetry should previously
exist in the medium in which this phenomenon occurs a body for
instance may be animated with a certain linear velocity or a speed of
rotation it may be compressed or twisted it may be placed in an
electric or in a magnetic field it may be affected by an electric
current or by one of heat it may be traversed by a ray of light
either ordinary or polarized rectilineally or circularly etcin
each case a certain minimum and characteristic dissymmetry is
necessary at every point of the body in question
this consideration enables us to foresee that certain phenomena which
might be imagined a priori cannot exist thus for instance it is
impossible that an electric field a magnitude directed and not
superposable on its image in a mirror perpendicular to its direction
could be created at right angles to the plane of symmetry of the
medium while it would be possible to create a magnetic field under
the same conditions
this consideration thus leads us to the discovery of new phenomena
but it must be understood that it cannot of itself give us absolutely
precise notions as to the nature of these phenomena nor disclose
their order of magnitude
 2 the principle of the conservation of energy
dominating not physics alone but nearly every other science the
principle of the conservation of energy is justly considered as the
grandest conquest of contemporary thought it shows us in a powerful
light the most diverse questions it introduces order into the most
varied studies it leads to a clear and coherent interpretation of
phenomena which without it appear to have no connexion with each
other and it supplies precise and exact numerical relations between
the magnitudes which enter into these phenomena
the boldest minds have an instinctive confidence in it and it is the
principle which has most stoutly resisted that assault which the
daring of a few theorists has lately directed to the overthrow of the
general principles of physics at every new discovery the first
thought of physicists is to find out how it accords with the principle
of the conservation of energy the application of the principle
moreover never fails to give valuable hints on the new phenomenon
and often even suggests a complementary discovery up till now it
seems never to have received a check even the extraordinary
properties of radium not seriously contradicting it also the general
form in which it is enunciated gives it such a suppleness that it is
no doubt very difficult to overthrow
i do not claim to set forth here the complete history of this
principle but i will endeavour to show with what pains it was born
how it was kept back in its early days and then obstructed in its
development by the unfavourable conditions of the surroundings in
which it appeared it first of all came in fact to oppose itself to
the reigning theories but little by little it acted on these
theories and they were modified under its pressure then in their
turn these theories reacted on it and changed its primitive form
it had to be made less wide in order to fit into the classic frame
and was absorbed by mechanics and if it thus became less general it
gained in precision what it lost in extent when once definitely
admitted and classed as it were in the official domain of science
it endeavoured to burst its bonds and return to a more independent and
larger life the history of this principle is similar to that of all
evolutions
it is well known that the conservation of energy was at first
regarded from the point of view of the reciprocal transformations
between heat and work and that the principle received its first clear
enunciation in the particular case of the principle of equivalence it
is therefore rightly considered that the scholars who were the first
to doubt the material nature of caloric were the precursors of r
mayer their ideas however were the same as those of the celebrated
german doctor for they sought especially to demonstrate that heat was
a mode of motion
without going back to early and isolated attempts like those of daniel
bernoulli who in his hydrodynamics propounded the basis of the
kinetic theory of gases or the researches of boyle on friction we
may recall to show how it was propounded in former times a rather
forgotten page of the mmoire sur la chaleur published in 1780 by
lavoisier and laplace other physicists they wrote after setting
out the theory of caloric think that heat is nothing but the result
of the insensible vibrations of matter in the system we are now
examining heat is the vis viva resulting from the insensible
movements of the molecules of a body it is the sum of the products of
the mass of each molecule by the square of its velocity we shall
not decide between the two preceding hypotheses several phenomena
seem to support the last mentionedfor instance that of the heat
produced by the friction of two solid bodies but there are others
which are more simply explained by the first and perhaps they both
operate at once most of the physicists of that period however did
not share the prudent doubts of lavoisier and laplace they admitted
without hesitation the first hypothesis and four years after the
appearance of the mmoire sur la chaleur sigaud de lafond a
professor of physics of great reputation wrote pure fire free from
all state of combination seems to be an assembly of particles of a
simple homogeneous and absolutely unalterable matter and all the
properties of this element indicate that these particles are
infinitely small and free that they have no sensible cohesion and
that they are moved in every possible direction by a continual and
rapid motion which is essential to them the extreme tenacity and
the surprising mobility of its molecules are manifestly shown by the
ease with which it penetrates into the most compact bodies and by its
tendency to put itself in equilibrium throughout all bodies near to
it
it must be acknowledged however that the idea of lavoisier and
laplace was rather vague and even inexact on one important point they
admitted it to be evident that all variations of heat whether real
or apparent undergone by a bodily system when changing its state are
produced in inverse order when the system passes back to its original
state this phrase is the very denial of equivalence where these
changes of state are accompanied by external work
laplace moreover himself became later a very convinced partisan of
the hypothesis of the material nature of caloric and his immense
authority so fortunate in other respects for the development of
science was certainly in this case the cause of the retardation of
progress
the names of young rumford davy are often quoted among those
physicists who at the commencement of the nineteenth century caught
sight of the new truths as to the nature of heat to these names is
very properly added that of sadi carnot a note found among his papers
unquestionably proves that before 1830 ideas had occurred to him
from which it resulted that in producing work an equivalent amount of
heat was destroyed but the year 1842 is particularly memorable in the
history of science as the year in which jules robert mayer succeeded
by an entirely personal effort in really enunciating the principle of
the conservation of energy chemists recall with just pride that the
remarques sur les forces de la nature anime contemptuously
rejected by all the journals of physics were received and published
in the annalen of liebig we ought never to forget this example
which shows with what difficulty a new idea contrary to the classic
theories of the period succeeds in coming to the front but
extenuating circumstances may be urged on behalf of the physicists
robert mayer had a rather insufficient mathematical education and his
memoirs the remarques as well as the ulterior publications
mmoire sur le mouvement organique et la nutrition and the
matriaux pour la dynamique du ciel contain side by side with very
profound ideas evident errors in mechanics thus it often happens
that discoveries put forward in a somewhat vague manner by adventurous
minds not overburdened by the heavy baggage of scientific erudition
who audaciously press forward in advance of their time fall into
quite intelligible oblivion until rediscovered clarified and put
into shape by slower but surer seekers this was the case with the
ideas of mayer they were not understood at first sight not only on
account of their originality but also because they were couched in
incorrect language
mayer was however endowed with a singular strength of thought he
expressed in a rather confused manner a principle which for him had
a generality greater than mechanics itself and so his discovery was
in advance not only of his own time but of half the century he may
justly be considered the founder of modern energetics
freed from the obscurities which prevented its being clearly
perceived his idea stands out today in all its imposing simplicity
yet it must be acknowledged that if it was somewhat denaturalised by
those who endeavoured to adapt it to the theories of mechanics and if
it at first lost its sublime stamp of generality it thus became
firmly fixed and consolidated on a more stable basis
the efforts of helmholtz clausius and lord kelvin to introduce the
principle of the conservation of energy into mechanics were far from
useless these illustrious physicists succeeded in giving a more
precise form to its numerous applications and their attempts thus
contributed by reaction to give a fresh impulse to mechanics and
allowed it to be linked to a more general order of facts if
energetics has not been able to be included in mechanics it seems
indeed that the attempt to include mechanics in energetics was not in
vain
in the middle of the last century the explanation of all natural
phenomena seemed more and more referable to the case of central
forces everywhere it was thought that reciprocal actions between
material points could be perceived these points being attracted or
repelled by each other with an intensity depending only on their
distance or their mass if to a system thus composed the laws of the
classical mechanics are applied it is shown that half the sum of the
product of the masses by the square of the velocities to which is
added the work which might be accomplished by the forces to which the
system would be subject if it returned from its actual to its initial
position is a sum constant in quantity
this sum which is the mechanical energy of the system is therefore
an invariable quantity in all the states to which it may be brought by
the interaction of its various parts and the word energy well
expresses a capital property of this quantity for if two systems are
connected in such a way that any change produced in the one
necessarily brings about a change in the other there can be no
variation in the characteristic quantity of the second except so far
as the characteristic quantity of the first itself varieson
condition of course that the connexions are made in such a manner as
to introduce no new force it will thus be seen that this quantity
well expresses the capacity possessed by a system for modifying the
state of a neighbouring system to which we may suppose it connected
now this theorem of pure mechanics was found wanting every time
friction took placethat is to say in all really observable cases
the more perceptible the friction the more considerable the
difference but in addition a new phenomenon always appeared and
heat was produced by experiments which are now classic it became
established that the quantity of heat thus created independently of
the nature of the bodies is always provided no other phenomena
intervene proportional to the energy which has disappeared
reciprocally also heat may disappear and we always find a constant
relation between the quantities of heat and work which mutually
replace each other
it is quite clear that such experiments do not prove that heat is
work we might just as well say that work is heat it is making a
gratuitous hypothesis to admit this reduction of heat to mechanism
but this hypothesis was so seductive and so much in conformity with
the desire of nearly all physicists to arrive at some sort of unity in
nature that they made it with eagerness and became unreservedly
convinced that heat was an active internal force
their error was not in admitting this hypothesis it was a legitimate
one since it has proved very fruitful but some of them committed the
fault of forgetting that it was an hypothesis and considered it a
demonstrated truth moreover they were thus brought to see in
phenomena nothing but these two particular forms of energy which in
their minds were easily identified with each other
from the outset however it became manifest that the principle is
applicable to cases where heat plays only a parasitical part there
were thus discovered by translating the principle of equivalence
numerical relations between the magnitudes of electricity for
instance and the magnitudes of mechanics heat was a sort of variable
intermediary convenient for calculation but introduced in a
roundabout way and destined to disappear in the final result
verdet who in lectures which have rightly remained celebrated
defined with remarkable clearness the new theories said in 1862
electrical phenomena are always accompanied by calorific
manifestations of which the study belongs to the mechanical theory of
heat this study moreover will not only have the effect of making
known to us interesting facts in electricity but will throw some
light on the phenomena of electricity themselves
the eminent professor was thus expressing the general opinion of his
contemporaries but he certainly seemed to have felt in advance that
the new theory was about to penetrate more deeply into the inmost
nature of things three years previously rankine also had put forth
some very remarkable ideas the full meaning of which was not at first
well understood he it was who comprehended the utility of employing a
more inclusive term and invented the phrase energetics he also
endeavoured to create a new doctrine of which rational mechanics
should be only a particular case and he showed that it was possible
to abandon the ideas of atoms and central forces and to construct a
more general system by substituting for the ordinary consideration of
forces that of the energy which exists in all bodies partly in an
actual partly in a potential state
by giving more precision to the conceptions of rankine the physicists
of the end of the nineteenth century were brought to consider that in
all physical phenomena there occur apparitions and disappearances
which are balanced by various energies it is natural however to
suppose that these equivalent apparitions and disappearances
correspond to transformations and not to simultaneous creations and
destructions we thus represent energy to ourselves as taking
different formsmechanical electrical calorific and chemical
capable of changing one into the other but in such a way that the
quantitative value always remains the same in like manner a bank
draft may be represented by notes gold silver or bullion the
earliest known form of energy ie work will serve as the standard
as gold serves as the monetary standard and energy in all its forms
will be estimated by the corresponding work in each particular case
we can strictly define and measure by the correct application of the
principle of the conservation of energy the quantity of energy
evolved under a given form
we can thus arrange a machine comprising a body capable of evolving
this energy then we can force all the organs of this machine to
complete an entirely closed cycle with the exception of the body
itself which however has to return to such a state that all the
variables from which this state depends resume their initial values
except the particular variable to which the evolution of the energy
under consideration is linked the difference between the work thus
accomplished and that which would have been obtained if this variable
also had returned to its original value is the measure of the energy
evolved
in the same way that in the minds of mechanicians all forces of
whatever origin which are capable of compounding with each other and
of balancing each other belong to the same category of beings so for
many physicists energy is a sort of entity which we find under various
aspects there thus exists for them a world which comes in some way
to superpose itself upon the world of matterthat is to say the
world of energy dominated in its turn by a fundamental law similar to
that of lavoisier5 this conception as we have already seen passes
the limit of experience but others go further still absorbed in the
contemplation of this new world they succeed in persuading themselves
that the old world of matter has no real existence and that energy is
sufficient by itself to give us a complete comprehension of the
universe and of all the phenomena produced in it they point out that
all our sensations correspond to changes of energy and that
everything apparent to our senses is in truth energy the famous
experiment of the blows with a stick by which it was demonstrated to a
sceptical philosopher that an outer world existed only proves in
reality the existence of energy and not that of matter the stick in
itself is inoffensive as professor ostwald remarks and it is its
vis viva its kinetic energy which is painful to us while if we
possessed a speed equal to its own moving in the same direction it
would no longer exist so far as our sense of touch is concerned
footnote 5 nothing is created nothing is losted
on this hypothesis matter would only be the capacity for kinetic
energy its pretended impenetrability energy of volume and its weight
energy of position in the particular form which presents itself in
universal gravitation nay space itself would only be known to us by
the expenditure of energy necessary to penetrate it thus in all
physical phenomena we should only have to regard the quantities of
energy brought into play and all the equations which link the
phenomena to one another would have no meaning but when they apply to
exchanges of energy for energy alone can be common to all phenomena
this extreme manner of regarding things is seductive by its
originality but appears somewhat insufficient if after enunciating
generalities we look more closely into the question from the
philosophical point of view it may moreover seem difficult not to
conclude from the qualities which reveal if you will the varied
forms of energy that there exists a substance possessing these
qualities this energy which resides in one region and which
transports itself from one spot to another forcibly brings to mind
whatever view we may take of it the idea of matter
helmholtz endeavoured to construct a mechanics based on the idea of
energy and its conservation but he had to invoke a second law the
principle of least action if he thus succeeded in dispensing with the
hypothesis of atoms and in showing that the new mechanics gave us to
understand the impossibility of certain movements which according to
the old ought to have been but never were experimentally produced he
was only able to do so because the principle of least action necessary
for his theory became evident in the case of those irreversible
phenomena which alone really exist in nature the energetists have
thus not succeeded in forming a thoroughly sound system but their
efforts have at all events been partly successful most physicists are
of their opinion that kinetic energy is only a particular variety of
energy to which we have no right to wish to connect all its other
forms
if these forms showed themselves to be innumerable throughout the
universe the principle of the conservation of energy would in fact
lose a great part of its importance every time that a certain
quantity of energy seemed to appear or disappear it would always be
permissible to suppose that an equivalent quantity had appeared or
disappeared somewhere else under a new form and thus the principle
would in a way vanish but the known forms of energy are fairly
restricted in number and the necessity of recognising new ones seldom
makes itself felt we shall see however that to explain for
instance the paradoxical properties of radium and to reestablish
concord between these properties and the principle of the conservation
of energy certain physicists have recourse to the hypothesis that
radium borrows an unknown energy from the medium in which it is
plunged this hypothesis however is in no way necessary and in a
few other rare cases in which similar hypotheses have had to be set
up experiment has always in the long run enabled us to discover some
phenomenon which had escaped the first observers and which corresponds
exactly to the variation of energy first made evident
one difficulty however arises from the fact that the principle ought
only to be applied to an isolated system whether we imagine actions
at a distance or believe in intermediate media we must always
recognise that there exist no bodies in the world incapable of acting
on each other and we can never affirm that some modification in the
energy of a given place may not have its echo in some unknown spot
afar off this difficulty may sometimes render the value of the
principle rather illusory
similarly it behoves us not to receive without a certain distrust the
extension by certain philosophers to the whole universe of a property
demonstrated for those restricted systems which observation can alone
reach we know nothing of the universe as a whole and every
generalization of this kind outruns in a singular fashion the limit of
experiment
even reduced to the most modest proportions the principle of the
conservation of energy retains nevertheless a paramount importance
and it still preserves if you will a high philosophical value mj
perrin justly points out that it gives us a form under which we are
experimentally able to grasp causality and that it teaches us that a
result has to be purchased at the cost of a determined effort
we can in fact with m perrin and m langevin represent this in a
way which puts this characteristic in evidence by enunciating it as
follows if at the cost of a change c we can obtain a change k there
will never be acquired at the same cost whatever the mechanism
employed first the change k and in addition some other change unless
this latter be one that is otherwise known to cost nothing to produce
or to destroy if for instance the fall of a weight can be
accompanied without anything else being produced by another
transformationthe melting of a certain mass of ice for exampleit
will be impossible no matter how you set about it or whatever the
mechanism used to associate this same transformation with the melting
of another weight of ice
we can thus in the transformation in question obtain an appropriate
number which will sum up that which may be expected from the external
effect and can give so to speak the price at which this
transformation is bought measure its invariable value by a common
measure for instance the melting of the ice and without any
ambiguity define the energy lost during the transformation as
proportional to the mass of ice which can be associated with it this
measure is moreover independent of the particular phenomenon taken
as the common measure
 3 the principle of carnot and clausius
the principle of carnot of a nature analogous to the principle of the
conservation of energy has also a similar origin it was first
enunciated like the last named although prior to it in time in
consequence of considerations which deal only with heat and mechanical
work like it too it has evolved grown and invaded the entire
domain of physics it may be interesting to examine rapidly the
various phases of this evolution the origin of the principle of
carnot is clearly determined and it is very rare to be able to go
back thus certainly to the source of a discovery sadi carnot had
truth to say no precursor in his time heat engines were not yet very
common and no one had reflected much on their theory he was
doubtless the first to propound to himself certain questions and
certainly the first to solve them
it is known how in 1824 in his rflexions sur la puissance motrice
du feu he endeavoured to prove that the motive power of heat is
independent of the agents brought into play for its realization and
that its quantity is fixed solely by the temperature of the bodies
between which in the last resort the transport of caloric is
effectedat least in all engines in which the method of developing
the motive power attains the perfection of which it is capable and
this is almost textually one of the enunciations of the principle at
the present day carnot perceived very clearly the great fact that to
produce work by heat it is necessary to have at ones disposal a fall
of temperature on this point he expresses himself with perfect
clearness the motive power of a fall of water depends on its height
and on the quantity of liquid the motive power of heat depends also
on the quantity of caloric employed and on what might be calledin
fact what we shall callthe height of fall that is to say the
difference in temperature of the bodies between which the exchange of
caloric takes place
starting with this idea he endeavours to demonstrate by associating
two engines capable of working in a reversible cycle that the
principle is founded on the impossibility of perpetual motion
his memoir now celebrated did not produce any great sensation and
it had almost fallen into deep oblivion which in consequence of
the discovery of the principle of equivalence might have seemed
perfectly justified written in fact on the hypothesis of the
indestructibility of caloric it was to be expected that this memoir
should be condemned in the name of the new doctrine that is of the
principle recently brought to light
it was really making a new discovery to establish that carnots
fundamental idea survived the destruction of the hypothesis on the
nature of heat on which he seemed to rely as he no doubt himself
perceived his idea was quite independent of this hypothesis since
as we have seen he was led to surmise that heat could disappear but
his demonstrations needed to be recast and in some points modified
it is to clausius that was reserved the credit of rediscovering the
principle and of enunciating it in language conformable to the new
doctrines while giving it a much greater generality the postulate
arrived at by experimental induction and which must be admitted
without demonstration is according to clausius that in a series of
transformations in which the final is identical with the initial
stage it is impossible for heat to pass from a colder to a warmer
body unless some other accessory phenomenon occurs at the same time
still more correctly perhaps an enunciation can be given of the
postulate which in the main is analogous by saying a heat motor
which after a series of transformations returns to its initial state
can only furnish work if there exist at least two sources of heat and
if a certain quantity of heat is given to one of the sources which
can never be the hotter of the two by the expression source of
heat we mean a body exterior to the system and capable of furnishing
or withdrawing heat from it
starting with this principle we arrive as does clausius at the
demonstration that the output of a reversible machine working between
two given temperatures is greater than that of any nonreversible
engine and that it is the same for all reversible machines working
between these two temperatures
this is the very proposition of carnot but the proposition thus
stated while very useful for the theory of engines does not yet
present any very general interest clausius however drew from it
much more important consequences first he showed that the principle
conduces to the definition of an absolute scale of temperature and
then he was brought face to face with a new notion which allows a
strong light to be thrown on the questions of physical equilibrium i
refer to entropy
it is still rather difficult to strip entirely this very important
notion of all analytical adornment many physicists hesitate to
utilize it and even look upon it with some distrust because they see
in it a purely mathematical function without any definite physical
meaning perhaps they are here unduly severe since they often admit
too easily the objective existence of quantities which they cannot
define thus for instance it is usual almost every day to speak of
the heat possessed by a body yet no body in reality possesses a
definite quantity of heat even relatively to any initial state since
starting from this point of departure the quantities of heat it may
have gained or lost vary with the road taken and even with the means
employed to follow it these expressions of heat gained or lost are
moreover themselves evidently incorrect for heat can no longer be
considered as a sort of fluid passing from one body to another
the real reason which makes entropy somewhat mysterious is that this
magnitude does not fall directly under the ken of any of our senses
but it possesses the true characteristic of a concrete physical
magnitude since it is in principle at least measurable various
authors of thermodynamical researches amongst whom m mouret should
be particularly mentioned have endeavoured to place this
characteristic in evidence
consider an isothermal transformation instead of leaving the heat
abandoned by the body subjected to the transformationwater
condensing in a state of saturated vapour for instanceto pass
directly into an ice calorimeter we can transmit this heat to the
calorimeter by the intermediary of a reversible carnot engine the
engine having absorbed this quantity of heat will only give back to
the ice a lesser quantity of heat and the weight of the melted ice
inferior to that which might have been directly given back will serve
as a measure of the isothermal transformation thus effected it can be
easily shown that this measure is independent of the apparatus used
it consequently becomes a numerical element characteristic of the body
considered and is called its entropy entropy thus defined is a
variable which like pressure or volume might serve concurrently with
another variable such as pressure or volume to define the state of a
body
it must be perfectly understood that this variable can change in an
independent manner and that it is for instance distinct from the
change of temperature it is also distinct from the change which
consists in losses or gains of heat in chemical reactions for
example the entropy increases without the substances borrowing any
heat when a perfect gas dilates in a vacuum its entropy increases
and yet the temperature does not change and the gas has neither been
able to give nor receive heat we thus come to conceive that a
physical phenomenon cannot be considered known to us if the variation
of entropy is not given as are the variations of temperature and of
pressure or the exchanges of heat the change of entropy is properly
speaking the most characteristic fact of a thermal change
it is important however to remark that if we can thus easily define
and measure the difference of entropy between two states of the same
body the value found depends on the state arbitrarily chosen as the
zero point of entropy but this is not a very serious difficulty and
is analogous to that which occurs in the evaluation of other physical
magnitudestemperature potential etc
a graver difficulty proceeds from its not being possible to define a
difference or an equality of entropy between two bodies chemically
different we are unable in fact to pass by any means reversible or
not from one to the other so long as the transmutation of matter is
regarded as impossible but it is well understood that it is
nevertheless possible to compare the variations of entropy to which
these two bodies are both of them individually subject
neither must we conceal from ourselves that the definition supposes
for a given body the possibility of passing from one state to another
by a reversible transformation reversibility is an ideal and extreme
case which cannot be realized but which can be approximately attained
in many circumstances so with gases and with perfectly elastic
bodies we effect sensibly reversible transformations and changes
of physical state are practically reversible the discoveries of
sainteclaire deville have brought many chemical phenomena into a
similar category and reactions such as solution which used to be
formerly the type of an irreversible phenomenon may now often be
effected by sensibly reversible means be that as it may when once the
definition is admitted we arrive by taking as a basis the principles
set forth at the inception at the demonstration of the celebrated
theorem of clausius the entropy of a thermally isolated system
continues to increase incessantly
it is very evident that the theorem can only be worth applying in
cases where the entropy can be exactly defined but even when thus
limited the field still remains vast and the harvest which we can
there reap is very abundant
entropy appears then as a magnitude measuring in a certain way the
evolution of a system or at least as giving the direction of this
evolution this very important consequence certainly did not escape
clausius since the very name of entropy which he chose to designate
this magnitude itself signifies evolution we have succeeded in
defining this entropy by demonstrating as has been said a certain
number of propositions which spring from the postulate of clausius it
is therefore natural to suppose that this postulate itself contains
in potentia the very idea of a necessary evolution of physical
systems but as it was first enunciated it contains it in a deeply
hidden way
no doubt we should make the principle of carnot appear in an
interesting light by endeavouring to disengage this fundamental idea
and by placing it as it were in large letters just as in
elementary geometry we can replace the postulate of euclid by other
equivalent propositions so the postulate of thermodynamics is not
necessarily fixed and it is instructive to try to give it the most
general and suggestive character
mm perrin and langevin have made a successful attempt in this
direction m perrin enunciates the following principle an isolated
system never passes twice through the same state in this form the
principle affirms that there exists a necessary order in the
succession of two phenomena that evolution takes place in a
determined direction if you prefer it it may be thus stated of two
converse transformations unaccompanied by any external effect one
only is possible for instance two gases may diffuse themselves one
in the other in constant volume but they could not conversely
separate themselves spontaneously
starting from the principle thus put forward we make the logical
deduction that one cannot hope to construct an engine which should
work for an indefinite time by heating a hot source and by cooling a
cold one we thus come again into the route traced by clausius and
from this point we may follow it strictly
whatever the point of view adopted whether we regard the proposition
of m perrin as the corollary of another experimental postulate or
whether we consider it as a truth which we admit a priori and verify
through its consequences we are led to consider that in its entirety
the principle of carnot resolves itself into the idea that we cannot
go back along the course of life and that the evolution of a system
must follow its necessary progress
clausius and lord kelvin have drawn from these considerations certain
wellknown consequences on the evolution of the universe noticing
that entropy is a property added to matter they admit that there is
in the world a total amount of entropy and as all real changes which
are produced in any system correspond to an increase of entropy it
may be said that the entropy of the world is continually increasing
thus the quantity of energy existing in the universe remains constant
but transforms itself little by little into heat uniformly distributed
at a temperature everywhere identical in the end therefore there
will be neither chemical phenomena nor manifestation of life the
world will still exist but without motion and so to speak dead
these consequences must be admitted to be very doubtful we cannot in
any certain way apply to the universe which is not a finite system a
proposition demonstrated and that not unreservedly in the sharply
limited case of a finite system herbert spencer moreover in his
book on first principles brings out with much force the idea that
even if the universe came to an end nothing would allow us to
conclude that once at rest it would remain so indefinitely we may
recognise that the state in which we are began at the end of a former
evolutionary period and that the end of the existing era will mark
the beginning of a new one
like an elastic and mobile object which thrown into the air attains
by degrees the summit of its course then possesses a zero velocity
and is for a moment in equilibrium and then falls on touching the
ground to rebound so the world should be subjected to huge
oscillations which first bring it to a maximum of entropy till the
moment when there should be produced a slow evolution in the contrary
direction bringing it back to the state from which it started thus
in the infinity of time the life of the universe proceeds without
real stop
this conception is moreover in accordance with the view certain
physicists take of the principle of carnot we shall see for example
that in the kinetic theory we are led to admit that after waiting
sufficiently long we can witness the return of the various states
through which a mass of gas for example has passed in its series of
transformations
if we keep to the present era evolution has a fixed directionthat
which leads to an increase of entropy and it is possible to enquire
in any given system to what physical manifestations this increase
corresponds we note that kinetic potential electrical and chemical
forms of energy have a great tendency to transform themselves into
calorific energy a chemical reaction for example gives out energy
but if the reaction is not produced under very special conditions
this energy immediately passes into the calorific form this is so
true that chemists currently speak of the heat given out by reactions
instead of regarding the energy disengaged in general
in all these transformations the calorific energy obtained has not
from a practical point of view the same value at which it started
one cannot in fact according to the principle of carnot transform
it integrally into mechanical energy since the heat possessed by a
body can only yield work on condition that a part of it falls on a
body with a lower temperature thus appears the idea that energies
which exchange with each other and correspond to equal quantities have
not the same qualitative value form has its importance and there are
persons who prefer a golden louis to four pieces of five francs the
principle of carnot would thus lead us to consider a certain
classification of energies and would show us that in the
transformations possible these energies always tend to a sort of
diminution of qualitythat is to a degradation
it would thus reintroduce an element of differentiation of which it
seems very difficult to give a mechanical explanation certain
philosophers and physicists see in this fact a reason which condemns
a priori all attempts made to give a mechanical explanation of the
principle of carnot
it is right however not to exaggerate the importance that should be
attributed to the phrase degraded energy if the heat is not
equivalent to the work if heat at 99 is not equivalent to heat at
100 that means that we cannot in practice construct an engine which
shall transform all this heat into work or that for the same cold
source the output is greater when the temperature of the hot source
is higher but if it were possible that this cold source had itself
the temperature of absolute zero the whole heat would reappear in the
form of work the case here considered is an ideal and extreme case
and we naturally cannot realize it but this consideration suffices to
make it plain that the classification of energies is a little
arbitrary and depends more perhaps on the conditions in which
mankind lives than on the inmost nature of things
in fact the attempts which have often been made to refer the
principle of carnot to mechanics have not given convincing results it
has nearly always been necessary to introduce into the attempt some
new hypothesis independent of the fundamental hypotheses of ordinary
mechanics and equivalent in reality to one of the postulates on
which the ordinary exposition of the second law of thermodynamics is
founded helmholtz in a justly celebrated theory endeavoured to fit
the principle of carnot into the principle of least action but the
difficulties regarding the mechanical interpretation of the
irreversibility of physical phenomena remain entire looking at the
question however from the point of view at which the partisans of
the kinetic theories of matter place themselves the principle is
viewed in a new aspect gibbs and afterwards boltzmann and professor
planck have put forward some very interesting ideas on this subject
by following the route they have traced we come to consider the
principle as pointing out to us that a given system tends towards the
configuration presented by the maximum probability and numerically
the entropy would even be the logarithm of this probability thus two
different gaseous masses enclosed in two separate receptacles which
have just been placed in communication diffuse themselves one through
the other and it is highly improbable that in their mutual shocks
both kinds of molecules should take a distribution of velocities which
reduce them by a spontaneous phenomenon to the initial state
we should have to wait a very long time for so extraordinary a
concourse of circumstances but in strictness it would not be
impossible the principle would only be a law of probability yet this
probability is all the greater the more considerable is the number of
molecules itself in the phenomena habitually dealt with this number
is such that practically the variation of entropy in a constant
sense takes so to speak the character of absolute certainty
but there may be exceptional cases where the complexity of the system
becomes insufficient for the application of the principle of carnot
as in the case of the curious movements of small particles suspended
in a liquid which are known by the name of brownian movements and can
be observed under the microscope the agitation here really seems as
m gouy has remarked to be produced and continued indefinitely
regardless of any difference in temperature and we seem to witness
the incessant motion in an isothermal medium of the particles which
constitute matter perhaps however we find ourselves already in
conditions where the too great simplicity of the distribution of the
molecules deprives the principle of its value
m lippmann has in the same way shown that on the kinetic hypothesis
it is possible to construct such mechanisms that we can so take
cognizance of molecular movements that vis viva can be taken from
them the mechanisms of m lippmann are not like the celebrated
apparatus at one time devised by maxwell purely hypothetical they do
not suppose a partition with a hole impossible to be bored through
matter where the molecular spaces would be larger than the hole
itself they have finite dimensions thus m lippmann considers a vase
full of oxygen at a constant temperature in the interior of this vase
is placed a small copper ring and the whole is set in a magnetic
field the oxygen molecules are as we know magnetic and when
passing through the interior of the ring they produce in this ring an
induced current during this time it is true other molecules emerge
from the space enclosed by the circuit but the two effects do not
counterbalance each other and the resulting current is maintained
there is elevation of temperature in the circuit in accordance with
joules law and this phenomenon under such conditions is
incompatible with the principle of carnot
it is possibleand that i think is m lippmanns ideato draw from
his very ingenious criticism an objection to the kinetic theory if we
admit the absolute value of the principle but we may also suppose
that here again we are in presence of a system where the prescribed
conditions diminish the complexity and render it consequently less
probable that the evolution is always effected in the same direction
in whatever way you look at it the principle of carnot furnishes in
the immense majority of cases a very sure guide in which physicists
continue to have the most entire confidence
 4 thermodynamics
to apply the two fundamental principles of thermodynamics various
methods may be employed equivalent in the main but presenting as the
cases vary a greater or less convenience
in recording with the aid of the two quantities energy and entropy
the relations which translate analytically the two principles we
obtain two relations between the coefficients which occur in a given
phenomenon but it may be easier and also more suggestive to employ
various functions of these quantities in a memoir of which some
extracts appeared as early as 1869 a modest scholar m massieu
indicated in particular a remarkable function which he termed a
characteristic function and by the employment of which calculations
are simplified in certain cases
in the same way jw gibbs in 1875 and 1878 then helmholtz in 1882
and in france m duhem from the year 1886 onward have published
works at first ill understood of which the renown was however
considerable in the sequel and in which they made use of analogous
functions under the names of available energy free energy or
internal thermodynamic potential the magnitude thus designated
attaching as a consequence of the two principles to all states of
the system is perfectly determined when the temperature and other
normal variables are known it allows us by calculations often very
easy to fix the conditions necessary and sufficient for the
maintenance of the system in equilibrium by foreign bodies taken at
the same temperature as itself
one may hope to constitute in this way as m duhem in a long and
remarkable series of operations has specially endeavoured to do a
sort of general mechanics which will enable questions of statics to be
treated with accuracy and all the conditions of equilibrium of the
system including the calorific properties to be determined thus
ordinary statics teaches us that a liquid with its vapour on the top
forms a system in equilibrium if we apply to the two fluids a
pressure depending on temperature alone thermodynamics will furnish
us in addition with the expression of the heat of vaporization and
of the specific heats of the two saturated fluids
this new study has given us also most valuable information on
compressible fluids and on the theory of elastic equilibrium added to
certain hypotheses on electric or magnetic phenomena it gives a
coherent whole from which can be deduced the conditions of electric or
magnetic equilibrium and it illuminates with a brilliant light the
calorific laws of electrolytic phenomena
but the most indisputable triumph of this thermodynamic statics is the
discovery of the laws which regulate the changes of physical state or
of chemical constitution jw gibbs was the author of this immense
progress his memoir now celebrated on the equilibrium of
heterogeneous substances concealed in 1876 in a review at that time
of limited circulation and rather heavy to read seemed only to
contain algebraic theorems applicable with difficulty to reality it
is known that helmholtz independently succeeded a few years later in
introducing thermodynamics into the domain of chemistry by his
conception of the division of energy into free and into bound energy
the first capable of undergoing all transformations and particularly
of transforming itself into external action the second on the other
hand bound and only manifesting itself by giving out heat when we
measure chemical energy we ordinarily let it fall wholly into the
calorific form but in reality it itself includes both parts and it
is the variation of the free energy and not that of the total energy
measured by the integral disengagement of heat the sign of which
determines the direction in which the reactions are effected
but if the principle thus enunciated by helmholtz as a consequence of
the laws of thermodynamics is at bottom identical with that discovered
by gibbs it is more difficult of application and is presented under a
more mysterious aspect it was not until m van der waals exhumed the
memoir of gibbs when numerous physicists or chemists most of them
dutchprofessor van thoff bakhius roozeboom and othersutilized
the rules set forth in this memoir for the discussion of the most
complicated chemical reactions that the extent of the new laws was
fully understood
the chief rule of gibbs is the one so celebrated at the present day
under the name of the phase law we know that by phases are designated
the homogeneous substances into which a system is divided thus
carbonate of lime lime and carbonic acid gas are the three phases of
a system which comprises iceland spar partially dissociated into lime
and carbonic acid gas the number of phases added to the number of
independent componentsthat is to say bodies whose mass is left
arbitrary by the chemical formulas of the substances entering into the
reactionfixes the general form of the law of equilibrium of the
system that is to say the number of quantities which by their
variations temperature and pressure would be of a nature to modify
its equilibrium by modifying the constitution of the phases
several authors m raveau in particular have indeed given very
simple demonstrations of this law which are not based on
thermodynamics but thermodynamics which led to its discovery
continues to give it its true scope moreover it would not suffice
merely to determine quantitatively those laws of which it makes known
the general form we must if we wish to penetrate deeper into
details particularize the hypothesis and admit for instance with
gibbs that we are dealing with perfect gases while thanks to
thermodynamics we can constitute a complete theory of dissociation
which leads to formulas in complete accord with the numerical results
of the experiment we can thus follow closely all questions concerning
the displacements of the equilibrium and find a relation of the first
importance between the masses of the bodies which react in order to
constitute a system in equilibrium
the statics thus constructed constitutes at the present day an
important edifice to be henceforth classed amongst historical
monuments some theorists even wish to go a step beyond they have
attempted to begin by the same means a more complete study of those
systems whose state changes from one moment to another this is
moreover a study which is necessary to complete satisfactorily the
study of equilibrium itself for without it grave doubts would exist
as to the conditions of stability and it alone can give their true
meaning to questions relating to displacements of equilibrium
the problems with which we are thus confronted are singularly
difficult m duhem has given us many excellent examples of the
fecundity of the method but if thermodynamic statics may be
considered definitely founded it cannot be said that the general
dynamics of systems considered as the study of thermal movements and
variations are yet as solidly established
 5 atomism
it may appear singularly paradoxical that in a chapter devoted to
general views on the principles of physics a few words should be
introduced on the atomic theories of matter
very often in fact what is called the physics of principles is set
in opposition to the hypotheses on the constitution of matter
particularly to atomic theories i have already said that abandoning
the investigation of the unfathomable mystery of the constitution of
the universe some physicists think they may find in certain general
principles sufficient guides to conduct them across the physical
world but i have also said in examining the history of those
principles that if they are today considered experimental truths
independent of all theories relating to matter they have in fact
nearly all been discovered by scholars who relied on molecular
hypotheses and the question suggests itself whether this is mere
chance or whether this chance may not be ordained by higher reasons
in a very profound work which appeared a few years ago entitled
essai critique sur lhypothese des atomes m hannequin a
philosopher who is also an erudite scholar examined the part taken by
atomism in the history of science he notes that atomism and science
were born in greece of the same problem and that in modern times
the revival of the one was closely connected with that of the other
he shows too by very close analysis that the atomic hypothesis is
essential to the optics of fresnel and of cauchy that it penetrates
into the study of heat and that in its general features it presided
at the birth of modern chemistry and is linked with all its progress
he concludes that it is in a manner the soul of our knowledge of
nature and that contemporary theories are on this point in accord
with history for these theories consecrate the preponderance of this
hypothesis in the domain of science
if m hannequin had not been prematurely cut off in the full expansion
of his vigorous talent he might have added another chapter to his
excellent book he would have witnessed a prodigious budding of
atomistic ideas accompanied it is true by wide modifications in the
manner in which the atom is to be regarded since the most recent
theories make material atoms into centres constituted of atoms of
electricity on the other hand he would have found in the bursting
forth of these new doctrines one more proof in support of his idea
that science is indissolubly bound to atomism
from the philosophical point of view m hannequin examining the
reasons which may have called these links into being arrives at the
idea that they necessarily proceed from the constitution of our
knowledge or perhaps from that of nature itself moreover this
origin double in appearance is single at bottom our minds could
not in fact detach and come out of themselves to grasp reality and
the absolute in nature according to the idea of descartes it is the
destiny of our minds only to take hold of and to understand that which
proceeds from them
thus atomism which is perhaps only an appearance containing even
some contradictions is yet a wellfounded appearance since it
conforms to the laws of our minds and this hypothesis is in a way
necessary
we may dispute the conclusions of m hannequin but no one will refuse
to recognise as he does that atomic theories occupy a preponderating
part in the doctrines of physics and the position which they have
thus conquered gives them in a way the right of saying that they
rest on a real principle it is in order to recognise this right that
several physicistsm langevin for exampleask that atoms be
promoted from the rank of hypotheses to that of principles by this
they mean that the atomistic ideas forced upon us by an almost
obligatory induction based on very exact experiments enable us to
coordinate a considerable amount of facts to construct a very general
synthesis and to foresee a great number of phenomena
it is of moment moreover to thoroughly understand that atomism does
not necessarily set up the hypothesis of centres of attraction acting
at a distance and it must not be confused with molecular physics
which has on the other hand undergone very serious checks the
molecular physics greatly in favour some fifty years ago leads to such
complex representations and to solutions often so undetermined that
the most courageous are wearied with upholding it and it has fallen
into some discredit it rested on the fundamental principles of
mechanics applied to molecular actions and that was no doubt an
extension legitimate enough since mechanics is itself only an
experimental science and its principles established for the
movements of matter taken as a whole should not be applied outside
the domain which belongs to them atomism in fact tends more and
more in modern theories to imitate the principle of the conservation
of energy or that of entropy to disengage itself from the artificial
bonds which attached it to mechanics and to put itself forward as an
independent principle
atomistic ideas also have undergone evolution and this slow evolution
has been considerably quickened under the influence of modern
discoveries these reach back to the most remote antiquity and to
follow their development we should have to write the history of human
thought which they have always accompanied since the time of
leucippus democritus epicurus and lucretius the first observers
who noticed that the volume of a body could be diminished by
compression or cold or augmented by heat and who saw a soluble solid
body mix completely with the water which dissolved it must have been
compelled to suppose that matter was not dispersed continuously
throughout the space it seemed to occupy they were thus brought to
consider it discontinuous and to admit that a substance having the
same composition and the same properties in all its partsin a word
perfectly homogeneousceases to present this homogeneity when
considered within a sufficiently small volume
modern experimenters have succeeded by direct experiments in placing
in evidence this heterogeneous character of matter when taken in small
mass thus for example the superficial tension which is constant
for the same liquid at a given temperature no longer has the same
value when the thickness of the layer of liquid becomes extremely
small newton noticed even in his time that a dark zone is seen to
form on a soap bubble at the moment when it becomes so thin that it
must burst professor reinold and sir arthur rcker have shown that
this zone is no longer exactly spherical and from this we must
conclude that the superficial tension constant for all thicknesses
above a certain limit commences to vary when the thickness falls
below a critical value which these authors estimate on optical
grounds at about fifty millionths of a millimetre
from experiments on capillarity prof quincke has obtained similar
results with regard to layers of solids but it is not only capillary
properties which allow this characteristic to be revealed all the
properties of a body are modified when taken in small mass m meslin
proves this in a very ingenious way as regards optical properties and
mr vincent in respect of electric conductivity m houllevigue who
in a chapter of his excellent work du laboratoire  lusine has
very clearly set forth the most interesting considerations on atomic
hypotheses has recently demonstrated that copper and silver cease to
combine with iodine as soon as they are present in a thickness of less
than thirty millionths of a millimetre it is this same dimension
likewise that is possessed according to m wiener by the smallest
thicknesses it is possible to deposit on glass these layers are so
thin that they cannot be perceived but their presence is revealed by
a change in the properties of the light reflected by them
thus below fifty to thirty millionths of a millimetre the properties
of matter depend on its thickness there are then no doubt only a
few molecules to be met with and it may be concluded in consequence
that the discontinuous elements of bodiesthat is the molecules
have linear dimensions of the order of magnitude of the millionth of a
millimetre considerations regarding more complex phenomena for
instance the phenomena of electricity by contact and also the kinetic
theory of gases bring us to the same conclusion
the idea of the discontinuity of matter forces itself upon us for many
other reasons all modern chemistry is founded on this principle and
laws like the law of multiple proportions introduce an evident
discontinuity to which we find analogies in the law of electrolysis
the elements of bodies we are thus brought to regard might as regards
solids at all events be considered as immobile but this immobility
could not explain the phenomena of heat and as it is entirely
inadmissible for gases it seems very improbable it can absolutely
occur in any state we are thus led to suppose that these elements are
animated by very complicated movements each one proceeding in closed
trajectories in which the least variations of temperature or pressure
cause modifications
the atomistic hypothesis shows itself remarkably fecund in the study
of phenomena produced in gases and here the mutual independence of
the particles renders the question relatively more simple and
perhaps allows the principles of mechanics to be more certainly
extended to the movements of molecules
the kinetic theory of gases can point to unquestioned successes and
the idea of daniel bernouilli who as early as 1738 considered a
gaseous mass to be formed of a considerable number of molecules
animated by rapid movements of translation has been put into a form
precise enough for mathematical analysis and we have thus found
ourselves in a position to construct a really solid foundation it
will be at once conceived on this hypothesis that pressure is the
resultant of the shocks of the molecules against the walls of the
containing vessel and we at once come to the demonstration that the
law of mariotte is a natural consequence of this origin of pressure
since if the volume occupied by a certain number of molecules is
doubled the number of shocks per second on each square centimetre of
the walls becomes half as much but if we attempt to carry this
further we find ourselves in presence of a serious difficulty it is
impossible to mentally follow every one of the many individual
molecules which compose even a very limited mass of gas the path
followed by this molecule may be every instant modified by the chance
of running against another or by a shock which may make it rebound in
another direction
the difficulty would be insoluble if chance had not laws of its own
it was maxwell who first thought of introducing into the kinetic
theory the calculation of probabilities willard gibbs and boltzmann
later on developed this idea and have founded a statistical method
which does not perhaps give absolute certainty but which is
certainly most interesting and curious molecules are grouped in such
a way that those belonging to the same group may be considered as
having the same state of movement then an examination is made of the
number of molecules in each group and what are the changes in this
number from one moment to another it is thus often possible to
determine the part which the different groups have in the total
properties of the system and in the phenomena which may occur
such a method analogous to the one employed by statisticians for
following the social phenomena in a population is all the more
legitimate the greater the number of individuals counted in the
averages now the number of molecules contained in a limited space
for example in a centimetre cube taken in normal conditionsis such
that no population could ever attain so high a figure all
considerations those we have indicated as well as others which might
be invoked for example the recent researches of m spring on the
limit of visibility of fluorescence give this resultthat there
are in this space some twenty thousand millions of molecules each
of these must receive in the space of a millimetre about ten thousand
shocks and be ten thousand times thrust out of its course the free
path of a molecule is then very small but it can be singularly
augmented by diminishing the number of them tait and dewar have
calculated that in a good modern vacuum the length of the free path
of the remaining molecules not taken away by the airpump easily
reaches a few centimetres
by developing this theory we come to consider that for a given
temperature every molecule and even every individual particle atom
or ion which takes part in the movement has on the average the same
kinetic energy in every body and that this energy is proportional to
the absolute temperature so that it is represented by this
temperature multiplied by a constant quantity which is a universal
constant
this result is not an hypothesis but a very great probability this
probability increases when it is noted that the same value for the
constant is met with in the study of very varied phenomena for
example in certain theories on radiation knowing the mass and energy
of a molecule it is easy to calculate its speed and we find that the
average speed is about 400 metres per second for carbonic anhydride
500 for nitrogen and 1850 for hydrogen at 0 c and at ordinary
pressure i shall have occasion later on to speak of much more
considerable speeds than these as animating other particles
the kinetic theory has permitted the diffusion of gases to be
explained and the divers circumstances of the phenomenon to be
calculated it has allowed us to show as m brillouin has done that
the coefficient of diffusion of two gases does not depend on the
proportion of the gases in the mixture it gives a very striking image
of the phenomena of viscosity and conductivity and it leads us to
think that the coefficients of friction and of conductivity are
independent of the density while all these previsions have been
verified by experiment it has also invaded optics and by relying on
the principle of doppler professor michelson has succeeded in
obtaining from it an explanation of the length presented by the
spectral rays of even the most rarefied gases
but however interesting are these results they would not have
sufficed to overcome the repugnance of certain physicists for
speculations which an imposing mathematical baggage notwithstanding
seemed to them too hypothetical the theory moreover stopped at the
molecule and appeared to suggest no idea which could lead to the
discovery of the key to the phenomena where molecules exercise a
mutual influence on each other the kinetic hypothesis therefore
remained in some disfavour with a great number of persons
particularly in france until the last few years when all the recent
discoveries of the conductivity of gases and of the new radiations
came to procure for it a new and luxuriant efflorescence it may be
said that the atomistic synthesis but yesterday so decried is today
triumphant
the elements which enter into the earlier kinetic theory and which
to avoid confusion should be always designated by the name of
molecules were not truth to say in the eyes of the chemists the
final term of the divisibility of matter it is well known that to
them except in certain particular bodies like the vapour of mercury
and argon the molecule comprises several atoms and that in compound
bodies the number of these atoms may even be fairly considerable but
physicists rarely needed to have recourse to the consideration of
these atoms they spoke of them to explain certain particularities of
the propagation of sound and to enunciate laws relating to specific
heats but in general they stopped at the consideration of the
molecule
the present theories carry the division much further i shall not
dwell now on these theories since in order to thoroughly understand
them many other facts must be examined but to avoid all confusion
it remains understood that contrary no doubt to etymology but in
conformity with present custom i shall continue in what follows to
call atoms those particles of matter which have till now been spoken
of these atoms being themselves according to modern views
singularly complex edifices formed of elements of which we shall have
occasion to indicate the nature later
chapter iv
the various states of matter
 1 the statics of fluids
the division of bodies into gaseous liquid and solid and the
distinction established for the same substance between the three
states retain a great importance for the applications and usages of
daily life but have long since lost their absolute value from the
scientific point of view
so far as concerns the liquid and gaseous states particularly the
already antiquated researches of andrews confirmed the ideas of
cagniard de la tour and established the continuity of the two states
a group of physical studies has thus been constituted on what may be
called the statics of fluids in which we examine the relations
existing between the pressure the volume and the temperature of
bodies and in which are comprised under the term fluid gases as
well as liquids
these researches deserve attention by their interest and the
generality of the results to which they have led they also give a
remarkable example of the happy effects which may be obtained by the
combined employment of the various methods of investigation used in
exploring the domain of nature thermodynamics has in fact allowed
us to obtain numerical relations between the various coefficients and
atomic hypotheses have led to the establishment of one capital
relation the characteristic equation of fluids while on the other
hand experiment in which the progress made in the art of measurement
has been utilized has furnished the most valuable information on all
the laws of compressibility and dilatation
the classical work of andrews was not very wide andrews did not go
much beyond pressures close to the normal and ordinary temperatures
of late years several very interesting and peculiar cases have been
examined by mm cailletet mathias batelli leduc p chappuis and
other physicists sir w ramsay and mr s young have made known the
isothermal diagrams6 of a certain number of liquid bodies at the
ordinary temperature they have thus been able while keeping to
somewhat restricted limits of temperature and pressure to touch upon
the most important questions since they found themselves in the
region of the saturation curve and of the critical point
footnote 6 by isothermal diagram is meant the pattern or complex
formed when the isothermal lines are arranged in curves of which the
pressure is the ordinate and the volume the abscissaed
but the most complete and systematic body of researches is due to m
amagat who undertook the study of a certain number of bodies some
liquid and some gaseous extending the scope of his experiments so as
to embrace the different phases of the phenomena and to compare
together not only the results relating to the same bodies but also
those concerning different bodies which happen to be in the same
conditions of temperature and pressure but in very different
conditions as regards their critical points
from the experimental point of view m amagat has been able with
extreme skill to conquer the most serious difficulties he has
managed to measure with precision pressures amounting to 3000
atmospheres and also the very small volumes then occupied by the
fluid mass under consideration this last measurement which
necessitates numerous corrections is the most delicate part of the
operation these researches have dealt with a certain number of
different bodies those relating to carbonic acid and ethylene take in
the critical point others on hydrogen and nitrogen for instance
are very extended others again such as the study of the
compressibility of water have a special interest on account of the
peculiar properties of this substance m amagat by a very concise
discussion of the experiments has also been able to definitely
establish the laws of compressibility and dilatation of fluids under
constant pressure and to determine the value of the various
coefficients as well as their variations it ought to be possible to
condense all these results into a single formula representing the
volume the temperature and the pressure rankin and subsequently
recknagel and then hirn formerly proposed formulas of that kind but
the most famous the one which first appeared to contain in a
satisfactory manner all the facts which experiments brought to light
and led to the production of many others was the celebrated equation
of van der waals
professor van der waals arrived at this relation by relying upon
considerations derived from the kinetic theory of gases if we keep to
the simple idea at the bottom of this theory we at once demonstrate
that the gas ought to obey the laws of mariotte and of gaylussac so
that the characteristic equation would be obtained by the statement
that the product of the number which is the measure of the volume by
that which is the measure of the pressure is equal to a constant
coefficient multiplied by the degree of the absolute temperature but
to get at this result we neglect two important factors
we do not take into account in fact the attraction which the
molecules must exercise on each other now this attraction which is
never absolutely nonexistent may become considerable when the
molecules are drawn closer together that is to say when the
compressed gaseous mass occupies a more and more restricted volume on
the other hand we assimilate the molecules as a first approximation
to material points without dimensions in the evaluation of the path
traversed by each molecule no notice is taken of the fact that at the
moment of the shock their centres of gravity are still separated by a
distance equal to twice the radius of the molecule
m van der waals has sought out the modifications which must be
introduced into the simple characteristic equation to bring it nearer
to reality he extends to the case of gases the considerations by
which laplace in his famous theory of capillarity reduced the effect
of the molecular attraction to a perpendicular pressure exercised on
the surface of a liquid this leads him to add to the external
pressure that due to the reciprocal attractions of the gaseous
particles on the other hand when we attribute finite dimensions to
these particles we must give a higher value to the number of shocks
produced in a given time since the effect of these dimensions is to
diminish the mean path they traverse in the time which elapses between
two consecutive shocks
the calculation thus pursued leads to our adding to the pressure in
the simple equation a term which is designated the internal pressure
and which is the quotient of a constant by the square of the volume
also to our deducting from the volume a constant which is the
quadruple of the total and invariable volume which the gaseous
molecules would occupy did they touch one another
the experiments fit in fairly well with the formula of van der waals
but considerable discrepancies occur when we extend its limits
particularly when the pressures throughout a rather wider interval are
considered so that other and rather more complex formulas on which
there is no advantage in dwelling have been proposed and in certain
cases better represent the facts
but the most remarkable result of m van der waals calculations is
the discovery of corresponding states for a long time physicists
spoke of bodies taken in a comparable state dalton for example
pointed out that liquids have vapourpressures equal to the
temperatures equally distant from their boilingpoint but that if in
this particular property liquids were comparable under these
conditions of temperature as regards other properties the parallelism
was no longer to be verified no general rule was found until m van
der waals first enunciated a primary law viz that if the pressure
the volume and the temperature are estimated by taking as units the
critical quantities the constants special to each body disappear in
the characteristic equation which thus becomes the same for all
fluids
the words corresponding states thus take a perfectly precise
signification corresponding states are those for which the numerical
values of the pressure volume and temperature expressed by taking
as units the values corresponding to the critical point are equal
and in corresponding states any two fluids have exactly the same
properties
m natanson and subsequently p curie and m meslin have shown by
various considerations that the same result may be arrived at by
choosing units which correspond to any corresponding states it has
also been shown that the theorem of corresponding states in no way
implies the exactitude of van der waals formula in reality this is
simply due to the fact that the characteristic equation only contains
three constants
the philosophical importance and the practical interest of the
discovery nevertheless remain considerable as was to be expected
numbers of experimenters have sought whether these consequences are
duly verified in reality m amagat particularly has made use for
this purpose of a most original and simple method he remarks that in
all its generality the law may be translated thus if the isothermal
diagrams of two substances be drawn to the same scale taking as unit
of volume and of pressure the values of the critical constants the
two diagrams should coincide that is to say their superposition
should present the aspect of one diagram appertaining to a single
substance further if we possess the diagrams of two bodies drawn to
any scales and referable to any units whatever as the changes of
units mean changes in the scale of the axes we ought to make one of
the diagrams similar to the other by lengthening or shortening it in
the direction of one of the axes m amagat then photographs two
isothermal diagrams leaving one fixed but arranging the other so
that it may be free to turn round each axis of the coordinates and
by projecting by means of a magic lantern the second on the first
he arrives in certain cases at an almost complete coincidence
this mechanical means of proof thus dispenses with laborious
calculations but its sensibility is unequally distributed over the
different regions of the diagram m raveau has pointed out an equally
simple way of verifying the law by remarking that if the logarithms
of the pressure and volume are taken as coordinates the coordinates
of two corresponding points differ by two constant quantities and the
corresponding curves are identical
from these comparisons and from other important researches among
which should be particularly mentioned those of mr s young and m
mathias it results that the laws of corresponding states have not
unfortunately the degree of generality which we at first attributed
to them but that they are satisfactory when applied to certain groups
of bodies7
footnote 7 mr preston thus puts it the law of corresponding
states seems to be not quite but very nearly true for these
substances ie the halogen derivatives of benzene but in the
case of the other substances examined the majority of these
generalizations were either only roughly true or altogether departed
from theory of heat london 1904 p 514ed
if in the study of the statics of a simple fluid the experimental
results are already complex we ought to expect much greater
difficulties when we come to deal with mixtures still the problem has
been approached and many points are already cleared up
mixed fluids may first of all be regarded as composed of a large
number of invariable particles in this particularly simple case m
van der waals has established a characteristic equation of the
mixtures which is founded on mechanical considerations various
verifications of this formula have been effected and it has in
particular been the object of very important remarks by m daniel
berthelot
it is interesting to note that thermodynamics seems powerless to
determine this equation for it does not trouble itself about the
nature of the bodies obedient to its laws but on the other hand it
intervenes to determine the properties of coexisting phases if we
examine the conditions of equilibrium of a mixture which is not
subjected to external forces it will be demonstrated that the
distribution must come back to a juxtaposition of homogeneous phases
in a given volume matter ought so to arrange itself that the total
sum of free energy has a minimum value thus in order to elucidate
all questions relating to the number and qualities of the phases into
which the substance divides itself we are led to regard the
geometrical surface which for a given temperature represents the free
energy
i am unable to enter here into the detail of the questions connected
with the theories of gibbs which have been the object of numerous
theoretical studies and also of a series ever more and more
abundant of experimental researches m duhem in particular has
published on the subject memoirs of the highest importance and a
great number of experimenters mostly scholars working in the physical
laboratory of leyden under the guidance of the director mr kamerlingh
onnes have endeavoured to verify the anticipations of the theory
we are a little less advanced as regards abnormal substances that is
to say those composed of molecules partly simple and partly complex
and either dissociated or associated these cases must naturally be
governed by very complex laws recent researches by mm van der waals
alexeif rothmund knen lehfeld etc throw however some light on
the question
the daily more numerous applications of the laws of corresponding
states have rendered highly important the determination of the
critical constants which permit these states to be defined in the
case of homogeneous bodies the critical elements have a simple clear
and precise sense the critical temperature is that of the single
isothermal line which presents a point of inflexion at a horizontal
tangent the critical pressure and the critical volume are the two
coordinates of this point of inflexion
the three critical constants may be determined as mr s young and m
amagat have shown by a direct method based on the consideration of
the saturated states results perhaps more precise may also be
obtained if one keeps to two constants or even to a single one
temperature for exampleby employing various special methods many
others mm cailletet and colardeau m young mj chappuis etc
have proceeded thus
the case of mixtures is much more complicated a binary mixture has a
critical space instead of a critical point this space is comprised
between two extreme temperatures the lower corresponding to what is
called the folding point the higher to that which we call the point
of contact of the mixture between these two temperatures an
isothermal compression yields a quantity of liquid which increases
then reaches a maximum diminishes and disappears this is the
phenomenon of retrograde condensation we may say that the properties
of the critical point of a homogeneous substance are in a way
divided when it is a question of a binary mixture between the two
points mentioned
calculation has enabled m van der waals by the application of his
kinetic theories and m duhem by means of thermodynamics to foresee
most of the results which have since been verified by experiment all
these facts have been admirably set forth and systematically
coordinated by m mathias who by his own researches moreover has
made contributions of the highest value to the study of questions
regarding the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states
the further knowledge of critical elements has allowed the laws of
corresponding states to be more closely examined in the case of
homogeneous substances it has shown that as i have already said
bodies must be arranged in groups and this fact clearly proves that
the properties of a given fluid are not determined by its critical
constants alone and that it is necessary to add to them some other
specific parameters m mathias and m d berthelot have indicated
some which seem to play a considerable part
it results also from this that the characteristic equation of a fluid
cannot yet be considered perfectly known neither the equation of van
der waals nor the more complicated formulas which have been proposed
by various authors are in perfect conformity with reality we may
think that researches of this kind will only be successful if
attention is concentrated not only on the phenomena of
compressibility and dilatation but also on the calorimetric
properties of bodies thermodynamics indeed establishes relations
between those properties and other constants but does not allow
everything to be foreseen
several physicists have effected very interesting calorimetric
measurements either like m perot in order to verify clapeyrons
formula regarding the heat of vaporization or to ascertain the values
of specific heats and their variations when the temperature or the
pressure happens to change m mathias has even succeeded in
completely determining the specific heats of liquefied gases and of
their saturated vapours as well as the heat of internal and external
vaporization
 2 the liquefaction of gases and the properties of bodies at a
     low temperature
the scientific advantages of all these researches have been great
and as nearly always happens the practical consequences derived from
them have also been most important it is owing to the more complete
knowledge of the general properties of fluids that immense progress
has been made these last few years in the methods of liquefying gases
from a theoretical point of view the new processes of liquefaction can
be classed in two categories lindes machine and those resembling it
utilize as is known expansion without any notable production of
external work this expansion nevertheless causes a fall in the
temperature because the gas in the experiment is not a perfect gas
and by an ingenious process the refrigerations produced are made
cumulative
several physicists have proposed to employ a method whereby
liquefaction should be obtained by expansion with recuperable external
work this method proposed as long ago as 1860 by siemens would
offer considerable advantages theoretically the liquefaction would
be more rapid and obtained much more economically but unfortunately
in the experiment serious obstacles are met with especially from the
difficulty of obtaining a suitable lubricant under intense cold for
those parts of the machine which have to be in movement if the
apparatus is to work
m claude has recently made great progress on this point by the use
during the running of the machine of the ether of petrol which is
uncongealable and a good lubricant for the moving parts when once
the desired region of cold is reached air itself is used which
moistens the metals but does not completely avoid friction so that
the results would have remained only middling had not this ingenious
physicist devised a new improvement which has some analogy with
superheating of steam in steam engines he slightly varies the initial
temperature of the compressed air on the verge of liquefaction so as
to avoid a zone of deep perturbations in the properties of fluids
which would make the work of expansion very feeble and the cold
produced consequently slight this improvement simple as it is in
appearance presents several other advantages which immediately treble
the output
the special object of m claude was to obtain oxygen in a practical
manner by the actual distillation of liquid air since nitrogen boils
at 194 and oxygen at 1805 c if liquid air be evaporated the
nitrogen escapes especially at the commencement of the evaporation
while the oxygen concentrates in the residual liquid which finally
consists of pure oxygen while at the same time the temperature rises
to the boilingpoint 1805 c of oxygen but liquid air is costly
and if one were content to evaporate it for the purpose of collecting
a part of the oxygen in the residuum the process would have a very
poor result from the commercial point of view as early as 1892 mr
parkinson thought of improving the output by recovering the cold
produced by liquid air during its evaporation but an incorrect idea
which seems to have resulted from certain experiments of dewarthe
idea that the phenomenon of the liquefaction of air would not be
owing to certain peculiarities the exact converse of that of
vaporizationled to the employment of very imperfect apparatus m
claude however by making use of a method which he calls the
reversal8 method obtains a complete rectification in a remarkably
simple manner and under extremely advantageous economic conditions
apparatus of surprisingly reduced dimensions but of great efficiency
is now in daily work which easily enables more than a thousand cubic
metres of oxygen to be obtained at the rate per horsepower of more
than a cubic metre per hour
footnote 8 methode avec retour en arriereed
it is in england thanks to the skill of sir james dewar and his
pupilsthanks also it must be said to the generosity of the royal
institution which has devoted considerable sums to these costly
experimentsthat the most numerous and systematic researches have
been effected on the production of intense cold i shall here note
only the more important results especially those relating to the
properties of bodies at low temperatures
their electrical properties in particular undergo some interesting
modifications the order which metals assume in point of conductivity
is no longer the same as at ordinary temperatures thus at 200 c
copper is a better conductor than silver the resistance diminishes
with the temperature and down to about 200 this diminution is
almost linear and it would seem that the resistance tends towards
zero when the temperature approaches the absolute zero but after
200 the pattern of the curves changes and it is easy to foresee
that at absolute zero the resistivities of all metals would still
have contrary to what was formerly supposed a notable value
solidified electrolytes which at temperatures far below their fusion
point still retain a very appreciable conductivity become on the
contrary perfect insulators at low temperatures their dielectric
constants assume relatively high values mm curie and compan who
have studied this question from their own point of view have noted
moreover that the specific inductive capacity changes considerably
with the temperature
in the same way magnetic properties have been studied a very
interesting result is that found in oxygen the magnetic
susceptibility of this body increases at the moment of liquefaction
nevertheless this increase which is enormous since the
susceptibility becomes sixteen hundred times greater than it was at
first if we take it in connection with equal volumes is much less
considerable if taken in equal masses it must be concluded from this
fact that the magnetic properties apparently do not belong to the
molecules themselves but depend on their state of aggregation
the mechanical properties of bodies also undergo important
modifications in general their cohesion is greatly increased and
the dilatation produced by slight changes of temperature is
considerable sir james dewar has effected careful measurements of the
dilatation of certain bodies at low temperatures for example of ice
changes in colour occur and vermilion and iodide of mercury pass into
pale orange phosphorescence becomes more intense and most bodies of
complex structuremilk eggs feathers cotton and flowersbecome
phosphorescent the same is the case with certain simple bodies such
as oxygen which is transformed into ozone and emits a white light in
the process
chemical affinity is almost put an end to phosphorus and potassium
remain inert in liquid oxygen it should however be noted and this
remark has doubtless some interest for the theories of photographic
action that photographic substances retain even at the temperature
of liquid hydrogen a very considerable part of their sensitiveness to
light
sir james dewar has made some important applications of low
temperatures in chemical analysis he also utilizes them to create a
vacuum his researches have in fact proved that the pressure of air
congealed by liquid hydrogen cannot exceed the millionth of an
atmosphere we have then in this process an original and rapid
means of creating an excellent vacuum in apparatus of very different
kindsa means which in certain cases may be particularly
convenient9
footnote 9 professor soddy in a paper read before the royal society
on the 15th november 1906 warns experimenters against vacua created
by charcoal cooled in liquid air the method referredto in the text
unless as much of the air as possible is first removed with a pump and
replaced by some argonfree gas according to him neither helium nor
argon is absorbed by charcoal by the use of electricallyheated
calcium he claims to have produced an almost perfect vacuumed
thanks to these studies a considerable field has been opened up for
biological research but in this which is not our subject i shall
notice one point only it has been proved that vital germsbacteria
for examplemay be kept for seven days at 190c without their
vitality being modified phosphorescent organisms cease it is true
to shine at the temperature of liquid air but this fact is simply due
to the oxidations and other chemical reactions which keep up the
phosphorescence being then suspended for phosphorescent activity
reappears so soon as the temperature is again sufficiently raised an
important conclusion has been drawn from these experiments which
affects cosmogonical theories since the cold of space could not kill
the germs of life it is in no way absurd to suppose that under
proper conditions a germ may be transmitted from one planet to
another
among the discoveries made with the new processes the one which most
strikingly interested public attention is that of new gases in the
atmosphere we know how sir william ramsay and dr travers first
observed by means of the spectroscope the characteristics of the
companions of argon in the least volatile part of the atmosphere
sir james dewar on the one hand and sir william ramsay on the other
subsequently separated in addition to argon and helium crypton
xenon and neon the process employed consists essentially in first
solidifying the least volatile part of the air and then causing it to
evaporate with extreme slowness a tube with electrodes enables the
spectrum of the gas in process of distillation to be observed in this
manner the spectra of the various gases may be seen following one
another in the inverse order of their volatility all these gases are
monoatomic like mercury that is to say they are in the most simple
state they possess no internal molecular energy unless it is that
which heat is capable of supplying and they even seem to have no
chemical energy everything leads to the belief that they show the
existence on the earth of an earlier state of things now vanished it
may be supposed for instance that helium and neon of which the
molecular mass is very slight were formerly more abundant on our
planet but at an epoch when the temperature of the globe was higher
the very speed of their molecules may have reached a considerable
value exceeding for instance eleven kilometres per second which
suffices to explain why they should have left our atmosphere crypton
and neon which have a density four times greater than oxygen may on
the contrary have partly disappeared by solution at the bottom of the
sea where it is not absurd to suppose that considerable quantities
would be found liquefied at great depths10
footnote 10 another view viz that these inert gases are a kind of
waste product of radioactive changes is also gaining ground the
discovery of the radioactive mineral malacone which gives off both
helium and argon goes to support this see messrs ketchin and
wintersons paper on the subject at the chemical society 18th october
1906ed
it is probable moreover that the higher regions of the atmosphere
are not composed of the same air as that around us sir james dewar
points out that daltons law demands that every gas composing the
atmosphere should have at all heights and temperatures the same
pressure as if it were alone the pressure decreasing the less
quickly all things being equal as its density becomes less it
results from this that the temperature becoming gradually lower as we
rise in the atmosphere at a certain altitude there can no longer
remain any traces of oxygen or nitrogen which no doubt liquefy and
the atmosphere must be almost exclusively composed of the most
volatile gases including hydrogen which ma gautier has like lord
rayleigh and sir william ramsay proved to exist in the air the
spectrum of the aurora borealis in which are found the lines of
those parts of the atmosphere which cannot be liquefied in liquid
hydrogen together with the lines of argon crypton and xenon is
quite in conformity with this point of view it is however singular
that it should be the spectrum of crypton that is to say of the
heaviest gas of the group which appears most clearly in the upper
regions of the atmosphere
among the gases most difficult to liquefy hydrogen has been the
object of particular research and of really quantitative experiments
its properties in a liquid state are now very clearly known its
boilingpoint measured with a helium thermometer which has been
compared with thermometers of oxygen and hydrogen is 252 its
critical temperature is 241 c its critical pressure 15
atmospheres it is four times lighter than water it does not present
any absorption spectrum and its specific heat is the greatest known
it is not a conductor of electricity solidified at 15 absolute it
is far from reminding one by its aspect of a metal it rather
resembles a piece of perfectly pure ice and dr travers attributes to
it a crystalline structure the last gas which has resisted
liquefaction helium has recently been obtained in a liquid state it
appears to have its boilingpoint in the neighbourhood of 6
absolute11
footnote 11 m poincar is here in error helium has never been
liquefieded
 3 solids and liquids
the interest of the results to which the researches on the continuity
between the liquid and the gaseous states have led is so great that
numbers of scholars have naturally been induced to inquire whether
something analogous might not be found in the case of liquids and
solids we might think that a similar continuity ought to be there met
with that the universal character of the properties of matter forbade
all real discontinuity between two different states and that in
truth the solid was a prolongation of the liquid state
to discover whether this supposition is correct it concerns us to
compare the properties of liquids and solids if we find that all
properties are common to the two states we have the right to believe
even if they presented themselves in different degrees that by a
continuous series of intermediary bodies the two classes might yet be
connected if on the other hand we discover that there exists in
these two classes some quality of a different nature we must
necessarily conclude that there is a discontinuity which nothing can
remove
the distinction established from the point of view of daily custom
between solids and liquids proceeds especially from the difficulty
that we meet with in the one case and the facility in the other when
we wish to change their form temporarily or permanently by the action
of mechanical force this distinction only corresponds however in
reality to a difference in the value of certain coefficients it is
impossible to discover by this means any absolute characteristic which
establishes a separation between the two classes modern researches
prove this clearly it is not without use in order to well understand
them to state precisely the meaning of a few terms generally rather
loosely employed
if a conjunction of forces acting on a homogeneous material mass
happens to deform it without compressing or dilating it two very
distinct kinds of reactions may appear which oppose themselves to the
effort exercised during the time of deformation and during that time
only the first make their influence felt they depend essentially on
the greater or less rapidity of the deformation they cease with the
movement and could not in any case bring the body back to its
pristine state of equilibrium the existence of these reactions leads
us to the idea of viscosity or internal friction
the second kind of reactions are of a different nature they continue
to act when the deformation remains stationary and if the external
forces happen to disappear they are capable of causing the body to
return to its initial form provided a certain limit has not been
exceeded these last constitute rigidity
at first sight a solid body appears to have a finite rigidity and an
infinite viscosity a liquid on the contrary presents a certain
viscosity but no rigidity but if we examine the matter more closely
beginning either with the solids or with the liquids we see this
distinction vanish
tresca showed long ago that internal friction is not infinite in a
solid certain bodies can so to speak at once flow and be moulded
mw spring has given many examples of such phenomena on the other
hand viscosity in liquids is never nonexistent for were it so for
water for example in the celebrated experiment effected by joule for
the determination of the mechanical equivalent of the caloric the
liquid borne along by the floats would slide without friction on the
surrounding liquid and the work done by movement would be the same
whether the floats did or did not plunge into the liquid mass
in certain cases observed long ago with what are called pasty bodies
this viscosity attains a value almost comparable to that observed by
m spring in some solids nor does rigidity allow us to establish a
barrier between the two states notwithstanding the extreme mobility
of their particles liquids contain in fact vestiges of the property
which we formerly wished to consider the special characteristic of
solids
maxwell before succeeded in rendering the existence of this rigidity
very probable by examining the optical properties of a deformed layer
of liquid but a russian physicist m schwedoff has gone further
and has been able by direct experiments to show that a sheath of
liquid set between two solid cylinders tends when one of the
cylinders is subjected to a slight rotation to return to its original
position and gives a measurable torsion to a thread upholding the
cylinder from the knowledge of this torsion the rigidity can be
deduced in the case of a solution containing 12 per cent of
gelatine it is found that this rigidity enormous compared with that
of water is still however one trillion eight hundred and forty
billion times less than that of steel
this figure exact within a few billions proves that the rigidity is
very slight but exists and that suffices for a characteristic
distinction to be founded on this property in a general way m
spring has also established that we meet in solids in a degree more
or less marked with the properties of liquids when they are placed
in suitable conditions of pressure and time they flow through
orifices transmit pressure in all directions diffuse and dissolve
one into the other and react chemically on each other they may be
soldered together by compression by the same means alloys may be
produced and further which seems to clearly prove that matter in a
solid state is not deprived of all molecular mobility it is possible
to realise suitable limited reactions and equilibria between solid
salts and these equilibria obey the fundamental laws of
thermodynamics
thus the definition of a solid cannot be drawn from its mechanical
properties it cannot be said after what we have just seen that
solid bodies retain their form nor that they have a limited
elasticity for m spring has made known a case where the elasticity
of solids is without any limit
it was thought that in the case of a different phenomenonthat of
crystallizationwe might arrive at a clear distinction because here
we should he dealing with a specific quality and that crystallized
bodies would be the true solids amorphous bodies being at that time
regarded as liquids viscous in the extreme
but the studies of a german physicist professor o lehmann seem to
prove that even this means is not infallible professor lehmann has
succeeded in fact in obtaining with certain organic compounds
oleate of potassium for instanceunder certain conditions some
peculiar states to which he has given the name of semifluid and
liquid crystals these singular phenomena can only be observed and
studied by means of a microscope and the carlsruhe professor had to
devise an ingenious apparatus which enabled him to bring the
preparation at the required temperature on to the very plate of the
microscope
it is thus made evident that these bodies act on polarized light in
the manner of a crystal those that m lehmann terms semiliquid still
present traces of polyhedric delimitation but with the peaks and
angles rounded by surfacetension while the others tend to a strictly
spherical form the optical examination of the firstnamed bodies is
very difficult because appearances may be produced which are due to
the phenomena of refraction and imitate those of polarization for the
other kind which are often as mobile as water the fact that they
polarize light is absolutely unquestionable
unfortunately all these liquids are turbid and it may be objected
that they are not homogeneous this want of homogeneity may according
to m quincke be due to the existence of particles suspended in a
liquid in contact with another liquid miscible with it and enveloping
it as might a membrane and the phenomena of polarization would thus
be quite naturally explained12
footnote 12 professor quinckes last hypothesis is that all liquids
on solidifying pass through a stage intermediate between solid and
liquid in which they form what he calls foamcells and assume a
viscous structure resembling that of jelly see proc roy soc a
23rd july 1906ed
m tamman is of opinion that it is more a question of an emulsion
and on this hypothesis the action on light would actually be that
which has been observed various experimenters have endeavoured of
recent years to elucidate this question it cannot be considered
absolutely settled but these very curious experiments pursued with
great patience and remarkable ingenuity allow us to think that there
really exist certain intermediary forms between crystals and liquids
in which bodies still retain a peculiar structure and consequently
act on light but nevertheless possess considerable plasticity
let us note that the question of the continuity of the liquid and
solid states is not quite the same as the question of knowing whether
there exist bodies intermediate in all respects between the solids and
liquids these two problems are often wrongly confused the gap
between the two classes of bodies may be filled by certain substances
with intermediate properties such as pasty bodies and bodies liquid
but still crystallized because they have not yet completely lost
their peculiar structure yet the transition is not necessarily
established in a continuous fashion when we are dealing with the
passage of one and the same determinate substance from the liquid to
the solid form we conceive that this change may take place by
insensible degrees in the case of an amorphous body but it seems
hardly possible to consider the case of a crystal in which molecular
movements must be essentially regular as a natural sequence to the
case of the liquid where we are on the contrary in presence of an
extremely disordered state of movement
m tamman has demonstrated that amorphous solids may very well in
fact be regarded as superposed liquids endowed with very great
viscosity but it is no longer the same thing when the solid is once
in the crystallized state there is then a solution of continuity of
the various properties of the substance and the two phases may
coexist
we might presume also by analogy with what happens with liquids and
gases that if we followed the curve of transformation of the
crystalline into the liquid phase we might arrive at a kind of
critical point at which the discontinuity of their properties would
vanish
professor poynting and after him professor planck and professor
ostwald supposed this to be the case but more recently m tamman has
shown that such a point does not exist and that the region of
stability of the crystallized state is limited on all sides all along
the curve of transformation the two states may exist in equilibrium
but we may assert that it is impossible to realize a continuous series
of intermediaries between these two states there will always be a
more or less marked discontinuity in some of the properties
in the course of his researches m tamman has been led to certain very
important observations and has met with fresh allotropic
modifications in nearly all substances which singularly complicate
the question in the case of water for instance he finds that
ordinary ice transforms itself under a given pressure at the
temperature of 80 c into another crystalline variety which is
denser than water
the statics of solids under high pressure is as yet therefore hardly
drafted but it seems to promise results which will not be identical
with those obtained for the statics of fluids though it will present
at least an equal interest
 4 the deformations of solids
if the mechanical properties of the bodies intermediate between solids
and liquids have only lately been the object of systematic studies
admittedly solid substances have been studied for a long time yet
notwithstanding the abundance of researches published on elasticity by
theorists and experimenters numerous questions with regard to them
still remain in suspense
we only propose to briefly indicate here a few problems recently
examined without going into the details of questions which belong
more to the domain of mechanics than to that of pure physics
the deformations produced in solid bodies by increasing efforts
arrange themselves in two distinct periods if the efforts are weak
the deformations produced are also very weak and disappear when the
effort ceases they are then termed elastic if the efforts exceed a
certain value a part only of these deformations disappear and a part
are permanent
the purity of the note emitted by a sound has been often invoked as a
proof of the perfect isochronism of the oscillation and
consequently as a demonstration a posteriori of the correctness of
the early law of hoocke governing elastic deformations this law has
however during some years been frequently disputed certain
mechanicians or physicists freely admit it to be incorrect especially
as regards extremely weak deformations according to a theory in some
favour especially in germany ie the theory of bach the law which
connects the elastic deformations with the efforts would be an
exponential one recent experiments by professors kohlrausch and
gruncisen executed under varied and precise conditions on brass cast
iron slate and wrought iron do not appear to confirm bachs law
nothing in point of fact authorises the rejection of the law of
hoocke which presents itself as the most natural and most simple
approximation to reality
the phenomena of permanent deformation are very complex and it
certainly seems that they cannot be explained by the older theories
which insisted that the molecules only acted along the straight line
which joined their centres it becomes necessary then to construct
more complete hypotheses as the mm cosserat have done in some
excellent memoirs and we may then succeed in grouping together the
facts resulting from new experiments among the experiments of which
every theory must take account may be mentioned those by which colonel
hartmann has placed in evidence the importance of the lines which are
produced on the surface of metals when the limit of elasticity is
exceeded
it is to questions of the same order that the minute and patient
researches of m bouasse have been directed this physicist as
ingenious as he is profound has pursued for several years experiments
on the most delicate points relating to the theory of elasticity and
he has succeeded in defining with a precision not always attained even
in the best esteemed works the deformations to which a body must be
subjected in order to obtain comparable experiments with regard to
the slight oscillations of torsion which he has specially studied m
bouasse arrives at the conclusion in an acute discussion that we
hardly know anything more than was proclaimed a hundred years ago by
coulomb we see by this example that admirable as is the progress
accomplished in certain regions of physics there still exist many
overneglected regions which remain in painful darkness the skill
shown by m bouasse authorises us to hope that thanks to his
researches a strong light will some day illumine these unknown
corners
a particularly interesting chapter on elasticity is that relating to
the study of crystals and in the last few years it has been the
object of remarkable researches on the part of m voigt these
researches have permitted a few controversial questions between
theorists and experimenters to be solved in particular m voigt has
verified the consequences of the calculations taking care not to
make like cauchy and poisson the hypothesis of central forces a mere
function of distance and has recognized a potential which depends on
the relative orientation of the molecules these considerations also
apply to quasiisotropic bodies which are in fact networks of
crystals
certain occasional deformations which are produced and disappear
slowly may be considered as intermediate between elastic and permanent
deformations of these the thermal deformation of glass which
manifests itself by the displacement of the zero of a thermometer is
an example so also the modifications which the phenomena of magnetic
hysteresis or the variations of resistivity have just demonstrated
many theorists have taken in hand these difficult questions m
brillouin endeavours to interpret these various phenomena by the
molecular hypothesis the attempt may seem bold since these phenomena
are for the most part essentially irreversible and seem
consequently not adaptable to mechanics but m brillouin makes a
point of showing that under certain conditions irreversible
phenomena may be created between two material points the actions of
which depend solely on their distance and he furnishes striking
instances which appear to prove that a great number of irreversible
physical and chemical phenomena may be ascribed to the existence of
states of unstable equilibria
m duhem has approached the problem from another side and endeavours
to bring it within the range of thermodynamics yet ordinary
thermodynamics could not account for experimentally realizable states
of equilibrium in the phenomena of viscosity and friction since this
science declares them to be impossible m duhem however arrives at
the idea that the establishment of the equations of thermodynamics
presupposes among other hypotheses one which is entirely arbitrary
namely that when the state of the system is given external actions
capable of maintaining it in that state are determined without
ambiguity by equations termed conditions of equilibrium of the
system if we reject this hypothesis it will then be allowable to
introduce into thermodynamics laws previously excluded and it will be
possible to construct as m duhem has done a much more comprehensive
theory
the ideas of m duhem have been illustrated by remarkable experimental
work m marchis for example guided by these ideas has studied the
permanent modifications produced in glass by an oscillation of
temperature these modifications which may be called phenomena of the
hysteresis of dilatation may be followed in very appreciable fashion
by means of a glass thermometer the general results are quite in
accord with the previsions of m duhem m lenoble in researches on
the traction of metallic wires and m chevalier in experiments on the
permanent variations of the electrical resistance of wires of an alloy
of platinum and silver when submitted to periodical variations of
temperature have likewise afforded verifications of the theory
propounded by m duhem
in this theory the representative system is considered dependent on
the temperature of one or several other variables such as for
example a chemical variable a similar idea has been developed in a
very fine set of memoirs on nickel steel by m ch ed guillaume the
eminent physicist who by his earlier researches has greatly
contributed to the light thrown on the analogous question of the
displacement of the zero in thermometers concludes from fresh
researches that the residual phenomena are due to chemical
variations and that the return to the primary chemical state causes
the variation to disappear he applies his ideas not only to the
phenomena presented by irreversible steels but also to very different
facts for example to phosphorescence certain particularities of
which may be interpreted in an analogous manner
nickel steels present the most curious properties and i have already
pointed out the paramount importance of one of them hardly capable of
perceptible dilatation for its application to metrology and
chronometry13 others also discovered by m guillaume in the course
of studies conducted with rare success and remarkable ingenuity may
render great services because it is possible to regulate so to
speak at will their mechanical or magnetic properties
footnote 13 the metal known as invared
the study of alloys in general is moreover one of those in which the
introduction of the methods of physics has produced the greatest
effects by the microscopic examination of a polished surface or of
one indented by a reagent by the determination of the electromotive
force of elements of which an alloy forms one of the poles and by the
measurement of the resistivities the densities and the differences
of potential or contact the most valuable indications as to their
constitution are obtained m le chatelier m charpy m dumas m
osmond in france sir w roberts austen and mr stansfield in
england have given manifold examples of the fertility of these
methods the question moreover has had a new light thrown upon it by
the application of the principles of thermodynamics and of the phase
rule
alloys are generally known in the two states of solid and liquid
fused alloys consist of one or several solutions of the component
metals and of a certain number of definite combinations their
composition may thus be very complex but gibbs rule gives us at once
important information on the point since it indicates that there
cannot exist in general more than two distinct solutions in an alloy
of two metals
solid alloys may be classed like liquid ones two metals or more
dissolve one into the other and form a solid solution quite analogous
to the liquid solution but the study of these solid solutions is
rendered singularly difficult by the fact that the equilibrium so
rapidly reached in the case of liquids in this case takes days and in
certain cases perhaps even centuries to become established
chapter v
solutions and electrolytic dissociation
 1 solution
vaporization and fusion are not the only means by which the physical
state of a body may be changed without modifying its chemical
constitution from the most remote periods solution has also been
known and studied but only in the last twenty years have we obtained
other than empirical information regarding this phenomenon
it is natural to employ here also the methods which have allowed us to
penetrate into the knowledge of other transformations the problem of
solution may be approached by way of thermodynamics and of the
hypotheses of kinetics
as long ago as 1858 kirchhoff by attributing to saline solutions
that is to say to mixtures of water and a nonvolatile liquid like
sulphuric acidthe properties of internal energy discovered a
relation between the quantity of heat given out on the addition of a
certain quantity of water to a solution and the variations to which
condensation and temperature subject the vapourtension of the
solution he calculated for this purpose the variations of energy
which are produced when passing from one state to another by two
different series of transformations and by comparing the two
expressions thus obtained he established a relation between the
various elements of the phenomenon but for a long time afterwards
the question made little progress because there seemed to be hardly
any means of introducing into this study the second principle of
thermodynamics14 it was the memoir of gibbs which at last opened
out this rich domain and enabled it to be rationally exploited as
early as 1886 m duhem showed that the theory of the thermodynamic
potential furnished precise information on solutions or liquid
mixtures he thus discovered over again the famous law on the lowering
of the congelation temperature of solvents which had just been
established by m raoult after a long series of now classic
researches
footnote 14 the second principle referred to has been thus
enunciated in every engine that produces work there is a fall of
temperature and the maximum output of a perfect engineie the
ratio between the heat consumed in work and the heat supplieddepends
only on the extreme temperatures between which the fluid is
evolveddemanet notes de physique exprimentale louvain 1905
fasc 2 p 147 clausius put it in a negative form as thus no
engine can of itself without the aid of external agency transfer
heat from a body at low temperature to a body at a high temperature
cf ganots physics 17th english edition  508ed
in the minds of many persons however grave doubts persisted
solution appeared to be an essentially irreversible phenomenon it was
therefore in all strictness impossible to calculate the entropy of a
solution and consequently to be certain of the value of the
thermodynamic potential the objection would be serious even today
and in calculations what is called the paradox of gibbs would be an
obstacle
we should not hesitate however to apply the phase law to solutions
and this law already gives us the key to a certain number of facts it
puts in evidence for example the part played by the eutectic point
that is to say the point at which to keep to the simple case in
which we have to do with two bodies only the solvent and the solute
the solution is in equilibrium at once with the two possible solids
the dissolved body and the solvent solidified the knowledge of this
point explains the properties of refrigerating mixtures and it is
also one of the most useful for the theory of alloys the scruples of
physicists ought to have been removed on the memorable occasion when
professor van thoff demonstrated that solution can operate reversibly
by reason of the phenomena of osmosis but the experiment can only
succeed in very rare cases and on the other hand professor van
thoff was naturally led to another very bold conception he regarded
the molecule of the dissolved body as a gaseous one and assimilated
solution not as had hitherto been the rule to fusion but to a kind
of vaporization naturally his ideas were not immediately accepted by
the scholars most closely identified with the classic tradition it
may perhaps not be without use to examine here the principles of
professor van thoffs theory
 2 osmosis
osmosis or diffusion through a septum is a phenomenon which has been
known for some time the discovery of it is attributed to the abb
nollet who is supposed to have observed it in 1748 during some
researches on liquids in ebullition a classic experiment by
dutrochet effected about 1830 makes this phenomenon clear into pure
water is plunged the lower part of a vertical tube containing pure
alcohol open at the top and closed at the bottom by a membrane such
as a pigs bladder without any visible perforation in a very short
time it will be found by means of an areometer for instance that the
water outside contains alcohol while the alcohol of the tube pure at
first is now diluted two currents have therefore passed through the
membrane one of water from the outside to the inside and one of
alcohol in the converse direction it is also noted that a difference
in the levels has occurred and that the liquid in the tube now rises
to a considerable height it must therefore be admitted that the flow
of the water has been more rapid than that of the alcohol at the
commencement the water must have penetrated into the tube much more
rapidly than the alcohol left it hence the difference in the levels
and consequently a difference of pressure on the two faces of the
membrane this difference goes on increasing reaches a maximum then
diminishes and vanishes when the diffusion is complete final
equilibrium being then attained
the phenomenon is evidently connected with diffusion if water is very
carefully poured on to alcohol the two layers separate at first
mingle by degrees till a homogeneous substance is obtained the
bladder seems not to have prevented this diffusion from taking place
but it seems to have shown itself more permeable to water than to
alcohol may it not therefore be supposed that there must exist
dividing walls in which this difference of permeability becomes
greater and greater which would be permeable to the solvent and
absolutely impermeable to the solute if this be so the phenomena of
these semipermeable walls as they are termed can be observed in
particularly simple conditions
the answer to this question has been furnished by biologists at which
we cannot be surprised the phenomena of osmosis are naturally of the
first importance in the action of organisms and for a long time have
attracted the attention of naturalists de vries imagined that the
contractions noticed in the protoplasm of cells placed in saline
solutions were due to a phenomenon of osmosis and upon examining
more closely certain peculiarities of cell life various scholars have
demonstrated that living cells are enclosed in membranes permeable to
certain substances and entirely impermeable to others it was
interesting to try to reproduce artificially semipermeable walls
analogous to those thus met with in nature15 and traube and pfeffer
seem to have succeeded in one particular case traube has pointed out
that the very delicate membrane of ferrocyanide of potassium which is
obtained with some difficulty by exposing it to the reaction of
sulphate of copper is permeable to water but will not permit the
passage of the majority of salts pfeffer by producing these walls in
the interstices of a porous porcelain has succeeded in giving them
sufficient rigidity to allow measurements to be made it must be
allowed that unfortunately no physicist or chemist has been as lucky
as these two botanists and the attempts to reproduce semipermeable
walls completely answering to the definition have never given but
mediocre results if however the experimental difficulty has not
been overcome in an entirely satisfactory manner it at least appears
very probable that such walls may nevertheless exist16
footnote 15 see next noteed
footnote 16 m stephane leduc professor of biology of nantes has
made many experiments in this connection and the artificial cells
exhibited by him to the association franaise pour lavancement des
sciences at their meeting at grenoble in 1904 and reproduced in their
actes are particularly noteworthyed
nevertheless in the case of gases there exists an excellent example
of a semipermeable wall and a partition of platinum brought to a
higher than red heat is as shown by m villard in some ingenious
experiments completely impermeable to air and very permeable on the
contrary to hydrogen it can also be experimentally demonstrated that
on taking two recipients separated by such a partition and both
containing nitrogen mixed with varying proportions of hydrogen the
lastnamed gas will pass through the partition in such a way that the
concentrationthat is to say the mass of gas per unit of volume
will become the same on both sides only then will equilibrium be
established and at that moment an excess of pressure will naturally
be produced in that recipient which at the commencement contained
the gas with the smallest quantity of hydrogen
this experiment enables us to anticipate what will happen in a liquid
medium with semipermeable partitions between two recipients one
containing pure water the other say water with sugar in solution
separated by one of these partitions there will be produced merely a
movement of the pure towards the sugared water and following this an
increase of pressure on the side of the last but this increase will
not be without limits at a certain moment the pressure will cease to
increase and will remain at a fixed value which now has a given
direction this is the osmotic pressure
pfeffer demonstrated that for the same substance the osmotic
pressure is proportional to the concentration and consequently in
inverse ratio to the volume occupied by a similar mass of the solute
he gave figures from which it was easy as professor van thoff found
to draw the conclusion that in a constant volume the osmotic
pressure is proportional to the absolute temperature de vries
moreover by his remarks on living cells extended the results which
pfeffer had applied to one case onlythat is to the one that he had
been able to examine experimentally
such are the essential facts of osmosis we may seek to interpret them
and to thoroughly examine the mechanism of the phenomenon but it must
be acknowledged that as regards this point physicists are not
entirely in accord in the opinion of professor nernst the
permeability of semipermeable membranes is simply due to differences
of solubility in one of the substances of the membrane itself other
physicists think it attributable either to the difference in the
dimensions of the molecules of which some might pass through the
pores of the membrane and others be stopped by their relative size or
to these molecules greater or less mobility for others again it is
the capillary phenomena which here act a preponderating part
this last idea is already an old one jager more and professor
traube have all endeavoured to show that the direction and speed of
osmosis are determined by differences in the surfacetensions and
recent experiments especially those of batelli seem to prove that
osmosis establishes itself in the way which best equalizes the
surfacetensions of the liquids on both sides of the partition
solutions possessing the same surfacetension though not in molecular
equilibrium would thus be always in osmotic equilibrium we must not
conceal from ourselves that this result would be in contradiction with
the kinetic theory
 3 application to the theory of solution
if there really exist partitions permeable to one body and impermeable
to another it may be imagined that the homogeneous mixture of these
two bodies might be effected in the converse way it can be easily
conceived in fact that by the aid of osmotic pressure it would be
possible for example to dilute or concentrate a solution by driving
through the partition in one direction or another a certain quantity
of the solvent by means of a pressure kept equal to the osmotic
pressure this is the important fact which professor van t hoff
perceived the existence of such a wall in all possible cases
evidently remains only a very legitimate hypothesisa fact which
ought not to be concealed
relying solely on this postulate professor van t hoff easily
established by the most correct method certain properties of the
solutions of gases in a volatile liquid or of nonvolatile bodies in
a volatile liquid to state precisely the other relations we must
admit in addition the experimental laws discovered by pfeffer but
without any hypothesis it becomes possible to demonstrate the laws of
raoult on the lowering of the vapourtension and of the freezing point
of solutions and also the ratio which connects the heat of fusion
with this decrease
these considerable results can evidently be invoked as a posteriori
proofs of the exactitude of the experimental laws of osmosis they are
not however the only ones that professor van t hoff has obtained by
the same method this illustrious scholar was thus able to find anew
guldberg and waages law on chemical equilibrium at a constant
temperature and to show how the position of the equilibrium changes
when the temperature happens to change
if now we state in conformity with the laws of pfeffer that the
product of the osmotic pressure by the volume of the solution is equal
to the absolute temperature multiplied by a coefficient and then look
for the numerical figure of this latter in a solution of sugar for
instance we find that this value is the same as that of the analogous
coefficient of the characteristic equation of a perfect gas there is
in this a coincidence which has also been utilized in the preceding
thermodynamic calculations it may be purely fortuitous but we can
hardly refrain from finding in it a physical meaning
professor van thoff has considered this coincidence a demonstration
that there exists a strong analogy between a body in solution and a
gas as a matter of fact it may seem that in a solution the
distance between the molecules becomes comparable to the molecular
distances met with in gases and that the molecule acquires the same
degree of liberty and the same simplicity in both phenomena in that
case it seems probable that solutions will be subject to laws
independent of the chemical nature of the dissolved molecule and
comparable to the laws governing gases while if we adopt the kinetic
image for the gas we shall be led to represent to ourselves in a
similar way the phenomena which manifest themselves in a solution
osmotic pressure will then appear to be due to the shock of the
dissolved molecules against the membrane it will come from one side
of this partition to superpose itself on the hydrostatic pressure
which latter must have the same value on both sides
the analogy with a perfect gas naturally becomes much greater as the
solution becomes more diluted it then imitates gas in some other
properties the internal work of the variation of volume is nil and
the specific heat is only a function of the temperature a solution
which is diluted by a reversible method is cooled like a gas which
expands adiabatically17
footnote 17 that is without receiving or emitting any heated
it must however be acknowledged that in other points the analogy
is much less perfect the opinion which sees in solution a phenomenon
resembling fusion and which has left an indelible trace in everyday
language we shall always say to melt sugar in water is certainly
not without foundation certain of the reasons which might be invoked
to uphold this opinion are too evident to be repeated here though
others more recondite might be quoted the fact that the internal
energy generally becomes independent of the concentration when the
dilution reaches even a moderately high value is rather in favour of
the hypothesis of fusion
we must not forget however the continuity of the liquid and gaseous
states and we may consider it in an absolute way a question devoid of
sense to ask whether in a solution the solute is in the liquid or the
gaseous state it is in the fluid state and perhaps in conditions
opposed to those of a body in the state of a perfect gas it is known
of course that in this case the manometrical pressure must be
regarded as very great in relation to the internal pressure which in
the characteristic equation is added to the other may it not seem
possible that in the solution it is on the contrary the internal
pressure which is dominant the manometric pressure becoming of no
account the coincidence of the formulas would thus be verified for
all the characteristic equations are symmetrical with regard to these
two pressures from this point of view the osmotic pressure would be
considered as the result of an attraction between the solvent and the
solute and it would represent the difference between the internal
pressures of the solution and of the pure solvent these hypotheses
are highly interesting and very suggestive but from the way in which
the facts have been set forth it will appear no doubt that there is
no obligation to admit them in order to believe in the legitimacy of
the application of thermodynamics to the phenomena of solution
 4 electrolytic dissociation
from the outset professor van t hoff was brought to acknowledge that
a great number of solutions formed very notable exceptions which were
very irregular in appearance the analogy with gases did not seem to
be maintained for the osmotic pressure had a very different value
from that indicated by the theory everything however came right if
one multiplied by a factor determined according to each case but
greater than unity the constant of the characteristic formula
similar divergences were manifested in the delays observed in
congelation and disappeared when subjected to an analogous
correction
thus the freezingpoint of a normal solution containing a molecule
gramme that is the number of grammes equal to the figure
representing the molecular mass of alcohol or sugar in water falls
185 c if the laws of solution were identically the same for a
solution of seasalt the same depression should be noticed in a
saline solution also containing 1 molecule per litre in fact the
fall reaches 326 and the solution behaves as if it contained not
1 but 175 normal molecules per litre the consideration of the
osmotic pressures would lead to similar observations but we know that
the experiment would be more difficult and less precise
we may wonder whether anything really analogous to this can be met with
in the case of a gas and we are thus led to consider the phenomena of
dissociation18 if we heat a body which in a gaseous state is
capable of dissociationhydriodic acid for exampleat a given
temperature an equilibrium is established between three gaseous bodies
the acid the iodine and the hydrogen the total mass will follow with
fair closeness mariottes law but the characteristic constant will no
longer be the same as in the case of a nondissociated gas we here no
longer have to do with a single molecule since each molecule is in part
dissociated
footnote 18 dissociation must be distinguished from decomposition
which is what occurs when the whole of a particle compound molecule
atom etc breaks up into its component parts in dissociation the
breaking up is only partial and the resultant consists of a mixture
of decomposed and undecomposed parts see ganots physics 17th
english edition  395 for examplesed
the comparison of the two cases leads to the employment of a new image
for representing the phenomenon which has been produced throughout the
saline solution we have introduced a single molecule of salt and
everything occurs as if there were 175 molecules may it not really
be said that the number is 175 because the seasalt is partly
dissociated and a molecule has become transformed into 075 molecule
of sodium 075 of chlorium and 025 of salt
this is a way of speaking which seems at first sight strangely
contradicted by experiment professor van t hoff like other
chemists would certainly have rejectedin fact he did so at first
such a conception if about the same time an illustrious swedish
scholar m arrhenius had not been brought to the same idea by
another road and had not by stating it precisely and modifying it
presented it in an acceptable form
a brief examination will easily show that all the substances which are
exceptions to the laws of van thoff are precisely those which are
capable of conducting electricity when undergoing decompositionthat
is to say are electrolytes the coincidence is absolute and cannot
be simply due to chance
now the phenomena of electrolysis have for a long time forced upon
us an almost necessary image the saline molecule is always
decomposed as we know in the primary phenomenon of electrolysis into
two elements which faraday termed ions secondary reactions no doubt
often come to complicate the question but these are chemical
reactions belonging to the general order of things and have nothing
to do with the electric action working on the solution the simple
phenomenon is always the samedecomposition into two ions followed
by the appearance of one of these ions at the positive and of the
other at the negative electrode but as the very slightest expenditure
of energy is sufficient to produce the commencement of electrolysis
it is necessary to suppose that these two ions are not united by any
force thus the two ions are in a way dissociated clausius who was
the first to represent the phenomena by this symbol supposed in
order not to shock the feelings of chemists too much that this
dissociation only affected an infinitesimal fraction of the total
number of the molecules of the salt and thereby escaped all check
this concession was unfortunate and the hypothesis thus lost the
greater part of its usefulness m arrhenius was bolder and frankly
recognized that dissociation occurs at once in the case of a great
number of molecules and tends to increase more and more as the
solution becomes more dilute it follows the comparison with a gas
which while partially dissociated in an enclosed space becomes
wholly so in an infinite one
m arrhenius was led to adopt this hypothesis by the examination of
experimental results relating to the conductivity of electrolytes in
order to interpret certain facts it has to be recognized that a part
only of the molecules in a saline solution can be considered as
conductors of electricity and that by adding water the number of
molecular conductors is increased this increase too though rapid at
first soon becomes slower and approaches a certain limit which an
infinite dilution would enable it to attain if the conducting
molecules are the dissociated molecules then the dissociation so
long as it is a question of strong acids and salts tends to become
complete in the case of an unlimited dilution
the opposition of a large number of chemists and physicists to the
ideas of m arrhenius was at first very fierce it must be noted with
regret that in france particularly recourse was had to an arm which
scholars often wield rather clumsily they joked about these free ions
in solution and they asked to see this chlorine and this sodium which
swam about the water in a state of liberty but in science as
elsewhere irony is not argument and it soon had to be acknowledged
that the hypothesis of m arrhenius showed itself singularly fertile
and had to be regarded at all events as a very expressive image if
not indeed entirely in conformity with reality
it would certainly be contrary to all experience and even to common
sense itself to suppose that in dissolved chloride of sodium there is
really free sodium if we suppose these atoms of sodium to be
absolutely identical with ordinary atoms but there is a great
difference in the one case the atoms are electrified and carry a
relatively considerable positive charge inseparable from their state
as ions while in the other they are in the neutral state we may
suppose that the presence of this charge brings about modifications as
extensive as one pleases in the chemical properties of the atom thus
the hypothesis will be removed from all discussion of a chemical
order since it will have been made plastic enough beforehand to adapt
itself to all the known facts and if we object that sodium cannot
subsist in water because it instantaneously decomposes the latter the
answer is simply that the sodium ion does not decompose water as does
ordinary sodium
still other objections might be raised which could not be so easily
refuted one to which chemists not unreasonably attached great
importance was thisif a certain quantity of chloride of sodium is
dissociated into chlorine and sodium it should be possible by
diffusion for example which brings out plainly the phenomena of
dissociation in gases to extract from the solution a part either of
the chlorine or of the sodium while the corresponding part of the
other compound would remain this result would be in flagrant
contradiction with the fact that everywhere and always a solution of
salt contains strictly the same proportions of its component elements
m arrhenius answers to this that the electrical forces in ordinary
conditions prevent separation by diffusion or by any other process
professor nernst goes further and has shown that the concentration
currents which are produced when two electrodes of the same substance
are plunged into two unequally concentrated solutions may be
interpreted by the hypothesis that in these particular conditions
the diffusion does bring about a separation of the ions thus the
argument is turned round and the proof supposed to be given of the
incorrectness of the theory becomes a further reason in its favour
it is possible no doubt to adduce a few other experiments which are
not very favourable to m arrheniuss point of view but they are
isolated cases and on the whole his theory has enabled many
isolated facts till then scattered to be coordinated and has
allowed very varied phenomena to be linked together it has also
suggestedand moreover still daily suggestsresearches of the
highest order
in the first place the theory of arrhenius explains electrolysis very
simply the ions which so to speak wander about haphazard and are
uniformly distributed throughout the liquid steer a regular course as
soon as we dip in the trough containing the electrolyte the two
electrodes connected with the poles of the dynamo or generator of
electricity then the charged positive ions travel in the direction of
the electromotive force and the negative ions in the opposite
direction on reaching the electrodes they yield up to them the
charges they carry and thus pass from the state of ion into that of
ordinary atom moreover for the solution to remain in equilibrium
the vanished ions must be immediately replaced by others and thus the
state of ionisation of the electrolyte remains constant and its
conductivity persists
all the peculiarities of electrolysis are capable of interpretation
the phenomena of the transport of ions the fine experiments of m
bouty those of professor kohlrausch and of professor ostwald on
various points in electrolytic conduction all support the theory the
verifications of it can even be quantitative and we can foresee
numerical relations between conductivity and other phenomena the
measurement of the conductivity permits the number of molecules
dissociated in a given solution to be calculated and the number is
thus found to be precisely the same as that arrived at if it is wished
to remove the disagreement between reality and the anticipations which
result from the theory of professor van t hoff the laws of
cryoscopy of tonometry and of osmosis thus again become strict and
no exception to them remains
if the dissociation of salts is a reality and is complete in a dilute
solution any of the properties of a saline solution whatever should
be represented numerically as the sum of three values of which one
concerns the positive ion a second the negative ion and the third
the solvent the properties of the solutions would then be what are
called additive properties numerous verifications may be attempted by
very different roads they generally succeed very well and whether we
measure the electric conductivity the density the specific heats
the index of refraction the power of rotatory polarization the
colour or the absorption spectrum the additive property will
everywhere be found in the solution
the hypothesis so contested at the outset by the chemists is
moreover assuring its triumph by important conquests in the domain of
chemistry itself it permits us to give a vivid explanation of
chemical reaction and for the old motto of the chemists corpora non
agunt nisi soluta it substitutes a modern one it is especially
the ions which react thus for example all salts of iron which
contain iron in the state of ions give similar reactions but salts
such as ferrocyanide of potassium in which iron does not play the
part of an ion never give the characteristic reactions of iron
professor ostwald and his pupils have drawn from the hypothesis of
arrhenius manifold consequences which have been the cause of
considerable progress in physical chemistry professor ostwald has
shown in particular how this hypothesis permits the quantitative
calculation of the conditions of equilibrium of electrolytes and
solutions and especially of the phenomena of neutralization if a
dissolved salt is partly dissociated into ions this solution must be
limited by an equilibrium between the nondissociated molecule and the
two ions resulting from the dissociation and assimilating the
phenomenon to the case of gases we may take for its study the laws of
gibbs and of guldberg and waage the results are generally very
satisfactory and new researches daily furnish new checks
professor nernst who before gave as has been said a remarkable
interpretation of the diffusion of electrolytes has in the direction
pointed out by m arrhenius developed a theory of the entire
phenomena of electrolysis which in particular furnishes a striking
explanation of the mechanism of the production of electromotive force
in galvanic batteries
extending the analogy already so happily invoked between the
phenomena met with in solutions and those produced in gases professor
nernst supposes that metals tend as it were to vaporize when in
presence of a liquid a piece of zinc introduced for example into
pure water gives birth to a few metallic ions these ions become
positively charged while the metal naturally takes an equal charge
but of contrary sign thus the solution and the metal are both
electrified but this sort of vaporization is hindered by
electrostatic attraction and as the charges borne by the ions are
considerable an equilibrium will be established although the number
of ions which enter the solution will be very small
if the liquid instead of being a solvent like pure water contains an
electrolyte it already contains metallic ions the osmotic pressure
of which will be opposite to that of the solution three cases may
then present themselveseither there will be equilibrium or the
electrostatic attraction will oppose itself to the pressure of
solution and the metal will be negatively charged or finally the
attraction will act in the same direction as the pressure and the
metal will become positively and the solution negatively charged
developing this idea professor nernst calculates by means of the
action of the osmotic pressures the variations of energy brought into
play and the value of the differences of potential by the contact of
the electrodes and electrolytes he deduces this from the
electromotive force of a single battery cell which becomes thus
connected with the values of the osmotic pressures or if you will
thanks to the relation discovered by van t hoff with the
concentrations some particularly interesting electrical phenomena
thus become connected with an already very important group and a new
bridge is built which unites two regions long considered foreign to
each other
the recent discoveries on the phenomena produced in gases when
rendered conductors of electricity almost force upon us as we shall
see the idea that there exist in these gases electrified centres
moving through the field and this idea gives still greater
probability to the analogous theory explaining the mechanism of the
conductivity of liquids it will also be useful in order to avoid
confusion to restate with precision this notion of electrolytic ions
and to ascertain their magnitude charge and velocity
the two classic laws of faraday will supply us with important
information the first indicates that the quantity of electricity
passing through the liquid is proportional to the quantity of matter
deposited on the electrodes this leads us at once to the
consideration that in any given solution all the ions possess
individual charges equal in absolute value
the second law may be stated in these terms an atomgramme of metal
carries with it into electrolysis a quantity of electricity
proportionate to its valency19
footnote 19 the valency or atomicity of an element may be defined as
the power it possesses of entering into compounds in a certain fixed
proportion as hydrogen is generally taken as the standard in
practice the valency of an atom is the number of hydrogen atoms it
will combine with or replace thus chlorine and the rest of the
halogens the atoms of which combine with one atom of hydrogen are
called univalent oxygen a bivalent element and so oned
numerous experiments have made known the total mass of hydrogen
capable of carrying one coulomb and it will therefore be possible to
estimate the charge of an ion of hydrogen if the number of atoms of
hydrogen in a given mass be known this last figure is already
furnished by considerations derived from the kinetic theory and
agrees with the one which can be deduced from the study of various
phenomena the result is that an ion of hydrogen having a mass of 13
x 1020 grammes bears a charge of 13 x 1020 electromagnetic
units and the second law will immediately enable the charge of any
other ion to be similarly estimated
the measurements of conductivity joined to certain considerations
relating to the differences of concentration which appear round the
electrode in electrolysis allow the speed of the ions to be
calculated thus in a liquid containing 110th of a hydrogenion per
litre the absolute speed of an ion would be 310ths of a millimetre
per second in a field where the fall of potential would be 1 volt per
centimetre sir oliver lodge who has made direct experiments to
measure this speed has obtained a figure very approximate to this
this value is very small compared to that which we shall meet with in
gases
another consequence of the laws of faraday to which as early as 1881
helmholtz drew attention may be considered as the startingpoint of
certain new doctrines we shall come across later
helmholtz says if we accept the hypothesis that simple bodies are
composed of atoms we are obliged to admit that in the same way
electricity whether positive or negative is composed of elementary
parts which behave like atoms of electricity
the second law seems in fact analogous to the law of multiple
proportions in chemistry and it shows us that the quantities of
electricity carried vary from the simple to the double or treble
according as it is a question of a uni bi or trivalent metal and
as the chemical law leads up to the conception of the material atom
so does the electrolytic law suggest the idea of an electric atom
chapter vi
the ether
 1 the luminiferous ether
it is in the works of descartes that we find the first idea of
attributing those physical phenomena which the properties of matter
fail to explain to some subtle matter which is the receptacle of the
energy of the universe
in our times this idea has had extraordinary luck after having been
eclipsed for two hundred years by the success of the immortal
synthesis of newton it gained an entirely new splendour with fresnel
and his followers thanks to their admirable discoveries the first
stage seemed accomplished the laws of optics were represented by a
single hypothesis marvellously fitted to allow us to anticipate
unknown phenomena and all these anticipations were subsequently fully
verified by experiment but the researches of faraday maxwell and
hertz authorized still greater ambitions and it really seemed that
this medium to which it was agreed to give the ancient name of ether
and which had already explained light and radiant heat would also be
sufficient to explain electricity thus the hope began to take form
that we might succeed in demonstrating the unity of all physical
forces it was thought that the knowledge of the laws relating to the
inmost movements of this ether might give us the key to all phenomena
and might make us acquainted with the method in which energy is stored
up transmitted and parcelled out in its external manifestations
we cannot study here all the problems which are connected with the
physics of the ether to do this a complete treatise on optics would
have to be written and a very lengthy one on electricity i shall
simply endeavour to show rapidly how in the last few years the ideas
relative to the constitution of this ether have evolved and we shall
see if it be possible without selfdelusion to imagine that a single
medium can really allow us to group all the known facts in one
comprehensive arrangement
as constructed by fresnel the hypothesis of the luminous ether which
had so great a struggle at the outset to overcome the stubborn
resistance of the partisans of the then classic theory of emission
seemed on the contrary to possess in the sequel an unshakable
strength lam though a prudent mathematician wrote the
existence of the ethereal fluid is incontestably demonstrated by
the propagation of light through the planetary spaces and by the
explanation so simple and so complete of the phenomena of
diffraction in the wave theory of light and he adds the laws of
double refraction prove with no less certainty that the ether exists
in all diaphanous media thus the ether was no longer an hypothesis
but in some sort a tangible reality but the ethereal fluid of which
the existence was thus proclaimed has some singular properties
were it only a question of explaining rectilinear propagation
reflexion refraction diffraction and interferences notwithstanding
grave difficulties at the outset and the objections formulated by
laplace and poisson some of which though treated somewhat lightly at
the present day have not lost all value we should be under no
obligation to make any hypothesis other than that of the undulations
of an elastic medium without deciding in advance anything as to the
nature and direction of the vibrations
this medium would naturallysince it exists in what we call the
voidbe considered as imponderable it may be compared to a fluid of
negligible masssince it offers no appreciable resistance to the
motion of the planetsbut is endowed with an enormous elasticity
because the velocity of the propagation of light is considerable it
must be capable of penetrating into all transparent bodies and of
retaining there so to speak a constant elasticity but must there
become condensed since the speed of propagation in these bodies is
less than in a vacuum such properties belong to no material gas even
the most rarefied but they admit of no essential contradiction and
that is the important point20
footnote 20 since this was written however men of science have
become less unanimous than they formerly were on this point the
veteran chemist professor mendeleff has given reasons for thinking
that the ether is an inert gas with an atomic weight a million times
less than that of hydrogen and a velocity of 2250 kilometres per
second principles of chemistry eng ed 1905 vol ii p 526
on the other hand the wellknown physicist dr ah bucherer speaking
at the naturforscherversammlung held at stuttgart in 1906 declared
his disbelief in the existence of the ether which he thought could
not be reconciled at once with the maxwellian theory and the known
factsed
it was the study of the phenomena of polarization which led fresnel to
his bold conception of transverse vibrations and subsequently induced
him to penetrate further into the constitution of the ether we know
the experiment of arago on the noninterference of polarized rays in
rectangular planes while two systems of waves proceeding from the
same source of natural light and propagating themselves in nearly
parallel directions increase or become destroyed according to whether
the nature of the superposed waves are of the same or of contrary
signs the waves of the rays polarized in perpendicular planes on the
other hand can never interfere with each other whatever the
difference of their course the intensity of the light is always the
sum of the intensity of the two rays
fresnel perceived that this experiment absolutely compels us to reject
the hypothesis of longitudinal vibrations acting along the line of
propagation in the direction of the rays to explain it it must of
necessity be admitted on the contrary that the vibrations are
transverse and perpendicular to the ray verdet could say in all
truth it is not possible to deny the transverse direction of
luminous vibrations without at the same time denying that light
consists of an undulatory movement
such vibrations do not and cannot exist in any medium resembling a
fluid the characteristic of a fluid is that its different parts can
displace themselves with regard to one another without any reaction
appearing so long as a variation of volume is not produced there
certainly may exist as we have seen certain traces of rigidity in a
liquid but we cannot conceive such a thing in a body infinitely more
subtle than rarefied gas among material bodies a solid alone really
possesses the rigidity sufficient for the production within it of
transverse vibrations and for their maintenance during their
propagation
since we have to attribute such a property to the ether we may add
that on this point it resembles a solid and lord kelvin has shown
that this solid would be much more rigid than steel this conclusion
produces great surprise in all who hear it for the first time and it
is not rare to hear it appealed to as an argument against the actual
existence of the ether it does not seem however that such an
argument can be decisive there is no reason for supposing that the
ether ought to be a sort of extension of the bodies we are accustomed
to handle its properties may astonish our ordinary way of thinking
but this rather unscientific astonishment is not a reason for doubting
its existence real difficulties would appear only if we were led to
attribute to the ether not singular properties which are seldom found
united in the same substance but properties logically contradictory
in short however odd such a medium may appear to us it cannot be
said that there is any absolute incompatibility between its
attributes
it would even be possible if we wished to suggest images capable of
representing these contrary appearances various authors have done so
thus m boussinesq assumes that the ether behaves like a very
rarefied gas in respect of the celestial bodies because these last
move while bathed in it in all directions and relatively slowly
while they permit it to retain so to speak its perfect homogeneity
on the other hand its own undulations are so rapid that so far as
they are concerned the conditions become very different and its
fluidity has one might say no longer the time to come in hence its
rigidity alone appears
another consequence very important in principle of the fact that
vibrations of light are transverse has been well put in evidence by
fresnel he showed how we have in order to understand the action
which excites without condensation the sliding of successive layers of
the ether during the propagation of a vibration to consider the
vibrating medium as being composed of molecules separated by finite
distances certain authors it is true have proposed theories in
which the action at a distance of these molecules are replaced by
actions of contact between parallelepipeds sliding over one another
but at bottom these two points of view both lead us to conceive the
ether as a discontinuous medium like matter itself the ideas
gathered from the most recent experiments also bring us to the same
conclusion
 2 radiations
in the ether thus constituted there are therefore propagated
transverse vibrations regarding which all experiments in optics
furnish very precise information the amplitude of these vibrations is
exceedingly small even in relation to the wavelength small as these
last are if in fact the amplitude of the vibrations acquired a
noticeable value in comparison with the wavelength the speed of
propagation should increase with the amplitude yet in spite of some
curious experiments which seem to establish that the speed of light
does alter a little with its intensity we have reason to believe
that as regards light the amplitude of the oscillations in relation
to the wavelength is incomparably less than in the case of sound
it has become the custom to characterise each vibration by the path
which the vibratory movement traverses during the space of a
vibrationby the length of wave in a wordrather than by the
duration of the vibration itself to measure wavelengths the methods
must be employed to which i have already alluded on the subject of
measurements of length professor michelson on the one hand and mm
perot and fabry on the other have devised exceedingly ingenious
processes which have led to results of really unhopedfor precision
the very exact knowledge also of the speed of the propagation of light
allows the duration of a vibration to be calculated when once the
wavelength is known it is thus found that in the case of visible
light the number of the vibrations from the end of the violet to the
infrared varies from four hundred to two hundred billions per second
this gamut is not however the only one the ether can give for a
long time we have known ultraviolet radiations still more rapid and
on the other hand infrared ones more slow while in the last few
years the field of known radiations has been singularly extended in
both directions
it is to m rubens and his fellowworkers that are due the most
brilliant conquests in the matter of great wavelengths he had
remarked that in their study the difficulty of research proceeds
from the fact that the extreme waves of the infrared spectrum only
contain a small part of the total energy emitted by an incandescent
body so that if for the purpose of study they are further dispersed
by a prism or a grating the intensity at any one point becomes so
slight as to be no longer observable his original idea was to obtain
without prism or grating a homogeneous pencil of great wavelength
sufficiently intense to be examined for this purpose the radiant
source used was a strip of platinum covered with fluorine or powdered
quartz which emits numerous radiations close to two bands of linear
absorption in the absorption spectra of fluorine and quartz one of
which is situated in the infrared the radiations thus emitted are
several times reflected on fluorine or on quartz as the case may be
and as in proximity to the bands the absorption is of the order of
that of metallic bodies for luminous rays we no longer meet in the
pencil several times reflected or in the rays remaining after this
kind of filtration with any but radiations of great wavelength
thus for instance in the case of the quartz in the neighbourhood of
a radiation corresponding to a wavelength of 85 microns the
absorption is thirty times greater in the region of the band than in
the neighbouring region and consequently after three reflexions
while the corresponding radiations will not have been weakened the
neighbouring waves will be so on the contrary in the proportion of 1
to 27000
with mirrors of rock salt and of sylvine21 there have been obtained
by taking an incandescent gas light auer as source radiations
extending as far as 70 microns and these last are the greatest
wavelengths observed in optical phenomena these radiations are
largely absorbed by the vapour of water and it is no doubt owing to
this absorption that they are not found in the solar spectrum on the
other hand they easily pass through guttapercha indiarubber and
insulating substances in general
footnote 21 a natural chlorate of potassium generally of volcanic
origined
at the opposite end of the spectrum the knowledge of the ultraviolet
regions has been greatly extended by the researches of lenard these
extremely rapid radiations have been shown by that eminent physicist
to occur in the light of the electric sparks which flash between two
metal points and which are produced by a large induction coil with
condenser and a wehnelt break professor schumann has succeeded in
photographing them by depositing bromide of silver directly on glass
plates without fixing it with gelatine and he has by the same
process photographed in the spectrum of hydrogen a ray with a
wavelength of only 01 micron
the spectroscope was formed entirely of fluorspar and a vacuum had
been created in it for these radiations are extremely absorbable by
the air
notwithstanding the extreme smallness of the luminous wavelengths it
has been possible after numerous fruitless trials to obtain
stationary waves analogous to those which in the case of sound are
produced in organ pipes the marvellous application m lippmann has
made of these waves to completely solve the problem of photography in
colours is well known this discovery so important in itself and so
instructive since it shows us how the most delicate anticipations of
theory may be verified in all their consequences and lead the
physicist to the solution of the problems occurring in practice has
justly become popular and there is therefore no need to describe it
here in detail
professor wiener obtained stationary waves some little while before m
lippmanns discovery in a layer of a sensitive substance having a
grain sufficiently small in relation to the length of wave his aim
was to solve a question of great importance to a complete knowledge of
the ether fresnel founded his theory of double refraction and
reflexion by transparent surfaces on the hypothesis that the
vibration of a ray of polarized light is perpendicular to the plane of
polarization but neumann has proposed on the contrary a theory in
which he recognizes that the luminous vibration is in this very plane
he rather supposes in opposition to fresnels idea that the density
of the ether remains the same in all media while its coefficient of
elasticity is variable
very remarkable experiments on dispersion by m carvallo prove indeed
that the idea of fresnel was if not necessary for us to adopt at
least the more probable of the two but apart from this indication
and contrary to the hypothesis of neumann the two theories from the
point of view of the explanation of all known facts really appear to
be equivalent are we then in presence of two mechanical explanations
different indeed but nevertheless both adaptable to all the facts
and between which it will always be impossible to make a choice or
on the contrary shall we succeed in realising an experimentum
crucis an experiment at the point where the two theories cross
which will definitely settle the question
professor wiener thought he could draw from his experiment a firm
conclusion on the point in dispute he produced stationary waves with
light polarized at an angle of 4522 and established that when
light is polarized in the plane of incidence the fringes persist but
that on the other hand they disappear when the light is polarized
perpendicularly to this plane if it be admitted that a photographic
impression results from the active force of the vibratory movement of
the ether the question is in fact completely elucidated and the
discrepancy is abolished in fresnels favour
footnote 22 that is to say he reflected the beam of polarized light
by a mirror placed at that angle see turpain leons lementaires de
physique t ii p 311 for details of the experimented
mh poincar has pointed out however that we know nothing as to the
mechanism of the photographic impression we cannot consider it
evident that it is the kinetic energy of the ether which produces the
decomposition of the sensitive salt and if on the contrary we
suppose it to be due to the potential energy all the conclusions are
reversed and neumanns idea triumphs
recently a very clever physicist m cotton especially known for his
skilful researches in the domain of optics has taken up anew the
study of stationary waves he has made very precise quantitative
experiments and has demonstrated in his turn that it is impossible
even with spherical waves to succeed in determining on which of the
two vectors which have to be regarded in all theories of light on the
subject of polarization phenomena the luminous intensity and the
chemical action really depend this question therefore no longer
exists for those physicists who admit that luminous vibrations are
electrical oscillations whatever then the hypothesis formed
whether it be electric force or on the contrary magnetic force which
we place in the plane of polarization the mode of propagation
foreseen will always be in accord with the facts observed
 3 the electromagnetic ether
the idea of attributing the phenomena of electricity to perturbations
produced in the medium which transmits the light is already of old
standing and the physicists who witnessed the triumph of fresnels
theories could not fail to conceive that this fluid which fills the
whole of space and penetrates into all bodies might also play a
preponderant part in electrical actions some even formed too hasty
hypotheses on this point for the hour had not arrived when it was
possible to place them on a sufficiently sound basis and the known
facts were not numerous enough to give the necessary precision
the founders of modern electricity also thought it wiser to adopt
with regard to this science the attitude taken by newton in
connection with gravitation in the first place to observe facts to
vary the circumstances of these as much as possible to accompany this
first work by precise measurements in order to deduce from them
general laws founded solely on experiment and to deduce from these
laws independently of all hypotheses on the nature of the forces
producing the phenomena the mathematical value of these forcesthat
is to say the formula representing them such was the system pursued
by newton it has in general been adopted in france by the scholars
to whom physics owe the great progress made of late years and it has
served as my guide in all my researches on electrodynamic
phenomena it is for this reason that i have avoided speaking of
the ideas i may have on the nature of the cause of the force emanating
from voltaic conductors
thus did ampre express himself the illustrious physicist rightly
considered the results obtained by him through following this wise
method as worthy of comparison with the laws of attraction but he
knew that when this first haltingplace was reached there was still
further to go and that the evolution of ideas must necessarily
continue
with whatever physical cause he adds we may wish to connect the
phenomena produced by electrodynamic action the formula i have
obtained will always remain the expression of the facts and he
explicitly indicated that if one could succeed in deducing his formula
from the consideration of the vibrations of a fluid distributed
through space an enormous step would have been taken in this
department of physics he added however that this research appeared
to him premature and would change nothing in the results of his work
since to accord with facts the hypothesis adopted would always have
to agree with the formula which exactly represents them
it is not devoid of interest to observe that ampre himself
notwithstanding his caution really formed some hypotheses and
recognized that electrical phenomena were governed by the laws of
mechanics yet the principles of newton then appeared to be
unshakable
faraday was the first to demonstrate by clear experiment the
influence of the media in electricity and magnetic phenomena and he
attributed this influence to certain modifications in the ether which
these media enclose his fundamental conception was to reject action
at a distance and to localize in the ether the energy whose evolution
is the cause of the actions manifested as for example in the
discharge of a condenser
consider the barrel of a pump placed in a vacuum and closed by a
piston at each end and let us introduce between these a certain mass
of air the two pistons through the elastic force of the gas repel
each other with a force which according to the law of mariotte
varies in inverse ratio to the distance the method favoured by ampre
would first of all allow this law of repulsion between the two pistons
to be discovered even if the existence of a gas enclosed in the
barrel of the pump were unsuspected and it would then be natural to
localize the potential energy of the system on the surface of the two
pistons but if the phenomenon is more carefully examined we shall
discover the presence of the air and we shall understand that every
part of the volume of this air could if it were drawn off into a
recipient of equal volume carry away with it a fraction of the energy
of the system and that consequently this energy belongs really to the
air and not to the pistons which are there solely for the purpose of
enabling this energy to manifest its existence
faraday made in some sort an equivalent discovery when he perceived
that the electrical energy belongs not to the coatings of the
condenser but to the dielectric which separates them his audacious
views revealed to him a new world but to explore this world a surer
and more patient method was needed
maxwell succeeded in stating with precision certain points of
faradays ideas and he gave them the mathematical form which often
wrongly impresses physicists but which when it exactly encloses a
theory is a certain proof that this theory is at least coherent and
logical23
footnote 23 it will no doubt be a shock to those whom professor
henry armstrong has lately called the mathematicallyminded to find
a member of the poincar family speaking disrespectfully of the
science they have done so much to illustrate one may perhaps compare
the expression in the text with m henri poincars remark in his last
allocution to the acadmie des sciences that mathematics are
sometimes a nuisance and even a danger when they induce us to affirm
more than we know comptesrendus 17th december 1906
the work of maxwell is overelaborated complex difficult to read
and often illunderstood even at the present day maxwell is more
concerned in discovering whether it is possible to give an explanation
of electrical and magnetic phenomena which shall be founded on the
mechanical properties of a single medium than in stating this
explanation in precise terms he is aware that if we could succeed in
constructing such an interpretation it would be easy to propose an
infinity of others entirely equivalent from the point of view of the
experimentally verifiable consequences and his especial ambition is
therefore to extract from the premises a general view and to place in
evidence something which would remain the common property of all the
theories
he succeeded in showing that if the electrostatic energy of an
electromagnetic field be considered to represent potential energy and
its electrodynamic the kinetic energy it becomes possible to satisfy
both the principle of least action and that of the conservation of
energy from that momentif we eliminate a few difficulties which
exist regarding the stability of the solutionsthe possibility of
finding mechanical explanations of electromagnetic phenomena must be
considered as demonstrated he thus succeeded moreover in stating
precisely the notion of two electric and magnetic fields which
are produced in all points of space and which are strictly
interconnected since the variation of the one immediately and
compulsorily gives birth to the other
from this hypothesis he deduced that in the medium where this energy
is localized an electromagnetic wave is propagated with a velocity
equal to the relation of the units of electric mass in the
electromagnetic and electrostatic systems now experiments made known
since his time have proved that this relation is numerically equal to
the speed of light and the more precise experiments made in
consequenceamong which should be cited the particularly careful ones
of m max abrahamhave only rendered the coincidence still more
complete
it is natural henceforth to suppose that this medium is identical with
the luminous ether and that a luminous wave is an electromagnetic
wavethat is to say a succession of alternating currents which
exist in the dielectric and even in the void and possess an enormous
frequency inasmuch as they change their direction thousands of
billions of times per second and by reason of this frequency produce
considerable induction effects maxwell did not admit the existence of
open currents to his mind therefore an electrical vibration could
not produce condensations of electricity it was in consequence
necessarily transverse and thus coincided with the vibration of
fresnel while the corresponding magnetic vibration was perpendicular
to it and would coincide with the luminous vibration of neumann
maxwells theory thus establishes a close correlation between the
phenomena of the luminous and those of the electromagnetic waves or
we might even say the complete identity of the two but it does not
follow from this that we ought to regard the variation of an electric
field produced at some one point as necessarily consisting of a real
displacement of the ether round that point the idea of thus bringing
electrical phenomena back to the mechanics of the ether is not then
forced upon us and the contrary idea even seems more probable it is
not the optics of fresnel which absorbs the science of electricity it
is rather the optics which is swallowed up by a more general theory
the attempts of popularizers who endeavour to represent in all their
details the mechanism of the electric phenomena thus appear vain
enough and even puerile it is useless to find out to what material
body the ether may be compared if we content ourselves with seeing in
it a medium of which at every point two vectors define the
properties
for a long time therefore we could remark that the theory of fresnel
simply supposed a medium in which something periodical was propagated
without its being necessary to admit this something to be a movement
but we had to wait not only for maxwell but also for hertz before
this idea assumed a really scientific shape hertz insisted on the
fact that the six equations of the electric field permit all the
phenomena to be anticipated without its being necessary to construct
one hypothesis or another and he put these equations into a very
symmetrical form which brings completely in evidence the perfect
reciprocity between electrical and magnetic actions he did yet more
for he brought to the ideas of maxwell the most striking confirmation
by his memorable researches on electric oscillations
 4 electrical oscillations
the experiments of hertz are well known we know how the bonn
physicist developed by means of oscillating electric discharges
displacement currents and induction effects in the whole of the space
round the sparkgap and how he excited by induction at some point in
a wire a perturbation which afterwards is propagated along the wire
and how a resonator enabled him to detect the effect produced
the most important point made evident by the observation of
interference phenomena and subsequently verified directly by m
blondlot is that the electromagnetic perturbation is propagated with
the speed of light and this result condemns for ever all the
hypotheses which fail to attribute any part to the intervening media
in the propagation of an induction phenomenon
if the inducing action were in fact to operate directly between the
inducing and the induced circuits the propagation should be
instantaneous for if an interval were to occur between the moment
when the cause acted and the one when the effect was produced during
this interval there would no longer be anything anywhere since the
intervening medium does not come into play and the phenomenon would
then disappear
leaving on one side the manifold but purely electrical consequences of
this and the numerous researches relating to the production or to the
properties of the wavessome of which those of mm sarrazin and de
la rive righi turpain lebedeff decombe barbillon drude gutton
lamotte lecher etc are however of the highest orderi shall
only mention here the studies more particularly directed to the
establishment of the identity of the electromagnetic and the luminous
waves
the only differences which subsist are necessarily those due to the
considerable discrepancy which exists between the durations of the
periods of these two categories of waves the length of wave
corresponding to the first sparkgap of hertz was about 6 metres and
the longest waves perceptible by the retina are 710 of a micron24
footnote 24 see footnote 3
these radiations are so far apart that it is not astonishing that
their properties have not a perfect similitude thus phenomena like
those of diffraction which are negligible in the ordinary conditions
under which light is observed may here assume a preponderating
importance to play the part for example with the hertzian waves
which a mirror 1 millimetre square plays with regard to light would
require a colossal mirror which would attain the size of a
myriametre25 square
footnote 25 ie 10000 metresed
the efforts of physicists have today however filled up in great
part this interval and from both banks at once they have laboured to
build a bridge between the two domains we have seen how rubens showed
us calorific rays 60 metres long on the other hand mm lecher bose
and lampa have succeeded one after the other in gradually obtaining
oscillations with shorter and shorter periods there have been
produced and are now being studied electromagnetic waves of four
millimetres and the gap subsisting in the spectrum between the rays
left undetected by sylvine and the radiations of m lampa now hardly
comprise more than five octavesthat is to say an interval
perceptibly equal to that which separates the rays observed by m
rubens from the last which are evident to the eye
the analogy then becomes quite close and in the remaining rays the
properties so to speak characteristic of the hertzian waves begin
to appear for these waves as we have seen the most transparent
bodies are the most perfect electrical insulators while bodies still
slightly conducting are entirely opaque the index of refraction of
these substances tends in the case of great wavelengths to become as
the theory anticipates nearly the square root of the dielectric
constant
mm rubens and nichols have even produced with the waves which remain
phenomena of electric resonance quite similar to those which an
italian scholar m garbasso obtained with electric waves this
physicist showed that if the electric waves are made to impinge on a
flat wooden stand on which are a series of resonators parallel to
each other and uniformly arranged these waves are hardly reflected
save in the case where the resonators have the same period as the
sparkgap if the remaining rays are allowed to fall on a glass plate
silvered and divided by a diamond fixed on a dividing machine into
small rectangles of equal dimensions there will be observed
variations in the reflecting power according to the orientation of the
rectangles under conditions entirely comparable with the experiment
of garbasso
in order that the phenomenon be produced it is necessary that the
remaining waves should be previously polarized this is because in
fact the mechanism employed to produce the electric oscillations
evidently gives out vibrations which occur on a single plane and are
subsequently polarized
we cannot therefore entirely assimilate a radiation proceeding from a
sparkgap to a ray of natural light for the synthesis of light to be
realized still other conditions must be complied with during a
luminous impression the direction and the phase change millions of
times in the vibration sensible to the retina yet the damping of this
vibration is very slow with the hertzian oscillations all these
conditions are changedthe damping is very rapid but the direction
remains invariable
every time however that we deal with general phenomena which are
independent of these special conditions the parallelism is perfect
and with the waves we have put in evidence the reflexion refraction
total reflexion double reflexion rotatory polarization dispersion
and the ordinary interferences produced by rays travelling in the same
direction and crossing each other at a very acute angle or the
interferences analogous to those which wiener observed with rays of
the contrary direction
a very important consequence of the electromagnetic theory foreseen by
maxwell is that the luminous waves which fall on a surface must
exercise on this surface a pressure equal to the radiant energy which
exists in the unit of volume of the surrounding space m lebedeff a
few years ago allowed a sheaf of rays from an arc lamp to fall on a
deflection radiometer26 and thus succeeded in revealing the
existence of this pressure its value is sufficient in the case of
matter of little density and finely divided to reduce and even change
into repulsion the attractive action exercised on bodies by the sun
this is a fact formerly conjectured by faye and must certainly play a
great part in the deformation of the heads of comets
footnote 26 by this m poincar appears to mean a radiometer in
which the vanes are not entirely free to move as in the radiometer of
crookes but are suspended by one or two threads as in the instrument
devised by professor poyntinged
more recently mm nichols and hull have undertaken experiments on
this point they have measured not only the pressure but also the
energy of the radiation by means of a special bolometer they have
thus arrived at numerical verifications which are entirely in
conformity with the calculations of maxwell
the existence of these pressures may be otherwise foreseen even apart
from the electromagnetic theory by adding to the theory of
undulations the principles of thermodynamics bartoli and more
recently dr larmor have shown in fact that if these pressures did
not exist it would be possible without any other phenomenon to pass
heat from a cold into a warm body and thus transgress the principle
of carnot
 5 the x rays
it appears today quite probable that the x rays should be classed
among the phenomena which have their seat in the luminous ether
doubtless it is not necessary to recall here how in december 1895
rntgen having wrapped in black paper a crookes tube in action
observed that a fluorescent platinocyanide of barium screen placed in
the neighbourhood had become visible in the dark and that a
photographic plate had received an impress the rays which come from
the tube in conditions now well known are not deviated by a magnet
and as m curie and m sagnac have conclusively shown they carry no
electric charge they are subject to neither reflection nor
refraction and very precise and very ingenious measurements by m
gouy have shown that in their case the refraction index of the
various bodies cannot be more than a millionth removed from unity
we knew from the outset that there existed various x rays differing
from each other as for instance the colours of the spectrum and
these are distinguished from each other by their unequal power of
passing through substances m sagnac particularly has shown that
there can be obtained a gradually decreasing scale of more or less
absorbable rays so that the greater part of their photographic action
is stopped by a simple sheet of black paper these rays figure among
the secondary rays discovered as is known by this ingenious
physicist the x rays falling on matter are thus subjected to
transformations which may be compared to those which the phenomena of
luminescence produce on the ultraviolet rays
m benoist has founded on the transparency of matter to the rays a
sure and practical method of allowing them to be distinguished and
has thus been enabled to define a specific character analogous to the
colour of the rays of light it is probable also that the different
rays do not transport individually the same quantity of energy we
have not yet obtained on this point precise results but it is roughly
known since the experiments of mm rutherford and mclung what
quantity of energy corresponds to a pencil of x rays these physicists
have found that this quantity would be on an average five hundred
times larger than that brought by an analogous pencil of solar light
to the surface of the earth what is the nature of this energy the
question does not appear to have been yet solved
it certainly appears according to professors haga and wind and to
professor sommerfeld that with the x rays curious experiments of
diffraction may be produced dr barkla has shown also that they can
manifest true polarization the secondary rays emitted by a metallic
surface when struck by x rays vary in fact in intensity when the
position of the plane of incidence round the primary pencil is
changed various physicists have endeavoured to measure the speed of
propagation but it seems more and more probable that it is very
nearly that of light27
footnote 27 see especially the experiments of professor e marx
vienna annalen der physik vol xx no 9 of 1906 pp 677 et
seq which seem conclusive on this pointed
i must here leave out the description of a crowd of other experiments
some very interesting researches by m brunhes m broca m
colardeau m villard in france and by many others abroad have
permitted the elucidation of several interesting problems relative to
the duration of the emission or to the best disposition to be adopted
for the production of the rays the only point which will detain us is
the important question as to the nature of the x rays themselves the
properties which have just been brought to mind are those which appear
essential and which every theory must reckon with
the most natural hypothesis would be to consider the rays as
ultraviolet radiations of very short wavelength or radiations which
are in a manner ultraultraviolet this interpretation can still at
this present moment be maintained and the researches of mm buisson
righi lenard and merrit stewart have even established that rays of
very short wavelengths produce on metallic conductors from the point
of view of electrical phenomena effects quite analogous to those of
the x rays another resemblance results also from the experiments by
which m perreau established that these rays act on the electric
resistance of selenium new and valuable arguments have thus added
force to those who incline towards a theory which has the merit of
bringing a new phenomenon within the pale of phenomena previously
known
nevertheless the shortest ultraviolet radiations such as those of m
schumann are still capable of refraction by quartz and this
difference constitutes in the minds of many physicists a serious
enough reason to decide them to reject the more simple hypothesis
moreover the rays of schumann are as we have seen extraordinarily
absorbableso much so that they have to be observed in a vacuum the
most striking property of the x rays is on the contrary the facility
with which they pass through obstacles and it is impossible not to
attach considerable importance to such a difference
some attribute this marvellous radiation to longitudinal vibrations
which as m duhem has shown would be propagated in dielectric media
with a speed equal to that of light but the most generally accepted
idea is the one formulated from the first by sir george stokes and
followed up by professor wiechert according to this theory the x rays
should be due to a succession of independent pulsations of the ether
starting from the points where the molecules projected by the cathode
of the crookes tube meet the anticathode these pulsations are not
continuous vibrations like the radiations of the spectrum they are
isolated and extremely short they are besides transverse like the
undulations of light and the theory shows that they must be
propagated with the speed of light they should present neither
refraction nor reflection but under certain conditions they may be
subject to the phenomena of diffraction all these characteristics are
found in the rntgen rays
professor jj thomson adopts an analogous idea and states the
precise way in which the pulsations may be produced at the moment when
the electrified particles forming the cathode rays suddenly strike the
anticathode wall the electromagnetic induction behaves in such a way
that the magnetic field is not annihilated when the particle stops
and the new field produced which is no longer in equilibrium is
propagated in the dielectric like an electric pulsation the electric
and magnetic pulsations excited by this mechanism may give birth to
effects similar to those of light their slight amplitude however is
the cause of there here being neither refraction nor diffraction
phenomena save in very special conditions if the cathode particle is
not stopped in zero time the pulsation will take a greater amplitude
and be in consequence more easily absorbable to this is probably to
be attributed the differences which may exist between different tubes
and different rays
it is right to add that some authors notwithstanding the proved
impossibility of deviating them in a magnetic field have not
renounced the idea of comparing them with the cathode rays they
suppose for instance that the rays are formed by electrons animated
with so great a velocity that their inertia conformably with theories
which i shall examine later no longer permit them to be stopped in
their course this is for instance the theory upheld by mr
sutherland we know too that to m gustave le bon they represent the
extreme limit of material things one of the last stages before the
vanishing of matter on its return to the ether
everyone has heard of the n rays whose name recalls the town of
nancy where they were discovered in some of their singular
properties they are akin to the x rays while in others they are
widely divergent from them
m blondlot one of the masters of contemporary physics deeply
respected by all who know him admired by everyone for the penetration
of his mind and the author of works remarkable for the originality
and sureness of his method discovered them in radiations emitted from
various sources such as the sun an incandescent light a nernst
lamp and even bodies previously exposed to the suns rays the
essential property which allows them to be revealed is their action on
a small induction spark of which they increase the brilliancy this
phenomenon is visible to the eye and is rendered objective by
photography
various other physicists and numbers of physiologists following the
path opened by m blondlot published during 1903 and 1904 manifold
but often rather hasty memoirs in which they related the results of
their researches which do not appear to have been always conducted
with the accuracy desirable these results were most strange they
seemed destined to revolutionise whole regions not only of the domain
of physics but likewise of the biological sciences unfortunately the
method of observation was always founded on the variations in
visibility of the spark or of a phosphorescent substance and it soon
became manifest that these variations were not perceptible to all
eyes
no foreign experimenter has succeeded in repeating the experiments
while in france many physicists have failed and hence the question
has much agitated public opinion are we face to face with a very
singular case of suggestion or is special training and particular
dispositions required to make the phenomenon apparent it is not
possible at the present moment to declare the problem solved but
very recent experiments by m gutton and a note by m mascart have
reanimated the confidence of those who hoped that such a scholar as m
blondlot could not have been deluded by appearances however these
last proofs in favour of the existence of the rays have themselves
been contested and have not succeeded in bringing conviction to
everyone
it seems very probable indeed that certain of the most singular
conclusions arrived at by certain authors on the subject will lapse
into deserved oblivion but negative experiments prove nothing in a
case like this and the fact that most experimenters have failed where
m blondlot and his pupils have succeeded may constitute a
presumption but cannot be regarded as a demonstrative argument hence
we must still wait it is exceedingly possible that the illustrious
physicist of nancy may succeed in discovering objective actions of the
n rays which shall be indisputable and may thus establish on a firm
basis a discovery worthy of those others which have made his name so
justly celebrated
according to m blondlot the n rays can be polarised refracted and
dispersed while they have wavelengths comprised within 0030 micron
and 0760 micronthat is to say between an eighth and a fifth of
that found for the extreme ultraviolet rays they might be perhaps
simply rays of a very short period their existence stripped of the
parasitical and somewhat singular properties sought to be attributed
to them would thus appear natural enough it would moreover be
extremely important and lead no doubt to most curious applications
it can be conceived in fact that such rays might serve to reveal
what occurs in those portions of matter whose too minute dimensions
escape microscopic examination on account of the phenomena of
diffraction
from whatever point of view we look at it and whatever may be the
fate of the discovery the history of the n rays is particularly
instructive and must give food for reflection to those interested in
questions of scientific methods
 6 the ether and gravitation
the striking success of the hypothesis of the ether in optics has in
our own days strengthened the hope of being able to explain by an
analogous representation the action of gravitation
for a long time philosophers who rejected the idea that ponderability
is a primary and essential quality of all bodies have sought to reduce
their weight to pressures exercised in a very subtle fluid this was
the conception of descartes and was perhaps the true idea of newton
himself newton points out in many passages that the laws he had
discovered were independent of the hypotheses that could be formed on
the way in which universal attraction was produced but that with
sufficient experiments the true cause of this attraction might one day
be reached in the preface to the second edition of the optics he
writes to prove that i have not considered weight as a universal
property of bodies i have added a question as to its cause
preferring this form of question because my interpretation does not
entirely satisfy me in the absence of experiment and he puts the
question in this shape is not this medium the ether more rarefied
in the interior of dense bodies like the sun the planets the comets
than in the empty spaces which separate them passing from these
bodies to great distances does it not become continually denser and
in that way does it not produce the weight of these great bodies with
regard to each other and of their parts with regard to these bodies
each body tending to leave the most dense for the most rarefied
parts
evidently this view is incomplete but we may endeavour to state it
precisely if we admit that this medium the properties of which would
explain the attraction is the same as the luminous ether we may
first ask ourselves whether the action of gravitation is itself also
due to oscillations some authors have endeavoured to found a theory
on this hypothesis but we are immediately brought face to face with
very serious difficulties gravity appears in fact to present quite
exceptional characteristics no agent not even those which depend
upon the ether such as light and electricity has any influence on
its action or its direction all bodies are so to speak absolutely
transparent to universal attraction and no experiment has succeeded
in demonstrating that its propagation is not instantaneous from
various astronomical observations laplace concluded that its
velocity in any case must exceed fifty million times that of light
it is subject neither to reflection nor to refraction it is
independent of the structure of bodies and not only is it
inexhaustible but also as is pointed out according to m hannequin
by an english scholar james croll the distribution of the effects of
the attracting force of a mass over the manifold particles which may
successively enter the field of its action in no way diminishes the
attraction it exercises on each of them respectively a thing which is
seen nowhere else in nature
nevertheless it is possible by means of certain hypotheses to
construct interpretations whereby the appropriate movements of an
elastic medium should explain the facts clearly enough but these
movements are very complex and it seems almost inconceivable that the
same medium could possess simultaneously the state of movement
corresponding to the transmission of a luminous phenomenon and that
constantly imposed on it by the transmission of gravitation
another celebrated hypothesis was devised by lesage of geneva lesage
supposed space to be overrun in all directions by currents of
ultramundane corpuscles this hypothesis contested by maxwell is
interesting it might perhaps be taken up again in our days and it is
not impossible that the assimilation of these corpuscles to electrons
might give a satisfactory image28
footnote 28 m sagnac le radium jan 1906 p 14 following
perhaps professors elster and geitel has lately taken up this idea
anewed
m crmieux has recently undertaken experiments directed as he
thinks to showing that the divergences between the phenomena of
gravitation and all the other phenomena in nature are more apparent
than real thus the evolution in the heart of the ether of a quantity
of gravific energy would not be entirely isolated and as in the case
of all evolutions of all energy of whatever kind it should provoke a
partial transformation into energy of a different form thus again the
liberated energy of gravitation would vary when passing from one
material to another as from gases into liquids or from one liquid to
a different one
on this last point the researches of m crmieux have given
affirmative results if we immerse in a large mass of some liquid
several drops of another not miscible with the first but of identical
density we form a mass representing no doubt a discontinuity in the
ether and we may ask ourselves whether in conformity with what
happens in all other phenomena of nature this discontinuity has not a
tendency to disappear
if we abide by the ordinary consequences of the newtonian theory of
potential the drops should remain motionless the hydrostatic
impulsion forming an exact equilibrium to their mutual attraction now
m crmieux remarks that as a matter of fact they slowly approach
each other
such experiments are very delicate and with all the precautions taken
by the author it cannot yet be asserted that he has removed all
possibility of the action of the phenomena of capillarity nor all
possible errors proceeding from extremely slight differences of
temperature but the attempt is interesting and deserves to be
followed up
thus the hypothesis of the ether does not yet explain all the
phenomena which the considerations relating to matter are of
themselves powerless to interpret if we wished to represent to
ourselves by the mechanical properties of a medium filling the whole
of the universe all luminous electric and gravitation phenomena we
should be led to attribute to this medium very strange and almost
contradictory characteristics and yet it would be still more
inconceivable that this medium should be double or treble that there
should be two or three ethers each occupying space as if it were
alone and interpenetrating it without exercising any action on one
another we are thus brought by a close examination of facts rather
to the idea that the properties of the ether are not wholly reducible
to the rules of ordinary mechanics
the physicist has therefore not yet succeeded in answering the
question often put to him by the philosopher has the ether really an
objective existence however it is not necessary to know the answer
in order to utilize the ether in its ideal properties we find the
means of determining the form of equations which are valid and to the
learned detached from all metaphysical prepossession this is the
essential point
chapter vii
a chapter in the history of science wireless telegraphy
 1
i have endeavoured in this book to set forth impartially the ideas
dominant at this moment in the domain of physics and to make known
the facts essential to them i have had to quote the authors of the
principal discoveries in order to be able to class and in some sort
to name these discoveries but i in no way claim to write even a
summary history of the physics of the day
i am not unaware that as has often been said contemporary history is
the most difficult of all histories to write a certain step backwards
seems necessary in order to enable us to appreciate correctly the
relative importance of events and details conceal the full view from
eyes which are too close to them as the trees prevent us from seeing
the forest the event which produces a great sensation has often only
insignificant consequences while another which seemed at the outset
of the least importance and little worthy of note has in the long run
a widespread and deep influence
if however we deal with the history of a positive discovery
contemporaries who possess immediate information and are in a
position to collect authentic evidence at first hand will make by
bringing to it their sincere testimony a work of erudition which may
be very useful but which we may be tempted to look upon as very easy
of execution yet such a labour even when limited to the study of a
very minute question or of a recent invention is far from being
accomplished without the historian stumbling over serious obstacles
an invention is never in reality to be attributed to a single
author it is the result of the work of many collaborators who
sometimes have no acquaintance with one another and is often the
fruit of obscure labours public opinion however wilfully simple in
face of a sensational discovery insists that the historian should
also act as judge and it is the historians task to disentangle the
truth in the midst of the contest and to declare infallibly to whom
the acknowledgments of mankind should be paid he must in his
capacity as skilled expert expose piracies detect the most carefully
hidden plagiarisms and discuss the delicate question of priority
while he must not be deluded by those who do not fear to announce in
bold accents that they have solved problems of which they find the
solution imminent and who the day after its final elucidation by
third parties proclaim themselves its true discoverers he must rise
above a partiality which deems itself excusable because it proceeds
from national pride and finally he must seek with patience for what
has gone before while thus retreating step by step he runs the risk
of losing himself in the night of time
an example of yesterday seems to show the difficulties of such a task
among recent discoveries the invention of wireless telegraphy is one
of those which have rapidly become popular and looks as it were an
exact subject clearly marked out many attempts have already been made
to write its history mr jj fahie published in england as early as
1899 an interesting work entitled the history of wireless
telegraphy and about the same time m broca published in france a
very exhaustive work named la telegraphie sans fil among the
reports presented to the congrs international de physique paris
1900 signor righi an illustrious italian scholar whose personal
efforts have largely contributed to the invention of the present
system of telegraphy devoted a chapter short but sufficiently
complete of his masterly report on hertzian waves to the history of
wireless telegraphy the same author in association with herr
bernhard dessau has likewise written a more important work die
telegraphie ohne draht and la telegraphie sans fil et les ondes
lectriques of mm j boulanger and g ferri may also be consulted
with advantage as may la telegraphie sans fil of signor dominico
mazotto quite recently mr a story has given us in a little volume
called the story of wireless telegraphy a condensed but very
precise recapitulation of all the attempts which have been made to
establish telegraphic communication without the intermediary of a
conducting wire mr story has examined many documents has sometimes
brought curious facts to light and has studied even the most recently
adopted apparatus
it may be interesting by utilising the information supplied by these
authors and supplementing them when necessary by others to trace the
sources of this modern discovery to follow its developments and thus
to prove once more how much a matter most simple in appearance
demands extensive and complex researches on the part of an author
desirous of writing a definitive work
 2
the first and not the least difficulty is to clearly define the
subject the words wireless telegraphy which at first seem to
correspond to a simple and perfectly clear idea may in reality apply
to two series of questions very different in the mind of a physicist
between which it is important to distinguish the transmission of
signals demands three organs which all appear indispensable the
transmitter the receiver and between the two an intermediary
establishing the communication this intermediary is generally the
most costly part of the installation and the most difficult to set up
while it is here that the sensible losses of energy at the expense of
good output occur and yet our present ideas cause us to consider this
intermediary as more than ever impossible to suppress since if we
are definitely quit of the conception of action at a distance it
becomes inconceivable to us that energy can be communicated from one
point to another without being carried by some intervening medium
but practically the line will be suppressed if instead of
constructing it artificially we use to replace it one of the natural
media which separate two points on the earth these natural media are
divided into two very distinct categories and from this
classification arise two series of questions to be examined
between the two points in question there are first the material
media such as the air the earth and the water for a long time we
have used for transmissions to a distance the elastic properties of
the air and more recently the electric conductivity of the soil and
of water particularly that of the sea
modern physics leads us on the other hand as we have seen to
consider that there exists throughout the whole of the universe
another and more subtle medium which penetrates everywhere is endowed
with elasticity in vacuo and retains its elasticity when it
penetrates into a great number of bodies such as the air this medium
is the luminous ether which possesses as we cannot doubt the
property of being able to transmit energy since it itself brings to
us by far the larger part of the energy which we possess on earth and
which we find in the movements of the atmosphere or of waterfalls
and in the coal mines proceeding from the decomposition of carbon
compounds under the influence of the solar energy for a long time
also before the existence of the ether was known the duty of
transmitting signals was entrusted to it thus through the ages a
double evolution is unfolded which has to be followed by the historian
who is ambitious of completeness
 3
if such an historian were to examine from the beginning the first
order of questions he might no doubt speak only briefly of the
attempts earlier than electric telegraphy without seeking to be
paradoxical he certainly ought to mention the invention of the
speakingtrumpet and other similar inventions which for a long time
have enabled mankind by the ingenious use of the elastic properties
of the natural media to communicate at greater distances than they
could have attained without the aid of art after this in some sort
prehistoric period had been rapidly run through he would have to
follow very closely the development of electric telegraphy almost
from the outset and shortly after ampre had made public the idea of
constructing a telegraph and the day after gauss and weber set up
between their houses in gttingen the first line really used it was
thought that the conducting properties of the earth and water might be
made of service
the history of these trials is very long and is closely mixed up with
the history of ordinary telegraphy long chapters for some time past
have been devoted to it in telegraphic treatises it was in 1838
however that professor ca steinheil of munich expressed for the
first time the clear idea of suppressing the return wire and
replacing it by a connection of the line wire to the earth he thus at
one step covered half the way the easiest it is true which was to
lead to the final goal since he saved the use of onehalf of the line
of wire steinheil advised perhaps by gauss had moreover a very
exact conception of the part taken by the earth considered as a
conducting body he seems to have well understood that in certain
conditions the resistance of such a conductor though supposed to be
unlimited might be independent of the distance apart of the
electrodes which carry the current and allow it to go forth he
likewise thought of using the railway lines to transmit telegraphic
signals
several scholars who from the first had turned their minds to
telegraphy had analogous ideas it was thus that sfb morse
superintendent of the government telegraphs in the united states
whose name is universally known in connection with the very simple
apparatus invented by him made experiments in the autumn of 1842
before a special commission in new york and a numerous public
audience to show how surely and how easily his apparatus worked in
the very midst of his experiments a very happy idea occurred to him of
replacing by the water of a canal the length of about a mile of wire
which had been suddenly and accidentally destroyed this accident
which for a moment compromised the legitimate success the celebrated
engineer expected thus suggested to him a fruitful idea which he did
not forget he subsequently repeated attempts to thus utilise the
earth and water and obtained some very remarkable results
it is not possible to quote here all the researches undertaken with
the same purpose to which are more particularly attached the names of
sw wilkins wheatstone and h highton in england of bonetti in
italy gintl in austria bouchot and donat in france but there are
some which cannot be recalled without emotion
on the 17th december 1870 a physicist who has left in the university
of paris a lasting name m dalmeida at that time professor at the
lyce henri iv and later inspectorgeneral of public instruction
quitted paris then besieged in a balloon and descended in the midst
of the german lines he succeeded after a perilous journey in
gaining havre by way of bordeaux and lyons and after procuring the
necessary apparatus in england he descended the seine as far as
poissy which he reached on the 14th january 1871 after his
departure two other scholars mm desains and bourbouze relieving
each other day and night waited at paris in a wherry on the seine
ready to receive the signal which they awaited with patriotic anxiety
it was a question of working a process devised by the lastnamed pair
in which the water of the river acted the part of the line wire on
the 23rd january the communication at last seemed to be established
but unfortunately first the armistice and then the surrender of paris
rendered useless the valuable result of this noble effort
special mention is also due to the experiments made by the indian
telegraph office under the direction of mr johnson and afterwards of
mr wf melhuish they led indeed in 1889 to such satisfactory
results that a telegraph service in which the line wire was replaced
by the earth worked practically and regularly other attempts were
also made during the latter half of the nineteenth century to transmit
signals through the sea they preceded the epoch when thanks to
numerous physicists among whom lord kelvin undoubtedly occupies a
preponderating position we succeeded in sinking the first cable but
they were not abandoned even after that date for they gave hopes of
a much more economical solution of the problem among the most
interesting are remembered those that sw wilkins carried on for a
long time between france and england like cooke and wheatstone he
thought of using as a receiver an apparatus which in some features
resembles the present receiver of the submarine telegraph later
george e dering then james bowman and lindsay made on the same
lines trials which are worthy of being remembered
but it is only in our own days that sir william h preece at last
obtained for the first time really practical results sir william
himself effected and caused to be executed by his associateshe is
chief consulting engineer to the general post office in england
researches conducted with much method and based on precise theoretical
considerations he thus succeeded in establishing very easy clear
and regular communications between various places for example across
the bristol channel the long series of operations accomplished by so
many seekers with the object of substituting a material and natural
medium for the artificial lines of metal thus met with an undoubted
success which was soon to be eclipsed by the widelyknown experiments
directed into a different line by marconi
it is right to add that sir william preece had himself utilised
induction phenomena in his experiments and had begun researches with
the aid of electric waves much is due to him for the welcome he gave
to marconi it is certainly thanks to the advice and the material
support he found in sir william that the young scholar succeeded in
effecting his sensational experiments
 4
the startingpoint of the experiments based on the properties of the
luminous ether and having for their object the transmission of
signals is very remote and it would be a very laborious task to hunt
up all the work accomplished in that direction even if we were to
confine ourselves to those in which electrical reactions play a part
an electric reaction an electrostatic influence or an
electromagnetic phenomenon is transmitted at a distance through the
air by the intermediary of the luminous ether but electric influence
can hardly be used as the distances it would allow us to traverse
would be much too restricted and electrostatic actions are often very
erratic the phenomena of induction which are very regular and
insensible to the variations of the atmosphere have on the other
hand for a long time appeared serviceable for telegraphic purposes
we might find in a certain number of the attempts just mentioned a
partial employment of these phenomena lindsay for instance in his
project of communication across the sea attributed to them a
considerable rle these phenomena even permitted a true telegraphy
without intermediary wire between the transmitter and the receiver at
very restricted distances it is true but in peculiarly interesting
conditions it is in fact owing to them that c brown and later
edison and gilliland succeeded in establishing communications with
trains in motion
mr willoughby s smith and mr charles a stevenson also undertook
experiments during the last twenty years in which they used
induction but the most remarkable attempts are perhaps those of
professor emile rathenau with the assistance of professor rubens and
of herr w rathenau this physicist effected at the request of the
german ministry of marine a series of researches which enabled him
by means of a compound system of conduction and induction by
alternating currents to obtain clear and regular communications at a
distance of four kilometres among the precursors also should be
mentioned graham bell the inventor of the telephone thought of
employing his admirable apparatus as a receiver of induction phenomena
transmitted from a distance edison herr sacher of vienna m henry
dufour of lausanne and professor trowbridge of boston also made
interesting attempts in the same direction
in all these experiments occurs the idea of employing an oscillating
current moreover it was known for a long timesince in 1842 the
great american physicist henry proved that the discharges from a
leyden jar in the attic of his house caused sparks in a metallic
circuit on the ground floorthat a flux which varies rapidly and
periodically is much more efficacious than a simple flux which latter
can only produce at a distance a phenomenon of slight intensity this
idea of the oscillating current was closely akin to that which was at
last to lead to an entirely satisfactory solution that is to a
solution which is founded on the properties of electric waves
 5
having thus got to the threshold of the definitive edifice the
historian who has conducted his readers over the two parallel routes
which have just been marked out will be brought to ask himself
whether he has been a sufficiently faithful guide and has not omitted
to draw attention to all essential points in the regions passed
through
ought we not to place by the side or perhaps in front of the authors
who have devised the practical appliances those scholars who have
constructed the theories and realised the laboratory experiments of
which after all the apparatus are only the immediate applications
if we speak of the propagation of a current in a material medium can
one forget the names of fourier and of ohm who established by
theoretical considerations the laws which preside over this
propagation when one looks at the phenomena of induction would it
not be just to remember that arago foresaw them and that michael
faraday discovered them it would be a delicate and also a rather
puerile task to class men of genius in order of merit the merit of
an inventor like edison and that of a theorist like clerk maxwell have
no common measure and mankind is indebted for its great progress to
the one as much as to the other
before relating how success attended the efforts to utilise electric
waves for the transmission of signals we cannot without ingratitude
pass over in silence the theoretical speculations and the work of pure
science which led to the knowledge of these waves it would therefore
be just without going further back than faraday to say how that
illustrious physicist drew attention to the part taken by insulating
media in electrical phenomena and to insist also on the admirable
memoirs in which for the first time clerk maxwell made a solid bridge
between those two great chapters of physics optics and electricity
which till then had been independent of each other and no doubt it
would be impossible not to evoke the memory of those who by
establishing on the other hand the solid and magnificent structure
of physical optics and proving by their immortal works the undulatory
nature of light prepared from the opposite direction the future
unity in the history of the applications of electrical undulations
the names of young fresnel fizeau and foucault must be inscribed
without these scholars the assimilation between electrical and
luminous phenomena which they discovered and studied would evidently
have been impossible
since there is an absolute identity of nature between the electric and
the luminous waves we should in all justice also consider as
precursors those who devised the first luminous telegraphs claude
chappe incontestably effected wireless telegraphy thanks to the
luminous ether and the learned men such as colonel mangin who
perfected optical telegraphy indirectly suggested certain
improvements lately introduced into the present method
but the physicist whose work should most of all be put in evidence is
without fear of contradiction heinrich hertz it was he who
demonstrated irrefutably by experiments now classic that an electric
discharge produces an undulatory disturbance in the ether contained in
the insulating media in its neighbourhood it was he who as a
profound theorist a clever mathematician and an experimenter of
prodigious dexterity made known the mechanism of the production and
fully elucidated that of the propagation of these electromagnetic
waves
he must naturally himself have thought that his discoveries might be
applied to the transmission of signals it would appear however that
when interrogated by a munich engineer named huber as to the
possibility of utilising the waves for transmissions by telephone he
answered in the negative and dwelt on certain considerations relative
to the difference between the periods of sounds and those of
electrical vibrations this answer does not allow us to judge what
might have happened had not a cruel death carried off in 1894 at the
age of thirtyfive the great and unfortunate physicist
we might also find in certain works earlier than the experiments of
hertz attempts at transmission in which unconsciously no doubt
phenomena were already set in operation which would at this day be
classed as electric oscillations it is allowable no doubt not to
speak of an american quack mahlon loomis who according to mr story
patented in 1870 a project of communication in which he utilised the
rocky mountains on one side and mont blanc on the other as gigantic
antennae to establish communication across the atlantic but we cannot
pass over in silence the very remarkable researches of the american
professor dolbear who showed at the electrical exhibition of
philadelphia in 1884 a set of apparatus enabling signals to be
transmitted at a distance which he described as an exceptional
application of the principles of electrostatic induction this
apparatus comprised groups of coils and condensers by means of which
he obtained as we cannot now doubt effects due to true electric
waves
place should also be made for a wellknown inventor de hughes who
from 1879 to 1886 followed up some very curious experiments in which
also these oscillations certainly played a considerable part it was
this physicist who invented the microphone and thus in another way
drew attention to the variations of contact resistance a phenomenon
not far from that produced in the radioconductors of branly which
are important organs in the marconi system unfortunately fatigued
and in illhealth hughes ceased his researches at the moment perhaps
when they would have given him final results
in an order of ideas different in appearance but closely linked at
bottom with the one just mentioned must be recalled the discovery of
radiophony in 1880 by graham bell which was foreshadowed in 1875 by
ca brown a luminous ray falling on a selenium cell produces a
variation of electric resistance thanks to which a sound signal can
be transmitted by light that delicate instrument the radiophone
constructed on this principle has wide analogies with the apparatus
of today
 6
starting from the experiments of hertz the history of wireless
telegraphy almost merges into that of the researches on electrical
waves all the progress realised in the manner of producing and
receiving these waves necessarily helped to give rise to the
application already indicated the experiments of hertz after being
checked in every laboratory and having entered into the strong domain
of our most certain knowledge were about to yield the expected fruit
experimenters like sir oliver lodge in england righi in italy
sarrazin and de la rive in switzerland blondlot in france lecher in
germany bose in india lebedeff in russia and theorists like mh
poincar and professor bjerknes who devised ingenious arrangements or
elucidated certain points left dark are among the artisans of the
work which followed its natural evolution
it was professor r threlfall who seems to have been the first to
clearly propose in 1890 the application of the hertzian waves to
telegraphy but it was certainly sir w crookes who in a very
remarkable article in the fortnightly review of february 1892
pointed out very clearly the road to be followed he even showed in
what conditions the morse receiver might be applied to the new system
of telegraphy
about the same period an american physicist well known by his
celebrated experiments on high frequency currentsexperiments too
which are not unconnected with those on electric oscillationsm
tesla demonstrated that these oscillations could be transmitted to
more considerable distances by making use of two vertical antennae
terminated by large conductors
a little later sir oliver lodge succeeded by the aid of the coherer
in detecting waves at relatively long distances and mr rutherford
obtained similar results with a magnetic indicator of his own
invention
an important question of meteorology the study of atmospheric
discharges at this date led a few scholars and more particularly the
russian m popoff to set up apparatus very analogous to the
receiving apparatus of the present wireless telegraphy this comprised
a long antenna and filingstube and m popoff even pointed out that
his apparatus might well serve for the transmission of signals as soon
as a generator of waves powerful enough had been discovered
finally on the 2nd june 1896 a young italian born in bologna on the
25th april 1874 guglielmo marconi patented a system of wireless
telegraphy destined to become rapidly popular brought up in the
laboratory of professor righi one of the physicists who had done most
to confirm and extend the experiments of hertz marconi had long been
familiar with the properties of electric waves and was well used to
their manipulation he afterwards had the good fortune to meet sir
william then mr preece who was to him an adviser of the highest
authority
it has sometimes been said that the marconi system contains nothing
original that the apparatus for producing the waves was the
oscillator of righi that the receiver was that employed for some two
or three years by professor lodge and mr bose and was founded on an
earlier discovery by a french scholar m branly and finally that
the general arrangement was that established by m popoff
the persons who thus rather summarily judge the work of m marconi
show a severity approaching injustice it cannot in truth be denied
that the young scholar has brought a strictly personal contribution to
the solution of the problem he proposed to himself apart from his
forerunners and when their attempts were almost unknown he had the
very great merit of adroitly arranging the most favourable
combination and he was the first to succeed in obtaining practical
results while he showed that the electric waves could be transmitted
and received at distances enormous compared to those attained before
his day alluding to a wellknown anecdote relating to christopher
columbus sir w preece very justly said the forerunners and rivals
of marconi no doubt knew of the eggs but he it was who taught them to
make them stand on end this judgment will without any doubt be the
one that history will definitely pronounce on the italian scholar
 7
the apparatus which enables the electric waves to be revealed the
detector or indicator is the most delicate organ in wireless
telegraphy it is not necessary to employ as an indicator a
filingstube or radioconductor one can in principle for the purpose
of constructing a receiver think of any one of the multiple effects
produced by the hertzian waves in many systems in use and in the new
one of marconi himself the use of these tubes has been abandoned and
replaced by magnetic detectors
nevertheless the first and the still most frequent successes are due
to radioconductors and public opinion has not erred in attributing
to the inventor of this ingenious apparatus a considerable and almost
preponderant part in the invention of wave telegraphy
the history of the discovery of radioconductors is short but it
deserves from its importance a chapter to itself in the history of
wireless telegraphy from a theoretical point of view the phenomena
produced in those tubes should be set by the side of those studied by
graham bell ca brown and summer tainter from the year 1878
onward the variations to which luminous waves give rise in the
resistance of selenium and other substances are doubtless not
unconnected with those which the electric waves produce in filings a
connection can also be established between this effect of the waves
and the variations of contact resistance which enabled hughes to
construct the microphone that admirable instrument which is one of
the essential organs of telephony
more directly as an antecedent to the discovery should be quoted the
remark made by varley in 1870 that coaldust changes in conductivity
when the electromotive force of the current which passes through it is
made to vary but it was in 1884 that an italian professor signor
calzecchionesti demonstrated in a series of remarkable experiments
that the metallic filings contained in a tube of insulating material
into which two metallic electrodes are inserted acquire a notable
conductivity under different influences such as extra currents
induced currents sonorous vibrations etc and that this
conductivity is easily destroyed as for instance by turning the
tube over and over
in several memoirs published in 1890 and 1891 m ed branly
independently pointed out similar phenomena and made a much more
complete and systematic study of the question he was the first to
note very clearly that the action described could be obtained by
simply making sparks pass in the neighbourhood of the radioconductor
and that their great resistance could be restored to the filings by
giving a slight shake to the tube or to its supports
the idea of utilising such a very interesting phenomenon as an
indicator in the study of the hertzian waves seems to have occurred
simultaneously to several physicists among whom should be especially
mentioned m ed branly himself sir oliver lodge and mm le royer
and van beschem and its use in laboratories rapidly became quite
common
the action of the waves on metallic powders has however remained
some what mysterious for ten years it has been the subject of
important researches by professor lodge m branly and a very great
number of the most distinguished physicists it is impossible to
notice here all these researches but from a recent and very
interesting work of m blanc it would seem that the phenomenon is
allied to that of ionisation
 8
the history of wireless telegraphy does not end with the first
experiments of marconi but from the moment their success was
announced in the public press the question left the domain of pure
science to enter into that of commerce the historians task here
becomes different but even more delicate and he will encounter
difficulties which can be only known to one about to write the history
of a commercial invention
the actual improvements effected in the system are kept secret by the
rival companies and the most important results are patriotically left
in darkness by the learned officers who operate discreetly in view of
the national defence meanwhile men of business desirous of bringing
out a company proclaim with great nourish of advertisements that
they are about to exploit a process superior to all others
on this slippery ground the impartial historian must nevertheless
venture and he may not refuse to relate the progress accomplished
which is considerable therefore after having described the
experiments carried out for nearly ten years by marconi himself first
across the bristol channel then at spezzia between the coast and the
ironclad san bartolommeo and finally by means of gigantic apparatus
between america and england he must give the names of those who in
the different civilised countries have contributed to the improvement
of the system of communication by waves while he must describe what
precious services this system has already rendered to the art of war
and happily also to peaceful navigation
from the point of view of the theory of the phenomena very remarkable
results have been obtained by various physicists among whom should be
particularly mentioned m tissot whose brilliant studies have thrown
a bright light on different interesting points such as the rle of
the antennae it would be equally impossible to pass over in silence
other recent attempts in a slightly different groove marconis
system however improved it may be today has one grave defect the
synchronism of the two pieces of apparatus the transmitter and the
receiver is not perfect so that a message sent off by one station
may be captured by some other station the fact that the phenomena of
resonance are not utilised further prevents the quantity of energy
received by the receiver from being considerable and hence the
effects reaped are very weak so that the system remains somewhat
fitful and the communications are often disturbed by atmospheric
phenomena causes which render the air a momentary conductor such as
electrical discharges ionisation etc moreover naturally prevent
the waves from passing the ether thus losing its elasticity
professor ferdinand braun of strasburg has conceived the idea of
employing a mixed system in which the earth and the water which as
we have seen have often been utilised to conduct a current for
transmitting a signal will serve as a sort of guide to the waves
themselves the now wellknown theory of the propagation of waves
guided by a conductor enables it to be foreseen that according to
their periods these waves will penetrate more or less deeply into the
natural medium from which fact has been devised a method of
separating them according to their frequency by applying this theory
m braun has carried out first in the fortifications of strasburg
and then between the island of heligoland and the mainland
experiments which have given remarkable results we might mention also
the researches in a somewhat analogous order of ideas by an english
engineer mr armstrong by dr lee de forest and also by professor
fessenden
having thus arrived at the end of this long journey which has taken
him from the first attempts down to the most recent experiments the
historian can yet set up no other claim but that of having written the
commencement of a history which others must continue in the future
progress does not stop and it is never permissible to say that an
invention has reached its final form
should the historian desire to give a conclusion to his labour and
answer the question the reader would doubtless not fail to put to him
to whom in short should the invention of wireless telegraphy more
particularly be attributed he should certainly first give the name
of hertz the genius who discovered the waves then that of marconi
who was the first to transmit signals by the use of hertzian
undulations and should add those of the scholars who like morse
popoff sir w preece lodge and above all branly have devised the
arrangements necessary for their transmission but he might then
recall what voltaire wrote in the philosophical dictionary
what we wish to know what was the exact theology of thot of
zerdust of sanchuniathon of the first brahmins and we are ignorant
of the inventor of the shuttle the first weaver the first mason the
first smith were no doubt great geniuses but they were disregarded
why because none of them invented a perfected art the one who
hollowed out an oak to cross a river never made a galley those who
piled up rough stones with girders of wood did not plan the pyramids
everything is made by degrees and the glory belongs to no one
today more than ever the words of voltaire are true science
becomes more and more impersonal and she teaches us that progress is
nearly always due to the united efforts of a crowd of workers and is
thus the best school of social solidarity
chapter viii
the conductivity of gases and the ions
 1 the conductivity of gases
if we were confined to the facts i have set forth above we might
conclude that two classes of phenomena are today being interpreted
with increasing correctness in spite of the few difficulties which
have been pointed out the hypothesis of the molecular constitution of
matter enables us to group together one of these classes and the
hypothesis of the ether leads us to coordinate the other
but these two classes of phenomena cannot be considered independent of
each other relations evidently exist between matter and the ether
which manifest themselves in many cases accessible to experiment and
the search for these relations appears to be the paramount problem the
physicist should set himself the question has for a long time been
attacked on various sides but the recent discoveries in the
conductivity of gases of the radioactive substances and of the
cathode and similar rays have allowed us of late years to regard it
in a new light without wishing to set out here in detail facts which
for the most part are well known we will endeavour to group the chief
of them round a few essential ideas and will seek to state precisely
the data they afford us for the solution of this grave problem
it was the study of the conductivity of gases which at the very first
furnished the most important information and allowed us to penetrate
more deeply than had till then been possible into the inmost
constitution of matter and thus to as it were catch in the act the
actions that matter can exercise on the ether or reciprocally those
it may receive from it
it might perhaps have been foreseen that such a study would prove
remarkably fruitful the examination of the phenomena of electrolysis
had in fact led to results of the highest importance on the
constitution of liquids and the gaseous media which presented
themselves as particularly simple in all their properties ought it
would seem to have supplied from the very first a field of
investigation easy to work and highly productive
this however was not at all the case experimental complications
springing up at every step obscured the problem one generally found
ones self in the presence of violent disruptive discharges with a
train of accessory phenomena due for instance to the use of
metallic electrodes and made evident by the complex appearance of
aigrettes and effluves or else one had to deal with heated gases
difficult to handle which were confined in receptacles whose walls
played a troublesome part and succeeded in veiling the simplicity of
the fundamental facts notwithstanding therefore the efforts of a
great number of seekers no general idea disengaged itself out of a
mass of often contradictory information
many physicists in france particularly discarded the study of
questions which seemed so confused and it must even be frankly
acknowledged that some among them had a really unfounded distrust of
certain results which should have been considered proved but which
had the misfortune to be in contradiction with the theories in current
use all the classic ideas relating to electrical phenomena led to the
consideration that there existed a perfect symmetry between the two
electricities positive and negative in the passing of electricity
through gases there is manifested on the contrary an evident
dissymmetry the anode and the cathode are immediately distinguished
in a tube of rarefied gas by their peculiar appearance and the
conductivity does not appear under certain conditions to be the same
for the two modes of electrification
it is not devoid of interest to note that erman a german scholar
once very celebrated and now generally forgotten drew attention as
early as 1815 to the unipolar conductivity of a flame his
contemporaries as may be gathered from the perusal of the treatises
on physics of that period attached great importance to this
discovery but as it was somewhat inconvenient and did not readily
fit in with ordinary studies it was in due course neglected then
considered as insufficiently established and finally wholly
forgotten
all these somewhat obscure facts and some otherssuch as the
different action of ultraviolet radiations on positively and
negatively charged bodiesare now on the contrary about to be
coordinated thanks to the modern ideas on the mechanism of conduction
while these ideas will also allow us to interpret the most striking
dissymmetry of all ie that revealed by electrolysis itself a
dissymmetry which certainly can not be denied but to which sufficient
attention has not been given
it is to a german physicist giese that we owe the first notions on
the mechanism of the conductivity of gases as we now conceive it in
two memoirs published in 1882 and 1889 he plainly arrives at the
conception that conduction in gases is not due to their molecules but
to certain fragments of them or to ions giese was a forerunner but
his ideas could not triumph so long as there were no means of
observing conduction in simple circumstances but this means has now
been supplied in the discovery of the x rays suppose we pass through
some gas at ordinary pressure such as hydrogen a pencil of x rays
the gas which till then has behaved as a perfect insulator29
suddenly acquires a remarkable conductivity if into this hydrogen two
metallic electrodes in communication with the two poles of a battery
are introduced a current is set up in very special conditions which
remind us when they are checked by experiments of the mechanism
which allows the passage of electricity in electrolysis and which is
so well represented to us when we picture to ourselves this passage as
due to the migration towards the electrodes under the action of the
field of the two sets of ions produced by the spontaneous division of
the molecule within the solution
footnote 29 at least so long as it is not introduced between the
two coatings of a condenser having a difference of potential
sufficient to overcome what m bouty calls its dielectric cohesion we
leave on one side this phenomenon regarding which m bouty has
arrived at extremely important results by a very remarkable series of
experiments but this question rightly belongs to a special study of
electrical phenomena which is not yet written
let us therefore recognise with jj thomson and the many physicists
who in his wake have taken up and developed the idea of giese that
under the influence of the x rays for reasons which will have to be
determined later certain gaseous molecules have become divided into
two portions the one positively and the other negatively electrified
which we will call by analogy with the kindred phenomenon in
electrolysis by the name of ions if the gas be then placed in an
electric field produced for instance by two metallic plates
connected with the two poles of a battery respectively the positive
ions will travel towards the plate connected with the negative pole
and the negative ions in the contrary direction there is thus
produced a current due to the transport to the electrodes of the
charges which existed on the ions
if the gas thus ionised be left to itself in the absence of any
electric field the ions yielding to their mutual attraction must
finally meet combine and reconstitute a neutral molecule thus
returning to their initial condition the gas in a short while loses
the conductivity which it had acquired or this is at least the
phenomenon at ordinary temperatures but if the temperature is raised
the relative speeds of the ions at the moment of impact may be great
enough to render it impossible for the recombination to be produced in
its entirety and part of the conductivity will remain
every element of volume rendered a conductor therefore furnishes in
an electric field equal quantities of positive and negative
electricity if we admit as mentioned above that these liberated
quantities are borne by ions each bearing an equal charge the number
of these ions will be proportional to the quantity of electricity and
instead of speaking of a quantity of electricity we could use the
equivalent term of number of ions for the excitement produced by a
given pencil of x rays the number of ions liberated will be fixed
thus from a given volume of gas there can only be extracted an
equally determinate quantity of electricity
the conductivity produced is not governed by ohms law the intensity
is not proportional to the electromotive force and it increases at
first as the electromotive force augments but it approaches
asymptotically to a maximum value which corresponds to the number of
ions liberated and can therefore serve as a measure of the power of
the excitement it is this current which is termed the current of
saturation
m righi has ably demonstrated that ionised gas does not obey the law
of ohm by an experiment very paradoxical in appearance he found that
the greater the distance of the two electrode plates from each the
greater may be within certain limits the intensity of the current
the fact is very clearly interpreted by the theory of ionisation
since the greater the length of the gaseous column the greater must be
the number of ions liberated
one of the most striking characteristics of ionised gases is that of
discharging electrified conductors this phenomenon is not produced by
the departure of the charge that these conductors may possess but by
the advent of opposite charges brought to them by ions which obey the
electrostatic attraction and abandon their own electrification when
they come in contact with these conductors
this mode of regarding the phenomena is extremely convenient and
eminently suggestive it may no doubt be thought that the image of
the ions is not identical with objective reality but we are compelled
to acknowledge that it represents with absolute faithfulness all the
details of the phenomena
other facts moreover will give to this hypothesis a still greater
value we shall even be able so to speak to grasp these ions
individually to count them and to measure their charge
 2 the condensation of watervapour by ions
if the pressure of a vapourthat of water for instancein the
atmosphere reaches the value of the maximum pressure corresponding to
the temperature of the experiment the elementary theory teaches us
that the slightest decrease in temperature will induce a condensation
that small drops will form and the mist will turn into rain
in reality matters do not occur in so simple a manner a more or
less considerable delay may take place and the vapour will remain
supersaturated we easily discover that this phenomenon is due
to the intervention of capillary action on a drop of liquid a
surfacetension takes effect which gives rise to a pressure which
becomes greater the smaller the diameter of the drop
pressure facilitates evaporation and on more closely examining this
reaction we arrive at the conclusion that vapour can never
spontaneously condense itself when liquid drops already formed are not
present unless forces of another nature intervene to diminish the
effect of the capillary forces in the most frequent cases these
forces come from the dust which is always in suspension in the air or
which exists in any recipient grains of dust act by reason of their
hygrometrical power and form germs round which drops presently form
it is possible to make use as did m coulier as early as 1875 of
this phenomenon to carry off the germs of condensation by producing
by expansion in a bottle containing a little water a preliminary mist
which purifies the air in subsequent experiments it will be found
almost impossible to produce further condensation of vapour
but these forces may also be of electrical origin von helmholtz long
since showed that electricity exercises an influence on the
condensation of the vapour of water and mr ctr wilson with this
view has made truly quantitative experiments it was rapidly
discovered after the apparition of the x rays that gases that have
become conductors that is ionised gases also facilitate the
condensation of supersaturated water vapour
we are thus led by a new road to the belief that electrified centres
exist in gases and that each centre draws to itself the neighbouring
molecules of water as an electrified rod of resin does the light
bodies around it there is produced in this manner round each ion an
assemblage of molecules of water which constitute a germ capable of
causing the formation of a drop of water out of the condensation of
excess vapour in the ambient air as might be expected the drops are
electrified and take to themselves the charge of the centres round
which they are formed moreover as many drops are created as there
are ions thereafter we have only to count these drops to ascertain
the number of ions which existed in the gaseous mass
to effect this counting several methods have been used differing in
principle but leading to similar results it is possible as mr ctr
wilson and professor jj thomson have done to estimate on the one
hand the weight of the mist which is produced in determined
conditions and on the other the average weight of the drops
according to the formula formerly given by sir g stokes by deducting
their diameter from the speed with which this mist falls or we can
with professor lemme determine the average radius of the drops by an
optical process viz by measuring the diameter of the first
diffraction ring produced when looking through the mist at a point of
light
we thus get to a very high number there are for instance some
twenty million ions per centimetre cube when the rays have produced
their maximum effect but high as this figure is it is still very
small compared with the total number of molecules all conclusions
drawn from kinetic theory lead us to think that in the same space
there must exist by the side of a molecule divided into two ions a
thousand millions remaining in a neutral state and intact
mr ctr wilson has remarked that the positive and negative ions do
not produce condensation with the same facility the ions of a
contrary sign may be almost completely separated by placing the
ionised gas in a suitably disposed field in the neighbourhood of a
negative disk there remain hardly any but positive ions and against a
positive disk none but negative and in effecting a separation of this
kind it will be noticed that condensation by negative ions is easier
than by the positive
it is consequently possible to cause condensation on negative
centres only and to study separately the phenomena produced by the
two kinds of ions it can thus be verified that they really bear
charges equal in absolute value and these charges can even be
estimated since we already know the number of drops this estimate
can be made for example by comparing the speed of the fall of a mist
in fields of different values or as did jj thomson by measuring
the total quantity of electricity liberated throughout the gas
at the degree of approximation which such experiments imply we find
that the charge of a drop and consequently the charge borne by an
ion is sensibly 34 x 1010 electrostatic or 11 x 1020
electromagnetic units this charge is very near that which the study
of the phenomena of ordinary electrolysis leads us to attribute to a
univalent atom produced by electrolytic dissociation
such a coincidence is evidently very striking but it will not be the
only one for whatever phenomenon be studied it will always appear
that the smallest charge we can conceive as isolated is that
mentioned we are in fact in presence of a natural unit or if you
will of an atom of electricity
we must however guard against the belief that the gaseous ion is
identical with the electrolytic ion sensible differences between
those are immediately apparent and still greater ones will be
discovered on closer examination
as m perrin has shown the ionisation produced by the xrays in no
way depends on the chemical composition of the gas and whether we
take a volume of gaseous hydrochloric acid or a mixture of hydrogen
and chlorine in the same condition all the results will be identical
and chemical affinities play no part here
we can also obtain other information regarding ions we can ascertain
for instance their velocities and also get an idea of their order of
magnitude
by treating the speeds possessed by the liberated charges as
components of the known speed of a gaseous current mr zeleny measures
the mobilities that is to say the speeds acquired by the positive
and negative charges in a field equal to the electrostatic unit he
has thus found that these mobilities are different and that they
vary for example between 400 and 200 centimetres per second for the
two charges in dry gases the positive being less mobile than the
negative ions which suggests the idea that they are of greater
mass30
footnote 30 a full account of these experiments which were executed
at the cavendish laboratory is to be found in philosophical
transactions a vol cxcv 1901 pp 193 et seqed
m langevin who has made himself the eloquent apostle of the new
doctrines in france and has done much to make them understood and
admitted has personally undertaken experiments analogous to those of
m zeleny but much more complete he has studied in a very ingenious
manner not only the mobilities but also the law of recombination
which regulates the spontaneous return of the gas to its normal state
he has determined experimentally the relation of the number of
recombinations to the number of collisions between two ions of
contrary sign by studying the variation produced by a change in the
value of the field in the quantity of electricity which can be
collected in the gas separating two parallel metallic plates after
the passage through it for a very short time of the rntgen rays
emitted during one discharge of a crookes tube if the image of the
ions is indeed conformable to reality this relation must evidently
always be smaller than unity and must tend towards this value when
the mobility of the ions diminishes that is to say when the pressure
of the gas increases the results obtained are in perfect accord with
this anticipation
on the other hand m langevin has succeeded by following the
displacement of the ions between the parallel plates after the
ionisation produced by the radiation in determining the absolute
values of the mobilities with great precision and has thus clearly
placed in evidence the irregularity of the mobilities of the positive
and negative ions respectively their mass can be calculated when we
know through experiments of this kind the speed of the ions in a
given field and on the other handas we can now estimate their
electric chargethe force which moves them they evidently progress
more slowly the larger they are and in the viscous medium constituted
by the gas the displacement is effected at a speed sensibly
proportional to the motive power
at the ordinary temperature these masses are relatively considerable
and are greater for the positive than for the negative ions that is
to say they are about the order of some ten molecules the ions
therefore seem to be formed by an agglomeration of neutral molecules
maintained round an electrified centre by electrostatic attraction if
the temperature rises the thermal agitation will become great enough
to prevent the molecules from remaining linked to the centre by
measurements effected on the gases of flames we arrive at very
different values of the masses from those found for ordinary ions and
above all very different ones for ions of contrary sign the negative
ions have much more considerable velocities than the positive ones
the latter also seem to be of the same size as atoms and the
firstnamed must consequently be considered as very much smaller
and probably about a thousand times less
thus for the first time in science the idea appears that the atom is
not the smallest fraction of matter to be considered fragments a
thousand times smaller may exist which possess however a negative
charge these are the electrons which other considerations will again
bring to our notice
 3 how ions are produced
it is very seldom that a gaseous mass does not contain a few ions
they may have been formed from many causes for although to give
precision to our studies and to deal with a well ascertained case i
mentioned only ionisation by the x rays in the first instance i ought
not to give the impression that the phenomenon is confined to these
rays it is on the contrary very general and ionisation is just as
well produced by the cathode rays by the radiations emitted by
radioactive bodies by the ultraviolet rays by heating to a high
temperature by certain chemical actions and finally by the impact of
the ions already existing in neutral molecules
of late years these new questions have been the object of a multitude
of researches and if it has not always been possible to avoid some
confusion yet certain general conclusions may be drawn the
ionisation by flames in particular is fairly well known for it to
be produced spontaneously it would appear that there must exist
simultaneously a rather high temperature and a chemical action in the
gas according to m moreau the ionisation is very marked when the
flame contains the vapour of the salt of an alkali or of an alkaline
earth but much less so when it contains that of other salts
arrhenius mr ctr wilson and m moreau have studied all the
circumstances of the phenomenon and it seems indeed that there is a
somewhat close analogy between what first occurs in the saline vapours
and that which is noted in liquid electrolytes there should be
produced as soon as a certain temperature is reached a dissociation
of the saline molecule and as m moreau has shown in a series of
very well conducted researches the ions formed at about 100c seem
constituted by an electrified centre of the size of a gas molecule
surrounded by some ten layers of other molecules we are thus dealing
with rather large ions but according to mr wilson this condensation
phenomenon does not affect the number of ions produced by
dissociation in proportion as the temperature rises the molecules
condensed round the nucleus disappear and as in all other
circumstances the negative ion tends to become an electron while the
positive ion continues the size of an atom
in other cases ions are found still larger than those of saline
vapours as for example those produced by phosphorus it has long
been known that air in the neighbourhood of phosphorus becomes a
conductor and the fact pointed out as far back as 1885 by matteucci
has been well studied by various experimenters by mm elster and
geitel in 1890 for instance on the other hand in 1893 mr barus
established that the approach of a stick of phosphorus brings about
the condensation of water vapour and we really have before us
therefore in this instance an ionisation m bloch has succeeded in
disentangling the phenomena which are here very complex and in
showing that the ions produced are of considerable dimensions for
their speed in the same conditions is on the average a thousand times
less than that of ions due to the x rays m bloch has established
also that the conductivity of recentlyprepared gases already studied
by several authors was analogous to that which is produced by
phosphorus and that it is intimately connected with the presence of
the very tenuous solid or liquid dust which these gases carry with
them while the ions are of the same order of magnitude these large
ions exist moreover in small quantities in the atmosphere and m
langevin lately succeeded in revealing their presence
it may happen and this not without singularly complicating matters
that the ions which were in the midst of material molecules produce
as the result of collisions new divisions in these last other ions
are thus born and this production is in part compensated for by
recombinations between ions of opposite signs the impacts will be
more active in the event of the gas being placed in a field of force
and of the pressure being slight the speed attained being then
greater and allowing the active force to reach a high value the
energy necessary for the production of an ion is in fact according
to professor rutherford and professor stark something considerable
and it much exceeds the analogous force in electrolytic decomposition
it is therefore in tubes of rarefied gas that this ionisation by
impact will be particularly felt this gives us the reason for the
aspect presented by geissler tubes generally in the case of
discharges new ions produced by the molecules struck come to add
themselves to the electrons produced as will be seen by the cathode
a full discussion has led to the interpretation of all the known
facts and to our understanding for instance why there exist bright
or dark spaces in certain regions of the tube m pellat in
particular has given some very fine examples of this concordance
between the theory and the facts he has skilfully observed
in all the circumstances then in which ions appear their formation
has doubtless been provoked by a mechanism analogous to that of the
shock the x rays if they are attributable to sudden variations in
the etherthat is to say a variation of the two vectors of hertz
themselves produce within the atom a kind of electric impulse which
breaks it into two electrified fragments ie the positive centre
the size of the molecule itself and the negative centre constituted
by an electron a thousand times smaller round these two centres at
the ordinary temperature are agglomerated by attraction other
molecules and in this manner the ions whose properties have just been
studied are formed
 4 electrons in metals
the success of the ionic hypothesis as an interpretation of the
conductivity of electrolytes and gases has suggested the desire to try
if a similar hypothesis can represent the ordinary conductivity of
metals we are thus led to conceptions which at first sight seem
audacious because they are contrary to our habits of mind they must
not however be rejected on that account electrolytic dissociation
at first certainly appeared at least as strange yet it has ended by
forcing itself upon us and we could at the present day hardly
dispense with the image it presents to us
the idea that the conductivity of metals is not essentially different
from that of electrolytic liquids or gases in the sense that the
passage of the current is connected with the transport of small
electrified particles is already of old date it was enunciated by w
weber and afterwards developed by giese but has only obtained its
true scope through the effect of recent discoveries it was the
researches of riecke later of drude and above all those of jj
thomson which have allowed it to assume an acceptable form all these
attempts are connected however with the general theory of lorentz
which we will examine later
it will be admitted that metallic atoms can like the saline molecule
in a solution partially dissociate themselves electrons very much
smaller than atoms can move through the structure considerable to
them which is constituted by the atom from which they have just been
detached they may be compared to the molecules of a gas which is
enclosed in a porous body in ordinary conditions notwithstanding the
great speed with which they are animated they are unable to travel
long distances because they quickly find their road barred by a
material atom they have to undergo innumerable impacts which throw
them first in one direction and then in another the passage of a
current is a sort of flow of these electrons in a determined
direction this electric flow brings however no modification to the
material medium traversed since every electron which disappears at
any point is replaced by another which appears at once and in all
metals the electrons are identical
this hypothesis leads us to anticipate certain facts which experience
confirms thus jj thomson shows that if in certain conditions a
conductor is placed in a magnetic field the ions have to describe an
epicycloid and their journey is thus lengthened while the electric
resistance must increase if the field is in the direction of the
displacement they describe helices round the lines of force and the
resistance is again augmented but in different proportions various
experimenters have noted phenomena of this kind in different
substances
for a long time it has been noticed that a relation exists between the
calorific and the electric conductivity the relation of these two
conductivities is sensibly the same for all metals the modern theory
tends to show simply that it must indeed be so calorific conductivity
is due in fact to an exchange of electrons between the hot and the
cold regions the heated electrons having the greater velocity and
consequently the more considerable energy the calorific exchanges
then obey laws similar to those which govern electric exchanges and
calculation even leads to the exact values which the measurements have
given31
footnote 31 the whole of this argument is brilliantly set forth by
professor lorentz in a lecture delivered to the electrotechnikerverein
at berlin in december 1904 and reprinted with additions in the
archives nerlandaises of 1906ed
in the same way professor hesehus has explained how contact
electrification is produced by the tendency of bodies to equalise
their superficial properties by means of a transport of electrons and
mr jeans has shown that we should discover the existence of the
wellknown laws of distribution over conducting bodies in electrostatic
equilibrium a metal can in fact be electrified that is to say may
possess an excess of positive or negative electrons which cannot
easily leave it in ordinary conditions to cause them to do so would
need an appreciable amount of work on account of the enormous
difference of the specific inductive capacities of the metal and of
the insulating medium in which it is plunged
electrons however which on arriving at the surface of the metal
possessed a kinetic energy superior to this work might be shot forth
and would be disengaged as a vapour escapes from a liquid now the
number of these rapid electrons at first very slight increases
according to the kinetic theory when the temperature rises and
therefore we must reckon that a wire on being heated gives out
electrons that is to say loses negative electricity and sends into
the surrounding media electrified centres capable of producing the
phenomena of ionisation edison in 1884 showed that from the
filament of an incandescent lamp there escaped negative electric
charges since then richardson and jj thomson have examined
analogous phenomena this emission is a very general phenomenon which
no doubt plays a considerable part in cosmic physics professor
arrhenius explains for instance the polar auroras by the action of
similar corpuscules emitted by the sun
in other phenomena we seem indeed to be confronted by an emission not
of negative electrons but of positive ions thus when a wire is
heated not in vacuo but in a gas this wire begins to electrify
neighbouring bodies positively jj thomson has measured the mass of
these positive ions and finds it considerable ie about 150 times
that of an atom of hydrogen some are even larger and constitute
almost a real grain of dust we here doubtless meet with the phenomena
of disaggregation undergone by metals at a red heat
chapter ix
cathode rays and radioactive bodies
 1 the cathode rays
a wire traversed by an electric current is as has just been
explained the seat of a movement of electrons if we cut this wire a
flood of electrons like a current of water which at the point where
a pipe bursts flows out in abundance will appear to spring out
between the two ends of the break
if the energy of the electrons is sufficient these electrons will in
fact rush forth and be propagated in the air or in the insulating
medium interposed but the phenomena of the discharge will in general
be very complex we shall here only examine a particularly simple
case viz that of the cathode rays and without entering into
details we shall only note the results relating to these rays which
furnish valuable arguments in favour of the electronic hypothesis and
supply solid materials for the construction of new theories of
electricity and matter
for a long time it was noticed that the phenomena in a geissler tube
changed their aspect considerably when the gas pressure became very
weak without however a complete vacuum being formed from the
cathode there is shot forth normally and in a straight line a flood
within the tube dark but capable of impressing a photographic plate
of developing the fluorescence of various substances particularly the
glass walls of the tube and of producing calorific and mechanical
effects these are the cathode rays so named in 1883 by e wiedemann
and their name which was unknown to a great number of physicists till
barely twelve years ago has become popular at the present day
about 1869 hittorf made an already very complete study of them and
put in evidence their principal properties but it was the researches
of sir w crookes in especial which drew attention to them the
celebrated physicist foresaw that the phenomena which were thus
produced in rarefied gases were in spite of their very great
complication more simple than those presented by matter under the
conditions in which it is generally met with
he devised a celebrated theory no longer admissible in its entirety
because it is not in complete accord with the facts which was
however very interesting and contained in germ certain of our
present ideas in the opinion of crookes in a tube in which the gas
has been rarefied we are in presence of a special state of matter the
number of the gas molecules has become small enough for their
independence to be almost absolute and they are able in this
socalled radiant state to traverse long spaces without departing
from a straight line the cathode rays are due to a kind of molecular
bombardment of the walls of the tubes and of the screens which can be
introduced into them and it is the molecules electrified by their
contact with the cathode and then forcibly repelled by electrostatic
action which produce by their movement and their vis viva all the
phenomena observed moreover these electrified molecules animated
with extremely rapid velocities correspond according to the theory
verified in the celebrated experiment of rowland on convection
currents to a true electric current and can be deviated by a magnet
notwithstanding the success of crookes experiments many physicists
the germans especiallydid not abandon an hypothesis entirely
different from that of radiant matter they continued to regard the
cathode radiation as due to particular radiations of a nature still
little known but produced in the luminous ether this interpretation
seemed indeed in 1894 destined to triumph definitely through the
remarkable discovery of lenard a discovery which in its turn was to
provoke so many others and to bring about consequences of which the
importance seems every day more considerable
professor lenards fundamental idea was to study the cathode rays
under conditions different from those in which they are produced
these rays are born in a very rarefied space under conditions
perfectly determined by sir w crookes but it was a question whether
when once produced they would be capable of propagating themselves in
other media such as a gas at ordinary pressure or even in an
absolute vacuum experiment alone could answer this question but
there were difficulties in the way of this which seemed almost
insurmountable the rays are stopped by glass even of slight
thickness and how then could the almost vacuous space in which they
have to come into existence be separated from the space absolutely
vacuous or filled with gas into which it was desired to bring them
the artifice used was suggested to professor lenard by an experiment
of hertz the great physicist had in fact shortly before his
premature death taken up this important question of the cathode rays
and his genius left there as elsewhere its powerful impress he had
shown that metallic plates of very slight thickness were transparent
to the cathode rays and professor lenard succeeded in obtaining
plates impermeable to air but which yet allowed the pencil of cathode
rays to pass through them
now if we take a crookes tube with the extremity hermetically closed
by a metallic plate with a slit across the diameter of 1 mm in width
and stop this slit with a sheet of very thin aluminium it will be
immediately noticed that the rays pass through the aluminium and pass
outside the tube they are propagated in air at atmospheric pressure
and they can also penetrate into an absolute vacuum they therefore
can no longer be attributed to radiant matter and we are led to think
that the energy brought into play in this phenomenon must have its
seat in the lightbearing ether itself
but it is a very strange light which is thus subject to magnetic
action which does not obey the principle of equal angles and for
which the most various gases are already disturbed media according to
crookes it possesses also the singular property of carrying with it
electric charges
this convection of negative electricity by the cathode rays seems
quite inexplicable on the hypothesis that the rays are ethereal
radiations nothing then remained in order to maintain this
hypothesis except to deny the convection which besides was only
established by indirect experiments that the reality of this
transport has been placed beyond dispute by means of an extremely
elegant experiment which is all the more convincing that it is so very
simple is due to m perrin in the interior of a crookes tube he
collected a pencil of cathode rays in a metal cylinder according to
the elementary principles of electricity the cylinder must become
charged with the whole charge if there be one brought to it by the
rays and naturally various precautions had to be taken but the
result was very precise and doubt could no longer existthe rays
were electrified
it might have been and indeed was maintained some time after this
experiment was published that while the phenomena were complex inside
the tube outside things might perhaps occur differently lenard
himself however with that absence of even involuntary prejudice
common to all great minds undertook to demonstrate that the opinion
he at first held could no longer be accepted and succeeded in
repeating the experiment of m perrin on cathode rays in the air and
even in vacuo
on the wrecks of the two contradictory hypotheses thus destroyed and
out of the materials from which they had been built a theory has been
constructed which coordinates all the known facts this theory is
furthermore closely allied to the theory of ionisation and like this
latter is based on the concept of the electron cathode rays are
electrons in rapid motion
the phenomena produced both inside and outside a crookes tube are
however generally complex in lenards first experiments and in many
others effected later when this region of physics was still very
little known a few confusions may be noticed even at the present day
at the spot where the cathode rays strike the walls of the tube the
essentially different x rays appear these differ from the cathode
radiations by being neither electrified nor deviated by a magnet in
their turn these x rays may give birth to the secondary rays of m
sagnac and often we find ourselves in presence of effects from these
lastnamed radiations and not from the true cathode rays
the electrons when they are propagated in a gas can ionise the
molecules of this gas and unite with the neutral atoms to form
negative ions while positive ions also appear there are likewise
produced at the expense of the gas still subsisting after
rarefication within the tube positive ions which attracted by the
cathode and reaching it are not all neutralised by the negative
electrons and can if the cathode be perforated pass through it and
if not pass round it we have then what are called the canal rays of
goldstein which are deviated by an electric or magnetic field in a
contrary direction to the cathode rays but being larger give weak
deviations or may even remain undeviated through losing their charge
when passing through the cathode
it may also be the parts of the walls at a distance from the cathode
which send a positive rush to the latter by a similar mechanism it
may be again that in certain regions of the tube cathode rays are
met with diffused by some solid object without having thereby changed
their nature all these complexities have been cleared up by m
villard who has published on these questions some remarkably
ingenious and particularly careful experiments
m villard has also studied the phenomena of the coiling of the rays
in a field as already pointed out by hittorf and plcker when a
magnetic field acts on the cathode particle the latter follows a
trajectory generally helicoidal which is anticipated by the theory
we here have to do with a question of ballistics and experiments duly
confirm the anticipations of the calculation nevertheless rather
singular phenomena appear in the case of certain values of the field
and these phenomena dimly seen by plcker and birkeland have been
the object of experiments by m villard the two faces of the cathode
seem to emit rays which are deviated in a direction perpendicular to
the lines of force by an electric field and do not seem to be
electrified m villard calls them magnetocathode rays and according
to m fortin these rays may be ordinary cathode rays but of very
slight velocity
in certain cases the cathode itself may be superficially
disaggregated and extremely tenuous particles detach themselves
which being carried off at right angles to its surface may deposit
themselves like a very thin film on objects placed in their path
various physicists among them m houllevigue have studied this
phenomenon and in the case of pressures between 120 and 1100 of a
millimetre the lastnamed scholar has obtained mirrors of most
metals a phenomenon he designates by the name of ionoplasty
but in spite of all these accessory phenomena which even sometimes
conceal those first observed the existence of the electron in the
cathodic flux remains the essential characteristic
the electron can be apprehended in the cathodic ray by the study of
its essential properties and jj thomson gave great value to the
hypothesis by his measurements at first he meant to determine the
speed of the cathode rays by direct experiment and by observing in a
revolving mirror the relative displacement of two bands due to the
excitement of two fluorescent screens placed at different distances
from the cathode but he soon perceived that the effect of the
fluorescence was not instantaneous and that the lapse of time might
form a great source of error and he then had recourse to indirect
methods it is possible by a simple calculation to estimate the
deviations produced on the rays by a magnetic and an electric field
respectively as a function of the speed of propagation and of the
relation of the charge to the material mass of the electron the
measurement of these deviations will then permit this speed and this
relation to be ascertained
other processes may be used which all give the same two quantities by
two suitably chosen measurements such are the radius of the curve
taken by the trajectory of the pencil in a perpendicular magnetic
field and the measure of the fall of potential under which the
discharge takes place or the measure of the total quantity
of electricity carried in one second and the measure of the
calorific energy which may be given during the same period to a
thermoelectric junction the results agree as well as can be expected
having regard to the difficulty of the experiments the values of the
speed agree also with those which professor wiechert has obtained by
direct measurement
the speed never depends on the nature of the gas contained in the
crookes tube but varies with the value of the fall of potential at
the cathode it is of the order of one tenth of the speed of light
and it may rise as high as one third the cathode particle therefore
goes about three thousand times faster than the earth in its orbit
the relation is also invariable even when the substance of which the
cathode is formed is changed or one gas is substituted for another it
is on the average a thousand times greater than the corresponding
relation in electrolysis as experiment has shown in all the
circumstances where it has been possible to effect measurements the
equality of the charges carried by all corpuscules ions atoms etc
we ought to consider that the charge of the electron is here again
that of a univalent ion in electrolysis and therefore that its mass
is only a small fraction of that of the atom of hydrogen viz of the
order of about a thousandth part this is the same result as that to
which we were led by the study of flames
the thorough examination of the cathode radiation then confirms us
in the idea that every material atom can be dissociated and will yield
an electron much smaller than itselfand always identical whatever
the matter whence it comesthe rest of the atom remaining charged
with a positive quantity equal and contrary to that borne by the
electron in the present case these positive ions are no doubt those
that we again meet with in the canal rays professor wien has shown
that their mass is really in fact of the order of the mass of atoms
although they are all formed of identical electrons there may be
various cathode rays because the velocity is not exactly the same for
all electrons thus is explained the fact that we can separate them
and that we can produce a sort of spectrum by the action of the
magnet or again as m deslandres has shown in a very interesting
experiment by that of an electrostatic field this also probably
explains the phenomena studied by m villard and previously pointed
out
 2 radioactive substances
even in ordinary conditions certain substances called radioactive
emit quite outside any particular reaction radiations complex
indeed but which pass through fairly thin layers of minerals impress
photographic plates excite fluorescence and ionize gases in these
radiations we again find electrons which thus escape spontaneously
from radioactive bodies
it is not necessary to give here a history of the discovery of radium
for every one knows the admirable researches of m and madame curie
but subsequent to these first studies a great number of facts have
accumulated for the last six years among which some people find
themselves a little lost it may perhaps not be useless to indicate
the essential results actually obtained
the researches on radioactive substances have their startingpoint in
the discovery of the rays of uranium made by m becquerel in 1896 as
early as 1867 niepce de st victor proved that salts of uranium
impressed photographic plates in the dark but at that time the
phenomenon could only pass for a singularity attributable to
phosphorescence and the valuable remarks of niepce fell into
oblivion m becquerel established after some hesitations natural in
the face of phenomena which seemed so contrary to accepted ideas that
the radiating property was absolutely independent of phosphorescence
that all the salts of uranium even the uranous salts which are not
phosphorescent give similar radiant effects and that these phenomena
correspond to a continuous emission of energy but do not seem to be
the result of a storage of energy under the influence of some external
radiation spontaneous and constant the radiation is insensible to
variations of temperature and light
the nature of these radiations was not immediately understood32 and
their properties seemed contradictory this was because we were not
dealing with a single category of rays but amongst all the effects
there is one which constitutes for the radiations taken as a whole a
veritable process for the measurement of radioactivity this is their
ionizing action on gases a very complete study of the conductivity of
air under the influence of rays of uranium has been made by various
physicists particularly by professor rutherford and has shown that
the laws of the phenomenon are the same as those of the ionization due
to the action of the rntgen rays
footnote 32 in his work on lvolution de la matire m gustave
le bon recalls that in 1897 he published several notes in the acadmie
des sciences in which he asserted that the properties of uranium were
only a particular case of a very general law and that the radiations
emitted did not polarize and were akin by their properties to the x
rays
it was natural to ask ones self if the property discovered in salts
of uranium was peculiar to this body or if it were not to a more or
less degree a general property of matter madame curie and m
schmidt independently of each other made systematic researches in
order to solve the question various compounds of nearly all the
simple bodies at present known were thus passed in review and it was
established that radioactivity was particularly perceptible in the
compounds of uranium and thorium and that it was an atomic property
linked to the matter endowed with it and following it in all its
combinations in the course of her researches madame curie observed
that certain pitchblendes oxide of uranium ore containing also
barium bismuth etc were four times more active activity being
measured by the phenomenon of the ionization of the air than metallic
uranium now no compound containing any other active metal than
uranium or thorium ought to show itself more active than those metals
themselves since the property belongs to their atoms it seemed
therefore probable that there existed in pitchblendes some substance
yet unknown in small quantities and more radioactive than uranium
m and madame curie then commenced those celebrated experiments which
brought them to the discovery of radium their method of research has
been justly compared in originality and importance to the process of
spectrum analysis to isolate a radioactive substance the first thing
is to measure the activity of a certain compound suspected of
containing this substance and this compound is chemically separated
we then again take in hand all the products obtained and by measuring
their activity anew it is ascertained whether the substance sought
for has remained in one of these products or is divided among them
and if so in what proportion the spectroscopic reaction which we may
use in the course of this separation is a thousand times less
sensitive than observation of the activity by means of the
electrometer
though the principle on which the operation of the concentration of
the radium rests is admirable in its simplicity its application is
nevertheless very laborious tons of uranium residues have to be
treated in order to obtain a few decigrammes of pure salts of radium
radium is characterised by a special spectrum and its atomic weight
as determined by madame curie is 225 it is consequently the higher
homologue of barium in one of the groups of mendelef salts of radium
have in general the same chemical properties as the corresponding
salts of barium but are distinguished from them by the differences of
solubility which allow of their separation and by their enormous
activity which is about a hundred thousand times greater than that of
uranium
radium produces various chemical and some very intense physiological
reactions its salts are luminous in the dark but this luminosity at
first very bright gradually diminishes as the salts get older we
have here to do with a secondary reaction correlative to the
production of the emanation after which radium undergoes the
transformations which will be studied later on
the method of analysis founded by m and madame curie has enabled
other bodies presenting sensible radioactivity to be discovered the
alkaline metals appear to possess this property in a slight degree
recently fallen snow and mineral waters manifest marked action the
phenomenon may often be due however to a radioactivity induced by
radiations already existing in the atmosphere but this radioactivity
hardly attains the tenthousandth part of that presented by uranium
or the tenmillionth of that appertaining to radium
two other bodies polonium and actinium the one characterised by the
special nature of the radiations it emits and the other by a
particular spectrum seem likewise to exist in pitchblende these
chemical properties have not yet been perfectly defined thus m
debierne who discovered actinium has been able to note the active
property which seems to belong to it sometimes in lanthanum
sometimes in neodynium33 it is proved that all extremely
radioactive bodies are the seat of incessant transformations and even
now we cannot state the conditions under which they present themselves
in a strictly determined form
footnote 33 polonium has now been shown to be no new element but
one of the transformation products of radium radium itself is also
thought to be derived in some manner not yet ascertained from
uranium the same is the case with actinium which is said to come in
the long run from uranium but not so directly as does radium all
this is described in professor rutherfords radioactive
transformations london 1906ed
 3 the radiation of the radioactive bodies and the emanation
to acquire exact notions as to the nature of the rays emitted by the
radioactive bodies it was necessary to try to cause magnetic or
electric forces to act on them so as to see whether they behaved in
the same way as light and the x rays or whether like the cathode rays
they were deviated by a magnetic field this work was effected by
professor giesel then by m becquerel professor rutherford and by
many other experimenters after them all the methods which have
already been mentioned in principle have been employed in order to
discover whether they were electrified and if so by electricity of
what sign to measure their speed and to ascertain their degree of
penetration
the general result has been to distinguish three sorts of radiations
designated by the letters alpha beta gamma
the alpha rays are positively charged and are projected at a speed
which may attain the tenth of that of light mh becquerel has shown
by the aid of photography that they are deviated by a magnet and
professor rutherford has on his side studied this deviation by the
electrical method the relation of the charge to the mass is in the
case of these rays of the same order as in that of the ions of
electrolysis they may therefore be considered as exactly analogous to
the canal rays of goldstein and we may attribute them to a material
transport of corpuscles of the magnitude of atoms the relatively
considerable size of these corpuscles renders them very absorbable a
flight of a few millimetres in a gas suffices to reduce their number
by onehalf they have great ionizing power
the beta rays are on all points similar to the cathode rays they are
as m and madame curie have shown negatively charged and the charge
they carry is always the same their size is that of the electrons
and their velocity is generally greater than that of the cathode rays
while it may become almost that of light they have about a hundred
times less ionizing power than the alpha rays
the gamma rays were discovered by m villard34 they may be compared
to the x rays like the latter they are not deviated by the magnetic
field and are also extremely penetrating a strip of aluminium five
millimetres thick will stop the other kinds but will allow them to
pass on the other hand their ionizing power is 10000 times less
than that of the alpha rays

physical science london 1904 nor the hon rj strutt in the
becquerel rays london same date both of whom deal with the
historical side of the subject seem to have noticed the facted
to these radiations there sometimes are added in the course of
experiments secondary radiations analogous to those of m sagnac and
produced when the alpha beta or gamma rays meet various substances
this complication has often led to some errors of observation
phosphorescence and fluorescence seem especially to result from the
alpha and beta rays particularly from the alpha rays to which
belongs the most important part of the total energy of the radiation
sir w crookes has invented a curious little apparatus the
spinthariscope which enables us to examine the phosphorescence of the
blende excited by these rays by means of a magnifying glass a screen
covered with sulphide of zinc is kept under observation and in front
of it is disposed at a distance of about half a millimetre a
fragment of some salt of radium we then perceive multitudes of
brilliant points on the screen which appear and at once disappear
producing a scintillating effect it seems probable that every
particle falling on the screen produces by its impact a disturbance in
the neighbouring region and it is this disturbance which the eye
perceives as a luminous point thus says sir w crookes each drop of
rain falling on the surface of still water is not perceived as a drop
of rain but by reason of the slight splash which it causes at the
moment of impact and which is manifested by ridges and waves
spreading themselves in circles
the various radioactive substances do not all give radiations of
identical constitution radium and thorium possess in somewhat large
proportions the three kinds of rays and it is the same with actinium
polonium contains especially alpha rays and a few gamma rays35 in
the case of uranium the alpha rays have extremely slight penetrating
power and cannot even impress photographic plates but the widest
difference between the substances proceeds from the emanation radium
in addition to the three groups of rays alpha beta and gamma
disengages continuously an extremely subtle emanation seemingly
almost imponderable but which may be for many reasons looked upon
as a vapour of which the elastic force is extremely feeble
footnote 35 it has now been shown that polonium when freshly
separated emits beta rays also see dr logemans paper in proceedings
of the royal society a 6th september 1906ed
m and madame curie discovered as early as 1899 that every substance
placed in the neighbourhood of radium itself acquired a radioactivity
which persisted for several hours after the removal of the radium
this induced radioactivity seems to be carried to other bodies by the
intermediary of a gas it goes round obstacles but there must exist
between the radium and the substance a free and continuous space for
the activation to take place it cannot for instance do so through a
wall of glass
in the case of compounds of thorium professor rutherford discovered a
similar phenomenon since then various physicists professor soddy
miss brooks miss gates m danne and others have studied the
properties of these emanations
the substance emanated can neither be weighed nor can its elastic
force be ascertained but its transformations may be followed as it
is luminous and it is even more certainly characterised by its
essential property ie its radioactivity we also see that it can be
decanted like a gas that it will divide itself between two tubes of
different capacity in obedience to the law of mariotte and will
condense in a refrigerated tube in accordance with the principle of
watt while it even complies with the law of gaylussac
the activity of the emanation vanishes quickly and at the end of four
days it has diminished by onehalf if a salt of radium is heated the
emanation becomes more abundant and the residue which however does
not sensibly diminish in weight will have lost all its radioactivity
and will only recover it by degrees professor rutherford
notwithstanding many different attempts has been unable to make this
emanation enter into any chemical reaction if it be a gaseous body
it must form part of the argon group and like its other members be
perfectly inert
by studying the spectrum of the gas disengaged by a solution of salt
of radium sir william ramsay and professor soddy remarked that when
the gas is radioactive there are first obtained rays of gases
belonging to the argon family then by degrees as the activity
disappears the spectrum slowly changes and finally presents the
characteristic aspect of helium
we know that the existence of this gas was first discovered by
spectrum analysis in the sun later its presence was noted in our
atmosphere and in a few minerals which happen to be the very ones
from which radium has been obtained it might therefore have been the
case that it preexisted in the gases extracted from radium but a
remarkable experiment by m curie and sir james dewar seems to show
convincingly that this cannot be so the spectrum of helium never
appears at first in the gas proceeding from pure bromide of radium
but it shows itself on the other hand very distinctly after the
radioactive transformations undergone by the salt
all these strange phenomena suggest bold hypotheses but to construct
them with any solidity they must be supported by the greatest possible
number of facts before admitting a definite explanation of the
phenomena which have their seat in the curious substances discovered
by them m and madame curie considered with a great deal of reason
that they ought first to enrich our knowledge with the exact and
precise facts relating to these bodies and to the effects produced by
the radiations they emit
thus m curie particularly set himself to study the manner in which
the radioactivity of the emanation is dissipated and the
radioactivity that this emanation can induce on all bodies the
radioactivity of the emanation diminishes in accordance with an
exponential law the constant of time which characterises this
decrease is easily and exactly determined and has a fixed value
independent of the conditions of the experiment as well as of the
nature of the gas which is in contact with the radium and becomes
charged with the emanation the regularity of the phenomenon is so
great that it can be used to measure time in 3985 seconds36 the
activity is always reduced onehalf
footnote 36 according to professor rutherford in 377 daysed
radioactivity induced on any body which has been for a long time in
presence of a salt of radium disappears more rapidly the phenomenon
appears moreover more complex and the formula which expresses the
manner in which the activity diminishes must contain two exponentials
to find it theoretically we have to imagine that the emanation first
deposits on the body in question a substance which is destroyed in
giving birth to a second this latter disappearing in its turn by
generating a third the initial and final substances would be
radioactive but the intermediary one not if moreover the bodies
acted on are brought to a temperature of over 700 they appear to
lose by volatilisation certain substances condensed in them and at
the same time their activity disappears
the other radioactive bodies behave in a similar way bodies which
contain actinium are particularly rich in emanations uranium on the
contrary has none37 this body nevertheless is the seat of
transformations comparable to those which the study of emanations
reveals in radium sir w crookes has separated from uranium a matter
which is now called uranium x this matter is at first much more
active than its parent but its activity diminishes rapidly while the
ordinary uranium which at the time of the separation loses its
activity regains it by degrees in the same way professors
rutherford and soddy have discovered a socalled thorium x to be the
stage through which ordinary thorium has to pass in order to produce
its emanation38
footnote 37 professor rutherford has lately stated that uranium may
possibly produce an emanation but that its rate of decay must be too
swift for its presence to be verified see radioactive
transformations p 161ed
footnote 38 an actinium x was also discovered by professor giesel
jahrbuch d radioaktivitat i p 358 1904 since the above was
written another product has been found to intervene between the x
substance and the emanation in the case of actinium and thorium they
have been named radioactinium and radiothorium respectivelyed
it is not possible to give a complete table which should as it were
represent the genealogical tree of the various radioactive substances
several authors have endeavoured to do so but in a premature manner
all the affiliations are not at the present time yet perfectly known
and it will no doubt be acknowledged some day that identical states
have been described under different names39
footnote 39 such a table is given on p 169 of rutherfords
radioactive transformationsed
 4 the disaggregation of matter and atomic energy
in spite of uncertainties which are not yet entirely removed it
cannot be denied that many experiments render it probable that in
radioactive bodies we find ourselves witnessing veritable
transformations of matter
professor rutherford professor soddy and several other physicists
have come to regard these phenomena in the following way a
radioactive body is composed of atoms which have little stability and
are able to detach themselves spontaneously from the parent substance
and at the same time to divide themselves into two essential component
parts the negative electron and its residue the positive ion the
firstnamed constitutes the beta and the second the alpha rays
the emanation is certainly composed of alpha ions with a few molecules
agglomerated round them professor rutherford has in fact
demonstrated that the emanation is charged with positive electricity
and this emanation may in turn be destroyed by giving birth to new
bodies
after the loss of the atoms which are carried off by the radiation
the remainder of the body acquires new properties but it may still be
radioactive and again lose atoms the various stages that we meet
with in the evolution of the radioactive substance or of its
emanation correspond to the various degrees of atomic disaggregation
professors rutherford and soddy have described them clearly in the
case of uranium and radium as regards thorium the results are less
satisfactory the evolution should continue until a stable atomic
condition is finally reached which because of this stability is no
longer radioactive thus for instance radium would finally be
transformed into helium40
footnote 40 this opinion no doubt formed when sir william ramsays
discovery of the formation of helium from the radium emanation was
first made known is now less tenable the latest theory is that the
alpha particle is in fact an atom of helium and that the final
transformation product of radium and the other radioactive substances
is lead cf rutherford op cit passimed
it is possible by considerations analogous to those set forth above
in other cases to arrive at an idea of the total number of particles
per second expelled by one gramme of radium professor rutherford in
his most recent evaluation finds that this number approaches 25 x
101141 by calculating from the atomic weight the number of atoms
probably contained in this gramme of radium and supposing each
particle liberated to correspond to the destruction of one atom it is
found that one half of the radium should disappear in 1280 years42
and from this we may conceive that it has not yet been possible to
discover any sensible loss of weight sir w ramsay and professor
soddy attained a like result by endeavouring to estimate the mass of
the emanation by the quantity of helium produced
footnote 41 see radioactive transformations p 251 professor
rutherford says that each of the alpha ray products present in one
gram of radium product sic expels 62 x 1010 alpha particles
per second he also remarks on the experimental difficulty of
accurately determining the number of alpha particles expelled from
radium per seconded
footnote 42 see rutherford op cit p 150ed
if radium transforms itself in such a way that its activity does not
persist throughout the ages it loses little by little the provision
of energy it had in the beginning and its properties furnish no valid
argument to oppose to the principle of the conservation of energy to
put everything right we have only to recognise that radium possessed
in the potential state at its formation a finite quantity of energy
which is consumed little by little in the same manner a chemical
system composed for instance of zinc and sulphuric acid also
contains in the potential state energy which if we retard the
reaction by any suitable arrangementsuch as by amalgamating the zinc
and by constituting with its elements a battery which we cause to act
on a resistancemay be made to exhaust itself as slowly as one may
desire
there can therefore be nothing in any way surprising in the fact
that a combination which like the atomic combination of radium is
not stablesince it disaggregates itselfis capable of
spontaneously liberating energy but what may be a little astonishing
at first sight is the considerable amount of this energy
m curie has calculated directly by the aid of the calorimeter the
quantity of energy liberated measuring it entirely in the form of
heat the disengagement of heat accounted for in a grain of radium is
uniform and amounts to 100 calories per hour it must therefore be
admitted that an atom of radium in disaggregating itself liberates
30000 times more energy than a molecule of hydrogen when the latter
combines with an atom of oxygen to form a molecule of water
we may ask ourselves how the atomic edifice of the active body can be
constructed to contain so great a provision of energy we will remark
that such a question might be asked concerning cases known from the
most remote antiquity like that of the chemical systems without any
satisfactory answer ever being given this failure surprises no one
for we get used to everythingeven to defeat
when we come to deal with a new problem we have really no right to
show ourselves more exacting yet there are found persons who refuse
to admit the hypothesis of the atomic disaggregation of radium because
they cannot have set before them a detailed plan of that complex whole
known to us as an atom
the most natural idea is perhaps the one suggested by comparison with
those astronomical phenomena where our observation most readily allows
us to comprehend the laws of motion it corresponds likewise to the
tendency ever present in the mind of man to compare the infinitely
small with the infinitely great the atom may be regarded as a sort of
solar system in which electrons in considerable numbers gravitate
round the sun formed by the positive ion it may happen that certain
of these electrons are no longer retained in their orbit by the
electric attraction of the rest of the atom and may be projected from
it like a small planet or comet which escapes towards the stellar
spaces the phenomena of the emission of light compels us to think
that the corpuscles revolve round the nucleus with extreme velocities
or at the rate of thousands of billions of evolutions per second it
is easy to conceive from this that notwithstanding its lightness an
atom thus constituted may possess an enormous energy43
footnote 43 this view of the case has been made very clear by m
gustave le bon in lvolution de la matire paris 1906 see
especially pp 3652 where the amount of the supposed intraatomic
energy is calculateded
other authors imagine that the energy of the corpuscles is principally
due to the extremely rapid rotations of those elements on their own
axes lord kelvin lately drew up on another model the plan of a
radioactive atom capable of ejecting an electron with a considerable
vis viva he supposes a spherical atom formed of concentric layers
of positive and negative electricity disposed in such a way that its
external action is null and that nevertheless the force emanated
from the centre may be repellent for certain values when the electron
is within it
the most prudent physicists and those most respectful to established
principles may without any scruples admit the explanation of the
radioactivity of radium by a dislocation of its molecular edifice the
matter of which it is constituted evolves from an admittedly unstable
initial state to another stable one it is in a way a slow
allotropic transformation which takes place by means of a mechanism
regarding which in short we have no more information than we have
regarding other analogous transformations the only astonishment we
can legitimately feel is derived from the thought that we are suddenly
and deeply penetrating to the very heart of things
but those persons who have a little more hardihood do not easily
resist the temptation of forming daring generalisations thus it will
occur to some that this property already discovered in many
substances where it exists in more or less striking degree is with
differences of intensity common to all bodies and that we are thus
confronted by a phenomenon derived from an essential quality of
matter quite recently professor rutherford has demonstrated in a
fine series of experiments that the alpha particles of radium cease to
ionize gases when they are made to lose their velocity but that they
do not on that account cease to exist it may follow that many bodies
emit similar particles without being easily perceived to do so since
the electric action by which this phenomenon of radioactivity is
generally manifested would in this case be but very weak
if we thus believe radioactivity to be an absolutely general
phenomenon we find ourselves face to face with a new problem the
transformation of radioactive bodies can no longer be assimilated to
allotropic transformations since thus no final form could ever be
attained and the disaggregation would continue indefinitely up to the
complete dislocation of the atom44 the phenomenon might it is
true have a duration of perhaps thousands of millions of centuries
but this duration is but a minute in the infinity of time and matters
little our habits of mind if we adopt such a conception will be
none the less very deeply disturbed we shall have to abandon the idea
so instinctively dear to us that matter is the most stable thing in
the universe and to admit on the contrary that all bodies whatever
are a kind of explosive decomposing with extreme slowness there is in
this whatever may have been said nothing contrary to any of the
principles on which the science of energetics rests but an hypothesis
of this nature carries with it consequences which ought in the highest
degree to interest the philosopher and we all know with what alluring
boldness m gustave le bon has developed all these consequences in his
work on the evolution of matter45
footnote 44 this is the main contention of m gustave le bon in
his work last quoteded
footnote 45 see last noteed
there is hardly a physicist who does not at the present day adopt in
one shape or another the ballistic hypothesis all new facts are
coordinated so happily by it that it more and more satisfies our
minds but it cannot be asserted that it forces itself on our
convictions with irresistible weight another point of view appeared
more plausible and simple at the outset when there seemed reason to
consider the energy radiated by radioactive bodies as inexhaustible
it was thought that the source of this energy was to be looked for
without the atom and this idea may perfectly well he maintained at
the present day
radium on this hypothesis must be considered as a transformer
borrowing energy from the external medium and returning it in the form
of radiation it is not impossible even to admit that the energy
which the atom of radium withdraws from the surrounding medium may
serve to keep up not only the heat emitted and its complex radiation
but also the dissociation supposed to be endothermic of this atom
such seems to be the idea of m debierne and also of m sagnac it
does not seem to accord with the experiments that this borrowed energy
can be a part of the heat of the ambient medium and indeed such a
phenomenon would be contrary to the principle of carnot if we wished
though we have seen how disputable is this extension to extend this
principle to the phenomena which are produced in the very bosom of the
atom
we may also address ourselves to a more noble form of energy and ask
ourselves whether we are not for the first time in presence of a
transformation of gravitational energy it may be singular but it is
not absurd to suppose that the unit of mass of radium is not attached
to the earth with the same intensity as an inert body m sagnac has
commenced some experiments as yet unpublished in order to study the
laws of the fall of a fragment of radium they are necessarily very
delicate and the energetic and ingenious physicist has not yet
succeeded in finishing them46 let us suppose that he succeeds in
demonstrating that the intensity of gravity is less for radium than
for the platinum or the copper of which the pendulums used to
illustrate the law of newton are generally made it would then be
possible still to think that the laws of universal attraction are
perfectly exact as regards the stars and that ponderability is really
a particular case of universal attraction while in the case of
radioactive bodies part of the gravitational energy is transformed in
the course of its evolution and appears in the form of active
radiation
footnote 46 in reality m sagnac operated in the converse manner he
took two equal weights of a salt of radium and a salt of barium
which he made oscillate one after the other in a torsion balance had
the durations of oscillation been different it might be concluded
that the mechanical mass is not the same for radium as for barium
but for this explanation to be admitted it would evidently need to be
supported by very numerous facts it might no doubt appear still
more probable that the energy borrowed from the external medium by
radium is one of those still unknown to us but of which a vague
instinct causes us to suspect the existence around us it is
indisputable moreover that the atmosphere in all directions is
furrowed with active radiations those of radium may be secondary
radiations reflected by a kind of resonance phenomenon
certain experiments by professors elster and geitel however are not
favourable to this point of view if an active body be surrounded by a
radioactive envelope a screen should prevent this body from receiving
any impression from outside and yet there is no diminution apparent
in the activity presented by a certain quantity of radium when it is
lowered to a depth of 800 metres under ground in a region containing
a notable quantity of pitchblende these negative results are on the
other hand so many successes for the partisans of the explanation of
radioactivity by atomic energy
chapter x
the ether and matter
 1 the relations between the ether and matter
for some time past it has been the more or less avowed ambition of
physicists to construct with the particles of ether all possible forms
of corporeal existence but our knowledge of the inmost nature of
things has hitherto seemed too limited for us to attempt such an
enterprise with any chance of success the electronic hypothesis
however which has furnished a satisfactory image of the most curious
phenomena produced in the bosom of matter has also led to a more
complete electromagnetic theory of the ether than that of maxwell and
this twofold result has given birth to the hope of arriving by means
of this hypothesis at a complete coordination of the physical world
the phenomena whose study may bring us to the very threshold of the
problem are those in which the connections between matter and the
ether appear clearly and in a relatively simple manner thus in the
phenomena of emission ponderable matter is seen to give birth to
waves which are transmitted by the ether and by the phenomena of
absorption it is proved that these waves disappear and excite
modifications in the interior of the material bodies which receive
them we here catch in operation actual reciprocal actions and
reactions between the ether and matter if we could thoroughly
comprehend these actions we should no doubt be in a position to fill
up the gap which separates the two regions separately conquered by
physical science
in recent years numerous researches have supplied valuable materials
which ought to be utilized by those endeavouring to construct a theory
of radiation we are perhaps still ill informed as to the phenomena
of luminescence in which undulations are produced in a complex manner
as in the case of a stick of moist phosphorus which is luminescent in
the dark or in that of a fluorescent screen but we are very well
acquainted with emission or absorption by incandescence where the
only transformation is that of calorific into radiating energy or
vice versa it is in this case alone that can be correctly applied
the celebrated demonstration by which kirchhoff established by
considerations borrowed from thermodynamics the proportional
relations between the power of emission and that of absorption
in treating of the measurement of temperature i have already pointed
out the experiments of professors lummer and pringsheim and the
theoretical researches of stephan and professor wien we may consider
that at the present day the laws of the radiation of dark bodies are
tolerably well known and in particular the manner in which each
elementary radiation increases with the temperature a few doubts
however subsist with respect to the law of the distribution of energy
in the spectrum in the case of real and solid bodies the results are
naturally less simple than in that of dark bodies one side of the
question has been specially studied on account of its great practical
interest that is to say the fact that the relation of the luminous
energy to the total amount radiated by a body varies with the nature
of this last and the knowledge of the conditions under which this
relation becomes most considerable led to the discovery of
incandescent lighting by gas in the auerwelsbach mantle and to the
substitution for the carbon thread in the electric light bulb of a
filament of osmium or a small rod of magnesium as in the nernst lamp
careful measurements effected by m fery have furnished in
particular important information on the radiation of the white
oxides but the phenomena noticed have not yet found a satisfactory
interpretation moreover the radiation of calorific origin is here
accompanied by a more or less important luminescence and the problem
becomes very complex
in the same way that for the purpose of knowing the constitution of
matter it first occurred to us to investigate gases which appear to
be molecular edifices built on a more simple and uniform plan than
solids we ought naturally to think that an examination of the
conditions in which emission and absorption are produced by gaseous
bodies might be eminently profitable and might perhaps reveal the
mechanism by which the relations between the molecule of the ether and
the molecule of matter might be established
unfortunately if a gas is not absolutely incapable of emitting some
sort of rays by simple heat the radiation thus produced no doubt by
reason of the slightness of the mass in play always remains of
moderate intensity in nearly all the experiments new energies of
chemical or electrical origin come into force on incandescence
luminescence is superposed and the advantage which might have been
expected from the simplicity of the medium vanishes through the
complication of the circumstances in which the phenomenon is produced
professor pringsheim has succeeded in certain cases in finding the
dividing line between the phenomena of luminescence and that of
incandescence thus the former takes a predominating importance when
the gas is rendered luminous by electrical discharges and chemical
transformations especially play a preponderant rle in the emission
of the spectrum of flames which contain a saline vapour in all the
ordinary experiments of spectrum analysis the laws of kirchhoff cannot
therefore be considered as established and yet the relation between
emission and absorption is generally tolerably well verified no doubt
we are here in presence of a kind of resonance phenomenon the gaseous
atoms entering into vibration when solicited by the ether by a motion
identical with the one they are capable of communicating to it
if we are not yet very far advanced in the study of the mechanism of
the production of the spectrum47 we are on the other hand well
acquainted with its constitution the extreme confusion which the
spectra of the lines of the gases seemed to present is now in great
part at least cleared up balmer gave some time since in the case of
the hydrogen spectrum an empirical formula which enabled the rays
discovered later by an eminent astronomer m deslandres to be
represented but since then both in the cases of line and band
spectra the labours of professor rydberg of m deslandres of
professors kayzer and runge and of m thiele have enabled us to
comprehend in their smallest details the laws of the distribution of
lines and bands
footnote 47 many theories as to the cause of the lines and bands of
the spectrum have been put forward since this was written among which
that of professor stark for which see physikalische zeitschrift for
1906 passim is perhaps the most advanced that of m jean becquerel
which would attribute it to the vibration within the atom of both
negative and positive electrons also deserves notice a popular
account of this is given in the athenum of 20th april 1907ed
these laws are simple but somewhat singular the radiations emitted
by a gas cannot be compared to the notes to which a sonorous body
gives birth nor even to the most complicated vibrations of any
elastic body the number of vibrations of the different rays are not
the successive multiples of one and the same number and it is not a
question of a fundamental radiation and its harmonics whileand this
is an essential differencethe number of vibrations of the radiation
tend towards a limit when the period diminishes infinitely instead of
constantly increasing as would be the case with the vibrations of
sound
thus the assimilation of the luminous to the elastic vibration is not
correct once again we find that the ether does not behave like matter
which obeys the ordinary laws of mechanics and every theory must take
full account of these curious peculiarities which experiment reveals
another difference likewise very important between the luminous and
the sonorous vibrations which also points out how little analogous
can be the constitutions of the media which transmit the vibrations
appears in the phenomena of dispersion the speed of propagation
which as we have seen when discussing the measurement of the velocity
of sound depends very little on the musical note is not at all the
same in the case of the various radiations which can be propagated in
the same substance the index of refraction varies with the duration
of the period or if you will with the length of wave in vacuo
which is proportioned to this duration since in vacuo the speed of
propagation is entirely the same for all vibrations
cauchy was the first to propose a theory on which other attempts have
been modelled for example the very interesting and simple one of
briot this lastnamed supposed that the luminous vibration could not
perceptibly drag with it the molecular material of the medium across
which it is propagated but that matter nevertheless reacts on the
ether with an intensity proportional to the elongation in such a
manner as tends to bring it back to its position of equilibrium with
this simple hypothesis we can fairly well interpret the phenomena of
the dispersion of light in the case of transparent substances but far
from well as m carvallo has noted in some extremely careful
experiments the dispersion of the infrared spectrum and not at all
the peculiarities presented by absorbent substances
m boussinesq arrives at almost similar results by attributing
dispersion on the other hand to the partial dragging along of
ponderable matter and to its action on the ether by combining in a
measure as was subsequently done by m boussinesq the two
hypotheses formulas can be established far better in accord with all
the known facts
these facts are somewhat complex it was at first thought that the
index always varied in inverse ratio to the wavelength but numerous
substances have been discovered which present the phenomenon of
abnormal dispersionthat is to say substances in which certain
radiations are propagated on the contrary the more quickly the
shorter their period this is the case with gases themselves as
demonstrated for example by a very elegant experiment of m
becquerel on the dispersion of the vapour of sodium moreover it may
happen that yet more complications may be met with as no substance is
transparent for the whole extent of the spectrum in the case of
certain radiations the speed of propagation becomes nil and the index
shows sometimes a maximum and sometimes a minimum all those phenomena
are in close relation with those of absorption
it is perhaps the formula proposed by helmholtz which best accounts
for all these peculiarities helmholtz came to establish this formula
by supposing that there is a kind of friction between the ether and
matter which like that exercised on a pendulum here produces a
double effect changing on the one hand the duration of this
oscillation and on the other gradually damping it he further
supposed that ponderable matter is acted on by elastic forces the
theory of helmholtz has the great advantage of representing not only
the phenomena of dispersion but also as m carvallo has pointed out
the laws of rotatory polarization its dispersion and other phenomena
among them the dichroism of the rotatory media discovered by m
cotton
in the establishment of these theories the language of ordinary
optics has always been employed the phenomena are looked upon as due
to mechanical deformations or to movements governed by certain forces
the electromagnetic theory leads as we have seen to the employment
of other images mh poincar and after him helmholtz have both
proposed electromagnetic theories of dispersion on examining things
closely it will be found that there are not in truth in the two
ways of regarding the problem two equivalent translations of exterior
reality the electrical theory gives us to understand much better
than the mechanical one that in vacuo the dispersion ought to be
strictly null and this absence of dispersion appears to be confirmed
with extraordinary precision by astronomical observations thus the
observation often repeated and at different times of year proves
that in the case of the star algol the light of which takes at least
four years to reach us no sensible difference in coloration
accompanies the changes in brilliancy
 2 the theory of lorentz
purely mechanical considerations have therefore failed to give an
entirely satisfactory interpretation of the phenomena in which even
the simplest relations between matter and the ether appear they
would evidently be still more insufficient if used to explain
certain effects produced on matter by light which could not without
grave difficulties be attributed to movement for instance the
phenomena of electrification under the influence of certain
radiations or again chemical reactions such as photographic
impressions
the problem had to be approached by another road the electromagnetic
theory was a step in advance but it comes to a standstill so to
speak at the moment when the ether penetrates into matter if we wish
to go deeper into the inwardness of the phenomena we must follow for
example professor lorentz or dr larmor and look with them for a mode
of representation which appears besides to be a natural consequence
of the fundamental ideas forming the basis of hertzs experiments
the moment we look upon a wave in the ether as an electromagnetic
wave a molecule which emits light ought to be considered as a kind of
excitant we are thus led to suppose that in each radiating molecule
there are one or several electrified particles animated with a
toandfro movement round their positions of equilibrium and these
particles are certainly identical with those electrons the existence
of which we have already admitted for so many other reasons
in the simplest theory we will imagine an electron which may be
displaced from its position of equilibrium in all directions and is
in this displacement submitted to attractions which communicate to it
a vibration like a pendulum these movements are equivalent to tiny
currents and the mobile electron when animated with a considerable
velocity must be sensitive to the action of the magnet which modifies
the form of the trajectory and the value of the period this almost
direct consequence was perceived by lorentz and it led him to the new
idea that radiations emitted by a body ought to be modified by the
action of a strong electromagnet
an experiment enabled this prevision to be verified it was made as
is well known as early as 1896 by zeeman and the discovery produced
a legitimate sensation when a flame is subjected to the action of a
magnetic field a brilliant line is decomposed in conditions more or
less complex which an attentive study however allows us to define
according to whether the observation is made in a plane normal to the
magnetic field or in the same direction the line transforms itself
into a triplet or doublet and the new lines are polarized
rectilinearly or circularly
these are the precise phenomena which the calculation foretells the
analysis of the modifications undergone by the light supplies
moreover valuable information on the electron itself from the
direction of the circular vibrations of the greatest frequency we can
determine the sign of the electric charge in motion and we find it to
be negative but further than this from the variation of the period
we can calculate the relation of the force acting on the electron to
its material mass and in addition the relation of the charge to the
mass we then find for this relation precisely that value which we
have already met with so many times such a coincidence cannot be
fortuitous and we have the right to believe that the electron
revealed by the luminous wave which emanates from it is really the
same as the one made known to us by the study of the cathode rays and
of the radioactive substances
however the elementary theory does not suffice to interpret the
complications which later experiments have revealed the physicists
most qualified to effect measurements in these delicate optical
questionsm cornu mr preston m cotton mm becquerel and
deslandres m broca professor michelson and othershave pointed
out some remarkable peculiarities thus in some cases the number of
the component rays dissociated by the magnetic field may be very
considerable
the great modification brought to a radiation by the zeeman effect
may besides combine itself with other phenomena and alter the light
in a still more complicated manner a pencil of polarized light as
demonstrated by signori macaluzo and corbino undergoes in a magnetic
field modifications with regard to absorption and speed of
propagation
some ingenious researches by m becquerel and m cotton have perfectly
elucidated all these complications from an experimental point of view
it would not be impossible to link together all these phenomena
without adopting the electronic hypothesis by preserving the old
optical equations as modified by the terms relating to the action of
the magnetic field this has actually been done in some very
remarkable work by m voigt but we may also like professor lorentz
look for more general theories in which the essential image of the
electrons shall be preserved and which will allow all the facts
revealed by experiment to be included
we are thus led to the supposition that there is not in the atom one
vibrating electron only but that there is to be found in it a
dynamical system comprising several material points which may be
subjected to varied movements the neutral atom may therefore be
considered as composed of an immovable principal portion positively
charged round which move like satellites round a planet several
negative electrons of very inferior mass this conclusion leads us to
an interpretation in agreement with that which other phenomena have
already suggested
these electrons which thus have a variable velocity generate around
themselves a transverse electromagnetic wave which is propagated with
the velocity of light for the charged particle becomes as soon as it
experiences a change of speed the centre of a radiation thus is
explained the phenomenon of the emission of radiations in the same
way the movement of electrons may be excited or modified by the
electrical forces which exist in any pencil of light they receive and
this pencil may yield up to them a part of the energy it is carrying
this is the phenomenon of absorption
professor lorentz has not contented himself with thus explaining all
the mechanism of the phenomena of emission and absorption he has
endeavoured to rediscover by starting with the fundamental
hypothesis the quantitative laws discovered by thermodynamics he
succeeds in showing that agreeably to the law of kirchhoff the
relation between the emitting and the absorbing power must be
independent of the special properties of the body under observation
and he thus again meets with the laws of planck and of wien
unfortunately the calculation can only be made in the case of great
wavelengths and grave difficulties exist thus it cannot be very
clearly explained why by heating a body the radiation is displaced
towards the side of the short wavelengths or if you will why a
body becomes luminous from the moment its temperature has reached a
sufficiently high degree on the other hand by calculating the energy
of the vibrating particles we are again led to attribute to these
particles the same constitution as that of the electrons
it is in the same way possible as professor lorentz has shown to
give a very satisfactory explanation of the thermoelectric phenomena
by supposing that the number of liberated electrons which exist in a
given metal at a given temperature has a determined value varying with
each metal and is in the case of each body a function of the
temperature the formula obtained which is based on these hypotheses
agrees completely with the classic results of clausius and of lord
kelvin finally if we recollect that the phenomena of electric and
calorific conductivity are perfectly interpreted by the hypothesis of
electrons it will no longer be possible to contest the importance of
a theory which allows us to group together in one synthesis so many
facts of such diverse origins
if we study the conditions under which a wave excited by an electrons
variations in speed can be transmitted they again bring us face to
face and generally with the results pointed out by the ordinary
electromagnetic theory certain peculiarities however are not
absolutely the same thus the theory of lorentz as well as that of
maxwell leads us to foresee that if an insulating mass be caused to
move in a magnetic field normally to its lines of force a
displacement will be produced in this mass analogous to that of which
faraday and maxwell admitted the existence in the dielectric of a
charged condenser but mh poincar has pointed out that according
as we adopt one or other of these authors points of view so the
value of the displacement differs this remark is very important for
it may lead to an experiment which would enable us to make a definite
choice between the two theories
to obtain the displacement estimated according to lorentz we must
multiply the displacement calculated according to hertz by a factor
representing the relation between the difference of the specific
inductive capacities of the dielectric and of a vacuum and the first
of these powers if therefore we take as dielectric the air of which
the specific inductive capacity is perceptibly the same as that of a
vacuum the displacement according to the idea of lorentz will be
null while on the contrary according to hertz it will have a
finite value m blondlot has made the experiment he sent a current
of air into a condenser placed in a magnetic field and was never able
to notice the slightest trace of electrification no displacement
therefore is effected in the dielectric the experiment being a
negative one is evidently less convincing than one giving a positive
result but it furnishes a very powerful argument in favour of the
theory of lorentz
this theory therefore appears very seductive yet it still raises
objections on the part of those who oppose to it the principles of
ordinary mechanics if we consider for instance a radiation emitted
by an electron belonging to one material body but absorbed by another
electron in another body we perceive immediately that the
propagation not being instantaneous there can be no compensation
between the action and the reaction which are not simultaneous and
the principle of newton thus seems to be attacked in order to
preserve its integrity it has to be admitted that the movements in
the two material substances are compensated by that of the ether which
separates these substances but this conception although in tolerable
agreement with the hypothesis that the ether and matter are not of
different essence involves on a closer examination suppositions
hardly satisfactory as to the nature of movements in the ether
for a long time physicists have admitted that the ether as a whole
must be considered as being immovable and capable of serving so to
speak as a support for the axes of galileo in relation to which axes
the principle of inertia is applicableor better still as m
painlev has shown they alone allow us to render obedience to the
principle of causality
but if it were so we might apparently hope by experiments in
electromagnetism to obtain absolute motion and to place in evidence
the translation of the earth relatively to the ether but all the
researches attempted by the most ingenious physicists towards this end
have always failed and this tends towards the idea held by many
geometricians that these negative results are not due to imperfections
in the experiments but have a deep and general cause now lorentz has
endeavoured to find the conditions in which the electromagnetic theory
proposed by him might agree with the postulate of the complete
impossibility of determining absolute motion it is necessary in
order to realise this concord to imagine that a mobile system
contracts very slightly in the direction of its translation to a
degree proportioned to the square of the ratio of the velocity of
transport to that of light the electrons themselves do not escape
this contraction although the observer since he participates in the
same motion naturally cannot notice it lorentz supposes besides
that all forces whatever their origin are affected by a translation
in the same way as electromagnetic forces m langevin and m h
poincar have studied this same question and have noted with precision
various delicate consequences of it the singularity of the hypotheses
which we are thus led to construct in no way constitutes an argument
against the theory of lorentz but it has we must acknowledge
discouraged some of the more timid partisans of this theory48
footnote 48 an objection not here noticed has lately been formulated
with much frankness by professor lorentz himself it is one of the
pillars of his theory that only the negative electrons move when an
electric current passes through a metal and that the positive
electrons if any such there be remain motionless yet in the
experiment known as halls the current is deflected by the magnetic
field to one side of the strip in certain metals and to the opposite
side in others this seems to show that in certain cases the positive
electrons move instead of the negative and professor lorentz
confesses that up to the present he can find no valid argument against
this see archives nerlandaises 1906 parts 1 and 2ed
 3 the mass of electrons
other conceptions bolder still are suggested by the results of
certain interesting experiments the electron affords us the
possibility of considering inertia and mass to be no longer a
fundamental notion but a consequence of the electromagnetic
phenomena
professor jj thomson was the first to have the clear idea that a
part at least of the inertia of an electrified body is due to its
electric charge this idea was taken up and precisely stated by
professor max abraham who for the first time was led to regard
seriously the seemingly paradoxical notion of mass as a function of
velocity consider a small particle bearing a given electric charge
and let us suppose that this particle moves through the ether it is
as we know equivalent to a current proportional to its velocity and
it therefore creates a magnetic field the intensity of which is
likewise proportional to its velocity to set it in motion therefore
there must be communicated to it over and above the expenditure
corresponding to the acquisition of its ordinary kinetic energy a
quantity of energy proportional to the square of its velocity
everything therefore takes place as if by the fact of
electrification its capacity for kinetic energy and its material mass
had been increased by a certain constant quantity to the ordinary
mass may be added if you will an electromagnetic mass
this is the state of things so long as the speed of the translation of
the particle is not very great but they are no longer quite the same
when this particle is animated with a movement whose rapidity becomes
comparable to that with which light is propagated
the magnetic field created is then no longer a field in repose but
its energy depends in a complicated manner on the velocity and the
apparent increase in the mass of the particle itself becomes a
function of the velocity more than this this increase may not be the
same for the same velocity but varies according to whether the
acceleration is parallel with or perpendicular to the direction of
this velocity in other words there seems to be a longitudinal and a
transversal mass which need not be the same
all these results would persist even if the material mass were very
small relatively to the electromagnetic mass and the electron
possesses some inertia even if its ordinary mass becomes slighter and
slighter the apparent mass it can be easily shown increases
indefinitely when the velocity with which the electrified particle is
animated tends towards the velocity of light and thus the work
necessary to communicate such a velocity to an electron would be
infinite it is in consequence impossible that the speed of an
electron in relation to the ether can ever exceed or even
permanently attain to 300000 kilometres per second
all the facts thus predicted by the theory are confirmed by
experiment there is no known process which permits the direct
measurement of the mass of an electron but it is possible as we have
seen to measure simultaneously its velocity and the relation of the
electric charge to its mass in the case of the cathode rays emitted
by radium these measurements are particularly interesting for the
reason that the rays which compose a pencil of cathode rays are
animated by very different speeds as is shown by the size of the
stain produced on a photographic plate by a pencil of them at first
very constricted and subsequently dispersed by the action of an
electric or magnetic field professor kaufmann has effected some very
careful experiments by a method he terms the method of crossed
spectra which consists in superposing the deviations produced by a
magnetic and an electric field respectively acting in directions at
right angles one to another he has thus been enabled by working in
vacuo to register the very different velocities which starting in
the case of certain rays from about seventenths of the velocity of
light attain in other cases to ninetyfive hundredths of it
it is thus noted that the ratio of charge to masswhich for ordinary
speeds is constant and equal to that already found by so many
experimentsdiminishes slowly at first and then very rapidly when
the velocity of the ray increases and approaches that of light if we
represent this variation by a curve the shape of this curve inclines
us to think that the ratio tends toward zero when the velocity tends
towards that of light
all the earlier experiments have led us to consider that the electric
charge was the same for all electrons and it can hardly be conceived
that this charge can vary with the velocity for in order that the
relation of which one of the terms remains fixed should vary the
other term necessarily cannot remain constant the experiments of
professor kaufmann therefore confirm the previsions of max abrahams
theory the mass depends on the velocity and increases indefinitely
in proportion as this velocity approaches that of light these
experiments moreover allow the numerical results of the calculation
to be compared with the values measured this very satisfactory
comparison shows that the apparent total mass is sensibly equal to the
electromagnetic mass the material mass of the electron is therefore
nil and the whole of its mass is electromagnetic
thus the electron must be looked upon as a simple electric charge
devoid of matter previous examination has led us to attribute to it a
mass a thousand times less that that of the atom of hydrogen and a
more attentive study shows that this mass was fictitious the
electromagnetic phenomena which are produced when the electron is set
in motion or a change effected in its velocity simply have the
effect as it were of simulating inertia and it is the inertia due
to the charge which has caused us to be thus deluded
the electron is therefore simply a small volume determined at a point
in the ether and possessing special properties49 this point is
propagated with a velocity which cannot exceed that of light when
this velocity is constant the electron creates around it in its
passage an electric and a magnetic field round this electrified
centre there exists a kind of wake which follows it through the ether
and does not become modified so long as the velocity remains
invariable if other electrons follow the first within a wire their
passage along the wire will be what is called an electric current
footnote 49 this cannot be said to be yet completely proved cf
sir oliver lodge electrons london 1906 p 200ed
when the electron is subjected to an acceleration a transverse wave
is produced and an electromagnetic radiation is generated of which
the character may naturally change with the manner in which the speed
varies if the electron has a sufficiently rapid periodical movement
this wave is a light wave while if the electron stops suddenly a
kind of pulsation is transmitted through the ether and thus we obtain
rntgen rays
 4 new views on the constitution of the ether and of matter
new and valuable information is thus afforded us regarding the
properties of the ether but will this enable us to construct a
material representation of this medium which fills the universe and
so to solve a problem which has baffled as we have seen the
prolonged efforts of our predecessors
certain scholars seem to have cherished this hope dr larmor in
particular as we have seen has proposed a most ingenious image but
one which is manifestly insufficient the present tendency of
physicists rather tends to the opposite view since they consider
matter as a very complex object regarding which we wrongly imagine
ourselves to be well informed because we are so much accustomed to it
and its singular properties end by seeming natural to us but in all
probability the ether is in its objective reality much more simple
and has a better right to be considered as fundamental
we cannot therefore without being very illogical define the ether by
material properties and it is useless labour condemned beforehand to
sterility to endeavour to determine it by other qualities than those
of which experiment gives us direct and exact knowledge
the ether is defined when we know in all its points and in magnitude
and in direction the two fields electric and magnetic which may
exist in it these two fields may vary we speak from habit of a
movement propagated in the ether but the phenomenon within the reach
of experiment is the propagation of these variations
since the electrons considered as a modification of the ether
symmetrically distributed round a point perfectly counterfeit that
inertia which is the fundamental property of matter it becomes very
tempting to suppose that matter itself is composed of a more or less
complex assemblage of electrified centres in motion
this complexity is in general very great as is demonstrated by the
examination of the luminous spectra produced by the atoms and it is
precisely because of the compensations produced between the different
movements that the essential properties of matterthe law of the
conservation of inertia for exampleare not contrary to the
hypothesis
the forces of cohesion thus would be due to the mutual attractions
which occur in the electric and magnetic fields produced in the
interior of bodies and it is even conceivable that there may be
produced under the influence of these actions a tendency to
determine orientation that is to say that a reason can be seen why
matter may be crystallised50
footnote 50 the reader should however be warned that a theory has
lately been put forth which attempts to account for crystallisation on
purely mechanical grounds see messrs barlow and popes development
of the atomic theory in the transactions of the chemical society
1906ed
all the experiments effected on the conductivity of gases or metals
and on the radiations of active bodies have induced us to regard the
atom as being constituted by a positively charged centre having
practically the same magnitude as the atom itself round which the
electrons gravitate and it might evidently be supposed that this
positive centre itself preserves the fundamental characteristics of
matter and that it is the electrons alone which no longer possess any
but electromagnetic mass
we have but little information concerning these positive particles
though they are met with in an isolated condition as we have seen in
the canal rays or in the x rays51 it has not hitherto been possible
to study them so successfully as the electrons themselves but that
their magnitude causes them to produce considerable perturbations in
the bodies on which they fall is manifest by the secondary emissions
which complicate and mask the primitive phenomenon there are
however strong reasons for thinking that these positive centres are
not simple thus professor stark attributes to them with experiments
in proof of his opinion the emission of the spectra of the rays in
geissler tubes and the complexity of the spectrum discloses the
complexity of the centre besides certain peculiarities in the
conductivity of metals cannot be explained without a supposition of
this kind so that the atom deprived of the cathode corpuscle would
be still liable to decomposition into elements analogous to electrons
and positively charged consequently nothing prevents us supposing
that this centre likewise simulates inertia by its electromagnetic
properties and is but a condition localised in the ether
footnote 51 there is much reason for thinking that the canal rays do
not contain positive particles alone but are accompanied by negative
electrons of slow velocity the x rays are thought as has been said
above to contain neither negative nor positive particles but to be
merely pulses in the ethered
however this may be the edifice thus constructed being composed of
electrons in periodical motion necessarily grows old the electrons
become subject to accelerations which produce a radiation towards the
exterior of the atom and certain of them may leave the body while
the primitive stability is in the end no longer assured and a new
arrangement tends to be formed matter thus seems to us to undergo
those transformations of which the radioactive bodies have given us
such remarkable examples
we have already had in fragments these views on the constitution of
matter a deeper study of the electron thus enables us to take up a
position from which we obtain a sharp clear and comprehensive grasp
of the whole and a glimpse of indefinite horizons
it would be advantageous however in order to strengthen this
position that a few objections which still menace it should be
removed the instability of the electron is not yet sufficiently
demonstrated how is it that its charge does not waste itself away
and what bonds assure the permanence of its constitution
on the other hand the phenomena of gravitation remain a mystery
lorentz has endeavoured to build up a theory in which he explains
attraction by supposing that two charges of similar sign repel each
other in a slightly less degree than that in which two charges equal
but of contrary sign attract each other the difference being
however according to the calculation much too small to be directly
observed he has also sought to explain gravitation by connecting it
with the pressures which may be produced on bodies by the vibratory
movements which form very penetrating rays recently m sutherland has
imagined that attraction is due to the difference of action in the
convection currents produced by the positive and negative corpuscles
which constitute the atoms of the stars and are carried along by the
astronomical motions but these hypotheses remain rather vague and
many authors think like m langevin that gravitation must result
from some mode of activity of the ether totally different from the
electromagnetic mode
chapter xi
the future of physics
it would doubtless be exceedingly rash and certainly very
presumptuous to seek to predict the future which may be reserved for
physics the rle of prophet is not a scientific one and the most
firmly established previsions of today may be overthrown by the
reality of tomorrow
nevertheless the physicist does not shun an extrapolation of some
little scope when it is not too far from the realms of experiment the
knowledge of the evolution accomplished of late years authorises a few
suppositions as to the direction in which progress may continue
the reader who has deigned to follow me in the rapid excursion we have
just made through the domain of the science of nature will doubtless
bring back with him from his short journey the general impression that
the ancient limits to which the classic treatises still delight in
restricting the divers chapters of physics are trampled down in all
directions
the fine straight roads traced out by the masters of the last century
and enlarged and levelled by the labour of such numbers of workmen
are now joined together by a crowd of small paths which furrow the
field of physics it is not only because they cover regions as yet
little explored where discoveries are more abundant and more easy
that these crosscuts are so frequent but also because a higher hope
guides the seekers who engage in these new routes
in spite of the repeated failures which have followed the numerous
attempts of past times the idea has not been abandoned of one day
conquering the supreme principle which must command the whole of
physics
some physicists no doubt think such a synthesis to be impossible of
realisation and that nature is infinitely complex but
notwithstanding all the reserves they may make from the philosophical
point of view as to the legitimacy of the process they do not
hesitate to construct general hypotheses which in default of complete
mental satisfaction at least furnish them with a highly convenient
means of grouping an immense number of facts till then scattered
abroad
their error if error there be is beneficial for it is one of those
that kant would have classed among the fruitful illusions which
engender the indefinite progress of science and lead to great and
important coordinations
it is naturally by the study of the relations existing between
phenomena apparently of very different orders that there can be any
hope of reaching the goal and it is this which justifies the peculiar
interest accorded to researches effected in the debatable land between
domains hitherto considered as separate
among all the theories lately proposed that of the ions has taken a
preponderant place ill understood at first by some appearing
somewhat singular and in any case useless to others it met at its
inception in france at least with only very moderate favour
today things have greatly changed and those even who ignored it have
been seduced by the curious way in which it adapts itself to the
interpretation of the most recent experiments on very different
subjects a very natural reaction has set in and i might almost say
that a question of fashion has led to some exaggerations
the electron has conquered physics and many adore the new idol rather
blindly certainly we can only bow before an hypothesis which enables
us to group in the same synthesis all the discoveries on electric
discharges and on radioactive substances and which leads to a
satisfactory theory of optics and of electricity while by the
intermediary of radiating heat it seems likely to embrace shortly the
principles of thermodynamics also certainly one must admire the power
of a creed which penetrates also into the domain of mechanics and
furnishes a simple representation of the essential properties of
matter but it is right not to lose sight of the fact that an image
may be a wellfounded appearance but may not be capable of being
exactly superposed on the objective reality
the conception of the atom of electricity the foundation of the
material atoms evidently enables us to penetrate further into
natures secrets than our predecessors but we must not be satisfied
with words and the mystery is not solved when by a legitimate
artifice the difficulty has simply been thrust further back we have
transferred to an element ever smaller and smaller those physical
qualities which in antiquity were attributed to the whole of a
substance and then we shifted them later to those chemical atoms
which united together constitute this whole today we pass them on
to the electrons which compose these atoms the indivisible is thus
rendered in a way smaller and smaller but we are still unacquainted
with what its substance may be the notion of an electric charge which
we substitute for that of a material mass will permit phenomena to be
united which we thought separate but it cannot be considered a
definite explanation or as the term at which science must stop it is
probable however that for a few years still physics will not travel
beyond it the present hypothesis suffices for grouping known facts
and it will doubtless enable many more to be foreseen while new
successes will further increase its possessions
then the day will arrive when like all those which have shone before
it this seductive hypothesis will lead to more errors than
discoveries it will however have been improved and it will have
become a very vast and very complete edifice which some will not
willingly abandon for those who have made to themselves a comfortable
dwellingplace on the ruins of ancient monuments are often too loth to
leave it
in that day the searchers who were in the van of the march after truth
will be caught up and even passed by others who will have followed a
longer but perhaps surer road we also have seen at work those
prudent physicists who dreaded too daring creeds and who sought only
to collect all the documentary evidence possible or only took for
their guide a few principles which were to them a simple
generalisation of facts established by experiments and we have been
able to prove that they also were effecting good and highly useful
work
neither the former nor the latter however carry out their work in an
isolated way and it should be noted that most of the remarkable
results of these last years are due to physicists who have known how
to combine their efforts and to direct their activity towards a common
object while perhaps it may not be useless to observe also that
progress has been in proportion to the material resources of our
laboratories
it is probable that in the future as in the past the greatest
discoveries those which will suddenly reveal totally unknown regions
and open up entirely new horizons will be made by a few scholars of
genius who will carry on their patient labour in solitary meditation
and who in order to verify their boldest conceptions will no doubt
content themselves with the most simple and least costly experimental
apparatus yet for their discoveries to yield their full harvest for
the domain to be systematically worked and desirable results obtained
there will be more and more required the association of willing minds
the solidarity of intelligent scholars and it will be also necessary
for these last to have at their disposal the most delicate as well as
the most powerful instruments these are conditions paramount at the
present day for continuous progress in experimental science
if as has already happened unfortunately in the history of science
these conditions are not complied with if the freedoms of the workers
are trammelled their unity disturbed and if material facilities are
too parsimoniously afforded themevolution at present so rapid may
be retarded and those retrogressions which bytheby have been
known in all evolutions may occur although even then hope in the
future would not be abolished for ever
there are no limits to progress and the field of our investigations
has no boundaries evolution will continue with invincible force what
we today call the unknowable will retreat further and further before
science which will never stay her onward march thus physics will
give greater and increasing satisfaction to the mind by furnishing new
interpretations of phenomena but it will accomplish for the whole of
society more valuable work still by rendering by the improvements
it suggests life every day more easy and more agreeable and by
providing mankind with weapons against the hostile forces of natur
