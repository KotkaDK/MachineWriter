preface
a very wise physician has said that every illness has two partswhat
it is and what the patient thinks about it what the patient thinks
about it is often more important and more troublesome than the real
disease what the patient thinks of life what life means to him is also
of great importance and may be the bar that shuts out all real health
and happiness the following pages are devoted to certain ideals of life
which i would like to give to my patients the longtime patients who
have especially fallen to my lot
they are not all here the steps to health and happiness the reader may
even be annoyed and baffled by my indirectness and unwillingness to be
specific that i cannot helpit is a personal peculiarity i cannot ask
any one to live by rule because i do not believe that rules are
binding and final there must be character behind the rule and then the
rule is unnecessary
all that i have written has doubtless been presented before in better
ways by wiser men but i believe that each writer may expect to find
his small public his own particular public who can understand and
profit by his teachings having partly or wholly failed with the others
for that reason i am encouraged to write upon a subject usually shunned
by medical men being assured of at least a small company of friendly
readers
i am grateful to a number of friends and patients who have read the
manuscript of the following chapters these reviewers have been frank
and kind and very helpful i am particularly indebted to dr richard c
cabot who has given me much valuable assistance

the untroubled mind
    canst thou not minister to a mind diseasd
    pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow
    raze out the written troubles of the brain
    and with some sweet oblivious antidote
    cleanse the stuffd bosom of that perilous stuff
    which weighs upon the heart
                macbeth
when a man tells me he never worries i am inclined to think that he is
either deceiving himself or trying to deceive me the great roots of
worry are conscience fear and regret undoubtedly we ought to be
conscientious and we ought to fear and regret evil but if it is to be
better than an impediment and a harm our worry must be largely
unconscious and intuitive the moment we become conscious of worry we
are undone fortunately or unfortunately we cannot leave conscience to
its own devices unless our lives are big enough and fine enough to
warrant such a course the remedy for the mental unrest which is in
itself an illness lies not in an enlightened knowledge of the
harmfulness and ineffectiveness of worry not even in the acquirement of
an unconscious conscience but in the living of a life so full and good
that worry cannot find place in it that idea of worry and conscience
that definition of serenity simplifies life immensely to overcome
worry by substituting development and growth need never be dull work to
know life in its farther reaches life in its better applications is
the final remedythe great undertakingit is life we must warn
ourselves not infrequently that the larger life is to be pursued for
its own glorious self and not for the sake of peace peace may come a
peace so sure that death itself cannot shake it but we must not expect
all our affairs to run smoothly as a matter of fact they may run badly
enough we shall have our ups and downs we shall sin and repent and
sin again but if in the end we live according to our best intuitions
we shall be justified and we need not worry about the outcome to put
it another way if we would have the untroubled mind we must transfer
our conscientious efforts from the small details of lifefrom the worry
and fret of common thingsinto another and a higher atmosphere we must
transfigure common life dignify it and ennoble it then although the
old causes of worry may continue we shall have gained a stature that
will make us unconscious masters of the little troubles and in a great
degree equal to the larger requirements life will be easier not
because we make less effort but because we are working from another and
a better level
if such a change and it would be a change for most of us could come
about instantly in a flash of revelation that would be ideal but it
would not be life we must return again and again to the old uninspired
state wherein we struggle conscientiously with perverse details i would
not minimize the importance and value of this struggle only the sooner
it changes its level the better for every one concerned large serenity
must finally be earned through the toughening of moral fibre that
comes in dealing squarely with perplexing details some of this struggle
must always be going on but serener life will come when we begin to
concern ourselves with larger factors
how are we to live the larger life partly through uninspired struggle
and through the brave meeting of adversity but partly also in a way
that may be described as out of hand by intuition by exercise of the
quality of mind that sees visions and grasps truths beyond the realms of
common thought
i am more and more impressed with the necessity of inspiration in life
if we are to be strong and serene and so finally escape the pitfalls
of worry and conscience by inspirations i do not mean belief in any
system or creed it is not a stated belief that we need to begin with
that may come in time we need first to find in life or at least in
nature an essential beauty that makes its own true inevitable response
within us we must learn to love life so deeply that we feel its
tremendous significance until we find in the sea and the sky the
evidence of an overbrooding spirit too great to be understood but not
too great to satisfy the soul this is a sort of mother religionthe
matrix from which all sects and creeds are born its existence in us
dignifies us and makes simple purposeful and receptive living almost
inevitable we may not know why we are living according to the dictates
of our inspiration but we shall live so and that is the important
consideration
if i urge the acquirement of a religious conception that we may cure
the intolerable distress of worry i do what i have already warned
against it is so easy to make this mistake that i have virtually made
it on the same page with my warning we have no right to seek so great a
thing as religious experience that we may be relieved of suffering
better go on with pain and distress than cheapen religion by making it a
remedy we must seek it for its own sake or rather we must not seek it
at all lest like a dream it elude us or change into something else
less holy nevertheless it is true that if we will but look with open
unprejudiced eyes again and again upon the sunrise or the stars above
us we shall become conscious of a presence greater and more beautiful
than our minds can think in the experience of that vision strength and
peace will come to us unbidden we shall find our lives raised as by an
unseen force above the warfare of conscience and worry we shall begin
to know the meaning of serenity and of that priceless if not wholly to
be acquired possession the untroubled mind
i am aware that i shall be misunderstood and perhaps ridiculed by my
colleagues when i attempt to discuss religion in any way theology is a
field in which i have had no training but that is the very reason why i
dare write of it i do not even assume that there is a god in the
traditional sense the idea is too great to be made concrete and
literal no single fact of nature can be fully understood by our finite
minds but i do feel vaguely that the laws that compass us and make our
lives possible point always onbeyond the realms of time and
spacetoward the existence of a mighty overruling spirit if this is a
cold and inadequate conception of god it is at least one that can be
held by any man without compromise
the modern mind is apt to fail of religious understanding and support
because of the arbitrary interpretations of religion which are
presented for our acceptance it is what men say about religion rather
than religion itself that repels us let us think it out for ourselves
if we are open to a simple even primitive conception of god we may
still repudiate the creeds and doctrines but we are likely to become
more tolerant of those who find them true and good we shall be likely
in time to find the religion of christ understandable and
acceptablewarm and quick with life the man who ungrudgingly opens his
heart to the god of nature will be religious in the simplest possible
sense he may worry because of the things he cannot altogether
understand and because he falls so far short of the implied ideal but
he will have enlarged his life so much that the common worries will find
little roomhe will be too full of the joy of living to spend much
conscious thought in worry such a man will realize that he cannot
afford to spend his time and strength in regretting his past mistakes
there is too much in the future what he does in the future not what he
has failed to do in the past will determine the quality of his life he
knows this and the knowledge sends him into that future with courage
and with strength finally in some indefinable way character will
become more important to him than physical health even illness is half
compensated when a man realizes that it is not what he accomplishes in
the world but what he is that really counts which puts him in touch
with the creative forces of god and raises him out of the aimless and
ordinary into a life of inspiration and joy
ii
religio medici
    at all events it is certain that if any medical man had come to
    middlemarch with the reputation of having definite religious
    views of being given to prayer and of otherwise showing an
    active piety there would have been a general presumption
    against his medical skill
                george eliot
when a medically educated man talks and writes of religion and of god
he is rightly enough questioned by his brotherswho are too busy with
the hard work of practice to be concerned with anything but material
problems to me the word god is symbolic of the power which created
and which maintains the universe the sunrise and the stars of heaven
give me some idea of his majesty the warmth and tenderness of human
love give me some idea of his divine love that is all i know but it is
enough to make life glow it is enough to inspire the most intense
devotion to any good cause it is enough to make me bear suffering with
some degree of patience and it is enough finally to give me some
confidence and courage even in the face of the great mystery of death
why this or another conception of god should produce such a profound
result upon any one i do not know except that in some obscure way it
connects the individual with the divine plan and does not leave him
outside in despair and loneliness however that may be it will be
conceded that a religious conception of some kind does much toward
justifying life toward making it strong and livable and so has
directly to do with certain important problems of illness and health
the most practical medical man will admit that any illness is made
lighter and more likely to recover in the presence of hope and serenity
in the mind of the patient
naturally the great bulk of medical practice calls for no handling other
than that of the straight medical sort a man comes in with a crushed
finger a girl with anmiathe way is clear it is only in deeper more
intricate departments of medicine that we altogether fail the
bacteriologist and the pathologist have no use for mental treatment in
their departments but when we come to the case of the nervously
brokendown school teacher or the wornout telegrapher that is another
matter years may elapse before work can be resumedyears of dependence
and anxiety here a new view of life is often more useful than drugs a
view that accepts the situation reasonably after a while that does not
grope blindly and impatiently for a cure but finds in life an
inspiration that makes it good in spite of necessary suffering and
limitations often enough we cannot promise a cure but we must be
prepared to give something better
a great deal of the fatigue and unhappiness of the world is due to the
fact that we do not go deep enough in our justification for work or
play or for any experience happy or sad there is a good deal of a
void after we have said art for arts sake or play for the joy of
playing or even after we have said i am working for the sake of my
family or for some one who needs my help that is not enough and
whether we realize it or not the lack of deeper justification is at the
bottom of a restlessness and uncertainty which we might not be willing
to acknowledge but which nevertheless is very real
i am not satisfied when some moralist says be good and you will be
happy the kind of happiness that comes from a perfunctory goodness is
a thing which i cannot understand and which i certainly do not want if
i work and play and serve and employ making up the fabric of a busy
life if i attain a very real happiness i am tormented by the desire to
know why i am doing it and i am not satisfied with the answer i
usually get the patient may not be cured when he is relieved of his
anmia or when his emaciation has given place to the plumpness and
suppleness and physical strength that we call health the man whom we
look upon as well and who has never known physical illness is not well
in the larger sense until he knows why he is working why he is living
why he is filling his life with activity in spite of the elasticity and
spring of the worlds interests there must come often and with a kind
of fatal insistence the deep demand for a cause for a justification
if there is not an adequate significance behind it life with all its
courage and accomplishment seems but a sorry thing so full of pathos
even in its brightest moments so shadowed with a sense of loss and of
finality that the bravest heart may well fail and the truest courage
relax supported only by the assurance that this way lies happiness or
that right is right
what is this knowledge that the world is seeking but can never find
what is this final justification if we seek it in its completeness we
are doomed always to be ill and unsatisfied if we are willing to look
only a little way into the great question if we are willing to accept a
little for the whole content because it is manifestly part of the final
knowledge and because we know that final knowledge rests with god
alone we shall understand enough to save us from much sorrow and
painful incompleteness
there is in the infinitely varied and beautiful world of nature and in
the hearts of men so much of beauty and truth that it is a wonder we do
not all realize that these things of common life may be in us and for us
the daily and hourly expression of the infinite being we call god we do
not see god but we do feel and know so much that we may fairly believe
to be of god that we do not need to see him face to face it is
something more than imagination to feel that it is the life of god in
our lives so often unrecognized or ignored that prompts us to all the
greatness and the inspiration and the accomplishment of the world if we
could know more clearly the joy of such a conception we should dry up
at its source much of the unhappiness which is in a deep and subtle
way at the bottom of many a nervous illness and many a wretched
existence
the happiness which is found in the recognition of kinship with god
through the common things of life in the experiences which are so
significant that they could not spring from a lesser source the
happiness which is not sought but which is the inevitable result of
such recognitionthis experience goes a long way toward making life
worth living
if we do have this conception of life then some of the old old
questions that have vexed so many dwellers upon the earth will no longer
be a source of unhappiness or of illness of mind or body the question
of immortality for instance which has made us afraid to die will no
longer be a questionwe shall not need to answer it in the presence of
god in our lives and in the world about us we shall be content finally
to accept whatever is in store for usso it be the will of god we may
even look for something better than mere immortality something more
divine than our gross conception of eternal life
this is a religion that i believe medical men may teach without
hesitation whenever the need shall arise i know well enough that many a
blunt if kindly man cannot bring himself to say these words even if he
believes them but i do think that in some measure they point the way to
what may wisely be taught
there is a practice of medicinethe common practicethat is concerned
with the body only and with its chemical and mechanical reactions we
can have nothing but respect and admiration for the men who go on year
after year in the eager pursuit of this calling we know that such a
work is necessary that it is just as important as the educational
practice of which i write we know that without the physical side
medicine would fail of its usefulness and that disease and death would
reap far richer harvests i only wish the two naturally related aspects
of our dealing with patients might not be so completely separated that
they lose sight of each other as a matter of fact both elements are
necessary to our human welfare if medicine devotes itself altogether to
the cure and prevention of physical disease it will miss half of its
possibilities it is equally true that if we forget the physical
necessities in our zeal for spiritual hygiene we shall get and deserve
complete and humiliating failure many men will say why mix the two
why not let the preachers and the philosophers preach and the doctors
follow their own ways for the most part this may have to be the
arrangement but the doctor who can see and treat the spiritual needs of
his patient will always be more likely to cure in the best sense than
the doctor who sees only half of the picture on the other hand the
philosopher is likely to be a comparatively poor doctor because he
knows nothing of medicine and so can see only the other half of the
picture there is much to be said for the religion of medicine if it can
be kept free from cant if it can be simple and rational enough to be
available for the whole world
iii
thought and work
    i wish i had a tradeit would animate my arms and tranquilize
    my brain
                senancour
    doe ye nexte thyngeold english proverb
since our minds are so constantly filled with anxiety there would seem
to be at least one sure way to be rid of itto stop thinking
a great many people believe that the mind will become less effective
that life will become dull and purposeless unless they are constantly
thinking and planning and arranging their affairs i believe that the
mind may easily and wisely be free from conscious thought a good deal of
the time and that the greatest progress and development in mind often
comes when the thinker is virtually at rest when his mind is to all
intents and purposes blank the busy unconscious mind does its best
work in the serenity of an atmosphere which does not interfere and
confuse
it is true that the greatest conceptions do not come to the untrained
and undisciplined mind but do we want great conceptions all the time
there is a technical training for the mind which is of course
necessary for special accomplishments but this is quite another matter
even this kind of thought must not obtrude too much lest we become
conscious of our mental processes and so end in confusion
one of the greatest benefits of work with the hands or of objective and
constructive work with the mind is that it saves us from unending hours
of thinking work should of course find its fullest justification as
an expression of faith if we have ever so dim a vision of a greater
significance in life of its close relationship to infinite things we
become thereby conscious of the need of service of the need of work it
is the easy natural expression of our faith the inevitable result of
a spiritual contact with the great working forces of the world it is
work above all else that saves us from the disasters of conflicting
thought
a few years ago a young man came to me suffering from too much
thinking he had just been graduated from college and his head was full
of confused ideas and emotions he was also very tired having
overworked in his preparation for examinations and because he had not
taken the best care of his body the symptoms he complained of were
sleeplessness and worry together with the inevitable indigestion and
headache of course as a physician i went over the bodily functions
carefully and studied as far as i might into the organic conditions
i could find no evidence of physical disease i did not say there is
nothing the matter with you for the man was sick i told him that he
was tired that he had thought too much that he was too much concerned
about himself and that as a result of all this his bodily functions
were temporarily upset he thought he ought to worry about himself
because otherwise he would not be trying to get well i explained to him
that this mistaken obligation was the common reason for worry and that
in this case at least it was quite unnecessary and even harmful for
him to go on thinking about himself that helped a little but not
nearly enough because when a man has overworked when he has begun to
worry and when his various bodily functions show results of worry no
reasoning no explanations can wholly relieve him i said to this young
man in spite of your discomforts in spite of your depression and
concern in regard to yourself you will get well if you will stop
thinking about the matter altogether you must be first convinced that
it is best for you to stop thinking that no harm or violence can
result and then you must be helped in this direction by going to work
with your handsthat will be life and progress it will lead you to
health
fortunately i had had some experience with nervous illness and i knew
that unless i managed for this man the character and extent of his work
he would not only fail in it but of its object and so become more
confused and discouraged i knew the troubled mind in this instance
might find its solace and its relief in work but that i must choose the
work carefully to suit the individual and i must see that the nervously
fatigued body was not pushed too hard
in the town where i live is a blacksmith shop presided over by a genial
old man who has been a blacksmith since he was a boy and in whose hands
iron is like clay i took my patient down to the smithy and said here
is a young man whom i want to put to work he will pay for the chance i
want you first to teach him to make handwrought nails this was a
good deal of a joke to the smith and to the patient but they saw that i
was in earnest and agreed to go ahead we got together the proper tools
and proceeded to make nails a job which is really not very difficult
after an hours work i called off my patient much to his disgust for
he was just beginning to be interested but i knew that if he were to
keep on until fatigue should come the whole matter would end in
trouble so the next day with some new overalls and a leather apron
added to the equipment we proceeded to another hours work we went on
this way for three or four days before the time was increased
the interest of the patient was always fresh he was eager for more and
he did not taste the dregs of fatigue yet he did get the wholesome
exercise and he did get the strong turning of the mind from its worry
and concern of course the rest of the day was taken care of in one
way or another but the work was the central feature in a week we were
at it two hours a day in three weeks four hours and in a month five
hours he had made a handsome display of handwrought nails a superior
line of pokers and shovels for fireplaces together with a number of
very respectable andirons on each of these larger pieces of handiwork
my patient had stamped his initials with a little steel die that was
made for him each piece was his own each piece was the product of his
own versatility and his own strength his pride and pleasure in this
work were very great and well they might be for it is a fine thing to
have learned to handle so intractable a material as iron but in
handling the iron patiently and consistently until he could do it
without too much conscious thinking and so without effort he had also
learned to handle himself naturally more simply and easily
as a matter of fact the illness which had brought this boy to me was
pretty nearly cured by his blacksmithing because it was an illness of
the mind and of the nerves and not of the body although the body had
suffered in its turn that young man instead of becoming a nervous
invalid as he might have done is now working steadily in partnership
with his father in business in the city i had found him a very
interesting patient full of originality and not at all the tedious and
boresome person he might have been had i listened day after day week
after week to the recital of his ills i was willing to listeni did
listenbut i also gave him a new trend of life which pretty soon made
his complaints sound hollow and then disappear
of course the problem is not always so simple as this and we must
often deal with complexities of body and mind requiring prolonged
investigation and treatment i cite this case because it shows clearly
that relief from some forms of nervous illness can come when we stop
thinking when we stop analyzing and then back up our position with
prescribed work
there may be some nervous invalids who read these lines who will say
but i have tried so many times to work and have failed unfortunately
such failure must often occur unless we can proceed with care and with
understanding but the principle remains true although it must be
modified in an infinite variety to meet the changing conditions of
individuals
i see a great many people who are conscientiously trying to get well
from nervous exhaustion they almost inevitably try too hard they think
and worry too much about it and so exhaust themselves the more this is
the greater pity because it is the honest and the conscientious people
who make the greatest effort it is very hard for them to realize that
they must stop thinking stop trying and if possible get to work
before they can accomplish their end we shall have to repeat to them
over and over again that they must stop thinking the matter out because
the thing they are attempting to overcome is too subtle to be met in
that way so if they are fortunate they may rid themselves of the
vagueness and uncertainty of life until all the multitude of details
which go to make up life lose their desultoriness and their lack of
meaning and they may find themselves no longer the subjects of physical
or nervous exhaustion
iv
idleness
    o ye who have your eyeballs vexd and tird
      feast them upon the wideness of the sea
                keats
    extreme busyness whether at school or college kirk or market
    is a symptom of deficient vitality and a faculty for idleness
    implies a catholic appetite and a strong sense of personal
    identity
                stevenson
it is an unfortunate fact that very few people are able to be idle
successfully i think it is not so much because we misuse idleness as
because we misinterpret it that the long days become increasingly
demoralizing i would ask no one to accept a forced idleness without
objection or regret such an acceptance would imply a lack of spirit to
say the least but idleness and rest are not incompatible neither are
idleness and service nor idleness and contentment if we can look upon
rest as a preparation for service if we can make it serve us in the
opportunity it gives for quiet growth and legitimate enjoyment then it
is fully justified and it may offer advantages and opportunity of the
best
the chief trouble with idleness is that it so often means introspection
worry and impatience especially to those conscientious souls who would
fain be about their business
i have for a long time been accustomed to combat the worry and fret of
necessary idlenessnot by forbidding it not by advising struggle and
fight against it but by insisting that the best way to get rid of it is
to leave it alone to accept it when we do this there may come a kind
of fallow time in which the mind enriches and refreshes itself beyond
our conception
i would rather my patient who must rest for a long time would give up
all thought of method would give up all idea of making his mind follow
any particular line of thought or absence of thought i know that the
mind which has been under conscious control a good deal of the time is
apt to rebel at this freedom and to indulge in all kinds of alarming
extravagances i am sure however that the best way to meet these
demands for conscious control is to be careless of them to be willing
to experience these extravagances and inconsistencies without fear in
the belief that finally will come a quiet and peace which will be all
that we can ask the peace of mind that is unguided in the conscious
and literal sense is a thing which too few of us know
mr arnold bennett in his little book how to live on twentyfour
hours a day teaches that we should leave no time unused in our lives
that we should accomplish a great deal more and be infinitely more
effective and progressive if we devoted our minds to the definite
workingout of necessary problems whenever those times occur in which we
are apt to be desultory i wish here to make a plea for desultoriness
and for an idleness which goes even beyond the idleness of the man who
reads the newspaper and forgets what he has read it seems to me better
whether we are sick or well to allow long periods in our lives when we
think only casually to the good old adage work while you work and
play while you play we might well add rest while you rest lest in
the end you should be unable successfully either to work or play
a man is not necessarily condemned to tortures of mind because he must
rest for a week or a month or a year i know that there must be anxious
times especially when idleness means dependence and when it brings
hardship to those who need our help but the invalid must not try
constantly to puzzle the matter out if we do not make ourselves sick
with worry we shall be able sometime to approach active life with
sufficient frankness and force it is the constant effort of the poor
tired mind to solve its problems that not only fails of its object but
plunges the invalid deeper into discouragement and misunderstanding how
cruel this is and how unfortunate that it should come more commonly to
those who try the hardest to overcome their handicaps to throw off the
yoke of idleness and to be well
when you have tried your best to get back to your work and have failed
when you have done this not once but many times it is inevitable that
misunderstanding should creep in inevitable that you should question
very deeply and doubt not infrequently yet the chances are that one of
the reasons for your failure is that you have tried too hard that you
have not known how to rest when you have learned how to rest when you
have learned to put off thinking and planning until the mind becomes
fresh and clear when you are in a fair way to know the joy of idleness
and the peace of rest you are a great deal more likely to get back to
efficiency and to find your way along the great paths of activity into
the world of life
it is not so much the idleness then as the attempt to overcome its
irksomeness that makes this condition painful the invalid in bed is in
a trap to be tormented by his thoughts unless he knows the meaning of
successful idleness this knowledge may come to him by such strategy as
i have suggestedby giving up the struggle against worry and fret but
peace will come surely steadily with healing in its wings when the
mind is changed altogether when life becomes free because of a growth
and development that finds significance even in idleness that sees the
world with wise and patient eyes
in a way it does not matter your physical condition or mine if our
eyes have seen the glory that deifies life and makes even its waste
places beautiful what is that view from your window as you lie in your
bed a bit of the sea if you are fortunate a corner of garden surely
the top of an elm tree against the blue what is it but the revelations
of a god in the world there is enough that is sad and unhappy but over
all are these simple ineffable things if the garden is an expression
of god in the world then the world and life are no longer meaningless
even idleness becomes in some degree bearable because it is a part of a
significant world
unfortunately the idleness of disability often means pain the wear and
tear of physical or nervous suffering that is another matter we cannot
meet it fully with any philosophy my patients very often beg to know
the best way to bear pain how they may overcome the attacks of nerves
that are harder to bear than pain to such a question i can only say
that the time to bear pain is before and after live in such a way in
the times of comparative comfort that the attacks are less likely to
appear and easier to bear when they do come after the pain or the
nervous attack is over that is the time to prevent the worst features
of another forget the distress live simply and happily in spite of the
memory and you will have done all that the patient himself can do to
ward off or to make tolerable the next occasion of suffering pain
itselfpure physical painis a matter for the physicians judgment it
is his business to seek out the causes and apply the remedy

                petrarch
when i go about among my patients most of them as it happens
nervously sick i sometimes stop to consider why it is they are ill i
know that some are so because of physical weakness over which they have
no control that some are suffering from the effects of carelessness
some from wilfulness and more from simple ignorance of the rules of the
game there are so many rules that no one will ever know them all but
it seems that we live in a world of laws and that if we transgress
those laws by ever so little we must suffer equally whether our
transgression is a mistake or not and whether we happen to be saints or
sinners there are laws also which have to do with the recovery of poise
and balance when these have been lost these laws are less well observed
and understood than those which determine our downfall
the more gross illnesses from accident contagion and malignancy we
need not consider here but only those intangible injuries that disable
people who are relatively sound in the physical sense it is true that
nervous troubles may cause physical complications and that physical
disease very often coexists with nervous illness but it is better for
us now to make an artificial separation just what happens in the human
economy when a nervous breakdown comes nobody seems to know but mind
and body coperate to make the patient miserable and helpless it may
be natures way of holding us up and preventing further injury the
holdup is severe usually and becomes in itself a thing to be managed
the rules we have wittingly or unwittingly broken are often unknown to
us but they exist in the allwise providence and we may guess by our
own suffering how far we have overstepped them if a man runs into a
door in the dark we know all about thatthe case is simplebut if
he runs overtime at his office and hastens to be rich with the result of
a nervous dyspepsiathat is a mystery here is a girl who came out
last year she was apparently strong and her mother was ambitious for
her social progress that meant four nights a week for several months at
dances and dinners getting home at 3 am or later it was gay and
delightful while it lasted but it could not last and the girl went to
pieces suddenly her back gave out because it was not strong enough to
stand the dancing and the longcontinued physical strain the nerves
gave out because she did not give her faculties time to rest and
perhaps because of a love affair that supervened the result was a year
of invalidism and then because the rules of recovery were not
understood several years more of convalescence such common rules
should be well enough understood but they are broken everywhere by the
wisest people
the common case of the brokendown school teacher is more unfortunate
this tragedy and others like it are more often i believe due to unwise
choice of profession in the first place the womens colleges are
turning out hundreds of young women every year who naturally consider
teaching as the field most appropriate and available probably only a
very small proportion of these girls are strong enough physically or
nervously to meet the growing demands of the schools they may do well
for a time some of them unusually well for it is the sensitive
highstrung organism that is appreciative and effective after a while
the worry and fret of the requirements and the constant nag of the
schoolroom have their effect upon those who are foredoomed to failure in
that particular field the plight of such young women is particularly
hard for they are usually dependent upon their work
it is after all not so much the things we do as the way we do them
and what we think about them that accomplishes nervous harm strangely
enough the sense of effort and the feeling of our own inadequacy damage
the nervous system quite as much as the actual physical effort the
attempt to catch up with life and with affairs that go on too fast for
us is a frequent and harmful deflection from the rules of the game few
of us avoid it life comes at us and goes by very fast tasks multiply
and we are inadequate responsibilities increase before we are ready
they bring fatigue and confusion we cannot shirk and be true having
done all you reasonably can stop whatever may be the consequences
that is a rule i would enforce if i could to do more is to drag and
fail so defeating the end of your efforts if it turns out that you are
not fit for the job you have undertaken give it up and find another or
modify that one until it comes within your capacity it takes courage to
do thismore courage sometimes than is needed to make us stick to the
thing we are doing rarely however will it be necessary for us to give
up if we will undertake and consider for the day only such part of our
task as we are able to perform the trouble is that we look at our work
or our responsibility all in one piece and it crushes us if we cannot
arrange our lives so that we may meet their obligations a little at a
time then we must admit failure and try again on what may seem a
lower plane that is what i consider the brave thing to do i would
honor the factory superintendent who finding himself unequal to his
position should choose to work at the bench where he could succeed
perfectly
the habit of uncertainty in thought and action bred as it sometimes
is from a lack of faith in man and in god is nevertheless a thing to
be dealt with sometimes by itself not infrequently it is a petty habit
that can be corrected by the exercise of a little will power i believe
it is better to decide wrong a great many timesdoing it quicklythan
to come to a right decision after weakly vacillating as a matter of
fact we may trust our decisions to be fair and true if our lifes
ideals are beautiful and true
we may improve our indecisions a great deal by mastering their unhappy
details but we shall not finally overcome them until life rings true
and until all our acts and thoughts become the solid and inevitable
expression of a healthy growing regard for the best in life a call to
right living that is no mean dictum of policy but which is renewed
every morning as the sun comes out of the sea however inconsequential
the habit of indecision may seem it is really one of the most disabling
of bad habits its continuance contributes largely to the sum of nervous
exhaustion whatever its origin whether it stands in the relation of
cause or effect it is an indulgence that insidiously takes the snap and
sparkle out of life and leaves us for the time being colorless and weak
next to uncertainty an uninspired certainty is wrecking to the best of
human prospects the man whose one idea is of making himself and his
family materially comfortable or even rich may not be coming to
nervous prostration but he is courting a moral prostration that will
deny him all the real riches of life and that will in the end reward
him with a troubled mind a great unsatisfied longing unless to be
sure he is too smug and satisfied to long for anything
the larger life leads us inevitably away from ourselves away from the
superrequirements of our families it demands of them and of ourselves
an unselfishness that is born of a love that finds its expression in the
service of god and what is the service of god if it is not such an
entering into the divine purposes and spirit that we become with god
recreators in the worldworking factors in the higher evolution of
humanity while we live we shall get and save we shall use and spend
we shall serve the needs of those dependent upon us but we shall not
line the family nest so softly that our children become powerless we
shall not confine our charities to the specified channels where our
names will be praised and our credit increased we shall give and serve
in secret places with our hearts in our deeds then we may possess the
untroubled mind a treasure too rich to be computed we shall not have
it for the seeking it may exist in the midst of what men may call
privations and sorrows but it will exist in a very large sense and it
will be ours the socalled hardheaded business man who never allows
himself to be taken advantage of whose dealings are always strict and
uncompromising is very apt to be a particularly miserable invalid when
he is ill i cannot argue in favor of business laxityi know the
imperative need of exactness and finalitybut i do believe that if we
are to possess the untroubled mind we must make our lives larger than
the field of dollars and cents the charity that develops in us will
make us truly generous and free from the reaction of hardness
it is a great temptation to go on multiplying the rules of the game
there are so many sensible and necessary pieces of advice which we all
need to have emphasized that is the course we must try to avoid the
child needs to be told arbitrarily for a while what is right and what
is wrong that he must do this and he must not do that the time comes
however when the growing instinct toward right living is the thing to
fosternot the details of life which will inevitably take care of
themselves if the underlying principle is made right it must be the
ideal of moral teaching to make clear and pure the source of action
then the stream will be clear and pure such a stream will purify itself
and neutralize the dangerous inflow along its banks it is true that
great harm may come from the polluted inflows but they will be less and
less harmful as the increasing current from the good source flows down
we shall have to look well to our habits lest serious ills befall but
that must never be the main concern or we shall find ourselves living
very narrow and labored lives we shall find that we are failing to
observe one of the most important rules of the game
vi
the nervous temperament
    beyond the ugly actual lo on every side
    imaginations limitless domain
                browning
    he that too much refines his delicacy will always endanger his
    quiet
                samuel johnson
    the great refinement of many poetical gentlemen has rendered
    them practically unfit for the jostling and ugliness of life
                stevenson
it has been my fortune as a physician to deal much with the socalled
nervous temperament i have come both to fear and to love it it is the
essence of all that is bright imaginative and fine but it is as
unstable as water those who possess it must sufferit is their lot to
feel deeply and very often to be misunderstood by their more practical
friends all their lives these people will shed tears of joy and more
tears of sorrow i would like to write of their joy of the perfect
satisfaction the true happiness that comes in creating new and
beautiful things of the deep pleasure they have in the appreciation of
good work in others but with the instinct of a dog trained for a
certain kind of hunting i find myself turning to the misfortunes and the
ills
the very keenness of perception makes painful anything short of
perfection what will such people do in our clanging streets what of
those fine ears tuned to the most exquisite appreciation of sweet sound
what of that refinement of hearing that detects the least departure from
the rhythm and pitch in complex orchestral music and must they bear the
crash of steel on stone the infernal clatter of traffic well yesas
a matter of factthey must at least for a good many years to come
until advancing civilization eliminates the city noise but it is not
always great noises that disturb and distract there is a story told of
a woman who became so sensitive to noise that she had her house made
soundproof there were thick carpets and softly closing doors
everything was padded the house was set back from a quiet street but
that street was strewn with tanbark to check the sound of carriages
surely here was bliss for the sensitive soul i need not tell the rest
of the story how absolutely necessary noises became intolerable and
the poor woman ended by keeping a man on the place to catch and silence
the tree toads and crickets
there is nothing to excuse the careless and unnecessary noises of the
worldwe shall dispose of them finally as we are disposing of
flamboyant signboards and typhoid flies but meanwhile and always for
that matter the sensitive soul must learn to adjust itself to
circumstances and conditions this adjustment may in itself become a
fine art it is really the art by which the painter excludes the
commonplace and irrelevant from his landscape sometimes we have to do
this consciously for the most part it should be a natural unconscious
selection
i am sure it is unwise to attempt at any time the dulling of the
appreciative sense for the sake of peace and comfort love and
understanding of the beautiful and true is too rare and fine a thing to
be lost or diminished under any circumstances the cure as i see it is
to be found in the cultivation of the faculty that finds some good in
everything and everybody this is the saving graceit takes great bulks
of the commonplace and distils from the mass a few drops of precious
essence it finds in the unscholarly and the imperfect rare traces of
good it sees in man any man the image of god to be justified and
made evident only in the sublimity of death perhaps but usually to be
developed in life
the nervous person is often morose and unsocialperhaps because he is
not understood perhaps because he falls so short of his own ideals
often he does not find kindred spirits anywhere i do not think we
should drive such a man into conditions that hurt but i do believe that
if he is truly artistic and not a snob he may lead himself into a
larger social life without too much sacrifice
the sensitive highstrung spirit that does not give of its own best
qualities to the world of its acquaintance that does not express itself
in some concrete way is always in danger of harm such a spirit turned
in upon itself is a consuming fire the spirit will burn a long time and
suffer much if it does not use its heat to warm and comfort the world of
need
real illness makes the nervous temperament a much more formidable
difficultyall the sensitive faculties are more sensitiveirritability
becomes an obsession and idleness a terror
the nervous temperament under irritation is very prone to become
selfishand very likely to hide behind this selfishness calling it
temperament the man who flies into a passion when he is disturbed or
who spends his days in torment from the noises of the street the woman
of high attainment who has retired into herself who is moody and
unresponsivethese unfortunates have virtually built a wall about
their lives a wall which shuts out the world of life and happiness
from the walls of this prison the sounds of discord and annoyance are
thrown back upon the prisoner intensified and multiplied the wall is
real enough in its effect but will cease to exist when the prisoner
begins to go outside when he begins to realize his selfishness and his
mistake then the noises and the irritations will be lost in the wider
world that is open to him after all it is only through unselfish
service in the world of men that this broadening can come
there is no lack of opportunity for service perhaps the simplest and
most available form of service is charitythe big professional kind
of courseand beyond that the greater field of intimate and personal
charity i know a girl of talent and abilityherself a nervous
invalidsick and helpless for the lack of a little money which would
give her a chance to get well i do not mean money for luxuries for
foolish indulgences but money to buy opportunitymoney that would lift
her out of the heavy morass of poverty and give her a chance she falls
outside the beaten path of charity she is not reached by the usual
philanthropies i also know plenty of people who could help that girl
without great sacrifice they will not do it because they give money to
the regular charitiesthey will not do it because sometimes generosity
has been abused so they miss the chance of broadening and developing
their own lives
i know well enough that objective interest can rarely be forcedit
must usually come the other way aboutthrough the broadening of life
which makes it inevitable sometimes i wish i could force that kind of
development that kind of charity sometimes i long to take the rich
neurasthenic and make him help his brother make him develop a new art
that shall save people from sorrow and loss we are all together in this
world and all kin to recognize it and to serve the needs of the
unfortunate as we would serve our own children is the remedy for many
ills it is the new art the final and greatest of all artistic
achievements it warms our hearts and opens our lives to all that is
wholesome and good this is one of the crises in which my theory of
inspiration first may fail here the charity may have to come first
may have to be insisted upon before there can be any inspiration or any
further joy in life it is not always charity in the usual sense that is
required sometimes the charity that gives something besides money is
best but charity in any good sense means selfforgetfulness and that
is a long way on the road to nervous health give of yourself give of
your substance and you will cease to be troubled with the penalties of
selfishness then take the next stepthat gives not because life has
come back but because the world has become larger and warmer and
happier when the giver gives of his sympathy and of his means because
he wants tonot because he has to do sohe will begin to know what i
mean when i say it is better to have the inspiration first
vii
selfcontrol
    he only earns his freedom and existence
    who daily conquers them anew
                goethe
a good many writers on selfcontrol and kindred subjects insist that we
shall conscientiously and consciously govern our mental lives they say
you must get up in the morning with determination to be cheerful they
insist that in spite of annoyance or trouble you shall keep a smiling
face and affirm to yourself over and over again the denial of
annoyance
i do not like this kind of selfcontrol i wish i could admire it and
approve it but i find i cannot because it seems to me selfconscious
and superficial it is better than nothing and unquestionably adds
greatly to the sum of human happiness but i do not think we ought to be
cheerful if we are consumed with trouble and sorrow the fact is we
ought not to be for long beyond a natural cheerfulness that comes from
the deepest possible sources while we are sad let us be so simply and
naturally but we must pray that the light may come to us in our sorrow
that we may be able soon and naturally to put aside the signs of
mourning
the person who thinks little of his own attitude of mind is more likely
to be well controlled and to radiate happiness than one who must
continually prompt himself to worthy thoughts the man whose heart is
great with understanding of the sorrow and pathos of life is far more
apt to be brave and fine in his own trouble than one who must look to a
motto or a formula for consolation and advice deep in the lives of
those who permanently triumph over sorrow there is an abiding peace and
joy such peace cannot come even from ample experience in the material
world despair comes from that experience sometimes unless the heart
is open to the vital spirit that lies beyond all material things that
creates and renews life and that makes it indescribably beautiful and
significant experience of material things is only the beginning in it
and through it we may have experience of the wider life that surrounds
the material
our hearts must be opened to the courage that comes unbidden when we
feel ourselves to be working growing parts of the universe of god then
we shall have no more sorrow and no more joy in the pitiful sense of the
earth but rather an exaltation which shall make us masters of these and
of ourselves we shall have a sympathy and charity that shall need no
promptings but that flow from us spontaneously into the world of
suffering and need
beethoven was of a sour temper according to all accounts but he wrote
his symphonies in the midst of tribulations under which few men would
have worked at all when we have felt something of the spirit that makes
work inevitable it will be as though we had heard the eternal harmonies
we shall write our symphonies build our bridges or do our lesser tasks
with dauntless purpose even though the possessions that men count dear
are taken from us suppose we can do very little because of some
infirmity if that little has in it the larger inspiration it will be
enough to make life full and fine the joy of a wider life is not
obtainable in its completeness it is only through a lifetime of service
and experience that we can approach it that is the proof of its divine
originits unattainableness god keep you from the she wolf and from
your hearts deepest desire is an old saying of the rumanians if we
fully obtain our desires we prove their unworthiness does any one
suppose that beethoven attained his whole hearts desire in his music
he might have done so had he been a lesser man he was not a cheerful
companion that is unfortunate and shows that he failed in complete
inspiration and in the ordinary kind of selfcontrol he was at least
sincere and that helped not a little to make him what he was i would
almost rather a man would be morose and sincere than cheerful from a
sense of duty
our knowledge of the greater things of life must always be substantiated
and worked out into realities of service or else we shall be weak and
ineffective the charity that balks at giving reacts upon a man and
deadens him i am always insisting that we must not live and serve
through a sense of duty but that we must find the inspiration first it
is better to give ourselves to service not for the sake of finding god
but because we have found him and because our souls have grown in the
finding until we cannot help giving if we have grown to such a stature
we shall be able to meet sorrow and loss bravely and simply we shall
feel for ourselves and for others in their troubles as forbes robertson
did when he wrote to his friend who had met with a great loss i pray
that you may never never never get over this sorrow but through it
into it into the very heart of god all this is very unworldly no
doubt and yet i will venture the assertion that such a standard and
such a method will come nearer to the mark of successful and
wellcontrolled living than the most carefully planned campaign of duty
if we plan to make life fine if we say in effect i will be good and
cheerful no matter what happens we are beginning at the wrong end we
may be able to work back from our mottoes to real living but the
chances are we shall stop somewhere by the way too confused and
uncertain to go on selfcontrol at its best is not a conscious thing
it is not well that we should try to be good but that we should so
dignify our lives with the spirit of good that evil becomes wellnigh
impossible to us

the lighter touch
    heart not so heavy as mine
    wending late home
    as it passed my window
    whistled itself a tune
                emily dickinson
i have never seen good come from frightening worriers it is no doubt
wise to speak the truth but it seems to me a mistake to say in public
print or in private advice that worry leads to tragedies of the worst
sort no matter how hopeful we may be in our later teaching about the
possibilities of overcoming worry the really serious worrier will
pounce upon the original tragic statement and apply it with terrible
insistence to his own case
i would not minimize the seriousness of worry but i am convinced that
we can rarely overcome it by direct voluntary effort it does not go
until we forget it and we do not forget it if we are always trying
consciously to overcome it we worriers must go about our
businessother business than that of worry
life is seriousalas too seriousand full enough of pathos we cannot
joke about its troubles they are real but at least we need not
magnify them why should we act as though everything depended upon our
efforts even the changing seasons and the blowing winds no doubt we
are responsible for our own acts and thoughts and for the welfare of
those who depend upon us the trouble is we take unnecessary
responsibilities so seriously that we overreach ourselves and defeat our
own good ends
i would make my little world more blessedly carelesswith an abandon
that loves life too much to spoil it with worry i would cherish so
great a desire for my childs good that i could not scold and bear down
upon him for every little fault making him a worrier too but
instead i would guide him along the right path with pleasant words and
brave encouragement the condemnation of faults is rarely constructive
we had better say to the worriers here is life no matter what
unfortunate things you may have said or done you must put all evil
behind you and livesimply bravely well the greater the evil
the greater the need of forgetting not flippantly but reverently
leave your misdeeds in a limbo where they may not rise to haunt you
this great thing you may do not with the idea of evading or escaping
consequences but so that past evil may be turned into present and
future good the criminal himself is coming to be treated this way he
is no longer eternally reminded of his crime he is taken out into the
sunshine and air and is given a shovel to dig with a wonderful thing is
that shovel with it he may bury the past and raise up a happier
better future we must care so much to expiate our sins that we are
willing to neglect them and live righteously that is true repentance
constructive repentance
we cannot suddenly change our mental outlook and become happy when grief
has borne us down for the broken heart silence and shadethat is
fair and right i would say to those who are unhappy do not try to be
happy you cannot force it but let peace come to you out of the great
world of beauty that calmly surrounds our human suffering and that
speaks to us quietly of god genuine laughter is not forced but we may
let it come back into our lives if we know that it is right for it to
come
we have all about us instances of the effectiveness of the lighter touch
as applied to serious matters the life of the busy surgeon is a good
example he may be and usually is brimming with sympathy but if he
were to feel too deeply for all his patients he would soon fail and
die he goes about his work he puts through a halfdozen operations in
a way that would send cold shivers down the back of the uninitiated and
yet he is accurate and sure as a machine if he were to take each case
upon his mind in a heavy consequential way if he were to give deep
concern to each ligature he ties and if he were to be constantly afraid
of causing pain he would be a poor surgeon his work instead of being
clean and sharp would suffer from overconscientiousness he might
never finish an operation for fear his patient would bleed to death
such a man may be the reverse of flippant and yet he may actually enjoy
his somber work cruel bloodthirsty not at all these menthe great
surgeonsare as tender as children but they love their work they
really care very deeply for their patients the successful ones have the
lighter touch and they have no time for worry
sometimes we wish to arouse the public conscience do the long columns
of figures the impressive statistics wake men to activity it is
rather the keen bright thrust of the satirist that saves the day once
in a new england town meeting there was a movement for a muchneeded new
schoolhouse by the installation of skylights in the attic the old
building had been made to accommodate the overflow of pupils the
serious speakers in favor of the new building had left the audience
cold when a young man arose and said he had been up into the attic and
had seen the wonderful skylights that were supposed to meet the needs of
the children i have seen them he said we used to call them
scuttles when i was a boy a hundred thousand dollars was voted for the
new schoolhouse
there is a natural gayety in most of us which helps more than we realize
to keep us sound the pity is that when responsibilities come and
hardships come we repress our lighter selves sternly as though such
repression were a duty better let us guard the springs of happiness
very very jealously the whistling boy in the dark street does more
than cheer himself on the way he actually protects himself from evil
and brings courage not only to himself but to those who hear him i do
not hold for false cheerfulness that is sometimes affected but a brave
show of courage in a forlorn hope will sometimes win the day it is
infinitely more likely to win than a too serious realization of the
danger of defeat the show of courage is often not a pretense at all
but victory itself
the need of the world is very great and its human destiny is in our
hands half of those who could help to right the wrongs are asleep or
too selfishly immersed in their own affairs we need more helpers like
my friend of the skylights most of us are far too serious the
slumberers will slumber on and the worriers will worry the serious
people will go ponderously about until some one shows them how
ridiculous they are and how pitiful
ix
regrets and forebodings
    regret avails littlestill less remorsethe one keeps alive
    the old offense the other creates new offenses
                goethe
the unrepentant sinner walks abroad unfortunately for us moralists he
seems to be having a very good time we must not condone him though he
may be a very lovable person neither must we altogether condemn him
for he may be repentant in the very best way of all ways the way that
forgets much and leaves behind more because life is so fine that it
must not be spoiled and because progress is in every way better than
retrospection the fact is that repentance is too often the fear of
punishment and such fear is to say the least unmanly i would rather
be a lovable sinner than one of the people who repent because they
cannot bear to think of the consequences knowledge and fear of
consequences undoubtedly keep a great many young people from the
socalled sins of ignorance but there must be something behind
knowledge and fear of consequences to stop the youth of spirit from
doing what he is inclined to do over and over again we must go back to
the appreciation of lifes dignity and beautyto the consciousness of
the spirit of god behind and in the world if we are to find a balance
and a character that will deliver us from evil
when we have found this consciousnesswhen we live it and breathe it
we shall be far less apt to sin and when we have sinned as we all must
in the course of our blundering lives we shall not waste our time in
regret or in the fear of consequences if the god we dream of is as
great as the sea or as beautiful as a tree we need not fear him he
will be tender and just at the same time he will be as forgiving as
he is strong the best we can do then is to leave our sins in the hand
of god and go our way sadder and wiser maybe but not regretting too
much not fearing any more
there is a new idea in medicinethe development of which has been one
of the most striking achievements of modern timesthe idea of
psychanalysis as taught and advocated by freud in germany the plan
is to study the subconscious mind of the nervous patient by means of
hypnotism to assist the patient to recall all the mental experiences of
his pasteven his very early childhoodand in this way to make clear
the origin of the misconceptions and the unfortunate impressions which
have presumably exerted their influence through the years the new
system includes also the interpretation of dreams their effect upon
the conscious life and their influence upon the mentality very
wonderful results are reported from the pursuit of this method many a
badly warped and twisted life has been straightened out and renewed when
the searchlight has revealed the hidden influences that have been at
work and which have made trouble the repression of conscious or
unconscious feelings can no doubt change the whole mental life we
should have the greatest respect for the men who are doing this work it
requires i am told an almost unbelievable amount of patience and time
to accomplish the analysis no doubt the adult judgment of childish
follies is a direct means of disposing of their harmful influence in
life the surest way of losing the conscious or unconscious regrets that
sadden many lives there are probably many cases of disturbed and
troubled mind that can be cured in this way only the method does not
appeal to me because i am so strongly inclined to take people as they
are to urge a forgetfulness that does not really forget but which goes
on bravely to the development of life this development cannot proceed
without the understanding that life may be made so beautiful that sins
and failures are lost in progress some of us may need the subtle
analysis of our lives to make clear the points where we went astray in
our thoughts and ideas but many of us fortunately are able to take
ourselves for better or for worse sins and all most of us ought to do
that for the most part if we are to progress and live sometimes the
revelations of evils we know not of result in complications rather than
simplification as in the case of a boy who wrote to me and said that
since he had learned of his early sins he had made sure that he could
never be well instead of going into further analysis with him i
assured him that while it was undoubtedly his duty to regret all the
evil of his life it was a still greater duty to go on and live the rest
of it well and that he could do so if he would open his eyes to the
possibilities of unselfish service
i am very much inclined to preach against selfanalysis and the almost
inevitable regret and despair that accompany it
one of my patients decided some time ago that her life was wasted that
she had accomplished nothing it was true that she had not the endurance
to meet the usual demands of social or even family life and that for
long periods she had to give up altogether but it happened that she had
the gift of musical understanding that she had studied hard in younger
days with a little urging the gift was made to grow again and to serve
not only the patients own needs but to bring very great pleasure to
every one who listened to her playing that rare true ability was worth
everything and she came to realize it in time the gift of musical
expression is a very great thing and i succeeded in making this woman
understand that she should be happy in that ability even if nothing
else should be possible
often enough nothing that can compare with music exists and life seems
wholly barren rather cold comfort it seems at first to assure a person
who is helpless that character is the greatest thing in the world but
that is the final truth the most limited and helpless life may glow
with it and be richer than imagination can believe it is never time to
regretand never time to despair the less analysis the better when it
comes to character live grow and get a deeper and deeper
understanding of lifeof life that is near to god and so capable of
wrong only as we turn away from him do not say things what you are
stands over you and thunders so i cannot hear what you say to the
contrary we shall do well not to forget that whatever failures or
mistakes we have made there is infinite possibility ahead of us that
character is the greatest thing in the world and that most good
character has been built upon mistakes and failures i believe there is
no sin which may not make up the fabric of its own forgiveness in the
living of a free selfsacrificing life i know of no bodily ill nor
handicap which we may not eventually rise above and beyond by means of
brave spiritual progress the body may fail us but the spirit reaches
on and into the great world of god

the virtues
    the virtues hide their vanquished fires
    within that whiter flame
    till conscience grows irrelevant
    and duty but a name
                frederick lawrence knowles
in most books i have read on nerves and similar subjects advice is
given encouragement is given but the necessity for patience is not
made clear patience is typical of all the other virtues many a man has
followed the best of advice for a time and has become discouraged
because the promised results did not materialize it is disappointing
surely to have lived upon a diet for months only to find that you still
have dyspepsia or to have followed certain rules of morality with great
precision and enthusiasm without obtaining the untroubled mind we are
accustomed to see results in the material world and naturally expect
them everywhere the trouble is we do not always recognize improvements
when we see them and we insist upon certain preconceived changes as a
result of our endeavors the physician is apt rashly to promise definite
physical accomplishments in a given time he is courting disappointment
and distrust when he does so we all want to get relief from our
symptoms and we are inclined to insist upon a particular kind of relief
so strongly that we fail to appreciate the possibilities of another and
a better relief which may be at hand the going astray in this
particular is sometimes very unfortunate i have known a man to rush
frantically from one doctor to another trying to obtain relief for a
particular pain or discomfort unwilling to rest long enough to find out
that the trouble would have disappeared naturally if he had taken the
advice of the first physician to live without impatience and within his
limitations
the human body is a very complex organism and sometimes pain and
distress are better not relieved since they may be the expression of
some deeper maladjustment which must first be straightened out this is
also true of the mindin which the unhappy proddings of conscience had
better not be cured by anodynes or by evasion unless we are prepared to
go deeply enough to make them disappear spontaneously we must sometimes
insist upon patience though it should exist as a matter of
coursepatience with ourselves and with others the physician who
demands and secures the greatest degree of patience from his clients is
the most successful practitioner for no life can go on successfully
without patience if patience can be spontaneousthe natural result of
a broadening outlookthen it will be permanent and serviceable the
other kind that exists by extreme effort may do for a while but it is
a poor makeshift
i always feel like apologizing when i ask a man or a woman to be
tolerant or charitable or generous or for that matter to practice any
of the ordinary virtues sound living should spring unbidden from the
very joy of life it should need no justification and certainly no
urging but unfortunately as the world now stands there are men and
groups of men who do not see the light there is a wide contagion of
selfishness and shortsightedness among the welltodo and a necessary
federation of protection and selfishness among the poor the practical
needs of life artificial as they are among the rich and terribly
insistent as they are among the poor blind us to larger considerations
if all matters of welfare public or private could be treated
unselfishly how quickly we should be rid of some of the great evils
that afflict the race i am inclined to think that much of the goodness
of people does come in that way unconsciously naturally as the light
flows from the sun yet i suppose that in our present order and until
through the years the better time arrives we must very often ask
ourselves and others to be good and to be charitable just because it is
right or worse still because it is good policy
a man grows better more human more intelligent as he practices the
virtues he is safer no doubt and the world is better it is even true
that by the constant practice of virtues he may come finally to
espouse goodness and become thoroughly good that is the hopeful thing
about it and the reason why we may consistently ask or demand the
routine practice of the virtues but let us hold up all the time in our
teaching and in our lives the other course the development of the
inspiration that includes all virtues and that makes all our way easy
and plain in a world where confusion reigns because men are going at
the problem of right living the wrong way around
the practice of good living will never be easy in its details but if it
is sure in its inspiration there will be no question of the final
triumph we shall have to fight blindly sometimes and with all the
strength and persistence of animals at bay we shall fail sometimes
too and that is not always the worst thing that can happen it is the
glory of life that we shall slowly triumph over ourselves and the world
it is the glory of life that out of sore trouble in the midst of
poverty and human injustice may rise spontaneous and serene the
spirit of selfsacrifice the unconquerable spirit of service that does
not question that expresses the divine tenderness in terms of human
love through the times of darkness and doubt which must inevitably
come there will be for those who cherish such a vision and who come
back to it again and again no utter darkness no trouble that wholly
crushes no loss that wholly destroys
if we could not understand it before it will slowly dawn upon us that
the life of christ exemplified all these things charity kindliness
service patienceall these things which have seemed so hard will
become in our lives as in his the substance and expression of our
faith the great human virtues will become easy and natural the
untroubled mind or as much of it as is good to possess will be ours
not because we have escaped trouble but because we have disarmed it
have welcomed it even so long as it has served to strengthen and
ennoble our lives

the cure by faith
    the healing of his seamless dress
    is by our beds of pain
    we touch him in lifes throng and press
    and we are whole again
                whittier
i cannot finish my little book of ideals without writing some things
that are in my mind about cure by faith or by prayer it is a subject
that i approach with hesitation because of the danger of
misunderstanding no subject is more difficult and none is more
important for the invalid to understand we hear a great deal about the
wonderful cures of christian science or of similar agencies and we all
know of people who have been restored to usefulness by such means has
the healing of christ again become possible on earth no one would be
more eager to accept it and acknowledge it than the physician if it
were really so but careful investigation always reveals the fact that
the wonderful cures are not of the body but of the mind it is easy
enough to say that a cancer or tuberculosis has been cured by faith and
apparently easy for many people to believe it but alas the proof is
wanting the christian scientist honest and sincere as he may be is
not qualified to say what is true disease and what is not what looks
like diseased tissue recovers but medical men know that it could not
have been diseased in the most serious sense and that the prayer for
recovery could have had nothing to do with the cure save in a very
indirect way
the man who discards medicine for philosophy or religion is courting
unnecessary suffering and even death the worst part of it is that he
may induce some one else to make the same mistake with similar results
in writing this opinion i am in no way denying the great significance
and value of faith nor of the prayerful and trustful mind if it cannot
cure actual physical disease faith can accomplish veritable miracles of
healing in the mind of the patient no thoughtful or honest medical man
will deny it nor will most medical men deny that the course of almost
any physical illness may be modified by faith and prayer i am almost
saying that there is no known medicine of such potency every bodily
function is the better for the conquering spirit that transcends the
earth and finds its necessary expression in prayer
there really need be no issue or disagreement between medicine and faith
cure at its best one is not more wonderful than the other and both
aim to accomplish the same endthe relief of human suffering when the
two are merged as some day they will be we shall be surprised to
discover how alike they are christian science is rightly scorned by
medical men because it is unscientific because it makes absurd and
untenable claims outside its own field and because it has not as yet
investigated that field in the scientific spirit when proper study and
investigation have been made it will be found that faith cure not in
its present state but in some future development will have an immense
field of usefulness it will be worthy of as much respect in that field
as medicine proper in its own sphere as a matter of fact both medicine
and faith cure are miraculous in a very real sense as both depend for
efficiency now and always upon the same great laws which may be fairly
called divine what is the discovery that the serum of a horse will
under certain circumstances cure diphtheria does it not mean that man
is tapping sources of power far beyond his understanding is man
responsible save as the agent did he produce the complex animal
chemistry that makes this cure possible did man make the horse or the
laws that control the physiology and pathology of that animal here
then is faith cure in its largest and best sense the biologist may not
be willing to admit it but his faith in these great laws of god have
made possible the cure of a dread disease here as in all matters of
pure religion it is what men say and write not the fact itself that
makes all the misunderstanding we make our judgments and conceive our
prejudices from mere surface considerations call life what you
willleave out the symbolic word god altogetherthe facts remain
the true scientific spirit must reverence and adore the power that lies
behind creation it is as inconsistent for the bacteriologist to be an
unbeliever as it is for the christian scientist to deny the value of
bacteriology medicine is infinitely farther advanced than christian
science and yet christian science has grasped some truth that the
natural scientist has stupidly missed when an obsession is thrown off
and courage substituted for fear we witness as important a cure as
can be shown to the credit of surgery if the christian scientists and
the other faithcurers were only less superficial and less narrow in
their explanation of the facts if they would condescend to study the
diseases they treat they would be entitled to and would receive more
respect and consideration
the cure and prevention of disease through the agency of man are
evidently part of the divine plan our eagerness to advance along the
lines of investigation and practice is but that divine plan in action
the truly scientific spirit will neglect no possible curative agent
when scientific men ridicule prayer they are thinking not of the real
thing which is above all possible criticism but of the feeble and often
pathetic groping for the real thing we ask in our prayers for
impossible blessings that would invert the laws of god and change the
face of naturevery well we must be prepared for disappointment the
attitude of prayer may indeed transform our own lives and make
possible for us experiences that would otherwise have been impossible
but our pathetic demandswe shall never know how forlorn and weak they
are prayer is the opening of the heart to the being we call godit is
most natural and reasonable if we pray in our weakness and blindness
for what we may not have there is nevertheless a wonderful
recreative effect within us the comfort and peace of such communion is
beyond all else healing and restoring in its influence upon the troubled
and anxious mind of man the poet or the scientist who bows in adoration
before the glory of god revealed in nature prays in effect to that god
and his soul is refreshed and renewed the poor wretch who stands
blindfolded before the firing squad waiting the word that ends the life
of a military spy is near enough to godand the whispered prayer upon
his lips is cure for the wounds that take his life
the best kind of prayer seeks not and asks not for physical relief or
benefit but opens the heart to its maker and so receives the cure of
peace that is a greater miracle than any yet wrought by man under the
influence of that cure the sick are well and the dead are alive again
with the courage and spirit of such a cure in our lives we shall
inevitably do our utmost to relieve by any good means the physical
suffering of the world we shall follow the laws of nature we shall
study them with the utmost care we shall take nothing for granted
since by less careful steps we shall miss the divine law and so go
astray the science of healing will become no chance and irrational
thing we shall use all the natural means to relieve and prevent
sufferingthere will be no scoring of one set of doctors by another
because all will have one purpose but more to the point than that men
will discover that health in its largest sense consists in living devout
and prayerful lives whereunto shall be revealed in good time all that
our finite minds can know and use there will be no suffering of the
body in the old and pitiful sense for we shall be so much alive that
disease and death can no longer claim us
