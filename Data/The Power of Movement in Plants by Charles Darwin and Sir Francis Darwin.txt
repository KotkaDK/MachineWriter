introduction
the chief object of the present work is to describe and connect
together several large classes of movement common to almost all
plants the most widely prevalent movement is essentially of the same
nature as that of the stem of a climbing plant which bends
successively to all points of the compass so that the tip revolves
this movement has been called by sachs revolving nutation but we
have found it much more convenient to use the terms circumnutation and
circumnutate as we shall have to say much about this movement it will
be useful here briefly to describe its nature if we observe a
circumnutating stem which happens at the time to be bent we will say
towards the north it will be found gradually to bend more and more
easterly until it faces the east and so onwards to the south then to
the west and back again to the north if the movement had been quite
regular the apex would have described a circle or rather as the stem
is always growing upwards a circular spiral but it generally
describes irregular elliptical or oval figures for the apex after
pointing in any one direction commonly moves back to the opposite
side not however returning along the same line afterwards other
irregular ellipses or ovals are successively described with their
longer
axes directed to different points of the compass whilst describing
such figures the apex often travels in a zigzag line or makes small
subordinate loops or triangles in the case of leaves the ellipses are
generally narrow
until recently the cause of all such bending movements was believed to
be due to the increased growth of the side which becomes for a time
convex that this side does temporarily grow more quickly than the
concave side has been well established but de vries has lately shown
that such increased growth follows a previously increased state of
turgescence on the convex side1 in the case of parts provided with a
socalled joint cushion or pulvinus which consists of an aggregate of
small cells that have ceased to increase in size from a very early age
we meet with similar movements and here as pfeffer has shown2 and
as we shall see in the course of this work the increased turgescence
of the cells on opposite sides is not followed by increased growth
wiesner denies in certain cases the accuracy of de vries conclusion
about turgescence and maintains3 that the increased extensibility of
the cellwalls is the more important element that such extensibility
must accompany increased turgescence in order that the part may bend is
manifest and this has been insisted on by several botanists but in
the case of unicellular plants it can hardly fail to be the more
important element on the whole we may at present conclude that
increased growth first on one side and then on another is a secondary
effect and that the increased turgescence of the cells together with
the extensibility of their walls is the primary cause of the movement
of circumnutation4

 intimate connection between turgescence and growth for de vries

 in relation to this subject
in the course of the present volume it will be shown that apparently
every growing part of every plant is continually circumnutating though
often on a small scale even the stems of seedlings before they have
broken through the ground as well as their buried radicles
circumnutate as far as the pressure of the surrounding earth permits
in this universally present movement we have the basis or groundwork
for the acquirement according to the requirements of the plant of the
most diversified movements thus the great sweeps made by the stems of
twining plants and by the tendrils of other climbers result from a
mere increase in the amplitude of the ordinary movement of
circumnutation the position which young leaves and other organs
ultimately assume is acquired by the circumnutating movement being
increased in some one direction the leaves of various plants are said
to sleep at night and it will be seen that their blades then assume a
vertical position through modified circumnutation in order to protect
their upper surfaces from being chilled through radiation the
movements of various organs to the light which are so general
throughout the vegetable kingdom and occasionally from the light or
transversely with respect to it are all modified
forms of circumnutation as again are the equally prevalent movements
of stems etc towards the zenith and of roots towards the centre of
the earth in accordance with these conclusions a considerable
difficulty in the way of evolution is in part removed for it might
have been asked how did all these diversified movements for the most
different purposes first arise as the case stands we know that there
is always movement in progress and its amplitude or direction or
both have only to be modified for the good of the plant in relation
with internal or external stimuli
besides describing the several modified forms of circumnutation some
other subjects will be discussed the two which have interested us most
are firstly the fact that with some seedling plants the uppermost
part alone is sensitive to light and transmits an influence to the
lower part causing it to bend if therefore the upper part be wholly
protected from light the lower part may be exposed for hours to it
and yet does not become in the least bent although this would have
occurred quickly if the upper part had been excited by light secondly
with the radicles of seedlings the tip is sensitive to various
stimuli especially to very slight pressure and when thus excited
transmits an influence to the upper part causing it to bend from the
pressed side on the other hand if the tip is subjected to the vapour
of water proceeding from one side the upper part of the radicle bends
towards this side again it is the tip as stated by ciesielski though
denied by others which is sensitive to the attraction of gravity and
by transmission causes the adjoining parts of the radicle to bend
towards the centre of the earth these several cases of the effects of
contact other irritants vapour light and the
attraction of gravity being transmitted from the excited part for some
little distance along the organ in question have an important bearing
on the theory of all such movements
terminologya brief explanation of some terms which will be used must
here be given with seedlings the stem which supports the cotyledons
ie the organs which represent the first leaves has been called by
many botanists the hypocotyledonous stem but for brevity sake we will
speak of it merely as the hypocotyl the stem immediately above the
cotyledons will be called the epicotyl or plumule the radicle can be
distinguished from the hypocotyl only by the presence of roothairs and
the nature of its covering the meaning of the word circumnutation has
already been explained authors speak of positive and negative
heliotropism5that is the bending of an organ to or from the light
but it is much more convenient to confine the word heliotropism to
bending towards the light and to designate as apheliotropism bending
from the light there is another reason for this change for writers
as we have observed occasionally drop the adjectives positive and
negative and thus introduce confusion into their discussions
diaheliotropism may express a position more or less transverse to the
light and induced by it in like manner positive geotropism or bending
towards the centre of the earth will be called by us geotropism
apogeotropism will mean bending in opposition to gravity or from the
centre of the earth and diageotropism a position more or less
transverse to the radius of the earth the words heliotropism and
geotropism properly mean the act of moving in relation to the light or
the earth but in the same manner as gravitation though defined as
the act of tending to the centre is often used to express the cause
of a body falling so it will be found convenient occasionally to
employ heliotropism and geotropism etc as the cause of the movements
in question
 5 the highly useful terms of heliotropism and geotropism were first
 used by dr a b frank see his remarkable beitrge zur
 pflanzenphysiologie 1868
the term epinasty is now often used in germany and implies that the
upper surface of an organ grows more quickly than the
lower surface and thus causes it to bend downwards hyponasty is the
reverse and implies increased growth along the lower surface causing
the part to bend upwards6
 6 these terms are used in the sense given them by de vries
 wrzburg arbeiten heft ii 1872 p 252
methods of observationthe movements sometimes very small and
sometimes considerable in extent of the various organs observed by us
were traced in the manner which after many trials we found to be best
and which must be described plants growing in pots were protected
wholly from the light or had light admitted from above or on one side
as the case might require and were covered above by a large horizontal
sheet of glass and with another vertical sheet on one side a glass
filament not thicker than a horsehair and from a quarter to
threequarters of an inch in length was affixed to the part to be
observed by means of shellac dissolved in alcohol the solution was
allowed to evaporate until it became so thick that it set hard in two
or three seconds and it never injured the tissues even the tips of
tender radicles to which it was applied to the end of the glass
filament an excessively minute bead of black sealingwax was cemented
below or behind which a bit of card with a black dot was fixed to a
stick driven into the ground the weight of the filament was so slight
that even small leaves were not perceptibly pressed down another
method of observation when much magnification of the movement was not
required will presently be described the bead and the dot on the card
were viewed through the horizontal or vertical glassplate according
to the position of the object and when one exactly covered the other
a dot was made on the glassplate with a sharply pointed stick dipped
in thick indianink other dots were made at short intervals of time
and these were afterwards joined by straight lines the figures thus
traced were therefore angular but if dots had been made every 1 or 2
minutes the lines would have been more curvilinear as occurred when
radicles were allowed to trace their own courses on smoked
glassplates to make the dots accurately was the sole difficulty and
required some practice nor could this be done quite accurately when
the movement was much magnified such as 30 times and upwards yet even
in this case the general course may be trusted to test the accuracy of
the above method of observation a filament was fixed to an
inanimate object which was made to slide along a straight edge and dots
were repeatedly made on a glassplate when these were joined the
result ought to have been a perfectly straight line and the line was
very nearly straight it may be added that when the dot on the card was
placed halfaninch below or behind the bead of sealingwax and when
the glassplate supposing it to have been properly curved stood at a
distance of 7 inches in front a common distance then the tracing
represented the movement of the bead magnified 15 times
whenever a great increase of the movement was not required another
and in some respects better method of observation was followed this
consisted in fixing two minute triangles of thin paper about 120 inch
in height to the two ends of the attached glass filament and when
their tips were brought into a line so that they covered one another
dots were made as before on the glassplate if we suppose the
glassplate to stand at a distance of seven inches from the end of the
shoot bearing the filament the dots when joined will give nearly the
same figure as if a filament seven inches long dipped in ink had been
fixed to the moving shoot and had inscribed its own course on the
plate the movement is thus considerably magnified for instance if a
shoot one inch in length were bending and the glassplate stood at the
distance of seven inches the movement would be magnified eight times
it would however have been very difficult to have ascertained in each
case how great a length of the shoot was bending and this is
indispensable for ascertaining the degree to which the movement is
magnified
after dots had been made on the glassplates by either of the above
methods they were copied on tracing paper and joined by ruled lines
with arrows showing the direction of the movement the nocturnal
courses are represented by straight broken lines the first dot is
always made larger than the others so as to catch the eye as may be
seen in the diagrams the figures on the glassplates were often drawn
on too large a scale to be reproduced on the pages of this volume and
the proportion in which they have been reduced is always given7
whenever it could be approximately told how much the movement had been
magnified this is stated we have perhaps
introduced a superfluous number of diagrams but they take up less
space than a full description of the movements almost all the sketches
of plants asleep etc were carefully drawn for us by mr george
darwin
 7 we are much indebted to mr cooper for the care with which he has
 reduced and engraved our diagrams
as shoots leaves etc in circumnutating bend more and more first in
one direction and then in another they were necessarily viewed at
different times more or less obliquely and as the dots were made on a
flat surface the apparent amount of movement is exaggerated according
to the degree of obliquity of the point of view it would therefore
have been a much better plan to have used hemispherical glasses if we
had possessed them of all sizes and if the bending part of the shoot
had been distinctly hinged and could have been placed so as to have
formed one of the radii of the sphere but even in this case it would
have been necessary afterwards to have projected the figures on paper
so that complete accuracy could not have been attained from the
distortion of our figures owing to the above causes they are of no
use to any one who wishes to know the exact amount of movement or the
exact course pursued but they serve excellently for ascertaining
whether or not the part moved at all as well as the general character
of the movement
in the following chapters the movements of a considerable number of
plants are described and the species have been arranged according to
the system adopted by hooker in le maout and decaisnes descriptive
botany no one who is not investigating the present subject need read
all the details which however we have thought it advisable to give
to save the reader trouble the conclusions and most of the more
important parts have been printed in larger type than the other parts
he may if he thinks fit read the last chapter first as it includes a
summary of the whole volume and he will thus see what points interest
him and on which he requires the full evidence
finally we must have the pleasure of returning our
sincere thanks to sir joseph hooker and to mr w thiselton dyer for
their great kindness in not only sending us plants from kew but in
procuring others from several sources when they were required for our
observations also for naming many species and giving us information
on various points

radicles hypocotyls and cotyledons of seedling plants and when the
cotyledons do not rise above the ground to the movements of the
epicotyl but in a future chapter we shall have to recur to the
movements of certain cotyledons which sleep at night
brassica oleracea cruciferaefuller details will be given with
respect to the movements in this case than in any other as space and
time will thus ultimately be saved
radiclea seed with the radicle projecting 05 inch was fastened with
shellac to a little plate of zinc so that the radicle stood up
vertically and a fine glass filament was then fixed near its base
that is close to the seedcoats the seed was surrounded by little
bits of wet sponge and the movement of the bead at the end of the
filament was traced fig 1 during sixty hours in this time the
radicle increased in length from 05 to 11 inch had the filament been
attached at first close to the apex of the radicle and if it could
have remained there all the time the movement exhibited would have
been much greater for at the close of our observations the tip
instead of standing vertically upwards had become bowed downwards
through geotropism so as almost to touch the zinc plate as far as we
could roughly ascertain by measurements made with compasses on other
seeds the tip alone for a length of only 2100 to 3100 of an inch
is acted on by geotropism but the tracing shows that the basal part of
the radicle continued to circumnutate irregularly during the whole
time the actual extreme amount of movement of the bead at the end of
the filament was nearly 05 inch but to what extent the movement of
the radicle was magnified by the filament which was nearly 34 inch in
length it was impossible to estimate
fig 1 brassica oleracea circumnutation of radicle traced on
horizontal glass from 9 am jan 31st to 9 pm feb 2nd movement of
bead at end of filament magnified about 40 times
another seed was treated and observed in the same manner but the
radicle in this case protruded 1 inch and was not fastened so as to
project quite vertically upwards the filament was affixed close to its
base the tracing fig 2 reduced by half shows the movement from 9
am jan 31st to 7 am feb 2nd but it continued to move during the
whole of the
2nd in the same general direction and in a similar zigzag manner from
the radicle not being quite perpendicular when the filament was affixed
geotropism came into play at once but the irregular zigzag course
shows that there was growth probably preceded by turgescence
sometimes on one and sometimes on another side occasionally the bead
remained stationary for about an hour and then probably growth
occurred on the side opposite to that which caused the geotropic
curvature in the case previously described the basal part of the very
short radicle from being turned vertically upwards was at first very
little affected by geotropism filaments were affixed in two other
instances to rather longer radicles protruding obliquely from seeds
which had been turned upside down and in these cases the lines traced
on the horizontal glasses were only slightly zigzag and the movement
was always in the same general direction through the action of
geotropism all these observations are liable to several causes of
error but we believe from what will hereafter be shown with respect
to the movements of the radicles of other plants that they may be
largely trusted
fig 2 brassica oleracea circumnutating and geotropic movement of
radicle traced on horizontal glass during 46 hours
hypocotylthe hypocotyl protrudes through the seedcoats as a
rectangular projection which grows rapidly into an arch like the
letter u turned upside down the cotyledons being still enclosed within
the seed in whatever position the seed may be embedded in the earth or
otherwise fixed both legs of the arch bend upwards through
apogeotropism and thus rise vertically above the ground as soon as
this has taken place or even earlier the inner or concave surface of
the arch grows more quickly than the upper or convex surface and this
tends to separate the two legs and aids in drawing the cotyledons out
of the buried seedcoats by the growth of the whole arch the
cotyledons are ultimately dragged from beneath the ground even from a
considerable depth and now the hypocotyl quickly straightens itself by
the increased growth of the concave side
even whilst the arched or doubled hypocotyl is still beneath the
ground it circumnutates as much as the pressure of the surrounding
soil will permit but this was difficult to observe because as soon as
the arch is freed from lateral pressure the two legs begin to separate
even at a very early age before the arch would naturally have reached
the surface seeds were allowed to germinate on the surface of damp
earth and after they had fixed themselves by their radicles and after
the as yet only
slightly arched hypocotyl had become nearly vertical a glass filament
was affixed on two occasions near to the base of the basal leg ie
the one in connection with the radicle and its movements were traced
in darkness on a horizontal glass the result was that long lines were
formed running in nearly the plane of the vertical arch due to the
early separation of the two legs now freed from pressure but as the
lines were zigzag showing lateral movement the arch must have been
circumnutating whilst it was straightening itself by growth along its
inner or concave surface
a somewhat different method of observation was next followed as soon
as the earth with seeds in a pot began to crack the surface was
removed in parts to the depth of 2 inch and a filament was fixed to
the basal leg of a buried and arched hypocotyl just above the summit
of the radicle the cotyledons were still almost completely enclosed
within the muchcracked seedcoats and these were again covered up
with damp adhesive soil pressed pretty firmly down the movement of the
filament was traced fig 3 from 11 am feb 5th till 8 am feb
7th by this latter period the cotyledons had been dragged from beneath
the presseddown earth but the upper part of the hypocotyl still
formed nearly a right angle with the lower part the tracing shows that
the arched hypocotyl tends at this early
age to circumnutate irregularly on the first day the greater movement
from right to left in the figure was not in the plane of the vertical
and arched hypocotyl but at right angles to it or in the plane of the
two cotyledons which were still in close contact the basal leg of the
arch at the time when the filament was affixed to it was already bowed
considerably backwards or from the cotyledons had the filament been
affixed before this bowing occurred the chief movement would have been
at right angles to that shown in the figure a filament was attached to
another buried hypocotyl of the same age and it moved in a similar
general manner but the line traced was not so complex this hypocotyl
became almost straight and the cotyledons were dragged from beneath
the ground on the evening of the second day

hypocotyl with the two legs of the arch tied together traced on
horizontal glass during 33 hours movement of the bead of filament
magnified about 26 times and here reduced to onehalf original scale
before the above observations were made some arched hypocotyls buried
at the depth of a quarter of an inch were uncovered and in order to
prevent the two legs of the arch from beginning to separate at once
they were tied together with fine silk this was done partly because we
wished to ascertain how long the hypocotyl in its arched condition
would continue to move and whether the movement when not masked and
disturbed by the straightening process indicated circumnutation
firstly a filament was fixed to the basal leg of an arched hypocotyl
close above the summit of the radicle the cotyledons were still
partially enclosed within the seedcoats the movement was traced fig
4 from 920 am on dec
23rd to 645 am on dec 25th no doubt the natural movement was much
disturbed by the two legs having been tied together but we see that it
was distinctly zigzag first in one direction and then in an almost
opposite one after 3 pm on the 24th the arched hypocotyl sometimes
remained stationary for a considerable time and when moving moved far
slower than before therefore on the morning of the 25th the glass
filament was removed from the base of the basal leg and was fixed
horizontally on the summit of the arch which from the legs having
been tied had grown broad and almost flat the movement was now traced
during 23 hours fig 5 and we see that the course was still zigzag
which indicates a tendency to circumnutation the base of the basal leg
by this time had almost completely ceased to move

buried and arched hypocotyl with the two legs tied together traced on
a horizontal glass during 23 hours movement of the bead of the
filament magnified about 58 times and here reduced to onehalf
original scale
as soon as the cotyledons have been naturally dragged from beneath the
ground and the hypocotyl has straightened itself by growth along the
inner or concave surface there is nothing to interfere with the free
movements of the parts and the circumnutation now becomes much more
regular and clearly displayed as shown in the following casesa
seedling was placed in front and near a northeast window with a line
joining the
two cotyledons parallel to the window it was thus left the whole day
so as to accommodate itself to the light on the following morning a
filament was fixed to the midrib of the larger and taller cotyledon
which enfolds the other and smaller one whilst still within the
seed and a mark being placed close behind the movement of the whole
plant that is of the hypocotyl and cotyledon was traced greatly
magnified on a vertical glass at first the plant bent so much towards
the light that it was useless to attempt to trace the movement but at
10 am heliotropism almost wholly ceased and the first dot was made on
the glass the last was made at 845 pm seventeen dots being
altogether made in this interval of 10 h 45 m see fig 6 it should
be noticed that when i looked shortly after 4 pm the bead was
pointing off the glass but it came on again at 530 pm and the
course during this interval of 1 h 30 m has been filled up by
imagination but cannot be far from correct the bead moved seven times
from side to side and thus described 3 ellipses in 10 34 h each
being completed on an average in 3 h 4 m
fig 6 brassica oleracea conjoint circumnutation of the hypocotyl and
cotyledons during 10 hours 45 minutes figure here reduced to onehalf
original scale
on the previous day another seedling had been observed under similar
conditions excepting that the plant was so
placed that a line joining the two cotyledons pointed towards the
window and the filament was attached to the smaller cotyledon on the
side furthest from the window moreover the plant was now for the first
time placed in this position the cotyledons bowed themselves greatly
towards the light from 8 to 1050 am when the first dot was made
fig 7 during the next 12 hours the bead swept obliquely up and down
8 times and described 4 figures representing ellipses so that it
travelled at nearly the same rate as in the previous case during the
night it moved upwards owing to the sleepmovement of the cotyledons
and continued to move in the same direction till 9 am on the
following morning but this latter movement would not have occurred
with seedlings under their natural conditions fully exposed to the
light
fig 7 brassica oleracea conjoint circumnutation of the hypocotyl and
cotyledons from 1050 am to 8 am on the following morning tracing
made on a vertical glass
by 925 am on this second day the same cotyledon had
begun to fall and a dot was made on a fresh glass the movement was
traced until 530 pm as shown in fig 8 which is given because
the course followed was much more irregular than on the two previous
occasions during these 8 hours the bead changed its course greatly 10
times the upward movement of the cotyledon during the afternoon and
early part of the night is here plainly shown
fig 8 brassica oleracea conjoint circumnutation of the hypocotyl and
cotyledons during 8 hours figure here reduced to onethird of the
original scale as traced on a vertical glass
as the filaments were fixed in the three last cases to one of the
cotyledons and as the hypocotyl was left free the tracings show the
movement of both organs conjoined and we now wished to ascertain
whether both circumnutated filaments were therefore fixed horizontally
to two hypocotyls close beneath the petioles of their cotyledons these
seedlings had stood for two days in the same position before a
northeast window in the morning up to about 11 am they moved in
zigzag lines towards the light and at night they again became almost
upright through apogeotropism after about 11 am they moved a little
back from the light often crossing and recrossing their former path in
zigzag lines the sky on this day varied much in brightness and these
observations merely proved that the hypocotyls were continually moving
in a manner resembling circumnutation on a previous day which was
uniformly cloudy a hypocotyl was firmly secured to a little stick and
a filament was fixed to the larger of the two cotyledons and its
movement was traced on a vertical glass it fell greatly from 852
am when the first dot was made till 1055 am it then rose
greatly until 1217 pm afterwards it fell a little and made a loop
but by 222 pm it had risen a little and continued rising till 923
pm when it made another loop and at 1030 pm was again rising
these observations show that the cotyledons move
vertically up and down all day long and as there was some slight
lateral movement they circumnutated
fig 9 brassica oleracea circumnutation of hypocotyl in darkness
traced on a horizontal glass by means of a filament with a bead fixed
across its summit between 915 am and 830 am on the following
morning figure here reduced to onehalf of original scale
the cabbage was one of the first plants the seedlings of which were
observed by us and we did not then know how far the circumnutation of
the different parts was affected by light young seedlings were
therefore kept in complete darkness except for a minute or two during
each observation when they were illuminated by a small wax taper held
almost vertically above them during the first day the hypocotyl of one
changed its course 13 times see fig 9 and it deserves notice that
the longer axes of the figures described often cross one another at
right or nearly right angles another seedling was observed in the same
manner but it was much older for it had formed a true leaf a quarter
of an inch in length and the hypocotyl was 1 38 inch in height the
figure traced was a very complex one though the movement was not so
great in extent as in the last case
the hypocotyl of another seedling of the same age was secured to a
little stick and a filament having been fixed to the midrib of one of
the cotyledons the movement of the bead was traced during 14 h 15 m
see fig 10 in darkness it should be noted that the chief movement
of the cotyledons namely up and down would be shown on a horizontal
glassplate only by the lines in the direction of the midrib that is
up and down as fig 10 here stands being a little lengthened or
shortened whereas any lateral movement would be well exhibited the
present tracing shows that the cotyledon did thus move laterally that
is from side to side in the tracing 12 times in the 14 h 15 m of
observation therefore the cotyledons certainly circumnutated though
the chief movement was up and down in a vertical plane

rate of movementthe movements of the hypocotyls and cotyledons of
seedling cabbages of different ages have now been sufficiently
illustrated with respect to the rate seedlings were placed under the
microscope with the stage removed and with a micrometer eyepiece so
adjusted that each division equalled 1500 inch the plants were
illuminated by light passing through a solution of bichromate of
potassium so as to eliminate heliotropism under these circumstances it
was interesting to observe how rapidly the circumnutating apex of a
cotyledon passed across the divisions of the micrometer whilst
travelling in any direction the apex generally oscillated backwards and
forwards to the extent of 1500 and sometimes of nearly 1250 of an
inch these oscillations were quite different from the trembling caused
by any disturbance in the same room or by the shutting of a distant
door the first seedling observed was nearly two inches in height and
had been etiolated by having been grown in darkness the tip of the
cotyledon passed across 10 divisions of the micrometer that is 150
of an inch in 6 m 40 s short glass filaments were then fixed
vertically to the hypocotyls of several seedlings so as to project a
little above the cotyledons thus exaggerating the rate of movement
but only a few of the observations thus made are worth giving the most
remarkable fact was the oscillatory movement above described and the
difference of rate at which the point crossed the divisions of the
micrometer after short intervals of time for instance a tall
notetiolated seedling had been kept for 14 h in darkness it was
exposed before a northeast window for only
two or three minutes whilst a glass filament was fixed vertically to
the hypocotyl it was then again placed in darkness for half an hour
and afterwards observed by light passing through bichromate of
potassium the point oscillating as usual crossed five divisions of
the micrometer ie 1100 inch in 1 m 30 s the seedling was then
left in darkness for an hour and now it required 3 m 6 s to cross
one division that is 15 m 30 s to have crossed five divisions
another seedling after being occasionally observed in the back part of
a northern room with a very dull light and left in complete darkness
for intervals of half an hour crossed five divisions in 5 m in the
direction of the window so that we concluded that the movement was
heliotropic but this was probably not the case for it was placed
close to a northeast window and left there for 25 m after which
time instead of moving still more quickly towards the light as might
have been expected it travelled only at the rate of 12 m 30 s for
five divisions it was then again left in complete darkness for 1 h
and the point now travelled in the same direction as before but at the
rate of 3 m 18 s for five divisions
we shall have to recur to the cotyledons of the cabbage in a future
chapter when we treat of their sleepmovements the circumnutation
also of the leaves of fullydeveloped plants will hereafter be
described

githago segetum caryophylleaea young seedling was dimly illuminated
from above and the circumnutation of the
hypocotyl was observed during 28 h as shown in fig 11 it moved in
all directions the lines from right and to left in the figure being
parallel to the blades of the cotyledons the actual distance travelled
from side to side by the summit of the hypocotyl was about 2 of an
inch but it was impossible to be accurate on this head as the more
obliquely the plant was viewed after it had moved for some time the
more the distances were exaggerated
we endeavoured to observe the circumnutation of the cotyledons but as
they close together unless kept exposed to a moderately bright light
and as the hypocotyl is extremely heliotropic the necessary
arrangements were too troublesome we shall recur to the nocturnal or
sleepmovements of the cotyledons in a future chapter
fig 12 gossypium circumnutation of hypocotyl traced on a horizontal

magnified about twice seedling illuminated from above
gossypium var nankin cotton malvaceaethe circumnutation of a
hypocotyl was observed in the hothouse but the movement was so much
exaggerated that the bead twice passed for a time out of view it was
however manifest that two somewhat irregular ellipses were nearly
completed in 9 h another seedling 1 in in height was then observed
during 23 h but the observations were not made at sufficiently short
intervals as shown by the few dots in fig 12 and the tracing was not
now sufficiently enlarged nevertheless there could be no doubt about
the circumnutation of the hypocotyl which described in 12 h a figure
representing three irregular ellipses of unequal sizes
the cotyledons are in constant movement up and down during the whole
day and as they offer the unusual case of moving downwards late in the
evening and in the early part of the night many observations were made
on them a filament was fixed along the middle of one and its movement
traced on a vertical glass but the tracing is not given as the
hypocotyl was not secured so that it was impossible to distinguish
clearly between its movement and that of the cotyledon the cotyledons
rose from 1030 am to about 3 pm they then sank till 10 pm
rising however greatly in the latter part of the night
the angles above the horizon at which the cotyledons of another
seedling stood at different hours is recorded in the following short

the position of the two cotyledons was roughly sketched at various
hours with the same general result
in the following summer the hypocotyl of a fourth seedling was secured
to a little stick and a glass filament with triangles of paper having
been fixed to one of the cotyledons its movements were traced on a
vertical glass under a double skylight in the house the first dot was
made at 420 pm june 20th and the cotyledon fell till 1015 pm in
a nearly straight line just past midnight it was found a little lower
and somewhat to one side by the early morning at 345 am it had
risen greatly but by 620 am had fallen a little during the whole
of this day 21st it fell in a slightly zigzag line but its normal
course was disturbed by the want of sufficient illumination for during
the night it rose only a little and travelled irregularly during the
whole of the following day and night of june 22nd the ascending and
descending lines traced during the three days did not coincide so that
the movement was one of circumnutation this seedling was then taken
back to the hothouse and after five days was inspected at 10 pm
when the cotyledons were found hanging so nearly vertically down that
they might justly be said to have been asleep on the following morning
they had resumed their usual horizontal position
oxalis rosea oxalideaethe hypocotyl was secured to a little stick
and an extremely thin glass filament with two triangles of paper was
attached to one of the cotyledons which was 15 inch in length in
this and the following species the end of the petiole where united to
the blade is developed into a pulvinus the apex of the cotyledon
stood only 5 inches from the vertical glass so that its movement was
not greatly exaggerated as long as it remained nearly horizontal but
in the course of the day it both rose considerably above and fell
beneath a horizontal position and then of course the movement was much
exaggerated
in fig 13 its course is shown from 645 am on june 17th to 740
am on the following morning and we see that during the daytime in
the course of 11 h 15 m it travelled thrice down and twice up after
545 pm it moved rapidly downwards and in an hour or two depended
vertically it thus remained all night asleep this position could not
be represented on the vertical glass nor in the figure here given by
640 am on the following morning 18th both cotyledons had risen
greatly and they continued to rise until 8 am when they stood
almost horizontally their movement was traced during the whole of this
day and until the next morning but a tracing is not given as it was
closely similar to fig 13 excepting that the lines were more zigzag
the cotyledons moved 7 times either upwards or downwards and at about
4 pm the great nocturnal sinking movement commenced
fig 13 oxalis rosea circumnutation of cotyledons the hypocotyl
being secured to a stick illuminated from above figure here given
onehalf of original scale
another seedling was observed in a similar manner during nearly 24 h
but with the difference that the hypocotyl was left free the movement
also was less magnified between 812 am and 5 pm on the 18th the
apex of the cotyledon moved 7 times upwards or downwards fig 14 the
nocturnal sinking movement which is merely a great increase of one of
the diurnal oscillations commenced about 4 pm
oxalis valdivianathis species is interesting as the
cotyledons rise perpendicularly upwards at night so as to come into
close contact instead of sinking vertically downwards as in the case
of o rosea a glass filament was fixed to a cotyledon 17 of an inch
in length and the hypocotyl was left free on the first day the
seedling was placed too far from the vertical glass so that the
tracing was enormously exaggerated and the movement could not be traced
when the cotyledon either rose or sank much but it was clearly seen
that the cotyledons rose thrice and fell twice between 815 am and
415 pm early on the following morning june 19th the apex of a
cotyledon was
placed only 1 78 inch from the vertical glass at 640 am it stood
horizontally it then fell till 835 and then rose altogether in the
course of 12 h it rose thrice and fell thrice as may be seen in fig
15 the great nocturnal rise of the cotyledons usually commences about
4 or 5 pm and on the following morning they are expanded or stand
horizontally at about 630 am in the present instance however the
great nocturnal rise did not commence till 7 pm but this was due to
the hypocotyl having from some unknown cause temporarily bent to the
left side as is shown in the tracing to ascertain positively that the
hypocotyl circumnutated a mark was placed at 815 pm behind the two
now closed and vertical cotyledons and the movement of a glass
filament fixed upright to the top of the hypocotyl was traced until
1040 pm during this time it moved from side to side as well as
backwards and forwards plainly showing circumnutation but the
movement was small in extent therefore fig 15 represents fairly well
the movements of the cotyledons alone with the exception of the one
great afternoon curvature to the left
fig 14 oxalis rosea conjoint circumnutation of the cotyledons and

oxalis corniculata var cupreathe cotyledons rise at night to a
variable degree above the horizon generally about 45 those on some
seedlings between 2 and 5 days old were found to be in continued
movement all day long but the movements were more simple than in the
last two species this may have partly resulted from their not being
sufficiently illuminated whilst being observed as was shown by their
not beginning to rise until very late in the evening
oxalis biophytum sensitivathe cotyledons are highly remarkable from
the amplitude and rapidity of their movements during the day the
angles at which they stood above or beneath the horizon were measured
at short intervals of time and we regret that their course was not
traced during the whole day we will give only a few of the
measurements which were made whilst the seedlings were exposed to a
temperature of 22 to 24 c one cotyledon rose 70 in 11 m
another on a distinct seedling fell 80 in 12 m immediately before
this latter fall the same cotyledon had risen from a vertically
downward to a vertically upward position in 1 h 48 m and had
therefore passed through 180 in under 2 h we have met with no other
instance of a circumnutating movement of such great amplitude as 180
nor of such rapidity of movement as the passage through 80 in 12 m
the cotyledons of this plant sleep at night by rising
vertically and coming into close contact this upward movement differs
from one of the great diurnal oscillations above described only by the
position being permanent during the night and by its periodicity as it
always commences late in the evening
tropaeolum minus  var tom thumb tropaeoleaethe cotyledons are
hypogean or never rise above the ground by removing the soil a buried
epicotyl or plumule was found with its summit arched abruptly
downwards like the arched hypocotyl of the cabbage previously
described a glass filament with a bead at its end was affixed to the
basal half or leg just above the hypogean cotyledons which were again
almost surrounded by loose earth the tracing fig 16 shows the
course of the bead during 11 h after the last dot given in the figure
the bead moved to a great distance and finally off the glass in the
direction indicated by the broken line this great movement due to
increased growth along the concave surface of the arch was caused by
the basal leg bending backwards from the upper part that is in a
direction opposite to the dependent tip in the same manner as occurred
with the hypocotyl of the cabbage another buried and arched epicotyl
was observed in the same manner excepting that the two legs of the
arch were tied together with fine silk for the sake of preventing the
great movement just mentioned it moved however in the evening in the
same direction as before but the line followed was not so straight
during the morning the tied arch moved in an irregularly circular
strongly zigzag course and to a greater distance than in the previous
case as was shown in a tracing magnified 18 times the movements of a
young plant bearing a few leaves and of a mature plant will hereafter
be described

sculus hippocastanum hippocastaneaegerminating seeds were placed
in a tin box kept moist internally with a sloping bank of damp
argillaceous sand on which four smoked glassplates rested inclined
at angles of 70 and 65 with the horizon the tips of the radicles
were placed so as just to touch the upper end of the glassplates and
as they grew downwards they pressed lightly owing to geotropism on
the smoked surfaces and left tracks of their course in the middle
part of each track the glass was swept clean but the margins were much
blurred and irregular copies of two of these tracks all four being
nearly alike were made on tracing paper placed over the glassplates
after they had been varnished and they are as exact as possible
considering the nature of the margins fig 18 they suffice to show
that there was some lateral almost serpentine movement and that the
tips in their downward course pressed with unequal force on the plates
as
the tracks varied in breadth the more perfectly serpentine tracks made
by the radicles of phaseolus multiflorus and vicia faba presently to
be described render it almost certain that the radicles of the
present plant circumnutated
fig 18 sculus hippocastanum outlines of tracks left on inclined
glassplates by tips of radicles in a the plate was inclined at 70
with the horizon and the radicle was 19 inch in length and 23 inch
in diameter at base in b the plate was inclined 65 with the horizon
and the radicle was a trifle larger
phaseolus multiflorus leguminosaefour smoked glassplates were
arranged in the same manner as described under sculus and the tracks
left by the tips of four radicles of the present plant whilst growing
downwards were photographed as transparent objects three of them are
here exactly copied fig 19 their serpentine courses show that the
tips moved regularly from side to side they also pressed alternately
with greater or less force on the plates sometimes rising up and
leaving them altogether for a very short distance but this was better
seen on the original plates than in the copies these radicles
therefore were continually moving in all directionsthat is they
circumnutated the distance between the extreme right and left
positions of the radicle a in its lateral movement was 2 mm as
ascertained by measurement with an eyepiece micrometer
fig 19 phaseolus multiflorus tracks left on inclined smoked
glassplates by tips of radicles in growing downwards a and c plates
inclined at 60 b inclined at 68 with the horizon
vicia faba common bean leguminosaeradiclesome beans were
allowed to germinate on bare sand and after one had protruded its
radicle to a length of 2 of an inch it was turned upside down so
that the radicle which was kept in damp air now stood upright a
filament nearly an inch in length was affixed obliquely near its tip
and the movement of the terminal bead was traced from 830 am to
1030 pm as shown in fig 18 the radicle at first changed its
course twice
abruptly then made a small loop and then a larger zigzag curve during
the night and till 11 am on the following morning the bead moved to
a great distance in a nearly straight line in the direction indicated
by the broken line in the figure this resulted from the tip bending
quickly downwards as it had now become much declined and had thus
gained a position highly favourable for the action of geotropism

tips of radicles in growing downwards plate c was inclined at 63
plates a and d at 71 plate b at 75 and plate e at a few degrees
beneath the horizon
we next experimented on nearly a score of radicles by allowing them to
grow downwards over inclined plates of smoked glass in exactly the
same manner as with sculus and phaseolus some of the plates were
inclined only a few degrees beneath the horizon but most of them
between 60 and 75 in the latter cases the radicles in growing
downwards were deflected only a little from the direction which they
had followed whilst germinating in sawdust and they pressed lightly on
the glassplates fig 21 five of the most distinct tracks are here
copied and they are all slightly sinuous showing circumnutation
moreover a close examination of almost every one of the tracks clearly
showed that the tips in their downward course had alternately pressed
with greater or less force on the plates and had sometimes risen up so
as nearly to leave them for short intervals the distance between the
extreme right and left positions of the radicle a was 07 mm
ascertained in the same manner as in the case of phaseolus
epicotylat the point where the radicle had protruded from a bean laid
on its side a flattened solid lump projected 1 of an inch in the
same horizontal plane with the bean this protuberance consisted of the
convex summit of the arched epicotyl and as it became developed the
two legs of the arch curved themselves laterally upwards owing to
apogeotropism at such a rate that the arch stood highly inclined after
14 h and vertically in 48 h a filament was fixed to the crown of the
protuberance before any arch was visible but the basal half grew so
quickly that on the second morning the end of the filament was bowed
greatly downwards it was therefore removed and fixed lower down the
line traced during these two days extended in the same general
direction and was in parts nearly straight and in others plainly
zigzag thus giving some evidence of circumnutation
as the arched epicotyl in whatever position it may be placed bends
quickly upwards through apogeotropism and as the two legs tend at a
very early age to separate from one another as soon as they are
relieved from the pressure of the surrounding earth it was difficult
to ascertain positively whether the epicotyl whilst remaining arched
circumnutated therefore some rather deeply buried beans were
uncovered and the two legs of the arches were tied together as had
been done with the epicotyl of tropaeolum and the hypocotyl of the
cabbage the movements of the tied arches were traced in the usual
manner on
two occasions during three days but the tracings made under such
unnatural conditions are not worth giving and it need only be said
that the lines were decidedly zigzag and that small loops were
occasionally formed we may therefore conclude that the epicotyl
circumnutates whilst still arched and before it has grown tall enough
to break through the surface of the ground
in order to observe the movements of the epicotyl at a somewhat more
advanced age a filament was fixed near the base of one which was no
longer arched for its upper half now formed a right angle with the
lower half this bean had germinated on bare damp sand and the
epicotyl began to straighten itself much sooner than would have
occurred if it had been properly planted the course pursued during 50
h from 9 am dec 26th to 11 am 28th is here shown fig 22
and we see that the epicotyl circumnutated during the whole time its
basal part grew so much during the 50 h that the filament at the end
of our observations was attached at the height of 4 inch above the
upper surface of the bean instead of close to it if the bean had been
properly planted this part of the epicotyl would still have been
beneath the soil

darkness during 50 hours on a horizontal glass movement of bead of
filament magnified 20 times here reduced to onehalf of original
scale
late in the evening of the 28th some hours after the above
observations were completed the epicotyl had grown much straighter
for the upper part now formed a widely open angle with the lower part
a filament was fixed to the upright basal part higher up than before
close beneath the lowest scalelike process or homologue of a leaf and
its movement was traced
during 38 h fig 23 we here again have plain evidence of continued
circumnutation had the bean been properly planted the part of the
epicotyl to which the filament was attached the movement of which is
here shown would probably have just risen above the surface of the
ground

of three internodes the lower one almost wholly subterranean and the
upper one bearing a short
narrow leaf is shown during 24 h in fig 24 no glass filament was
employed but a mark was placed beneath the apex of the leaf the
actual length of the longer of the two ellipses described by the stem
was about 14 of an inch on the previous day the chief line of
movement was nearly at right angles to that shown in the present
figure and it was more simple

which was left free was rather old and therefore not highly
heliotropic a filament had been fixed to the midrib of one of the
cotyledons and the movement of the whole seedling was traced during
two days the circumnutation of the hypocotyl is quite insignificant
compared with that of the cotyledons these rise up vertically at night
and come into close contact so that they may be said to sleep this
seedling was so old that a very small true leaf had been developed
which at night was completely hidden by the closed cotyledons on sept
24th between 8 am and 5 pm the cotyledons moved five times up and
five times down they therefore described five irregular ellipses in
the course of the 9 h the great nocturnal rise commenced about 430
pm
 1 seeds of this plant which grew near the seaside were sent to us
 by fritz mller from s brazil the seedlings did not flourish or
 flower well with us they were sent to kew and were pronounced not to
 be distinguishable from c tora
fig 25 cassia tora conjoint circumnutation of cotyledons and
hypocotyl traced on vertical glass from 710 am sept 25th to 730
am 26th figure here given reduced to onehalf of original scale
on the following morning sept 25th the movement of the same
cotyledon was again traced in the same manner during 24 h and a copy
of the tracing is here given fig 25 the morning was cold and the
window had been accidentally left open for a short time which must
have chilled the plant and this probably prevented it from moving
quite as freely as on the previous day for it rose only four and sank
only four times during the day one of the oscillations being very
small at 710 am when the first dot was made the cotyledons were
not fully open or awake they continued to open till about 9 am by
which time they had sunk a little beneath the horizon by 930 am
they had risen and then they oscillated up and down but the upward
and downward lines never quite coincided at about 430 pm the great
nocturnal rise commenced at 7 am on the following morning sept
26th they occupied nearly the same level as on the previous morning
as shown in the diagram they then began to open or sink in the usual
manner the diagram leads to the belief that the great periodical daily
rise and fall does not differ essentially excepting in amplitude from
the oscillations during the middle of the day
lotus jacoboeus leguminosaethe cotyledons of this plant after the
few first days of their life rise so as to stand almost though rarely
quite vertically at night they continue to act in this manner for a
long time even after the development of some of the true leaves with
seedlings 3 inches in height and bearing five or six leaves they
rose at night about 45 they continued to act thus for about an
additional fortnight subsequently they remained horizontal at night
though still green
and at last dropped off their rising at night so as to stand almost
vertically appears to depend largely on temperature for when the
seedlings were kept in a cool house though they still continued to
grow the cotyledons did not become vertical at night it is remarkable
that the cotyledons do not generally rise at night to any conspicuous
extent during the first four or five days after germination but the
period was extremely variable with seedlings kept under the same
conditions and many were observed glass filaments with minute
triangles of paper were fixed to the cotyledons 1 mm in breadth of
two seedlings only 24 h old and the hypocotyl was secured to a
stick their movements greatly magnified were traced and they
certainly circumnutated the whole time on a small scale but they did
not exhibit any distinct nocturnal and diurnal movement the
hypocotyls when left free circumnutated over a large space
another and much older seedling bearing a halfdeveloped leaf had its
movements traced in a similar manner during the three first days and
nights of june but seedlings at this age appear to be very sensitive
to a deficiency of light they were observed under a rather dim
skylight at a temperature of between 16 to 17 c and apparently
in consequence of these conditions the great daily movement of the
cotyledons ceased on the third day during the first two days they
began rising in the early afternoon in a nearly straight line until
between 6 and 7 pm when they stood vertically during the latter
part of the night or more probably in the early morning they began to
fall or open so that by 645 am they stood fully expanded and
horizontal they continued to fall slowly for some time and during the
second day described a single small ellipse between 9 am and 2 pm
in addition to the great diurnal movement the course pursued during
the whole 24 h was far less complex than in the foregoing case of
cassia on the third morning they fell very much and then
circumnutated on a small scale round the same spot by 820 pm they
showed no tendency to rise at night nor did the cotyledons of any of
the many other seedlings in the same pot rise and so it was on the
following night of june 5th the pot was then taken back into the
hothouse where it was exposed to the sun and on the succeeding night
all the cotyledons rose again to a high angle but did not stand quite
vertically on each of the above days the line representing the great
nocturnal
rise did not coincide with that of the great diurnal fall so that
narrow ellipses were described as is the usual rule with
circumnutating organs the cotyledons are provided with a pulvinus and
its development will hereafter be described
mimosa pudica leguminosaethe cotyledons rise up vertically at
night so as to close together two seedlings were observed in the
greenhouse temp 16 to 17 c or 63 to 65 f their hypocotyls
were secured to sticks and glass filaments bearing little triangles of
paper were affixed to the cotyledons of both their movements were
traced on a vertical glass during 24 h on november 13th the pot had
stood for some time in the same position and they were chiefly
illuminated through the glassroof the cotyledons of one of these
seedlings moved downward in the morning till 1130 am and then rose
moving rapidly in the evening until they stood vertically so that in
this case there was simply a single great daily fall and rise the
other seedling behaved rather differently for it fell in the morning
until 1130 am and then rose but after 1210 pm again fell and
the great evening rise did not begin until 122 pm on the following
morning this cotyledon had fallen greatly from its vertical position by
815 am two other seedlings one seven and the other eight days old
had been previously observed under unfavourable circumstances for they
had been brought into a room and placed before a northeast window
where the temperature was between only 56 and 57 f they had
moreover to be protected from lateral light and perhaps were not
sufficiently illuminated under these circumstances the cotyledons
moved simply downwards from 7 am till 2 pm after which hour and
during a large part of the night they continued to rise between 7 and
8 am on the following morning they fell again but on this second and
likewise on the third day the movements became irregular and between 3
and 1030 pm they circumnutated to a small extent about the same
spot but they did not rise at night nevertheless on the following
night they rose as usual
cytisus fragrans leguminosaeonly a few observations were made on
this plant the hypocotyl circumnutated to a considerable extent but
in a simple mannernamely for two hours in one direction and then
much more slowly back again in a zigzag course almost parallel to the
first line and beyond the startingpoint it moved in the same
direction all night but next morning began to return the cotyledons
continually
move both up and down and laterally but they do not rise up at night
in a conspicuous manner
lupinus luteus leguminosaeseedlings of this plant were observed
because the cotyledons are so thick about 08 of an inch that it
seemed unlikely that they would move our observations were not very
successful as the seedlings are strongly heliotropic and their
circumnutation could not be accurately observed near a northeast
window although they had been kept during the previous day in the same
position a seedling was then placed in darkness with the hypocotyl
secured to a stick both cotyledons rose a little at first and then
fell during the rest of the day in the evening between 5 and 6 pm
they moved very slowly during the night one continued to fall and the
other rose though only a little the tracing was not much magnified
and as the lines were plainly zigzag the cotyledons must have moved a
little laterally that is they must have circumnutated
the hypocotyl is rather thick about 12 of inch nevertheless it
circumnutated in a complex course though to a small extent the
movement of an old seedling with two true leaves partially developed
was observed in the dark as the movement was magnified about 100 times
it is not trustworthy and is not given but there could be no doubt
that the hypocotyl moved in all directions during the day changing its
course 19 times the extreme actual distance from side to side through
which the upper part of the hypocotyl passed in the course of 14 hours
was only 160 of an inch it sometimes travelled at the rate of 150 of
an inch in an hour
cucurbita ovifera cucurbitaceradicle a seed which had germinated
on damp sand was fixed so that the slightly curved radicle which was
only 07 inch in length stood almost vertically
upwards in which position geotropism would act at first with little
power a filament was attached near to its base and projected at about
an angle of 45 above the horizon the general course followed during
the 11 hours of observation and during the following night is shown in
the accompanying diagram fig 26 and was plainly due to geotropism
but it was also clear that the radicle circumnutated by the next
morning the tip had curved so much downwards that the filament instead
of projecting at 45 above the horizon was nearly horizontal another
germinating seed was turned upside down and covered with damp sand and
a filament was fastened to the radicle so as to project at an angle of
about 50 above the horizon this radicle was 35 of an inch in length
and a little curved the course pursued was mainly governed as in the
last case by geotropism but the line traced during 12 hours and
magnified as before was more strongly zigzag again showing
circumnutation
fig 26 cucurbita ovifera course followed by a radicle in bending
geotropically downwards traced on a horizontal glass between 1125
am and 1025 pm the direction during the night is indicated by the

four radicles were allowed to grow downwards over plates of smoked
glass inclined at 70 to the horizon under the same conditions as in
the cases of sculus phaseolus and vicia facsimiles are here given
fig 27 of two of these tracks and a third short one was almost as
plainly serpentine as that at a it was also manifest by a greater or
less amount of soot having been swept off the glasses that the tips
had
pressed alternately with greater and less force on them there must
therefore have been movement in at least two planes at right angles to
one another these radicles were so delicate that they rarely had the
power to sweep the glasses quite clean one of them had developed some
lateral or secondary rootlets which projected a few degrees beneath
the horizon and it is an important fact that three of them left
distinctly serpentine tracks on the smoked surface showing beyond
doubt that they had circumnutated like the main or primary radicle but
the tracks were so slight that they could not be traced and copied
after the smoked surface had been varnished

hypocotyla seed lying on damp sand was firmly fixed by two crossed
wires and by its own growing radicle the cotyledons were still
enclosed within the seedcoats and the short hypocotyl between the
summit of the radicle and the cotyledons was as yet only slightly
arched a filament 85 of inch in length was attached at an angle of
35 above the horizon to the side of the arch adjoining the cotyledons
this part would ultimately form the upper end of the hypocotyl after
it had grown straight and vertical had the seed been properly planted
the hypocotyl at this stage of growth would have been deeply buried
beneath the surface the course followed by the bead of the filament is
shown in fig 28 the chief lines of movement from left to right in the
figure were parallel to the plane of the two united cotyledons and of
the flattened seed and this movement would aid in dragging them out of
the seedcoats which are held down by a special structure hereafter to
be described the movement at right angles to the above lines was due
to the arched hypocotyl becoming more arched as it increased in height
the foregoing observations apply to the leg of the arch next to the
cotyledons but
the other leg adjoining the radicle likewise circumnutated at an
equally early age
the movement of the same hypocotyl after it had become straight and
vertical but with the cotyledons only partially expanded is shown in
fig 29 the course pursued during 12 h apparently represents four and
a half ellipses or ovals with the longer axis of the first at nearly
right angles to that of the others the longer axes of all were oblique
to a line joining the opposite cotyledons the actual extreme distance
from side to side over which the summit of the tall hypocotyl passed in
the course of 12 h was 28 of an inch the original figure was traced
on a large scale and from the obliquity of the line of view the outer
parts of the diagram are much exaggerated
cotyledonson two occasions the movements of the cotyledons were
traced on a vertical glass and as the ascending and descending lines
did not quite coincide very narrow ellipses were formed they
therefore circumnutated whilst young they rise vertically up at night
but their tips always remain reflexed on the following morning they
sink down again with a seedling kept in complete darkness they moved
in the same manner for they sank from 845 am to 430 pm they
then began to rise and remained close together until 10 pm when they
were last observed at 7 am on the following morning they were as
much expanded as at any hour on the previous day the cotyledons of
another young seedling exposed to the light were fully open for the
first time on a certain day but were found completely closed at 7 am
on the following morning they soon began to expand again and
continued doing so till about 5 pm they then began to rise and by
1030 pm stood vertically and were almost closed at 7 am on the
third morning they were nearly vertical and again expanded during the
day on the fourth morning they were not closed yet they opened a
little in the course of the day and rose a little on the following
night by this time a minute true leaf had become developed another
seedling still older bearing a welldeveloped leaf had a sharp rigid
filament affixed to one of its cotyledons 85 mm in length which
recorded its own movements on a revolving drum with smoked paper the
observations were made in the hothouse where the plant had lived so
that there was no change in temperature or light the record commenced
at 11 am on february 18th and from this hour till 3 pm the
cotyledon fell it then rose rapidly till 9 pm then very gradually
till 3 am february 19th after which hour it sank gradually till 430
pm but the downward movement was interrupted by one slight rise or
oscillation about 130 pm after 430 pm 19th the cotyledon rose
till 1 am in the night of february 20th and then sank very
gradually till 930 am when our observations ceased the amount of
movement was greater on the 18th than on the 19th or on the morning of
the 20th
cucurbita aurantiaan arched hypocotyl was found buried a little
beneath the surface of the soil and in order to prevent it
straightening itself quickly when relieved from the surrounding
pressure of the soil the two legs of the arch were tied together the
seed was then lightly covered with loose damp earth a filament with a
bead at the end was affixed to the basal leg the movements of which
were observed during two days in the usual manner on the first day the
arch moved in a zigzag line towards the side of the basal leg on the
next day by which time the dependent cotyledons had been dragged above
the surface of the soil the tied arch changed its course greatly nine
times in the course of 14 h it swept a large extremely irregular
circular figure returning at night to nearly the same spot whence it
had started early in the morning the line was so strongly zigzag that
it apparently represented five ellipses with their longer axes
pointing in various directions with respect to the periodical
movements of the cotyledons those of several young seedlings formed
together at 4 pm an angle of about 60 and at 10 pm their lower
parts stood vertically and were in contact their tips however as is
usual in the genus were permanently reflexed these cotyledons at 7
am on the following morning were again well expanded
lagenaria vulgaris var miniature bottlegourd cucurbitacea
seedling opened its cotyledons the movements of which were alone
observed slightly on june 27th and closed them at night next day at
noon 28th they included an angle of 53 and at 10 pm they were in
close contact so that each had risen 26 at noon on the 29th they
included an angle of 118 and at 10 pm an angle of 54 so each had
risen 32 on the following day they were still more open and the
nocturnal rise was greater but the angles were not measured two other
seedlings were observed and behaved during three days in a closely
similar manner the cotyledons therefore
open more and more on each succeeding day and rise each night about
30 consequently during the first two nights of their life they stand
vertically and come into contact
fig 30 lagenaria vulgaris circumnutation of a cotyledon 1 inch in
length apex only 4 34 inches from the vertical glass on which its
movements were traced from 735 am july 11th to 95 am on the 14th
figure here given reduced to onethird of original scale
in order to ascertain more accurately the nature of these movements
the hypocotyl of a seedling with its cotyledons well expanded was
secured to a little stick and a filament with triangles of paper was
affixed to one of the cotyledons the observations were made under a
rather dim skylight and the temperature during the whole time was
between 17 to 18 c 63 to 65 f had the temperature been higher
and the light brighter the movements would probably have been greater
on july 11th see fig 30 the cotyledon fell from 735 am till 10
am it then rose rapidly after 4 pm till it stood quite
vertically at 840 pm during the early morning of the next day 12th
it fell and continued to fall till 8 am after which hour it rose
then fell and again rose so that by 1035 pm it stood much higher
than it did in the morning but was not vertical as on the preceding
night during the following early morning and whole day 13th it fell
and circumnutated but had not risen when observed late in the evening
and this was probably due to the deficiency of heat or light or of
both we thus see that the cotyledons became more widely open at noon
on each succeeding day and that they rose considerably each night
though not acquiring a vertical position except during the first two
nights
cucumis dudaim cucurbitacetwo seedlings had opened
their cotyledons for the first time during the dayone to the extent
of 90 and the other rather more they remained in nearly the same
position until 1040 pm but by 7 am on the following morning the
one which had been previously open to the extent of 90 had its
cotyledons vertical and completely shut the other seedling had them
nearly shut later in the morning they opened in the ordinary manner
it appears therefore that the cotyledons of this plant close and open
at somewhat different periods from those of the foregoing species of
the allied genera of cucurbita and lagenaria

kept in hothouse feebly illuminated from above
opuntia basilaris cactea seedling was carefully observed because
considering its appearance and the nature of the mature plant it
seemed very unlikely that either the hypocotyl or cotyledons would
circumnutate to an appreciable extent the cotyledons were well
developed being 9 of an inch in length 22 in breadth and 15 in
thickness the almost cylindrical hypocotyl now bearing a minute
spinous bud on its summit was only 45 of an inch in height and 19
in diameter the tracing fig 31 shows the combined movement of the
hypocotyl and of one of the cotyledons from 445 pm on may 28th to
11 am on the 31st on the 29th a nearly perfect ellipse was
completed on the 30th the hypocotyl moved from some unknown cause in
the same general direction in a zigzag line but between 430 and 10
pm almost completed a second small ellipse the cotyledons move only
a little up and down thus at 1015 pm they stood only 10 higher
than at noon the chief seat of movement therefore at least when the
cotyledons are rather old as in the present case lies in the
hypocotyl the ellipse described on the 29th had its longer axis
directed at nearly right angles to a line joining the two cotyledons
the actual amount of movement of the bead at the end of the
filament was as far as could be ascertained about 14 of an inch

helianthus annuus compositthe upper part of the hypocotyl moved
during the daytime in the course shown in the annexed figure fig
32 as the line runs in various directions crossing itself several
times the movement may be considered as one of circumnutation the
extreme actual distance travelled was at least 1 of an inch the
movements of the cotyledons of two seedlings were observed one facing
a northeast window and the other so feebly illuminated from above us
as to be almost in darkness they continued to sink till about noon
when they began to rise but between 5 and 7 or 8 pm they either sank
a little or moved laterally and then again began to rise at 7 am
on the following morning those on the plant before the northeast
window had opened so little that they stood at an angle of 73 above
the horizon and were not observed any longer those on the seedling
which had been kept in almost complete darkness sank during the whole
day without rising about midday but rose during the night on the
third and fourth days they continued sinking without any alternate
ascending movement and this no doubt was due to the absence of
light
primula sinensis primulaceaea seedling was placed with the two
cotyledons parallel to a northeast window on a day when the light was
nearly uniform and a filament was affixed to one of them from
observations subsequently made on another seedling with the stem
secured to a stick the greater part of the movement shown in the
annexed figure fig 33 must have been that of the hypocotyl though
the cotyledons certainly move up and down to a certain extent both
during the day and night the movements of the same seedling were
traced
on the following day with nearly the same result and there can be no
doubt about the circumnutation of the hypocotyl

cyclamen persicum primulaceaethis plant is generally supposed to
produce only a single cotyledon but dr h gressner2 has shown that
a second one is developed after a long interval of time the hypocotyl
is converted into a globular corm even before the first cotyledon has
broken through the ground with its blade closely enfolded and with its
petiole in the form of an arch like the arched hypocotyl or epicotyl
of any ordinary dicotyledonous plant a glass filament was affixed to a
cotyledon 55 of an inch in height the petiole of which had
straightened itself and stood nearly vertical but with the blade not
as yet fully expanded its movements were traced during 24 h on a
horizontal glass magnified 50 times and in this interval it described
two irregular small circles it therefore circumnutates though on an
extremely small scale

stapelia sarpedon asclepiadeaethis plant when mature resembles a
cactus the flattened hypocotyl is fleshy enlarged in the upper part
and bears two rudimentary cotyledons it breaks through the ground in
an arched form with the rudimentary cotyledons closed or in contact a
filament was affixed almost
vertically to the hypocotyl of a seedling half an inch high and its
movements were traced during 50 h on a horizontal glass fig 34
from some unknown cause it bowed itself to one side and as this was
effected by a zigzag course it probably circumnutated but with hardly
any other seedling observed by us was this movement so obscurely shown
ipoma caerulea vel pharbitis nil convolvulaceaeseedlings of this
plant were observed because it is a twiner the upper internodes of
which circumnutate conspicuously but like other twining plants the
first few internodes which rise above the ground are stiff enough to
support themselves and therefore do not circumnutate in any plainly
recognisable manner3 in this particular instance the fifth internode
including the hypocotyl was the first which plainly circumnutated and
twined round a stick we therefore wished to learn whether
circumnutation could be observed in the hypocotyl if carefully observed
in our usual manner two seedlings were kept in the dark with filaments
fixed to the upper part of their hypocotyls but from circumstances not
worth explaining their movements were traced for only a short time one
moved thrice forwards and twice backwards in nearly opposite
directions in the course of 3 h 15 m and the other twice forwards
and twice backwards in 2 h 22 m the hypocotyl therefore circumnutated
at a remarkably rapid rate it may here be added that a filament was
affixed transversely to the summit of the second internode above the
cotyledons of a little plant 3 inches in height and its movements
were traced on a horizontal glass it circumnutated and the actual
distance travelled from side to side was a quarter of an inch which
was too small an amount to be perceived without the aid of marks
 3 movements and habits of climbing plants p 33 1875
the movements of the cotyledons are interesting from their complexity
and rapidity and in some other respects the hypocotyl 2 inches high
of a vigorous seedling was secured to a stick and a filament with
triangles of paper was affixed to one of the cotyledons the plant was
kept all day in the hothouse and at 420 pm june 20th was placed
under a skylight in the house and observed occasionally during the
evening and night it fell in a slightly zigzag line to a moderate
extent from 420 pm till 1015 pm when looked at shortly after
midnight 1230 pm it had risen a very little and considerably by
345 am when again looked at at 610 am 21st it had fallen
largely a new tracing was now begun see fig 35 and soon
afterwards at 642 am the cotyledon had risen a little during the
forenoon it was observed about every hour but between 1230 and 6 pm
every halfhour if the observations had been made at these short
intervals during the whole day the figure would have been too
intricate to have been copied as it was the cotyledon moved up and
down in the course of 16 h 20 m ie between 610 am and 1030
pm thirteen times

the cotyledons of this seedling sank downwards during both evenings and
the early part of the night but rose during the latter part as this
is an unusual movement the cotyledons of twelve other seedlings were
observed they stood almost or quite horizontally at midday and at 10
pm were all declined at various angles the most usual angle was
between 30 and 35 but three stood at about 50 and one at even 70
beneath the horizon the blades of all these cotyledons had attained
almost their full size viz from 1 to 1 inches in length measured
along their midribs it is a remarkable fact that whilst youngthat is
when less than half an inch in length measured in the same mannerthey
do not sink
downwards in the evening therefore their weight which is considerable
when almost fully developed probably came into play in originally
determining the downward movement the periodicity of this movement is
much influenced by the degree of light to which the seedlings have been
exposed during the day for three kept in an obscure place began to
sink about noon instead of late in the evening and those of another
seedling were almost paralysed by having been similarly kept during two
whole days the cotyledons of several other species of ipoma likewise
sink downwards late in the evening
cerinthe major boragineaethe circumnutation of the hypocotyl of a
young seedling with the cotyledons hardly expanded is shown in the
annexed figure fig 36 which apparently represents four or five
irregular ellipses described in the course of a little over 12 hours
two older seedlings were similarly observed excepting that one of them
was kept in the dark their hypocotyls also circumnutated but in a
more simple manner the cotyledons on a seedling exposed to the light
fell from the early morning until a little after noon and then
continued to rise until 1030 pm or later the cotyledons of this
same seedling acted in the same general manner during the two following
days it had previously been tried in the dark and after being thus
kept for only 1 h 40 m the cotyledons began at 430 pm to sink
instead of continuing to rise till late at night

nolana prostrata nolaneaethe movements were not traced but a pot
with seedlings which had been kept in the dark for an hour was placed
under the microscope with the micrometer eyepiece so adjusted that
each division equalled 1500th of an inch the apex of one of the
cotyledons crossed rather obliquely four divisions in 13 minutes it
was also sinking as shown by getting out of focus the seedlings were
again placed in darkness for another hour and the apex now crossed two
divisions in 6 m 18 s that is at very nearly the same rate as
before after another interval of an hour in darkness it crossed two
divisions in 4 m 15 s therefore at a quicker rate in the afternoon
after a longer interval in the dark the apex was motionless but after
a time it recommenced moving though slowly perhaps the room was too
cold judging from previous cases there can hardly be a doubt that
this seedling was circumnutating
solanum lycopersicum solaneaethe movements of the hypocotyls of two
seedling tomatoes were observed during seven hours and there could be
no doubt that both circumnutated they were illuminated from above but
by an accident a little light entered on one side and in the
accompanying figure fig 37 it may be seen that the hypocotyl moved
to this side the upper one in the figure making small loops and
zigzagging in its course the movements of the cotyledons were also
traced both on vertical and horizontal glasses their angles with the
horizon were likewise measured at various hours they fell from 830
am october 17th to about noon then moved laterally in a zigzag
line and at about 4 pm began to rise they continued to do so until
1030 pm by which hour they stood vertically and were asleep at
what hour of the night or early morning they began to fall was not
ascertained owing to the lateral movement shortly after midday the
descending and ascending lines did not coincide and irregular ellipses
were described during each 24 h the regular periodicity of these
movements is destroyed as we shall hereafter see if the seedlings are
kept in the dark

solanum palinacanthumseveral arched hypocotyls rising nearly 2 of an
inch above the ground but with the cotyledons still buried beneath the
surface were observed and the tracings showed that they
circumnutated moreover in several cases little open circular spaces
or cracks in the argillaceous sand which surrounded the arched
hypocotyls were visible and these appeared to have been made by the
hypocotyls having bent first to one and then to another side whilst
growing upwards in two instances the vertical arches were observed to
move to a considerable distance backwards from the point where the
cotyledons lay buried this movement which has been noticed in some
other cases and which seems to aid in extracting the cotyledons from
the buried seedcoats is due to the commencement of the straightening
of the hypocotyl in order to prevent this latter movement the two
legs of an arch the summit of which was on a level with the surface of
the soil were tied together the earth having been previously removed
to a little depth all round the movement of the arch during 47 hours
under these unnatural circumstances is exhibited in the annexed figure

was affixed obliquely to the crown of the arch was of unusual length
the cotyledons of some seedlings in the hothouse were horizontal about
noon on december 13th and at 10 pm had risen to an angle of 27
above the horizon at 7 am on the following
morning before it was light they had risen to 59 above the horizon
in the afternoon of the same day they were found again horizontal
beta vulgaris chenopodeaethe seedlings are excessively sensitive to
light so that although on the first day they were uncovered only
during two or three minutes at each observation they all moved
steadily towards the side of the room whence the light proceeded and
the tracings consisted only of slightly zigzag lines directed towards
the light on the next day the plants were placed in a completely
darkened room and at each observation were illuminated as much as
possible from vertically above by a small wax taper the annexed figure
fig 39 shows the movement of the hypocotyl during 9 h under these
circumstances a second seedling was similarly observed at the same
time and the tracing had the same peculiar character due to the
hypocotyl often moving and returning in nearly parallel lines the
movement of a third hypocotyl differed greatly

23 times here reduced to onethird of original scale
we endeavoured to trace the movements of the cotyledons and for this
purpose some seedlings were kept in the dark but they moved in an
abnormal manner they continued rising from 845 am to 2 pm then
moved laterally and from 3 to 6 pm descended whereas cotyledons
which have been exposed all the day to the light rise in the evening so
as to stand vertically at night but this statement applies only to
young seedlings for instance six seedlings in the greenhouse had
their cotyledons partially open for the first time on the morning of
november 15th and at 845 pm all were completely closed so that
they might properly be said to be asleep again on the morning of
november 27th the cotyledons of four other seedlings which were
surrounded by a collar of brown paper so that they received light only
from above were open to the extent of 39 at 10 pm they were
completely closed next morning november 28th at 645 am whilst it
was still dark two of them
were partially open and all opened in the course of the morning but at
1020 pm all four not to mention nine others which had been open in
the morning and six others on another occasion were again completely
closed on the morning of the 29th they were open but at night only
one of the four was closed and this only partially the three others
had their cotyledons much more raised than during the day on the night
of the 30th the cotyledons of the four were only slightly raised
ricinus borboniensis euphorbiaceaeseeds were purchased under the
above nameprobably a variety of the common castoroil plant as soon
as an arched hypocotyl had risen clear above the ground a filament was
attached to the upper leg bearing the cotyledons which were still
buried beneath the surface and the movement of the bead was traced on
a horizontal glass during a period of 34 h the lines traced were
strongly zigzag and as the bead twice returned nearly parallel to its
former course in two different directions there could be no doubt that
the arched hypocotyl circumnutated at the close of the 34 h the upper
part began to rise and straighten itself dragging the cotyledons out
of the ground so that the movements of the bead could no longer be
traced on the glass
quercus american sp cupuliferaeacorns of an american oak which
had germinated at kew were planted in a pot in the greenhouse this
transplantation checked their growth but after a time one grew to a
height of five inches measured to the tips of the small partially
unfolded leaves on the summit and now looked vigorous it consisted of
six very thin internodes of unequal lengths considering these
circumstances and the nature of the plant we hardly expected that it
would circumnutate but the annexed figure fig 40 shows that it did
so in a conspicuous manner changing its course many times and
travelling in all directions during the 48 h of observation the
figure seems to represent 5 or 6 irregular ovals or ellipses the
actual amount of movement from side to side excluding one great bend
to the left was about 2 of an inch but this was difficult to
estimate as owing to the rapid growth of the stem the attached
filament was much further from the mark beneath at the close than at
the commencement of the observations it deserves notice that the pot
was placed in a northeast room within a deep box the top of which was
not at first covered up so that the inside facing
the windows was a little more illuminated than the opposite side and
during the first morning the stem travelled to a greater distance in
this direction to the left in the figure than it did afterwards when
the box was completely protected from light

quercus roburobservations were made only on the movements of the
radicles from germinating acorns which were allowed to grow downwards
in the manner previously described over plates of smoked glass
inclined at angles between 65 and 69 to the horizon in four cases
the tracks left were almost straight but the tips had pressed
sometimes with more and sometimes with less force on the glass as
shown by the varying thickness of the tracks and by little bridges of
soot left across them in the fifth case the track was slightly
serpentine that is the tip had moved a little from side to side in
the sixth case fig 41 a it was plainly serpentine and the tip had
pressed almost equably on the glass in its whole course in the seventh
case b the tip had moved both laterally and had pressed
alternately with unequal force on the glass so that it had moved a
little in two planes at right angles to one another in the eighth and
last case c it had moved very little laterally but had alternately
left the glass and come into contact with it again there can be no
doubt that in the last four cases the radicle of the oak circumnutated
whilst growing downwards

corylus avellana corylaceaethe epicotyl breaks through the ground
in an arched form but in the specimen which was first examined the
apex had become decayed and the epicotyl grew to some distance through
the soil in a tortuous almost horizontal direction like a root in
consequence of this injury it had emitted near the hypogean cotyledons
two secondary shoots and it was remarkable that both of these were
arched like the normal epicotyl in ordinary cases the soil was
removed from around one of these arched secondary shoots and a glass
filament was affixed to the basal leg the whole was kept damp beneath
a metalbox with a glass lid and was thus illuminated only from above
owing apparently to the lateral pressure of the earth being removed
the terminal and boweddown part of the shoot began at once to move
upwards so that after 24 h it formed a right angle with the lower
part this lower part to which the filament was attached also
straightened itself and moved a little backwards from the upper part
consequently a long line was traced on the horizontal glass and
this was in parts straight and in parts decidedly zigzag indicating
circumnutation
on the following day the other secondary shoot was observed it was a
little more advanced in age for the upper part instead of depending
vertically downwards stood at an angle of 45 above the horizon the
tip of the shoot projected obliquely 4 of an inch above the ground
but by the close of our observations which lasted 47 h it had grown
chiefly towards its base to a height of 85 of an inch the filament
was fixed transversely to the basal and almost upright half of the
shoot close beneath the lowest scalelike appendage the
circumnutating course pursued is shown in the accompanying figure fig
42 the actual distance traversed from side to side was about 04 of
an inch

pinus pinaster conifera young hypocotyl with the tips of the
cotyledons still enclosed within the seedcoats was at first only 35
of an inch in height but the upper part grew so rapidly that at the
end of our observations it was 6 in height
and by this time the filament was attached some way down the little
stem from some unknown cause the hypocotyl moved far towards the
left but there could be no doubt fig 43 that it circumnutated
another hypocotyl was similarly observed and it likewise moved in a
strongly zigzag line to the same side this lateral movement was not
caused by the attachment of the glass filaments nor by the action of
light for no light was allowed to enter when each observation was
made except from vertically above

the hypocotyl of a seedling was secured to a little stick it bore nine
in appearance distinct cotyledons arranged in a circle the movements
of two nearly opposite ones were observed the tip of one was painted
white with a mark placed below and the figure described fig 44 a
shows that it made an irregular circle in the course of about 8 h
during the night it travelled to a considerable distance in the
direction indicated by the broken line a glass filament was attached
longitudinally to the other cotyledon and this nearly completed fig
44 b an irregular circular figure in about 12 hours during the night
it also moved to a considerable distance in the direction indicated by
the broken line the cotyledons therefore circumnutate independently of
the movement of the hypocotyl although they moved much during the
night they did not approach each other so as to stand more vertically
than during the day

cycas pectinata cycadethe large seeds of this plant in germinating
first protrude a single leaf which breaks through the ground with the
petiole bowed into an arch and with the leaflets involuted a leaf in
this condition which at the close of our observations was 2 inches in
height had its movements traced in a warm greenhouse by means of a
glass filament bearing paper triangles attached across its tip the
tracing fig 45 shows how large complex and rapid were the
circumnutating movements the extreme distance from side to side which
it passed over amounted to between 6 and 7 of an inch

canna warscewiczii cannaceaea seedling with the plumule projecting
one inch above the ground was observed but not under fair conditions
as it was brought out of the hothouse and kept in a room not
sufficiently warm nevertheless the tracing fig 46 shows that it
made two or three incomplete irregular circles or ellipses in the
course of 48 hours the plumule is straight and this was the first
instance observed
by us of the part that first breaks through the ground not being
arched

allium cepa liliaceaethe narrow green leaf which protrudes from
the seed of the common onion as a cotyledon4 breaks through the
ground in the form of an arch in the same manner as the hypocotyl or
epicotyl of a dicotyledonous plant long after the arch has risen above
the surface the apex remains within the seedcoats evidently absorbing
the still abundant contents the summit or crown of the arch when it
first protrudes from the seed and is still buried beneath the ground
is simply rounded but before it reaches the surface it is developed
into a conical protuberance of a white colour owing to the absence of
chlorophyll whilst the adjoining parts are green with the epidermis
apparently rather thicker and tougher than elsewhere we may therefore
conclude that this conical protuberance is a special adaptation for
breaking through the ground5 and answers the same end as the
knifelike white crest on the summit of the straight cotyledon of the
gramine
after a time the apex is drawn out of the empty seedcoats and rises
up forming a right angle or more commonly a still larger angle with
the lower part and occasionally the whole becomes nearly straight the
conical protuberance which originally formed the crown of the arch is
now seated on one side and appears like a joint or knee which from
acquiring chlorophyll becomes green and increases in size in rarely
or never becoming perfectly straight these cotyledons differ
remarkably from the ultimate condition of the arched hypocotyls or
epicotyls of dicotyledons it is also a singular circumstance that
the attenuated extremity of the upper bent portion invariably withers
and dies
 4 this is the expression used by sachs in his textbook of botany
 5 haberlandt has briefly described die
 schutzeinrichtungenkeimpflanze 1877 p 77 this curious
 structure and the purpose which it subserves he states that good
 figures of the cotyledon of the onion have been given by tittmann and
 by sachs in his experimental physiologie p 93
a filament 17 inch in length was affixed nearly upright beneath the
knee to the basal and vertical portion of a cotyledon and its
movements were traced during 14 h in the usual manner the tracing
here given fig 47 indicates circumnutation the movement of the
upper part above the knee of the same cotyledon which projected at
about an angle of 45 above the horizon was observed at the same time
a filament was not affixed to it but a mark was placed beneath the
apex which was almost white from beginning to wither and its
movements were thus traced the figure described resembled pretty
closely that above given and this shows that the chief seat of
movement is in the lower or basal part of the cotyledon

asparagus officinalis asparageaethe tip of a straight plumule or
cotyledon for we do not know which it should be called was found at a
depth of 1 inch beneath the surface and the earth was then removed
all round to the dept of 3 inch a glass filament was affixed
obliquely to it and the movement of the bead magnified 17 times was
traced in darkness during the first 1 h 15 m the plumule moved to
the right and during the next two hours it returned in a roughly
parallel but strongly zigzag course from some unknown cause it had
grown up through the soil in an inclined direction and now through
apogeotropism it moved during nearly 24 h in
the same general direction but in a slightly zigzag manner until it
became upright on the following morning it changed its course
completely there can therefore hardly be a doubt that the plumule
circumnutates whilst buried beneath the ground as much as the
pressure of the surrounding earth will permit the surface of the soil
in the pot was now covered with a thin layer of very fine argillaceous
sand which was kept damp and after the tapering seedlings had grown a
few tenths of an inch in height each was found surrounded by a little
open space or circular crack and this could be accounted for only by
their having circumnutated and thus pushed away the sand on all sides
for there was no vestige of a crack in any other part
in order to prove that there was circumnutation the movements of five
seedlings varying in height from 3 inch to 2 inches were traced
they were placed within a box and illuminated from above but in all
five cases the longer axes of the figures described were directed to
nearly the same point so that more light seemed to have come through
the glass roof of the greenhouse on one side than on any other all
five tracings resembled each other to a certain extent and it will
suffice to give two of them in a fig 48 the seedling was only 45
of an
inch in height and consisted of a single internode bearing a bud on
its summit the apex described between 830 am and 1020 pm ie
during nearly 14 hours a figure which would probably have consisted of
3 ellipses had not the stem been drawn to one side until 1 pm
after which hour it moved backwards on the following morning it was
not far distant from the point whence it had first started the actual
amount of movement of the apex from side to side was very small viz
about 118th of an inch the seedling of which the movements are shown
in fig 48 b was 1 34 inch in height and consisted of three
internodes besides the bud on the summit the figure which was
described during 10 h apparently represents two irregular and unequal
ellipses or circles the actual amount of movement of the apex in the
line not influenced by the light was 11 of an inch and in that thus
influenced 37 of an inch with a seedling 2 inches in height it was
obvious even without the aid of any tracing that the uppermost part
of the stem bent successively to all points of the compass like the
stem of a twining plant a little increase in the power of
circumnutating and in the flexibility of the stem would convert the
common asparagus into a twining plant as has occurred with one species
in this genus namely a scandens

phalaris canariensis graminewith the gramine the part which first
rises above the ground has been called by some authors the pileole and
various views have been expressed on its homological nature it is
considered by some great authorities to be a cotyledon which term we
will use without venturing to express any opinion on the subject6 it
consists in the present case of a slightly flattened reddish sheath
terminating upwards in a sharp white edge it encloses a true green
leaf which protrudes from the sheath through a slitlike orifice
close beneath and at right angles to the sharp edge on the summit the
sheath is not arched when it breaks through the ground
 6 we are indebted to the rev g henslow for an abstract of the
 views which have been held on this subject together with references
the movements of three rather old seedlings about 1 inch in height
shortly before the protrusion of the leaves were first traced they
were illuminated exclusively from above for as will hereafter be
shown they are excessively sensitive to the
action of light and if any enters even temporarily on one side they
merely bend to this side in slightly zigzag lines of the three
tracings one alone fig 49 is here given had the observations been
more frequent during the 12 h two oval figures would have been
described with their longer axes at right angles to one another the
actual amount of movement of the apex from side to side was about 3 of
an inch the figures described by the other two seedlings resembled to
a certain extent the one here given

a seedling which had just broken through the ground and projected only
120th of an inch above the surface was next observed in the same
manner as before it was necessary to clear away the earth all round
the seedling to a little depth in order to place a mark beneath the
apex the figure fig 50 shows that the apex moved to one side but
changed its course ten times in the course of the ten hours of
observation so that there can be no doubt about its circumnutation
the cause of the general movement in one direction could hardly be
attributed to the entrance of lateral light as this was carefully
guarded against and we suppose it was in some manner connected with
the removal of the earth round the little seedling

cotyledon with a mark placed below the apex traced on a horizontal
glass from 1137 am to 930 pm dec 13th movement of apex greatly
magnified here reduced to onefourth of original scale
lastly the soil in the same pot was searched with the aid of a lens
and the white knifelike apex of a seedling was found on an exact level
with that of the surrounding surface the soil was removed all round
the apex to the depth of a quarter of an inch the seed itself
remaining covered the pot protected from lateral light was placed
under the
microscope with a micrometer eyepiece so arranged that each division
equalled 1500th of an inch after an interval of 30 m the apex was
observed and it was seen to cross a little obliquely two divisions of
the micrometer in 9 m 15 s and after a few minutes it crossed the
same space in 8 m 50s the seedling was again observed after an
interval of threequarters of an hour and now the apex crossed rather
obliquely two divisions in 10 m we may therefore conclude that it was
travelling at about the rate of 150th of an inch in 45 minutes we may
also conclude from these and the previous observations that the
seedlings of phalaris in breaking through the surface of the soil
circumnutate as much as the surrounding pressure will permit this fact
accounts as in the case before given of the asparagus for a circular
narrow open space or crack being distinctly visible round several
seedlings which had risen through very fine argillaceous sand kept
uniformly damp
fig 51 zea mays circumnutation of cotyledon traced on horizontal
glass from 830 am feb 4th to 8 am 6th movement of bead
magnified on an average about 25 times
zea mays graminea glass filament was fixed obliquely to the summit
of a cotyledon rising 2 of an inch above the ground but by the third
morning it had grown to exactly thrice this height so that the
distance of the bead from the mark below was greatly increased
consequently the tracing fig 51 was much more magnified on the first
than on the second day the upper part of the cotyledon changed its
course by at least as much as a rectangle six times on each of the two
days the plant was illuminated by an obscure light from vertically
above this was a necessary precaution as on the previous day we had
traced the movements of cotyledons placed in a deep box the inner side
of which was feebly illuminated on one side from a distant northeast
window and at each observation by a wax taper held for a minute or two
on the same side and the result was that the cotyledons travelled all
day long to this side though making in their course some conspicuous
flexures from which fact alone we might have
concluded that they were circumnutating but we thought it advisable to
make the tracing above given
radiclesglass filaments were fixed to two short radicles placed so
as to stand almost upright and whilst bending downwards through
geotropism their courses were strongly zigzag from this latter
circumstance circumnutation might have been inferred had not their
tips become slightly withered after the first 24 h though they were
watered and the air kept very damp nine radicles were next arranged in
the manner formerly described so that in growing downwards they left
tracks on smoked glassplates inclined at various angles between 45
and 80 beneath the horizon almost every one of these tracks offered
evidence in their greater or less breadth in different parts or in
little bridges of soot being left that the apex had come alternately
into more and less close contact with the glass in the accompanying
figure fig 52 we have an accurate copy of one such track in two
instances alone and in these the plates were highly inclined there
was some evidence of slight lateral movement we presume therefore that
the friction of the apex on the smoked surface little as this could
have been sufficed to check the movement from side to side of these
delicate radicles
fig 52 zea mays track left on inclined smoked glassplate by tip of
radicle in growing downwards
avena sativa graminea cotyledon 1 inch in height was placed in
front of a northeast window and the movement of the apex was traced
on a horizontal glass during two days it moved towards the light in a
slightly zigzag line from 9 to 1130 am on october 15th it then
moved a little backwards and zigzagged much until 5 pm after which
hour and curing the night it continued to move towards the window on
the following morning the same movement was continued in a nearly
straight line until 1240 pm when the sky remained until 235
extraordinarily dark from thunderclouds during this interval of 1 h
55 m whilst the light was obscure it was interesting to observe how
circumnutation overcame heliotropism for the apex instead of
continuing to move towards the window in a slightly zigzag line
reversed its course four times making two small narrow ellipses a
diagram of this case will be given in the chapter on heliotropism
a filament was next fixed to a cotyledon only 14 of an inch in height
which was illuminated exclusively from above and as it was kept in a
warm greenhouse it grew rapidly and now there could be no doubt about
its circumnutation for it described a figure of 8 as well as two small
ellipses in 5 hours
nephrodium molle filicesa seedling fern of this species came up by
chance in a flowerpot near its parent the frond as yet only slightly
lobed was only 16 of an inch in length and 2 in breadth and was
supported on a rachis as fine as a hair and 23 of an inch in height a
very thin glass filament which projected for a length of 36 of an
inch was fixed to the end of the frond the movement was so highly
magnified that the figure fig 53 cannot be fully trusted but the
frond was constantly moving in a complex manner and the bead greatly
changed its course eighteen times in the 12 hours of observation
within half an hour it often returned in a line almost parallel to its
former course the greatest amount of movement occurred between 4 and 6
pm the circumnutation of this plant is interesting because the
species in the genus lygodium are well known to circumnutate
conspicuously and to twine round any neighbouring object

changed its course several times as shown in fig 54 whilst observed
during 13 h 15 m and returned at night to a point not far distant
from that whence it had started in the morning there can be no doubt
that this little plant circumnutated

chapter a list is here appended of the families cohorts subclasses
etc to which they belong arranged and numbered according to the
classification adopted by hooker1 any one who will consider this
list will see that the young plants selected for observation fairly
represent the whole vegetable series excepting the lowest cryptogams
and the movements of some of the latter when mature will hereafter be
described as all the seedlings which were observed including
conifers cycads and ferns which belong to the most ancient
types amongst plants were continually circumnutating we may infer
that this kind of movement is common to every seedling species

radiclesin all the germinating seeds observed by us the first change
is the protrusion of the radicle which immediately bends downwards and
endeavours to penetrate the ground in order to effect this it is
almost necessary that the seed should be pressed down so as to offer
some resistance unless indeed the soil is extremely loose for
otherwise the seed is lifted up instead of the radicle penetrating the
surface but seeds often get covered by earth thrown up by burrowing
quadrupeds or scratching birds by the castings of earthworms by
heaps of excrement the decaying branches of trees etc and will thus
be pressed down and they must often fall into cracks when the ground
is dry or into holes even with seeds lying on the bare surface the
first developed roothairs by becoming attached to stones or other
objects on the surface are able to hold down the upper part of the
radicle whilst the tip penetrates the ground sachs has shown2 how
well and closely roothairs adapt themselves by growth to the most
irregular particles in the soil and become firmly attached to them
this attachment seems to be effected by the softening or liquefaction
of the outer surface of the wall of the hair and its subsequent
consolidation as will be on some future occasion more fully described
this intimate union plays an important part according to sachs in the
absorption of water and of the inorganic matter dissolved in it the
mechanical aid afforded by the roothairs in penetrating the ground is
probably only a secondary service

the tip of the radicle as soon as it protrudes from the seedcoats
begins to circumnutate and the whole
growing part continues to do so probably for as long as growth
continues this movement of the radicle has been described in brassica
sculus phaseolus vicia cucurbita quercus and zea the probability
of its occurrence was inferred by sachs3 from radicles placed
vertically upwards being acted on by geotropism which we likewise
found to be the case for if they had remained absolutely
perpendicular the attraction of gravity could not have caused them to
bend to any one side circumnutation was observed in the above
specified cases either by means of extremely fine filaments of glass
affixed to the radicles in the manner previously described or by their
being allowed to grow downwards over inclined smoked glassplates on
which they left their tracks in the latter cases the serpentine course
see figs 19 21 27 41 showed unequivocally that the apex had
continually moved from side to side this lateral movement was small in
extent being in the case of phaseolus at most about 1 mm from a
medial line to both sides but there was also movement in a vertical
plane at right angles to the inclined glassplates this was shown by
the tracks often being alternately a little broader and narrower due
to the radicles having alternately pressed with greater and less force
on the plates occasionally little bridges of soot were left across the
tracks showing that the apex had at these spots been lifted up this
latter fact was especially apt to occur
xwhen the radicle instead of travelling straight down the glass made a
semicircular bend but fig 52 shows that this may occur when the track
is rectilinear the apex by thus rising was in one instance able to
surmount a bristle cemented across an inclined glassplate but slips
of wood only 140 of an inch in thickness always caused the radicles to
bend rectangularly to one side so that the apex did not rise to this
small height in opposition to geotropism
 3 ueber das wachsthum der wurzeln arbeiten des bot instituts in
 wrzburg heft iii 1873 p 460 this memoir besides its intrinsic
 and great interest deserves to be studied as a model of careful
 investigation and we shall have occasion to refer to it repeatedly
 dr frank had previously remarked beitrge zur pflanzenphysiologie
 1868 p 81 on the fact of radicles placed vertically upwards being
 acted on by geotropism and he explained it by the supposition that
 their growth was not equal on all sides
in those cases in which radicles with attached filaments were placed so
as to stand up almost vertically they curved downwards through the
action of geotropism circumnutating at the same time and their
courses were consequently zigzag sometimes however they made great
circular sweeps the lines being likewise zigzag
radicles closely surrounded by earth even when this is thoroughly
soaked and softened may perhaps be quite prevented from
circumnutating yet we should remember that the circumnutating
sheathlike cotyledons of phalaris the hypocotyls of solanum and the
epicotyls of asparagus formed round themselves little circular cracks
or furrows in a superficial layer of damp argillaceous sand they were
also able as well as the hypocotyls of brassica to form straight
furrows in damp sand whilst circumnutating and bending towards a
lateral light in a future chapter it will be shown that the rocking or
circumnutating movement of the flowerheads of trifolium subterraneum
aids them in burying themselves it is therefore probable that the
circumnutation of the tip of the radicle aids it slightly in
penetrating the ground and it may be observed in several of the
previously given diagrams that the movement is more strongly
pronounced in radicles when they first
protrude from the seed than at a rather later period but whether this
is an accidental or an adaptive coincidence we do not pretend to
decide nevertheless when young radicles of phaseolus multiflorus
were fixed vertically close over damp sand in the expectation that as
soon as they reached it they would form circular furrows this did not
occura fact which may be accounted for as we believe by the furrow
being filled up as soon as formed by the rapid increase of thickness in
the apex of the radicle whether or not a radicle when surrounded by
softened earth is aided in forming a passage for itself by
circumnutating this movement can hardly fail to be of high importance
by guiding the radicle along a line of least resistance as will be
seen in the next chapter when we treat of the sensibility of the tip to
contact if however a radicle in its downward growth breaks obliquely
into any crevice or a hole left by a decayed root or one made by the
larva of an insect and more especially by worms the circumnutating
movement of the tip will materially aid it in following such open
passage and we have observed that roots commonly run down the old
burrows of worms4
 4 see also prof hensens statements zeitschrift fr wissen
 zool b xxviii p 354 1877 to the same effect he goes so far as
 to believe that roots are able to penetrate the ground to a great
 depth only by means of the burrows made by worms
when a radicle is placed in a horizontal or inclined position the
terminal growing part as is well known bends down towards the centre
of the earth and sachs5 has shown that whilst thus bending the
growth of the lower surface is greatly retarded whilst that
of the upper surface continues at the normal rate or may be even
somewhat increased he has further shown by attaching a thread running
over a pulley to a horizontal radicle of large size namely that of
the common bean that it was able to pull up a weight of only one
gramme or 154 grains we may therefore conclude that geotropism does
not give a radicle force sufficient to penetrate the ground but merely
tells it if such an expression may be used which course to pursue
before we knew of sachs more precise observations we covered a flat
surface of damp sand with the thinnest tinfoil which we could procure
02 to 03 mm or 00012 to 00079 of an inch in thickness and
placed a radicle close above in such a position that it grew almost
perpendicularly downwards when the apex came into contact with the
polished level surface it turned at right angles and glided over it
without leaving any impression yet the tinfoil was so flexible that
a little stick of soft wood pointed to the same degree as the end of
the radicle and gently loaded with a weight of only a quarter of an
ounce 120 grains plainly indented the tinfoil

 p 397 for the length of the growing part and p 451 on the force of
 geotropism
radicles are able to penetrate the ground by the force due to their
longitudinal and transverse growth the seeds themselves being held
down by the weight of the superincumbent soil in the case of the bean
the apex protected by the rootcap is sharp and the growing part
from 8 to 10 mm in length is much more rigid as sachs has proved
than the part immediately above which has ceased to increase in
length we endeavoured to ascertain the downward pressure of the
growing part by placing germinating beans between two small metal
plates the upper one of which was loaded with a known weight and the
radicle was then allowed to grow into a narrow hole in wood 2 or 3
tenths of an inch in depth and closed at the bottom the wood was so
cut that the short space of radicle between the mouth of the hole and
the bean could not bend laterally on three sides but it was impossible
to protect the fourth side close to the bean consequently as long as
the radicle continued to increase in length and remained straight the
weighted bean would be lifted up after the tip had reached the bottom
of the shallow hole beans thus arranged surrounded by damp sand
lifted up a quarter of a pound in 24 h after the tip of the radicle
had entered the hole with a greater weight the radicles themselves
always became bent on the one unguarded side but this probably would
not have occurred if they had been closely surrounded on all sides by
compact earth there was however a possible but not probable source
of error in these trials for it was not ascertained whether the beans
themselves go on swelling for several days after they have germinated
and after having been treated in the manner in which ours had been
namely being first left for 24 h in water then allowed to germinate
in very damp air afterwards placed over the hole and almost surrounded
by damp sand in a closed box
fig 55 outline of piece of stick reduced to onehalf natural size
with a hole through which the radicle of a bean grew thickness of

we succeeded better in ascertaining the force exerted transversely by
these radicles two were so placed as to penetrate small holes made in
little sticks one of which was cut into the shape here exactly copied
fig 55 the short end of the stick beyond the hole was purposely
split but not the opposite
end as the wood was highly elastic the split or fissure closed
immediately after being made after six days the stick and bean were
dug out of the damp sand and the radicle was found to be much enlarged
above and beneath the hole the fissure which was at first quite
closed was now open to a width of 4 mm as soon as the radicle was
extracted it immediately closed to a width of 2 mm the stick was then
suspended horizontally by a fine wire passing through the hole lately
filled by the radicle and a little saucer was suspended beneath to
receive the weights and it required 8 lbs 8 ozs to open the fissure
to the width of 4 mmthat is the width before the root was extracted
but the part of the radicle only 1 of an inch in length which was
embedded in the hole probably exerted a greater transverse strain even
than 8 lbs 8 ozs for it had split the solid wood for a length of
rather more than a quarter of an inch exactly 275 inch and this
fissure is shown in fig 55 a second stick was tried in the same
manner with almost exactly the same result
fig 56 wooden pincers kept closed by a spiral brass spring with a
hole 14 inch in diameter and 6 inch in depth bored through the
narrow closed part through which a radicle of a bean was allowed to
grow temp 5060 f
we then followed a better plan holes were bored near the narrow end of
two wooden clips or pincers fig 56 kept closed by brass spiral
springs two radicles in damp sand were allowed to grow through these
holes the
pincers rested on glassplates to lessen the friction from the sand
the holes were a little larger viz14 inch and considerably deeper
viz6 inch than in the trials with the sticks so that a greater
length of a rather thicker radicle exerted a transverse strain after
13 days they were taken up the distance of two dots see the figure
on the longer ends of the pincers was now carefully measured the
radicles were then extracted from the holes and the pincers of course
closed they were then suspended horizontally in the same manner as
were the bits of sticks and a weight of 1500 grams or 3 pounds 4
ounces was necessary with one of the pincers to open them to the same
extent as had been effected by the transverse growth of the radicle as
soon as this radicle had slightly opened the pincers it had grown into
a flattened form and had escaped a little beyond the hole its diameter
in one direction being 42 mm and at rightangles 35 mm if this
escape and flattening could have been prevented the radicle would
probably have exerted a greater strain than the 3 pounds 4 ounces with
the other pincers the radicle escaped still further out of the hole
and the weight required to open them to the same extent as had been
effected by the radicle was only 600 grams
with these facts before us there seems little difficulty in
understanding how a radicle penetrates the ground the apex is pointed
and is protected by the rootcap the terminal growing part is rigid
and increases in length with a force equal as far as our observations
can be trusted to the pressure of at least a quarter of a pound
probably with a much greater force when prevented from bending to any
side by the surrounding earth whilst thus increasing in length it
increases in thickness pushing away the damp
earth on all sides with a force of above 8 pounds in one case of 3
pounds in another case it was impossible to decide whether the actual
apex exerts relatively to its diameter the same transverse strain as
the parts a little higher up but there seems no reason to doubt that
this would be the case the growing part therefore does not act like a
nail when hammered into a board but more like a wedge of wood which
whilst slowly driven into a crevice continually expands at the same
time by the absorption of water and a wedge thus acting will split
even a mass of rock
manner in which hypocotyls epicotyls etc rise up and break through
the groundafter the radicle has penetrated the ground and fixed the
seed the hypocotyls of all the dicotyledonous seedlings observed by
us which lift their cotyledons above the surface break through the
ground in the form of an arch when the cotyledons are hypogean that
is remain buried in the soil the hypocotyl is hardly developed and
the epicotyl or plumule rises in like manner as an arch through the
ground in all or at least in most of such cases the downwardly bent
apex remains for a time enclosed within the seedcoats with corylus
avellena the cotyledons are hypogean and the epicotyl is arched but
in the particular case described in the last chapter its apex had been
injured and it grew laterally through the soil like a root and in
consequence of this it had emitted two secondary shoots which likewise
broke through the ground as arches
cyclamen does not produce any distinct stem and only a single
cotyledon appears at first6 its petiole
breaks through the ground as an arch fig 57 abronia has only a
single fully developed cotyledon but in this case it is the hypocotyl
which first emerges and is arched abronia umbellata however presents
this peculiarity that the enfolded blade of the one developed
cotyledon with the enclosed endosperm whilst still beneath the
surface has its apex upturned and parallel to the descending leg of the
arched hypocotyl but it is dragged out of the ground by the continued
growth of the hypocotyl with the apex pointing downward with cycas
pectinata the cotyledons are hypogean and a true leaf first breaks
through the ground with its petiole forming an arch
 6 this is the conclusion arrived at by dr h gressner bot
 zeitung 1874 p 837 who maintains that what has been considered
 by other botanists as the first true leaf is really the second
 cotyledon which is greatly delayed in its development
fig 57 cyclamen persicum seedling figure enlarged c blade of
cotyledon not yet expanded with arched petiole beginning to
straighten itself h hypocotyl developed into a corm r secondary
radicles
fig 58 acanthus mollis seedling with the hypogean cotyledon on the
near side removed and the radicles cut off a blade of first leaf
beginning to expand with petiole still partially arched b second and
opposite leaf as yet very imperfectly developed c hypogean cotyledon
on the opposite side
in the genus acanthus the cotyledons are likewise hypogean in a
mollis a single leaf first breaks through the ground with its petiole
arched and with the opposite leaf much less developed short
straight of a yellowish colour and with the petiole at first not half
as thick as that of the other the undeveloped leaf is protected by
standing beneath its arched fellow and it is an
instrucive fact that it is not arched as it has not to force for
itself a passage through the ground in the accompanying sketch fig
58 the petiole of the first leaf has already partially straightened
itself and the blade is beginning to unfold the small second leaf
ultimately grows to an equal size with the first but this process is
effected at very different rates in different individuals in one
instance the second leaf did not appear fully above the ground until
six weeks after the first leaf as the leaves in the whole family of
the acanthaceae stand either opposite one another or in whorls and as
these are of equal size the great inequality between the first two
leaves is a singular fact we can see how this inequality of
development and the arching of the petiole could have been gradually
acquired if they were beneficial to the seedlings by favouring their
emergence for with a candelabrum spinosus and latifolius there was
a great variability in the inequality between the two first leaves and
in the arching of their petioles in one seedling of a candelabrum the
first leaf was arched and nine times as long as the second which
latter consisted of a mere little yellowishwhite straight hairy
style in other seedlings the difference in length between the two
leaves was as 3 to 2 or as 4 to 3 or as only 76 to 62 inch in
these latter cases the first and taller leaf was not properly arched
lastly in another seedling there was not the least difference in size
between the two first leaves and both of them had their petioles
straight their laminae were enfolded and pressed against each other
forming a lance or wedge by which means they had broken through the
ground therefore in different individuals of this same species of
acanthus the first pair of leaves breaks through the ground by two
widely different methods and if
either had proved decidedly advantageous or disadvantageous one of
them no doubt would soon have prevailed
asa gray has described7 the peculiar manner of germination of three
widely different plants in which the hypocotyl is hardly at all
developed these were therefore observed by us in relation to our
present subject
 7 botanical textbook 1879 p 22
delphinium nudicaulethe elongated petioles of the two cotyledons are
confluent as are sometimes their blades at the base and they break
through the ground as an arch they thus resemble in a most deceptive
manner a hypocotyl at first they are solid but after a time become
tubular and the basal part beneath the ground is enlarged into a
hollow chamber within which the young leaves are developed without any
prominent plumule externally roothairs are formed on the confluent
petioles either a little above or on a level with the plumule the
first leaf at an early period of its growth and whilst within the
chamber is quite straight but the petiole soon becomes arched and the
swelling of this part and probably of the blade splits open one side
of the chamber and the leaf then emerges the slit was found in one
case to be 32 mm in length and it is seated on the line of
confluence of the two petioles the leaf when it first escapes from the
chamber is buried beneath the ground and now an upper part of the
petiole near the blade becomes arched in the usual manner the second
leaf comes out of the slit either straight or somewhat arched but
afterwards the upper part of the petiolecertainly in some and we
believe in all casesarches itself whilst forcing a passage through
the soil
megarrhiza californicathe cotyledons of this gourd never free
themselves from the seedcoats and are hypogean their petioles are
completely confluent forming a tube which terminates downwards in a
little solid point consisting of a minute radicle and hypocotyl with
the likewise minute plumule enclosed within the base of the tube this
structure was well exhibited in an abnormal specimen in which one of
the two cotyledons failed to produce a petiole whilst the other
produced one consisting of an open semicylinder ending in a sharp
point formed of the parts just described as soon as the confluent
petioles protrude from the seed they bend down as they are strongly
geotropic and penetrate the ground the seed itself retains its
original position either on the surface or buried at some depth as
the case may be if however the point of the confluent petioles meets
with some obstacle in the soil as appears to have occurred with the
seedlings described and figured by asa gray8 the cotyledons are
lifted up above the ground the petioles are clothed with roothairs
like those on a true radicle and they likewise resemble radicles in
becoming brown when immersed in a solution of permanganate of
potassium our seeds were subjected to a high temperature and in the
course of three or four days the petioles penetrated the soil
perpendicularly to a depth of from 2 to 2 inches and not until then
did the true radicle begin to grow in one specimen which was closely
observed the petioles in 7 days after their first protrusion attained
a length of 2 inches and the radicle by this time had also become
well developed the plumule still enclosed within the tube was now
3 inch in length and was quite straight but from having increased in
thickness it had just begun to split open the lower part of the
petioles on one side along the line of their confluence by the
following morning the upper part of the plumule had arched itself into
a right angle and the convex side or elbow had thus been forced out
through the slit here then the arching of the plumule plays the same
part as in the case of the petioles of the delphinium as the plumule
continued to grow the tip became more arched and in the course of six
days it emerged through the 2 inches of superincumbent soil still
retaining its arched form after reaching the surface it straightened
itself in the usual manner in the accompanying figure fig 58 a we

the germination of the seeds in their native californian home proceeds
in a rather different manner as we infer from an interesting letter
from mr rattan sent to us by prof asa gray the petioles protrude
from the seeds soon after the autumnal rains and penetrate the ground
generally in a vertical direction to a depth of from 4 to even 6
inches they were found in this state by mr rattan during the
christmas vacation with the
plumules still enclosed within the tubes and he remarks that if the
plumules had been at once developed and had reached the surface as
occurred with our seeds which were exposed to a high temperature they
would surely have been killed by the frost as it is they lie dormant
at some depth beneath the surface and are thus protected from the
cold and the roothairs on the petioles would supply them with
sufficient moisture we shall hereafter see that many seedlings are
protected from frost but by a widely different process namely by
being drawn beneath the surface by the contraction of their radicles
we may however believe that the extraordinary manner of germination
of megarrhiza has another and secondary advantage the radicle begins
in a few weeks to enlarge into a little tuber which then abounds with
starch and is only slightly bitter it would therefore be very liable
to be devoured by animals were it not protected by being buried whilst
young and tender at a depth of some inches beneath the surface
ultimately it grows to a huge size
ipoma leptophyllain most of the species of this genus the hypocotyl
is well developed and breaks through the ground as an arch but the
seeds of the present species in germinating behave like those of
megarrhiza excepting that the elongated petioles of the cotyledons are
not confluent after they have protruded from the seed they are united
at their lower ends with the undeveloped hypocotyl and undeveloped
radicle which together form a point only about 1 inch in length they
are at first highly geotropic and penetrate the ground to a depth of
rather above half an inch the radicle then begins to grow on four
occasions after the petioles had grown for a short distance vertically
downwards they
were placed in a horizontal position in damp air in the dark and in
the course of 4 hours they again became curved vertically downwards
having passed through 90 in this time but their sensitiveness to
geotropism lasts for only 2 or 3 days and the terminal part alone for
a length of between 2 and 4 inch is thus sensitive although the
petioles of our specimens did not penetrate the ground to a greater
depth than about  inch yet they continued for some time to grow
rapidly and finally attained the great length of about 3 inches the
upper part is apogeotropic and therefore grows vertically upwards
excepting a short portion close to the blades which at an early period
bends downwards and becomes arched and thus breaks through the ground
afterwards this portion straightens itself and the cotyledons then
free themselves from the seedcoats thus we here have in different
parts of the same organ widely different kinds of movement and of
sensitiveness for the basal part is geotropic the upper part
apogeotropic and a portion near the blades temporarily and
spontaneously arches itself the plumule is not developed for some
little time and as it rises between the bases of the parallel and
closely approximate petioles of the cotyledons which in breaking
through the ground have formed an almost open passage it does not
require to be arched and is consequently always straight whether the
plumule remains buried and dormant for a time in its native country
and is thus protected from the cold of winter we do not know the
radicle like that of the megarrhiza grows into a tuberlike mass
which ultimately attains a great size so it is with ipoma pandurata
the germination of which as asa gray informs us resembles that of i
leptophylla
the following case is interesting in connection with
the rootlike nature of the petioles the radicle of a seedling was cut
off as it was completely decayed and the two now separated cotyledons
were planted they emitted roots from their bases and continued green
and healthy for two months the blades of both then withered and on
removing the earth the bases of the petioles instead of the radicle
were found enlarged into little tubers whether these would have had
the power of producing two independent plants in the following summer
we do not know
in quercus virens according to dr engelmann9 both the cotyledons
and their petioles are confluent the latter grow to a length of an
inch or even more and if we understand rightly penetrate the
ground so that they must be geotropic the nutriment within the
cotyledons is then quickly transferred to the hypocotyl or radicle
which thus becomes developed into a fusiform tuber the fact of tubers
being formed by the foregoing three widely distinct plants makes us
believe that their protection from animals at an early age and whilst
tender is one at least of the advantages gained by the remarkable
elongation of the petioles of the cotyledons together with their power
of penetrating the ground like roots under the guidance of geotropism

the following cases may be here given as they bear on our present
subject though not relating to seedlings the flowerstem of the
parasitic lathraea squamaria which is destitute of true leaves breaks
through the ground as an arch10 so does the
flowerstem of the parasitic and leafless monotropa hypopitys with
helleborus niger the flowerstems which rise up independently of the
leaves likewise break through the ground as arches this is also the
case with the greatly elongated flowerstems as well as with the
petioles of epimedium pinnatum so it is with the petioles of
ranunculus ficaria when they have to break through the ground but
when they arise from the summit of the bulb above ground they are from
the first quite straight and this is a fact which deserves notice the
rachis of the bracken fern pteris aquilina and of some probably
many other ferns likewise rises above ground under the form of an
arch no doubt other analogous instances could be found by careful
search in all ordinary cases of bulbs rhizomes
rootstocks etc buried beneath the ground the surface is broken by
a cone formed by the young imbricated leaves the combined growth of
which gives them force sufficient for the purpose
 10 the passage of the flowerstem of the lathraea through the ground
 cannot fail to be greatly facilitated by the extraordinary quantity of
 water secreted at this period of the year by the subterranean
 scalelike leaves not that there is any reason to suppose that the
 secretion is a special adaptation for this purpose it probably
 follows from the great quantity of sap absorbed in the early spring by
 the parasitic roots after a long period without any rain the earth
 had become lightcoloured and very dry but it was darkcoloured and
 damp even in parts quite wet for a distance of at least six inches
 all round each flowerstem the water is secreted by glands described
 by cohn bericht bot sect der schlesischen gesell 1876 p 113
 which line the longitudinal channels running through each scalelike
 leaf a large plant was dug up washed so as to remove the earth left
 for some time to drain and then placed in the evening on a dry
 glassplate covered with a bellglass and by next morning it had
 secreted a large pool of water the plate was wiped dry and in the
 course of the succeeding 7 or 8 hours another little pool was
 secreted and after 16 additional hours several large drops a smaller
 plant was washed and placed in a large jar which was left inclined
 for an hour by which time no more water drained off the jar was then
 placed upright and closed after 23 hours two drachms of water were
 collected from the bottom and a little more after 25 additional
 hours the flowerstems were now cut off for they do not secrete and
 the subterranean part of the plant was found to weigh 1068 grams
 1611 grains and the water secreted during the 48 hours weighed 119
 grams 183 grainsthat is oneninth of the whole weight of the
 plant excluding the flowerstems we should remember that plants in a
 state of nature would probably secrete in 48 hours much more than the
 above large amount for their roots would continue all the time
 absorbing sap from the plant on which they were parasitic
with germinating monocotyledonous seeds of which however we did not
observe a large number the plumules for instance those of asparagus
and canna are straight whilst breaking through the ground with the
gramine the sheathlike cotyledons are likewise straight they
however terminate in a sharp crest which is white and somewhat
indurated and this structure obviously facilitates their emergence
from the soil the first true leaves escape from the sheath through a
slit beneath the chisellike apex and at right angles to it in the
case of the onion allium cepa we again meet with an arch the
leaflike cotyledon being abruptly bowed when it breaks through the
ground with the apex still enclosed within the seedcoats the crown
of the arch as previously described is developed into a white conical
protuberance which we may safely believe to be a special adaptation
for this office
the fact of so many organs of different kindshypocotyls and epicotyls
the petioles of some cotyledons and of some first leaves the
cotyledons of the onion the rachis of some ferns and some
flowerstemsbeing all arched whilst they break through the ground
shows how just are dr haberlandts11 remarks on the importance of
the arch to seedling plants he attributes its chief importance to the
upper young and more tender parts of the hypocotyl
or epicotyl being thus saved from abrasion and pressure whilst
breaking through the ground but we think that some importance may be
attributed to the increased force gained by the hypocotyl epicotyl or
other organ by being at first arched for both legs of the arch
increase in length and both have points of resistance as long as the
tip remains enclosed within the seedcoats and thus the crown of the
arch is pushed up through the earth with twice as much force as that
which a straight hypocotyl etc could exert as soon however as the
upper end has freed itself all the work has to be done by the basal
leg in the case of the epicotyl of the common bean the basal leg the
apex having freed itself from the seedcoats grew upwards with a force
sufficient to lift a thin plate of zinc loaded with 12 ounces two
more ounces were added and the 14 ounces were lifted up to a very
little height and then the epicotyl yielded and bent to one side
 11 die schutzeinrichtungen in der entwickelung der keimpflanze
 1877 we have learned much from this interesting essay though our
 observations lead us to differ on some points from the author
with respect to the primary cause of the arching process we long
thought in the case of many seedlings that this might be attributed to
the manner in which the hypocotyl or epicotyl was packed and curved
within the seedcoats and that the arched shape thus acquired was
merely retained until the parts in question reached the surface of the
ground but it is doubtful whether this is the whole of the truth in
any case for instance with the common bean the epicotyl or plumule
is bowed into an arch whilst breaking through the seedcoats as shown
in fig 59 p 92 the plumule first protrudes as a solid knob e in
a which after twentyfour hours growth is seen e in b to be the
crown of an arch nevertheless with several beans which germinated in
damp air and had otherwise been treated in an unnatural manner little
plumules were developed in the axils of the petioles of both
cotyledons and these were as perfectly arched as the normal plumule
yet they had not been subjected to any confinement or pressure for the
seedcoats were completely ruptured and they grew in the open air
this proves that the plumule has an innate or spontaneous tendency to
arch itself
in some other cases the hypocotyl or epicotyl protrudes from the seed
at first only slightly bowed but the bowing afterwards increases
independently of any constraint the arch is thus made narrow with the
two legs which are sometimes much elongated parallel and close
together and thus it becomes well fitted for breaking through the
ground
with many kinds of plants the radicle whilst still enclosed within
the seed and likewise after its first protrusion lies in a straight
line with the future hypocotyl and with the longitudinal axis of the
cotyledons this is the case with cucurbita ovifera nevertheless in
whatever position the seeds were buried the hypocotyl always came up
arched in one particular direction seeds were planted in friable peat
at a depth of about an inch in a vertical position with the end from
which the radicle protrudes downwards therefore all the parts occupied
the same relative positions which they would ultimately hold after the
seedlings had risen clear above the surface notwithstanding this fact
the hypocotyl arched itself and as the arch grew upwards through the
peat the buried seeds were turned either upside down or were laid
horizontally being afterwards dragged above the ground ultimately the
hypocotyl straightened itself in the usual manner and now after all
these movements the several parts occupied the same position relatively
to one another and to the centre of the earth which they
had done when the seeds were first buried but it may be argued in this
and other such cases that as the hypocotyl grows up through the soil
the seed will almost certainly be tilted to one side and then from the
resistance which it must offer during its further elevation the upper
part of the hypocotyl will be doubled down and thus become arched this
view seems the more probable because with ranunculus ficaria only the
petioles of the leaves which forced a passage through the earth were
arched and not those which arose from the summits of the bulbs above
the ground nevertheless this explanation does not apply to the
cucurbita for when germinating seeds were suspended in damp air in
various positions by pins passing through the cotyledons fixed to the
inside of the lids of jars in which case the hypocotyls were not
subjected to any friction or constraint yet the upper part became
spontaneously arched this fact moreover proves that it is not the
weight of the cotyledons which causes the arching seeds of helianthus
annuus and of two species of ipoma those of i bona nox being for
the genus large and heavy were pinned in the same manner and the
hypocotyls became spontaneously arched the radicles which had been
vertically dependent assumed in consequence a horizontal position in
the case of ipoma leptophylla it is the petioles of the cotyledons
which become arched whilst rising through the ground and this occurred
spontaneously when the seeds were fixed to the lids of jars
it may however be suggested with some degree of probability that the
arching was aboriginally caused by mechanical compulsion owing to the
confinement of the parts in question within the seedcoats or to
friction whilst they were being dragged upwards but
if this is so we must admit from the cases just given that a tendency
in the upper part of the several specified organs to bend downwards and
thus to become arched has now become with many plants firmly
inherited the arching to whatever cause it may be due is the result
of modified circumnutation through increased growth along the convex
side of the part such growth being only temporary for the part always
straightens itself subsequently by increased growth along the concave
side as will hereafter be described
it is a curious fact that the hypocotyls of some plants which are but
little developed and which never raise their cotyledons above the
ground nevertheless inherit a slight tendency to arch themselves
although this movement is not of the least use to them we refer to a
movement observed by sachs in the hypocotyls of the bean and some other
leguminosae and which is shown in the accompanying figure fig 59
copied from his essay12 the hypocotyl and radicle at first grow
perpendicularly downwards as at a and then bend often in the course
of 24 hours into the position shown at b as we shall hereafter often
have to recur to this movement we will for brevity sake call it
sachs curvature at first sight it might be thought that the altered
position of the radicle in b was wholly due to the outgrowth of the
epicotyl e the petiole p serving as a hinge and it is probable
that this is partly the cause but the hypocotyl and upper part of the
radicle themselves become slightly curved
 12 arbeiten des bot instit wrzburg vol i 1873 p 403
the above movement in the bean was repeatedly seen by us but our
observations were made chiefly on phaseolus multiflorus the cotyledons
of which are
likewise hypogean some seedlings with welldeveloped radicles were
first immersed in a solution of permanganate of potassium and judging
from the changes of colour though these were not very clearly
defined the hypocotyl is about 3 inch in length straight thin
black lines of this length were now drawn from the bases of the short
petioles along the hypocotyls of 23 germinating seeds which were
pinned to the lids of jars generally with the hilum downwards and
with their radicles pointing to the centre of the earth after an
interval of from 24 to 48 hours the black lines on the hypocotyls of 16
out of the 23 seedlings became distinctly curved but in very various
degrees namely with radii between 20 and
80 mm on sachs cyclometer in the same relative direction as shown at
b in fig 59 as geotropism will obviously tend to check this
curvature seven seeds were allowed to germinate with proper
precautions for their growth in a klinostat13 by which means
geotropism was eliminated the position of the hypocotyls was observed
during four successive days and they continued to bend towards the
hilum and lower surface of the seed on the fourth day they were
deflected by an average angle of 63 from a line perpendicular to the
lower surface and were therefore considerably more curved than the
hypocotyl and radicle in the bean at b fig 59 though in the same
relative direction

it will we presume be admitted that all leguminous plants with
hypogean cotyledons are descended from forms which once raised their
cotyledons above the ground in the ordinary manner and in doing so it
is certain that their hypocotyls would have been abruptly arched as in
the case of every other dicotyledonous plant this is especially clear
in the case of phaseolus for out of five species the seedlings of
which we observed namely p multiflorus caracalla vulgaris
hernandesii and roxburghii inhabitants of the old and new worlds the
three lastnamed species have welldeveloped hypocotyls which break
through the ground as arches now if we imagine a seedling of the
common bean or of p multiflorus to behave as its progenitors once
did the hypocotyl h fig 59 in whatever position the seed may have
been buried would become so much arched that the upper part would be
doubled down parallel to the lower part and
this is exactly the kind of curvature which actually occurs in these
two plants though to a much less degree therefore we can hardly doubt
that their short hypocotyls have retained by inheritance a tendency to
curve themselves in the same manner as they did at a former period
when this movement was highly important to them for breaking through
the ground though now rendered useless by the cotyledons being
hypogean rudimentary structures are in most cases highly variable and
we might expect that rudimentary or obsolete actions would be equally
so and sachs curvature varies extremely in amount and sometimes
altogether fails this is the sole instance known to us of the
inheritance though in a feeble degree of movements which have become
superfluous from changes which the species has undergone
rudimentary cotyledonsa few remarks on this subject may be here
interpolated it is well known that some dicotyledonous plants produce
only a single cotyledon for instance certain species of ranunculus
corydalis chaerophyllum and we will here endeavour to show that the
loss of one or both cotyledons is apparently due to a store of
nutriment being laid up in some other part as in the hypocotyl or one
of the two cotyledons or one of the secondary radicles
with the orange citrus aurantium the cotyledons are hypogean and one
is larger than the other as may be seen in a fig 60 in b the
inequality is rather greater and the stem has grown between the points
of insertion of the two petioles so that they do not stand opposite to
one another in another case the separation amounted to onefifth of an
inch the smaller cotyledon of one seedling was extremely thin and not
half the length of the larger one so that it was clearly becoming
rudimentary14 in all these seedlings the hypocotyl was enlarged or
swollen

with abronia umbellata one of the cotyledons is quite rudimentary as
may be seen c in fig 61 in this specimen it consisted of a little
green flap 184th inch in length destitute of a petiole and covered
with glands like those on the fully developed cotyledon c at first
it stood opposite to the larger cotyledon but as the petiole of the
latter increased in length and grew in the same line with the hypocotyl
h the rudiment appeared in older seedlings as if seated some way
down the hypocotyl with abronia arenaria there is a similar rudiment
which in one
specimen was only 1100th and in another 160th inch in length it
ultimately appeared as if seated halfway down the hypocotyl in both
these species the hypocotyl is so much enlarged especially at a very
early age that it might almost be called a corm the lower end forms a
heel or projection the use of which will hereafter be described
in cyclamen persicum the hypocotyl even whilst still within the
seed is enlarged into a regular corm15 and only a single cotyledon
is at first developed see former fig 57 with ranunculus ficaria
two cotyledons are never produced and here one of the secondary
radicles is developed at an early age into a socalled bulb16 again
certain species of chaerophyllum and corydalis produce only a single
cotyledon17 in the former the hypocotyl and in the latter the
radicle is enlarged according to irmisch into a bulb

 vauchers account hist phys des plantes deurope tom i 1841
 p 149 of the germination of the seeds of several species of
 corydalis that the bulb or tubercule begins to be formed at an
 extremely early age
in the several foregoing cases one of the cotyledons is delayed in its
development or reduced in size or rendered rudimentary or quite
aborted but in other cases both cotyledons are represented by mere
rudiments with opuntia basilaris this is not the case for both
cotyledons are thick and large and the hypocotyl shows at first no
signs of enlargement but afterwards when the cotyledons have withered
and disarticulated themselves it becomes thickened and from its
tapering form together with its smooth tough brown skin appears
when ultimately drawn down to some depth into the soil like a root on
the other
hand with several other cacte the hypocotyl is from the first much
enlarged and both cotyledons are almost or quite rudimentary thus
with cereus landbeckii two little triangular projections representing
the cotyledons are narrower than the hypocotyl which is pearshaped
with the point downwards in rhipsalis cassytha the cotyledons are
represented by mere points on the enlarged hypocotyl in echinocactus
viridescens the hypocotyl is globular with two little prominences on
its summit in pilocereus houlletii the hypocotyl much swollen in the
upper part is merely notched on the summit and each side of the notch
evidently represents a cotyledon stapelia sarpedon a member of the
very distinct family of the asclepiadeae is fleshy like a cactus and
here again the upper part of the flattened hypocotyl is much thickened
and bears two minute cotyledons which measured internally were only
15 inch in length and in breadth not equal to onefourth of the
diameter of the hypocotyl in its narrow axis yet these minute
cotyledons are probably not quite useless for when the hypocotyl
breaks through the ground in the form of an arch they are closed or
pressed against one another and thus protect the plumule they
afterwards open
from the several cases now given which refer to widely distinct
plants we may infer that there is some close connection between the
reduced size of one or both cotyledons and the formation by the
enlargement of the hypocotyl or of the radicle of a socalled bulb
but it may be asked did the cotyledons first tend to abort or did a
bulb first begin to be formed as all dicotyledons naturally produce
two welldeveloped cotyledons whilst the thickness of the hypocotyl
and of the radicle differs much in different plants it seems probable
that these latter organs first became from
some cause thickenedin several instances apparently in correlation
with the fleshy nature of the mature plantso as to contain a store of
nutriment sufficient for the seedling and then that one or both
cotyledons from being superfluous decreased in size it is not
surprising that one cotyledon alone should sometimes have been thus
affected for with certain plants for instance the cabbage the
cotyledons are at first of unequal size owing apparently to the manner
in which they are packed within the seed it does not however follow
from the above connection that whenever a bulb is formed at an early
age one or both cotyledons will necessarily become superfluous and
consequently more or less rudimentary finally these cases offer a
good illustration of the principle of compensation or balancement of
growth or as goethe expresses it in order to spend on one side
nature is forced to economise on the other side
circumnutation and other movements of hypocotyls and epicotyls whilst
still arched and buried beneath the ground and whilst breaking through
itaccording to the position in which a seed may chance to have been
buried the arched hypocotyl or epicotyl will begin to protrude in a
horizontal a more or less inclined or in a vertical plane except
when already standing vertically upwards both legs of the arch are
acted on from the earliest period by apogeotropism consequently they
both bend upwards until the arch becomes vertical during the whole of
this process even before the arch has broken through the ground it is
continually trying to circumnutate to a slight extent as it likewise
does if it happens at first to stand vertically upall which cases
have been observed and described more or less fully in the last
chapter after the arch has grown to some
height upwards the basal part ceases to circumnutate whilst the upper
part continues to do so
that an arched hypocotyl or epicotyl with the two legs fixed in the
ground should be able to circumnutate seemed to us until we had read
prof wiesners observations an inexplicable fact he has shown18 in
the case of certain seedlings whose tips are bent downwards or which
nutate that whilst the posterior side of the upper or dependent
portion grows quickest the anterior and opposite side of the basal
portion of the same internode grows quickest these two portions being
separated by an indifferent zone where the growth is equal on all
sides there may be even more than one indifferent zone in the same
internode and the opposite sides of the parts above and below each
such zone grow quickest this peculiar manner of growth is called by
wiesner undulatory nutation circumnutation depends on one side of an
organ growing quickest probably preceded by increased turgescence
and then another side generally almost the opposite one growing
quickest now if we look at an arch like this upside down u and
suppose the whole of one sidewe will say the whole convex side of both
legsto increase in length this would not cause the arch to bend to
either side but if the outer side or surface of the left leg were to
increase in length the arch would be pushed over to the right and this
would be aided by the inner side of the right leg increasing in length
if afterwards the process were reversed the arch would be pushed over
to the opposite or left side and so on alternatelythat is it would
circumnutate as an arched
hypocotyl with the two legs fixed in the ground certainly
circumnutates and as it consists of a single internode we may
conclude that it grows in the manner described by wiesner it may be
added that the crown of the arch does not grow or grows very slowly
for it does not increase much in breadth whilst the arch itself
increases greatly in height
 18 die undulirende nutation der internodien akad der wissench
 vienna jan 17th 1878 also published separately see p 32
the circumnutating movements of arched hypocotyls and epicotyls can
hardly fail to aid them in breaking through the ground if this be damp
and soft though no doubt their emergence depends mainly on the force
exerted by their longitudinal growth although the arch circumnutates
only to a slight extent and probably with little force yet it is able
to move the soil near the surface though it may not be able to do so
at a moderate depth a pot with seeds of solanum palinacanthum the
tall arched hypocotyls of which had emerged and were growing rather
slowly was covered with fine argillaceous sand kept damp and this at
first closely surrounded the bases of the arches but soon a narrow
open crack was formed round each of them which could be accounted for
only by their having pushed away the sand on all sides for no such
cracks surrounded some little sticks and pins which had been driven
into the sand it has already been stated that the cotyledons of
phalaris and avena the plumules of asparagus and the hypocotyls of
brassica were likewise able to displace the same kind of sand either
whilst simply circumnutating or whilst bending towards a lateral light
as long as an arched hypocotyl or epicotyl remains buried beneath the
ground the two legs cannot separate from one another except to a
slight extent from the yielding of the soil but as soon as the arch
rises above the ground or at an earlier period if
the pressure of the surrounding earth be artificially removed the arch
immediately begins to straighten itself this no doubt is due to growth
along the whole inner surface of both legs of the arch such growth
being checked or prevented as long as the two legs of the arch are
firmly pressed together when the earth is removed all round an arch
and the two legs are tied together at their bases the growth on the
under side of the crown causes it after a time to become much flatter
and broader than naturally occurs the straightening process consists
of a modified form of circumnutation for the lines described during
this process as with the hypocotyl of brassica and the epicotyls of
vicia and corylus were often plainly zigzag and sometimes looped
after hypocotyls or epicotyls have emerged from the ground they
quickly become perfectly straight no trace is left of their former
abrupt curvature excepting in the case of allium cepa in which the
cotyledon rarely becomes quite straight owing to the protuberance
developed on the crown of the arch
the increased growth along the inner surface of the arch which renders
it straight apparently begins in the basal leg or that which is united
to the radicle for this leg as we often observed is first bowed
backwards from the other leg this movement facilitates the withdrawal
of the tip of the epicotyl or of the cotyledons as the case may be
from within the seedcoats and from the ground but the cotyledons
often emerge from the ground still tightly enclosed within the
seedcoats which apparently serve to protect them the seedcoats are
afterwards ruptured and cast off by the swelling of the closely
conjoined cotyledons and not by any movement or their separation from
one another
nevertheless in some few cases especially with the
cucurbitace the seedcoats are ruptured by a curious contrivance
described by m flahault19 a heel or peg is developed on one side of
the summit of the radicle or base of the hypocotyl and this holds down
the lower half of the seedcoats the radicle being fixed into the
ground whilst the continued growth of the arched hypocotyl forced
upwards the upper half and tears asunder the seedcoats at one end
and the cotyledons are then easily withdrawn
 19 bull soc bot de france tom xxiv 1877 p 201
the accompanying figure fig 62 will render this description
intelligible fortyone seeds of cucurbita ovifera were laid on friable
peat and were covered by a layer about an inch in thickness not much
pressed down so that the cotyledons in being dragged up were subjected
to very little friction yet forty of them came up naked the
seedcoats being left buried in the peat this was certainly due to the
action of the peg for when it was prevented from acting the
cotyledons as we shall presently see were lifted up still enclosed in
their seedcoats they were however cast off in the course of two or
three days by the swelling of the cotyledons until this occurs light
is excluded and the cotyledons cannot decompose carbonic acid but no
one probably would have thought that the advantage thus gained by a
little earlier
casting off of the seedcoats would be sufficient to account for the
development of the peg yet according to m flahault seedlings which
have been prevented from casting their seedcoats whilst beneath the
ground are inferior to those which have emerged with their cotyledons
naked and ready to act
fig 62 cucurbita ovifera germinating seed showing the heel or peg
projecting on one side from summit of radicle and holding down lower
tip of seedcoats which have been partially ruptured by the growth of
the arched hypocotyl
the peg is developed with extraordinary rapidity for it could only
just be distinguished in two seedlings having radicles 35 inch in
length but after an interval of only 24 hours was well developed in
both it is formed according to flahault by the enlargement of the
layers of the cortical parenchyma at the base of the hypocotyl if
however we judge by the effects of a solution of permanganate of
potassium it is developed on the exact line of junction between the
hypocotyl and radicle for the flat lower surface as well as the
edges were coloured brown like the radicle whilst the upper slightly
inclined surface was left uncoloured like the hypocotyl excepting
indeed in one out of 33 immersed seedlings in which a large part of the
upper surface was coloured brown secondary roots sometimes spring from
the lower surface of the peg which thus seems in all respects to
partake of the nature of the radicle the peg is always developed on
the side which becomes concave by the arching of the hypocotyl and it
would be of no service if it were formed on any other side it is also
always developed with the flat lower side which as just stated forms
a part of the radicle at right angles to it and in a horizontal
plane this fact was clearly shown by burying some of the thin flat
seeds in the same position as in fig 62 excepting that they were not
laid on their flat broad sides but with one edge downwards nine seeds
were thus planted and the peg was developed in the
same position relatively to the radicle as in the figure
consequently it did not rest on the flat tip of the lower half of the
seedcoats but was inserted like a wedge between the two tips as the
arched hypocotyl grew upwards it tended to draw up the whole seed and
the peg necessarily rubbed against both tips but did not hold either
down the result was that the cotyledons of five out of the nine seeds
thus placed were raised above the ground still enclosed within their
seedcoats four seeds were buried with the end from which the radicle
protrudes pointing vertically downwards and owing to the peg being
always developed in the same position its apex alone came into contact
with and rubbed against the tip on one side the result was that the
cotyledons of all four emerged still within their seedcoats these
cases show us how the peg acts in coordination with the position which
the flat thin broad seeds would almost always occupy when naturally
sown when the tip of the lower half of the seedcoats was cut off
flahault found as we did likewise that the peg could not act since
it had nothing to press on and the cotyledons were raised above the
ground with their seedcoats not cast off lastly nature shows us the
use of the peg for in the one cucurbitaceous genus known to us in
which the cotyledons are hypogean and do not cast their seedcoats
namely megarrhiza there is no vestige of a peg this structure seems
to be present in most of the other genera in the family judging from
flahaults statements we found it welldeveloped and properly acting
in trichosanthes anguina in which we hardly expected to find it as
the cotyledons are somewhat thick and fleshy few cases can be advanced
of a structure better adapted for a special purpose than the present
one
with mimosa pudica the radicle protrudes from a small hole in the sharp
edge of the seed and on its summit where united with the hypocotyl a
transverse ridge is developed at an early age which clearly aids in
splitting the tough seedcoats but it does not aid in casting them
off as this is subsequently effected by the swelling of the cotyledons
after they have been raised above the ground the ridge or heel
therefore acts rather differently from that of cucurbita its lower
surface and the edges were coloured brown by the permanganate of
potassium but not the upper surface it is a singular fact that after
the ridge has done its work and has escaped from the seedcoats it is
developed into a frill all round the summit of the radicle20
 20 our attention was called to this case by a brief statement by
 nobbe in his handbuch der samenkunde 1876 p 215 where a figure
 is also given of a seedling of martynia with a heel or ridge at the
 junction of the radicle and hypocotyl this seed possesses a very hard
 and tough coat and would be likely to require aid in bursting and
 freeing the cotyledons
at the base of the enlarged hypocotyl of abronia umbellata where it
blends into the radicle there is a projection or heel which varies in
shape but its outline is too angular in our former figure fig 61
the radicle first protrudes from a small hole at one end of the tough
leathery winged fruit at this period the upper part of the radicle is
packed within the fruit parallel to the hypocotyl and the single
cotyledon is doubled back parallel to the latter the swelling of these
three parts and especially the rapid development of the thick heel
between the hypocotyl and radicle at the point where they are doubled
ruptures the tough fruit at the upper end and allows the arched
hypocotyl to emerge and this seems to be the function of the heel a
seed was cut out of the fruit and
allowed to germinate in damp air and now a thin flat disc was
developed all round the base of the hypocotyl and grew to an
extraordinary breadth like the frill described under mimosa but
somewhat broader flahault says that with mirabilis a member of the
same family with abronia a heel or collar is developed all round the
base of the hypocotyl but more on one side than on the other and that
it frees the cotyledons from their seedcoats we observed only old
seeds and these were ruptured by the absorption of moisture
independently of any aid from the heel and before the protrusion of the
radicle but it does not follow from our experience that fresh and
tough fruits would behave in a like manner
in concluding this section of the present chapter it may be convenient
to summarise under the form of an illustration the usual movements of
the hypocotyls and epicotyls of seedlings whilst breaking through the
ground and immediately afterwards we may suppose a man to be thrown
down on his hands and knees and at the same time to one side by a
load of hay falling on him he would first endeavour to get his arched
back upright wriggling at the same time in all directions to free
himself a little from the surrounding pressure and this may represent
the combined effects of apogeotropism and circumnutation when a seed
is so buried that the arched hypocotyl or epicotyl protrudes at first
in a horizontal or inclined plane the man still wriggling would then
raise his arched back as high as he could and this may represent the
growth and continued circumnutation of an arched hypocotyl or epicotyl
before it has reached the surface of the ground as soon as the man
felt himself at all free he would raise the upper part of his body
whilst still on
his knees and still wriggling and this may represent the bowing
backwards of the basal leg of the arch which in most cases aids in the
withdrawal of the cotyledons from the buried and ruptured seedcoats
and the subsequent straightening of the whole hypocotyl or
epicotylcircumnutation still continuing
circumnutation of hypocotyls and epicotyls when erectthe hypocotyls
epicotyls and first shoots of the many seedlings observed by us after
they had become straight and erect circumnutated continuously the
diversified figures described by them often during two successive
days have been shown in the woodcuts in the last chapter it should be
recollected that the dots were joined by straight lines so that the
figures are angular but if the observations had been made every few
minutes the lines would have been more or less curvilinear and
irregular ellipses or ovals or perhaps occasionally circles would
have been formed the direction of the longer axes of the ellipses made
during the same day or on successive days generally changed completely
so as to stand at right angles to one another the number of irregular
ellipses or circles made within a given time differs much with
different species thus with brassica oleracea cerinthe major and
cucurbita ovifera about four such figures were completed in 12 h
whereas with solanum palinacanthum and opuntia basilaris scarcely more
than one the figures likewise differ greatly in size thus they were
very small and in some degree doubtful in stapelia and large in
brassica etc the ellipses described by lathyrus nissolia and brassica
were narrow whilst those made by the oak were broad the figures are
often complicated by small loops and zigzag lines
as most seedling plants before the development of true leaves are of
low sometimes very low stature
the extreme amount of movement from side to side of their
circumnutating stems was small that of the hypocotyl of githago
segetum was about 2 of an inch and that of cucurbita ovifera about
28 a very young shoot of lathyrus nissolia moved about 14 that of
an american oak 2 that of the common nut only 04 and a rather tall
shoot of the asparagus 11 of an inch the extreme amount of movement
of the sheathlike cotyledon of phalaris canariensis was 3 of an inch
but it did not move very quickly the tip crossing on one occasion five
divisions of the micrometer that is 1100th of an inch in 22 m 5 s
a seedling nolana prostrata travelled the same distance in 10 m 38 s
seedling cabbages circumnutate much more quickly for the tip of a
cotyledon crossed 1100th of an inch on the micrometer in 3 m 20 s
and this rapid movement accompanied by incessant oscillations was a
wonderful spectacle when beheld under the microscope
the absence of light for at least a day does not interfere in the
least with the circumnutation of the hypocotyls epicotyls or young
shoots of the various dicotyledonous seedlings observed by us nor with
that of the young shoots of some monocotyledons the circumnutation was
indeed much plainer in darkness than in light for if the light was at
all lateral the stem bent towards it in a more or less zigzag course
finally the hypocotyls of many seedlings are drawn during the winter
into the ground or even beneath it so that they disappear this
remarkable process which apparently serves for their protection has
been fully described by de vries21 he shows that
it is effected by the contraction of the parenchymacells of the root
but the hypocotyl itself in some cases contracts greatly and although
at first smooth becomes covered with zigzag ridges as we observed with
githago segetum how much of the drawing down and burying of the
hypocotyl of opuntia basilaris was due to the contraction of this part
and how much to that of the radicle we did not observe

circumnutation of cotyledonswith all the dicotyledonous seedlings
described in the last chapter the cotyledons were in constant
movement chiefly in a vertical plane and commonly once up and once
down in the course of the 24 hours but there were many exceptions to
such simplicity of movement thus the cotyledons of ipoma caerulea
moved 13 times either upwards or downwards in the course of 16 h 18
m those of oxalis rosea moved in the same manner 7 times in the course
of 24 h and those of cassia tora described 5 irregular ellipses in 9
h the cotyledons of some individuals of mimosa pudica and of lotus
jacobus moved only once up and down in 24 h whilst those of others
performed within the same period an additional small oscillation thus
with different species and with different individuals of the same
species there were many gradations from a single diurnal movement to
oscillations as complex as those of the ipoma and cassia the opposite
cotyledons on the same seedling move to a certain extent independently
of one another this was conspicuous with those of oxalis sensitiva in
which one cotyledon might be seen during the daytime rising up until it
stood vertically whilst the opposite one was sinking down
although the movements of cotyledons were generally in nearly the same
vertical plane yet their upward and downward courses never exactly
coincided so that ellipses more or less narrow were described and
the cotyledons may safely be said to have circumnutated nor could this
fact be accounted for by the mere increase in length of the cotyledons
through growth for this by itself would not induce any lateral
movement that there was lateral movement in some instances as with
the cotyledons of the cabbage was evident for these besides moving
up and down changed their course from right to left 12 times in 14 h
15 m with solanum lycopersicum the cotyledons after falling in the
forenoon zigzagged from side to side between 12 and 4 pm and then
commenced rising the cotyledons of lupinus luteus are so thick about
08 of an inch and fleshy22 that they seemed little likely to move
and were therefore observed with especial interest they certainly
moved largely up and down and as the line traced was zigzag there was
some lateral movement the nine cotyledons of a seedling pinus pinaster
plainly circumnutated and the figures described approached more nearly
to irregular circles than to irregular ovals or ellipses the
sheathlike cotyledons of the gramine circumnutate that is move to
all sides as plainly as do the hypocotyls or epicotyls of any
dicotyledonous plants lastly the very young fronds of a fern and of a
selaginella circumnutated
 22 the cotyledons though bright green resemble to a certain extent
 hypogean ones see the interesting discussion by haberlandt die
 schutzeinrichtungen etc 1877 p 95 on the gradations in the
 leguminosae between subarial and subterranean cotyledons
in a large majority of the cases which were carefully observed the
cotyledons sink a little downwards in the forenoon and rise a little
in the afternoon or evening they thus stand rather more highly
inclined during the night than during the midday at which
time they are expanded almost horizontally the circumnutating movement
is thus at least partially periodic no doubt in connection as we
shall hereafter see with the daily alternations of light and darkness
the cotyledons of several plants move up so much at night as to stand
nearly or quite vertically and in this latter case they come into
close contact with one another on the other hand the cotyledons of a
few plants sink almost or quite vertically down at night and in this
latter case they clasp the upper part of the hypocotyl in the same
genus oxalis the cotyledons of certain species stand vertically up and
those of other species vertically down at night in all such cases the
cotyledons may be said to sleep for they act in the same manner as do
the leaves of many sleeping plants this is a movement for a special
purpose and will therefore be considered in a future chapter devoted
to this subject
in order to gain some rude notion of the proportional number of cases
in which the cotyledons of dicotyledonous plants hypogean ones being
of course excluded changed their position in a conspicuous manner at
night one or more species in several genera were cursorily observed
besides those described in the last chapter altogether 153 genera
included in as many families as could be procured were thus observed
by us the cotyledons were looked at in the middle of the day and again
at night and those were noted as sleeping which stood either
vertically or at an angle of at least 60 above or beneath the horizon
of such genera there were 26 and in 21 of them the cotyledons of some
of the species rose and in only 6 sank at night and some of these
latter cases are rather doubtful from causes to be explained in the
chapter on the sleep of cotyledons when
cotyledons which at noon were nearly horizontal stood at night at more
than 20 and less than 60 above the horizon they were recorded as
plainly raised and of such genera there were 38 we did not meet
with any distinct instances of cotyledons periodically sinking only a
few degrees at night although no doubt such occur we have now
accounted for 64 genera out of the 153 and there remain 89 in which
the cotyledons did not change their position at night by as much as
20that is in a conspicuous manner which could easily be detected by
the unaided eye and by memory but it must not be inferred from this
statement that these cotyledons did not move at all for in several
cases a rise of a few degrees was recorded when they were carefully
observed the number 89 might have been a little increased for the
cotyledons remained almost horizontal at night in some species in a few
genera for instance trifolium and geranium which are included
amongst the sleepers such genera might therefore have been added to
the 89 again one species of oxalis generally raised its cotyledons at
night more than 20 and less than 60 above the horizon so that this
genus might have been included under two heads but as several species
in the same genus were not often observed such double entries have
been avoided
in a future chapter it will be shown that the leaves of many plants
which do not sleep rise a few degrees in the evening and during the
early part of the night and it will be convenient to defer until then
the consideration of the periodicity of the movements of cotyledons
on the pulvini or joints of cotyledonswith several of the seedlings
described in this and the last chapter the summit of the petiole is
developed into a pulvinus
cushion or joint as this organ has been variously called like that
with which many leaves are provided it consists of a mass of small
cells usually of a pale colour from the absence of chlorophyll and
with its outline more or less convex as shown in the annexed figure
in the case of oxalis sensitiva twothirds of the petiole and in that
of mimosa pudica apparently the whole of the short subpetioles of the
leaflets have been converted into pulvini with pulvinated leaves ie
those provided with a pulvinus their periodical movements depend
according to pfeffer23 on the cells of the pulvinus alternately
expanding more quickly on one side than on the other whereas the
similar movements of leaves not provided with pulvini depend on their
growth being alternately more rapid on one side than on the other24
as long as a leaf provided with a pulvinus is young and continues to
grow its movement depends on both these causes combined25 and if
the view now held by many botanists be sound namely that growth is
always preceded by the expansion of the growing cells then the
difference between the movements induced by the aid of pulvini and
without such aid is reduced to the expansion of the cells not being
followed by growth in the first case and being so followed in the
second case

dots were made with indian ink along the midrib of both pulvinated
cotyledons of a rather old seedling of oxalis valdiviana their
distances were repeatedly measured with an eyepiece micrometer during
8 34 days and they did not exhibit the least trace of increase it is
therefore almost certain that the pulvinus itself was not then growing
nevertheless during this whole time and for ten days afterwards these
cotyledons rose vertically every night in the case of some seedlings
raised from seeds purchased under the name of oxalis floribunda the
cotyledons continued for a long time to move vertically down at night
and the movement apparently depended exclusively on the pulvini for
their petioles were of nearly the same length in young and in old
seedlings which had produced true leaves with some species of cassia
on the other hand it was obvious without any measurement that the
pulvinated cotyledons continued to increase greatly in length during
some weeks so that here the expansion of the cells of the pulvini and
the growth of the petiole were probably combined in causing their
prolonged periodic movements it was equally evident that the
cotyledons of many plants not provided with pulvini increased rapidly
in length and their periodic movements no doubt were exclusively due
to growth
in accordance with the view that the periodic movements of all
cotyledons depend primarily on the expansion of the cells whether or
not followed by growth we can understand the fact that there is but
little difference in the kind or form of movement in the two sets of
cases this may be seen by
comparing the diagrams given in the last chapter thus the movements of
the cotyledons of brassica oleracea and of ipoma caerulea which are
not provided with pulvini are as complex as those of oxalis and cassia
which are thus provided the pulvinated cotyledons of some individuals
of mimosa pudica and lotus jacobus made only a single oscillation
whilst those of other individuals moved twice up and down in the course
of 24 hours so it was occasionally with the cotyledons of cucurbita
ovifera which are destitute of a pulvinus the movements of pulvinated
cotyledons are generally larger in extent than those without a
pulvinus nevertheless some of the latter moved through an angle of
90 there is however one important difference in the two sets of
cases the nocturnal movements of cotyledons without pulvini for
instance those in the cruciferae cucurbitace githago and beta
never last even for a week to any conspicuous degree pulvinated
cotyledons on the other hand continue to rise at night for a much
longer period even for more than a month as we shall now show but
the period no doubt depends largely on the temperature to which the
seedlings are exposed and their consequent rate of development
oxalis valdivianasome cotyledons which had lately opened and were
horizontal on march 6th at noon stood at night vertically up on the
13th the first true leaf was formed and was embraced at night by the
cotyledons on april 9th after an interval of 35 days six leaves were
developed and yet the cotyledons rose almost vertically at night the
cotyledons of another seedling which when first observed had already
produced a leaf stood vertically at night and continued to do so for
11 additional days after 16 days from the first observation two leaves
were developed and the cotyledons were still greatly raised at night
after 21 days the cotyledons during the day were deflected beneath the
horizon but at night were raised 45
above it after 24 days from the first observation begun after a true
leaf had been developed the cotyledons ceased to rise at night
oxalis biophytum sensitivathe cotyledons of several seedlings 45
days after their first expansion stood nearly vertical at night and
closely embraced either one or two true leaves which by this time had
been formed these seedlings had been kept in a very warm house and
their development had been rapid
oxalis corniculatathe cotyledons do not stand vertical at night but
generally rise to an angle of about 45 above the horizon they
continued thus to act for 23 days after their first expansion by which
time two leaves had been formed even after 29 days they still rose
moderately above their horizontal or downwardly deflected diurnal
position
mimosa pudicathe cotyledons were expanded for the first time on nov
2nd and stood vertical at night on the 15th the first leaf was
formed and at night the cotyledons were vertical on the 28th they
behaved in the same manner on dec 15th that is after 44 days the
cotyledons were still considerably raised at night but those of
another seedling only one day older were raised very little
mimosa albidaa seedling was observed during only 12 days by which
time a leaf had been formed and the cotyledons were then quite
vertical at night
trifolium subterraneuma seedling 8 days old had its cotyledons
horizontal at 1030 am and vertical at 915 pm after an interval of
two months by which time the first and second true leaves had been
developed the cotyledons still performed the same movement they had
now increased greatly in size and had become oval and their petioles
were actually 8 of an inch in length
trifolium strictumafter 17 days the cotyledons still rose at night
but were not afterwards observed
lotus jacoboeusthe cotyledons of some seedlings having welldeveloped
leaves rose to an angle of about 45 at night and even after 3 or 4
whorls of leaves had been formed the cotyledons rose at night
considerably above their diurnal horizontal position

their first expansion and when a leaf had been formed stood during
the day horizontal and at night vertical
cassia sp a large s brazilian tree raised from seeds sent us
by f mllerthe cotyledons after 16 days from their first
expansion had increased greatly in size with two leaves just formed
they stood horizontally during the day and vertically at night but
were not afterwards observed
cassia neglecta likewise a s brazilian speciesa seedling 34 days
after the first expansion of its cotyledons was between 3 and 4 inches
in height with 3 welldeveloped leaves and the cotyledons which
during the day were nearly horizontal at night stood vertical closely
embracing the young stem the cotyledons of another seedling of the
same age 5 inches in height with 4 welldeveloped leaves behaved at
night in exactly the same manner
it is known26 that there is no difference in structure between the
upper and lower halves of the pulvini of leaves sufficient to account
for their upward or downward movements in this respect cotyledons
offer an unusually good opportunity for comparing the structure of the
two halves for the cotyledons of oxalis valdiviana rise vertically at
night whilst those of o rosea sink vertically yet when sections of
their pulvini were made no clear difference could be detected between
the corresponding halves of this organ in the two species which move so
differently with o rosea however there were rather more cells in
the lower than in the upper half but this was likewise the case in one
specimen of o valdiviana the cotyledons of both species 3 mm in
length were examined in the morning whilst extended horizontally and
the upper surface of the pulvinus of o rosea was then wrinkled
transversely showing that it was in a state of compression and this
might have been expected as the cotyledons sink at night with o
valdiviana it was the lower surface which was wrinkled and its
cotyledons rise at night
 26 pfeffer die period bewegungen 1875 p 157
trifolium is a natural genus and the leaves of all
the species seen by us are pulvinated so it is with the cotyledons of
t subterraneum and strictum which stand vertically at night whereas
those of t resupinatum exhibit not a trace of a pulvinus nor of any
nocturnal movement this was ascertained by measuring the distance
between the tips of the cotyledons of four seedlings at midday and at
night in this species however as in the others the firstformed
leaf which is simple or not trifoliate rises up and sleeps like the
terminal leaflet on a mature plant
in another natural genus oxalis the cotyledons of o valdiviana
rosea floribunda articulata and sensitiva are pulvinated and all
move at night into an upward or downward vertical position in these
several species the pulvinus is seated close to the blade of the
cotyledon as is the usual rule with most plants oxalis corniculata
var atropurpurea differs in several respects the cotyledons rise
at night to a very variable amount rarely more than 45 and in one
lot of seedlings purchased under the name of o tropaeoloides but
certainly belonging to the above variety they rose only from 5 to 15
above the horizon the pulvinus is developed imperfectly and to an
extremely variable degree so that apparently it is tending towards
abortion no such case has hitherto we believe been described it is
coloured green from its cells containing chlorophyll and it is seated
nearly in the middle of the petiole instead of at the upper end as in
all the other species the nocturnal movement is effected partly by its
aid and partly by the growth of the upper part of the petiole as in
the case of plants destitute of a pulvinus from these several reasons
and from our having partially traced the development of the pulvinus
from an early age the case seems worth describing in some detail
when the cotyledons of o corniculata were dissected out of a seed from
which they would soon have naturally emerged no trace of a pulvinus
could be detected and all the cells forming the short petiole 7 in
number in a longitudinal row were of nearly equal size in seedlings
one or two days old the pulvinus was so indistinct that we thought at
first that it did not exist but in the middle of the petiole an
illdefined transverse zone of cells could be seen which were much
shorter than those both above and below although of the same breadth
with them they presented the appearance of having been just formed by
the transverse division of longer cells and there can be little doubt
that this had occurred for the cells in the petiole which had been
dissected out of the seed averaged in length 7 divisions of the
micrometer each division equalling 003 mm and were a little longer
than those forming a welldeveloped pulvinus which varied between 4
and 6 of these same divisions after a few additional days the
illdefined zone of cells becomes distinct and although it does not
extend across the whole width of the petiole and although the cells
are of a green colour from containing chlorophyll yet they certainly
constitute a pulvinus which as we shall presently see acts as one
these small cells were arranged in longitudinal rows and varied from 4
to 7 in number and the cells themselves varied in length in different
parts of the
same pulvinus and in different individuals in the accompanying
figures a and b fig 64 we have views of the epidermis27 in the
middle part of the petioles of two seedlings in which the pulvinus was
for this species well developed they offer a striking contrast with
the pulvinus of o rosea see former fig 63 or of o valdiviana
with the seedlings falsely called o tropaeoloides the cotyledons of
which rise very little at night the small cells were still fewer in
number and in parts formed a single transverse row and in other parts
short longitudinal rows of only two or three nevertheless they
sufficed to attract the eye when the whole petiole was viewed as a
transparent object beneath the microscope in these seedlings there
could hardly be a doubt that the pulvinus was becoming rudimentary and
tending to disappear and this accounts for its great variability in
structure and function
 27 longitudinal sections show that the forms of the epidermic cells
 may be taken as a fair representation of those constituting the
 pulvinus
fig 64 oxalis corniculata a and b the almost rudimentary pulvini of
the cotyledons of two rather old seedlings viewed as transparent
objects magnified 50 times
in the following table some measurements of the cells in fairly
welldeveloped pulvini of o corniculata are given

 28 each division equalled 003 mm
we here see that the cells of the pulvinus increase but little in
length with advancing age in comparison with those of the petiole both
above and below it but they continue to grow in width and keep equal
in this respect with the other cells of the petiole the rate of
growth however varies in all parts of the cotyledons as may be
observed in the measurements of the 8days old seedling
the cotyledons of seedlings only a day old rise at night considerably
sometimes as much as afterwards but there was much variation in this
respect as the pulvinus is so indistinct at first the movement
probably does not then depend on the expansion of its cells but on
periodically unequal growth in the petiole by the comparison of
seedlings of different known ages it was evident that the chief seat
of growth of the petiole was in the upper part between the pulvinus and
the blade and this agrees with the fact shown in the measurements
above given that the cells grow to a greater length in the upper than
in the lower part with a seedling 11 days old the nocturnal rise was
found to depend largely on the action of the pulvinus for the petiole
at night was curved upwards at this point and during the day whilst
the petiole was horizontal the lower surface of the pulvinus was
wrinkled with the upper surface tense although the cotyledons at an
advanced age do not rise at night to a higher inclination than whilst
young yet they have to pass through a larger angle in one instance
amounting to 63 to gain their nocturnal position as they are
generally deflected beneath the horizon during the day even with the
11days old seedling the movement did not depend exclusively on the
pulvinus for the blade where joined to the petiole was curved upwards
and this must be attributed to unequal growth therefore the periodic
movements of the cotyledons of o corniculata depend on two distinct
but conjoint actions namely the expansion of the cells of the
pulvinus and on the growth of the upper part of the petiole including
the base of the blade
lotus jacoboeusthe seedlings of this plant present a case parallel to
that of oxalis corniculata in some respects and in others unique as
far as we have seen the cotyledons during the first 4 or 5 days of
their life do not exhibit any plain nocturnal movement but afterwards
they stand vertically or almost vertically up at night there is
however some degree of variability in this respect apparently
dependent on the season and on the degree to which they have been
illuminated during
the day with older seedlings having cotyledons 4 mm in length which
rise considerably at night there is a welldeveloped pulvinus close to
the blade colourless and rather narrower than the rest of the
petiole from which it is abruptly separated it is formed of a mass of
small cells of an average length of 021 mm whereas the cells in the
lower part of the petiole are about 06 mm and those in the blade
from 034 to 04 mm in length the epidermic cells in the lower part
of the petiole project conically and thus differ in shape from those
over the pulvinus
turning now to very young seedlings the cotyledons of which do not
rise at night and are only from 2 to 2 mm in length their petioles
do not exhibit any defined zone of small cells destitute of
chlorophyll and differing in shape exteriorly from the lower ones
nevertheless the cells at the place where a pulvinus will afterwards
be developed are smaller being on an average 015 mm in length than
those in the lower parts of the same petiole which gradually become
larger in proceeding downwards the largest being 030 mm in length
at this early age the cells of the blade are about 027 mm in length
we thus see that the pulvinus is formed by the cells in the uppermost
part of the petiole continuing for only a short time to increase in
length then being arrested in their growth accompanied by the loss of
their chlorophyll grains whilst the cells in the lower part of the
petiole continue for a long time to increase in length those of the
epidermis becoming more conical the singular fact of the cotyledons of
this plant not sleeping at first is therefore due to the pulvinus not
being developed at an early age
we learn from these two cases of lotus and oxalis that the development
of a pulvinus follows from the growth of the cells over a small defined
space of the petiole being almost arrested at an early age with lotus
jacobus the cells at first increase a little in length in oxalis
corniculata they decrease a little owing to selfdivision a mass of
such small cells forming a pulvinus might therefore be either acquired
or lost without any special difficulty by different species in the
same natural genus and we know that
with seedlings of trifolium lotus and oxalis some of the species have
a welldeveloped pulvinus and others have none or one in a
rudimentary condition as the movements caused by the alternate
turgescence of the cells in the two halves of a pulvinus must be
largely determined by the extensibility and subsequent contraction of
their walls we can perhaps understand why a large number of small
cells will be more efficient than a small number of large cells
occupying the same space as a pulvinus is formed by the arrestment of
the growth of its cells movements dependent on their action may be
longcontinued without any increase in length of the part thus
provided and such longcontinued movements seem to be one chief end
gained by the development of a pulvinus longcontinued movement would
be impossible in any part without an inordinate increase in its
length if the turgescence of the cells was always followed by growth
disturbance of the periodic movements of cotyledons by lightthe
hypocotyls and cotyledons of most seedling plants are as is well
known extremely heliotropic but cotyledons besides being
heliotropic are affected paratonically to use sachs expression by
light that is their daily periodic movements are greatly and quickly
disturbed by changes in its intensity or by its absence it is not that
they cease to circumnutate in darkness for in all the many cases
observed by us they continued to do so but the normal order of their
movements in relation to the alternations of day and night is much
disturbed or quite annulled this holds good with species the
cotyledons of which rise or sink so much at night that they may be said
to sleep as well as with others which rise only a little but
different species are affected in very different degrees by changes in
the light
for instance the cotyledons of beta vulgaris solanum lycopersicum
cerinthe major and lupinus luteus when placed in darkness moved down
during the afternoon and early night instead of rising as they would
have done if they had been exposed to the light all the individuals of
the solanum did not behave in the same manner for the cotyledons of
one circumnutated about the same spot between 230 and 10 pm the
cotyledons of a seedling of oxalis corniculata which was feebly
illuminated from above moved downwards during the first morning in the
normal manner but on the second morning it moved upwards the
cotyledons of lotus jacoboeus were not affected by 4 h of complete
darkness but when placed under a double skylight and thus feebly
illuminated they quite lost their periodical movements on the third
morning on the other hand the cotyledons of cucurbita ovifera moved
in the normal manner during a whole day in darkness
seedlings of githago segetum were feebly illuminated from above in the
morning before their cotyledons had expanded and they remained closed
for the next 40 h other seedlings were placed in the dark after their
cotyledons had opened in the morning and these did not begin to close
until about 4 h had elapsed the cotyledons of oxalis rosea sank
vertically downwards after being left for 1 h 20 m in darkness but
those of some other species of oxalis were not affected by several
hours of darkness the cotyledons of several species of cassia are
eminently susceptible to changes in the degree of light to which they
are exposed thus seedlings of an unnamed s brazilian species a large
and beautiful tree were brought out of the hothouse and placed on a
table in the middle of a room with two northeast and one northwest
window so that they were fairly well illuminated though of course
less so than in the hothouse the day being moderately bright and
after 36 m the cotyledons which had been horizontal rose up vertically
and closed together as when asleep after thus remaining on the table
for 1 h 13 m they began to open the cotyledons of young seedlings of
another brazilian species and of c neglecta treated in the same
manner behaved similarly excepting that they did not rise up quite so
much they again became horizontal after about an hour
here is a more interesting case seedlings of cassia tora in two pots
which had stood for some time on the table in the room just described
had their cotyledons horizontal one pot was now exposed for 2 h to
dull sunshine and the cotyledons
remained horizontal it was then brought back to the table and after
50 m the cotyledons had risen 68 above the horizon the other pot was
placed during the same 2 h behind a screen in the room where the
light was very obscure and the cotyledons rose 63 above the horizon
the pot was then replaced on the table and after 50 m the cotyledons
had fallen 33 these two pots with seedlings of the same age stood
close together and were exposed to exactly the same amount of light
yet the cotyledons in the one pot were rising whilst those in the
other pot were at the same time sinking this fact illustrates in a
striking manner that their movements are not governed by the actual
amount but by a change in the intensity or degree of the light a
similar experiment was tried with two sets of seedlings both exposed
to a dull light but different in degree and the result was the same
the movements of the cotyledons of this cassia are however determined
as in many other cases largely by habit or inheritance independently
of light for seedlings which had been moderately illuminated during
the day were kept all night and on the following morning in complete
darkness yet the cotyledons were partially open in the morning and
remained open in the dark for about 6 h the cotyledons in another pot
similarly treated on another occasion were open at 7 am and remained
open in the dark for 4 h 30 m after which time they began to close
yet these same seedlings when brought in the middle of the day from a
moderately bright into only a moderately dull light raised as we have
seen their cotyledons high above the horizon
sensitiveness of cotyledons to contactthis subject does not possess
much interest as it is not known that sensitiveness of this kind is of
any service to seedling plants we have observed cases in only four
genera though we have vainly observed the cotyledons of many others
the genus cassia seems to be preeminent in this respect thus the
cotyledons of c tora when extended horizontally were both lightly
tapped with a very thin twig for 3 m and in the course of a few
minutes they formed together an angle of 90 so that each had risen
45 a single cotyledon of another seedling was tapped in a like manner
for 1 m and it rose 27 in 9 m and after eight additional minutes
it had risen 10 more the opposite cotyledon which was not tapped
hardly moved at all the cotyledons in all these cases became
horizontal again in less than half an hour the pulvinus is the most
sensitive part for on slightly pricking three cotyledons with a
pin in this part they rose up vertically but the blade was found also
to be sensitive care having been taken that the pulvinus was not
touched drops of water placed quietly on these cotyledons produced no
effect but an extremely fine stream of water ejected from a syringe
caused them to move upwards when a pot of seedlings was rapidly hit
with a stick and thus jarred the cotyledons rose slightly when a
minute drop of nitric acid was placed on both pulvini of a seedling
the cotyledons rose so quickly that they could easily be seen to move
and almost immediately afterwards they began to fall but the pulvini
had been killed and became brown
the cotyledons of an unnamed species of cassia a large tree from s
brazil rose 31 in the course of 26 m after the pulvini and the
blades had both been rubbed during 1 m with a twig but when the blade
alone was similarly rubbed the cotyledons rose only 8 the remarkably
long and narrow cotyledons of a third unnamed species from s brazil
did not move when their blades were rubbed on six occasions with a
pointed stick for 30 s or for 1 m but when the pulvinus was rubbed
and slightly pricked with a pin the cotyledons rose in the course of a
few minutes through an angle of 6o several cotyledons of c neglecta
likewise from s brazil rose in from 5 m to 15 m to various angles
between 16v and 34 after being rubbed during 1 m with a twig their
sensitiveness is retained to a somewhat advanced age for the
cotyledons of a little plant of c neglecta 34 days old and bearing
three true leaves rose when lightly pinched between the finger and
thumb some seedlings were exposed for 30 m to a wind temp 50 f
sufficiently strong to keep the cotyledons vibrating but this to our
surprise did not cause any movement the cotyledons of four seedlings
of the indian c glauca were either rubbed with a thin twig for 2 m or
were lightly pinched one rose 34 a second only 6 a third 13 and
a fourth 17 a cotyledon of c florida similarly treated rose 9 one
of c corymbosa rose 7 and one of the very distinct c mimosoides
only 6 those of c pubescens did not appear to be in the least
sensitive nor were those of c nodosa but these latter are rather
thick and fleshy and do not rise at night or go to sleep
smithia sensitivathis plant belongs to a distinct suborder of the
leguminosae from cassia both cotyledons of an oldish seedling with
the first true leaf partially unfolded were rubbed for 1 m with a
fine twig and in 5 m each rose 32 they
remained in this position for 15 m but when looked at again 40 m
after the rubbing each had fallen 14 both cotyledons of another and
younger seedling were lightly rubbed in the same manner for 1 m and
after an interval of 32 m each had risen 30 they were hardly at all
sensitive to a fine jet of water the cotyledons of s pfundii an
african water plant are thick and fleshy they are not sensitive and
do not go to sleep
mimosa pudica and albidathe blades of several cotyledons of both
these plants were rubbed or slightly scratched with a needle during 1
m or 2 m but they did not move in the least when however the
pulvini of six cotyledons of m pudica were thus scratched two of them
were slightly raised in these two cases perhaps the pulvinus was
accidentally pricked for on pricking the pulvinus of another cotyledon
it rose a little it thus appears that the cotyledons of mimosa are
less sensitive than those of the previously mentioned plants29
 29 the sole notice which we have met with on the sensitiveness of
 cotyledons relates to mimosa for aug p de candolle says phys
 vg 1832 tom ii p 865 les cotyledons du m pudica tendent 
 se raprocher par leurs faces suprieures lorsquon les irrite
oxalis sensitivathe blades and pulvini of two cotyledons standing
horizontally were rubbed or rather tickled for 30 s with a fine split
bristle and in 10 m each had risen 48 when looked at again in 35 m
after being rubbed they had risen 4 more after 30 additional minutes
they were again horizontal on hitting a pot rapidly with a stick for 1
m the cotyledons of two seedlings were considerably raised in the
course of 11 m a pot was carried a little distance on a tray and thus
jolted and the cotyledons of four seedlings were all raised in 10 m
after 17 m one had risen 56 a second 45 a third almost 90 and a
fourth 90 after an additional interval of 40 m three of them had
reexpanded to a considerable extent these observations were made
before we were aware at what an extraordinarily rapid rate the
cotyledons circumnutate and are therefore liable to error
nevertheless it is extremely improbable that the cotyledons in the
eight cases given should all have been rising at the time when they
were irritated the cotyledons of oxalis valdiviana and rosea were
rubbed and did not exhibit any sensitiveness
finally there seems to exist some relation between
the habit of cotyledons rising vertically at night or going to sleep
and their sensitiveness especially that of their pulvini to a touch
for all the abovenamed plants sleep at night on the other hand there
are many plants the cotyledons of which sleep and are not in the least
sensitive as the cotyledons of several species of cassia are easily
affected both by slightly diminished light and by contact we thought
that these two kinds of sensitiveness might be connected but this is
not necessarily the case for the cotyledons of oxalis sensitiva did
not rise when kept on one occasion for 1 h and on a second occasion
for nearly 4 h in a dark closet some other cotyledons as those of
githago segetum are much affected by a feeble light but do not move
when scratched by a needle that with the same plant there is some
relation between the sensitiveness of its cotyledons and leaves seems
highly probable for the above described smithia and oxalis have been
called sensitiva owing to their leaves being sensitive and though the
leaves of the several species of cassia are not sensitive to a touch
yet if a branch be shaken or syringed with water they partially assume
their nocturnal dependent position but the relation between the
sensitiveness to contact of the cotyledons and of the leaves of the
same plant is not very close as may be inferred from the cotyledons of
mimosa pudica being only slightly sensitive whilst the leaves are well
known to be so in the highest degree again the leaves of neptunia
oleracea are very sensitive to a touch whilst the cotyledons do not
appear to be so in any degree

in order to see how the radicles of seedlings would pass over stones
roots and other obstacles which they must incessantly encounter in
the soil germinating beans vicia faba were so placed that the tips
of the radicles came into contact almost rectangularly or at a high
angle with underlying plates of glass in other cases the beans were
turned about whilst their radicles were growing so that they descended
nearly vertically on their own smooth almost flat broad upper
surfaces the delicate rootcap when it first touched any directly
opposing surface was a little flattened transversely the flattening
soon became oblique and in a few hours quite disappeared the apex now
pointing at right angles or at nearly right angles to its former
course the radicle then seemed to glide in its new direction over the
surface which had opposed
it pressing on it with very little force how far such abrupt changes
in its former course are aided by the circumnutation of the tip must be
left doubtful thin slips of wood were cemented on more or less steeply
inclined glassplates at right angles to the radicles which were
gliding down them straight lines had been painted along the growing
terminal part of some of these radicles before they met the opposing
slip of wood and the lines became sensibly curved in 2 h after the
apex had come into contact with the slips in one case of a radicle
which was growing rather slowly the rootcap after encountering a
rough slip of wood at right angles was at first slightly flattened
transversely after an interval of 2 h 30 m the flattening became
oblique and after an additional 3 hours the flattening had wholly
disappeared and the apex now pointed at right angles to its former
course it then continued to grow in its new direction alongside the
slip of wood until it came to the end of it round which it bent
rectangularly soon afterwards when coming to the edge of the plate of
glass it was again bent at a large angle and descended
perpendicularly into the damp sand
when as in the above cases radicles encountered an obstacle at right
angles to their course the terminal growing part became curved for a
length of between 3 and 4 of an inch 810 mm measured from the
apex this was well shown by the black lines which had been previously
painted on them the first and most obvious explanation of the
curvature is that it results merely from the mechanical resistance to
the growth of the radicle in its original direction nevertheless this
explanation did not seem to us satisfactory the radicles did not
present the appearance of having been subjected to a sufficient
pressure to account for
their curvature and sachs has shown1 that the growing part is more
rigid than the part immediately above which has ceased to grow so that
the latter might have been expected to yield and become curved as soon
as the apex encountered an unyielding object whereas it was the stiff
growing part which became curved moreover an object which yields with
the greatest ease will deflect a radicle thus as we have seen when
the apex of the radicle of the bean encountered the polished surface of
extremely thin tinfoil laid on soft sand no impression was left on
it yet the radicle became deflected at right angles a second
explanation occurred to us namely that even the gentlest pressure
might check the growth of the apex and in this case growth could
continue only on one side and thus the radicle would assume a
rectangular form but this view leaves wholly unexplained the curvature
of the upper part extending for a length of 810 mm
 1 arbeiten bot inst wrzburg heft iii 1873 p 398
we were therefore led to suspect that the apex was sensitive to
contact and that an effect was transmitted from it to the upper part
of the radicle which was thus excited to bend away from the touching
object as a little loop of fine thread hung on a tendril or on the
petiole of a leafclimbing plant causes it to bend we thought that
any small hard object affixed to the tip of a radicle freely suspended
and growing in damp air might cause it to bend if it were sensitive
and yet would not offer any mechanical resistance to its growth full
details will be given of the experiments which were tried as the
result proved remarkable the fact of the apex of a radicle being
sensitive to contact has never been observed though as we shall
hereafter see sachs discovered that the radicle a little above the
apex is sensitive and bends like a tendril towards the touching
object but when one side of the apex is pressed by any object the
growing part bends away from the object and this seems a beautiful
adaptation for avoiding obstacles in the soil and as we shall see
for following the lines of least resistance many organs when touched
bend in one fixed direction such as the stamens of berberis the lobes
of dionaea etc and many organs such as tendrils whether modified
leaves or flowerpeduncles and some few stems bend towards a touching
object but no case we believe is known of an organ bending away from
a touching object
sensitiveness of the apex of the radicle of vicia fabacommon beans
after being soaked in water for 24 h were pinned with the hilum
downwards in the manner followed by sachs inside the cork lids of
glassvessels which were half filled with water the sides and the
cork were well moistened and light was excluded as soon as the beans
had protruded radicles some to a length of less than a tenth of an
inch and others to a length of several tenths little squares or
oblongs of card were affixed to the short sloping sides of their
conical tips the squares therefore adhered obliquely with reference to
the longitudinal axis of the radicle and this is a very necessary
precaution for if the bits of card accidentally became displaced or
were drawn by the viscid matter employed so as to adhere parallel to
the side of the radicle although only a little way above the conical
apex the radicle did not bend in the peculiar manner which we are here
considering squares of about the 120th of an inch ie about 1
mm or oblong bits of nearly the same size were found to
be the most convenient and effective we employed at first ordinary
thin card such as visiting cards or bits of very thin glass and
various other objects but afterwards sandpaper was chiefly employed
for it was almost as stiff as thin card and the roughened surface
favoured its adhesion at first we generally used very thick gumwater
and this of course under the circumstances never dried in the least
on the contrary it sometimes seemed to absorb vapour so that the bits
of card became separated by a layer of fluid from the tip when there
was no such absorption and the card was not displaced it acted well
and caused the radicle to bend to the opposite side i should state
that thick gumwater by itself induces no action in most cases the
bits of card were touched with an extremely small quantity of a
solution of shellac in spirits of wine which had been left to
evaporate until it was thick it then set hard in a few seconds and
fixed the bits of card well when small drops of the shellac were
placed on the tips without any card they set into hard little beads
and these acted like any other hard object causing the radicles to
bend to the opposite side even extremely minute beads of the shellac
occasionally acted in a slight degree as will hereafter be described
but that it was the cards which chiefly acted in our many trials was
proved by coating one side of the tip with a little bit of goldbeaters
skin which by itself hardly acts and then fixing a bit of card to
the skin with shellac which never came into contact with the radicle
nevertheless the radicle bent away from the attached card in the
ordinary manner
some preliminary trials were made presently to be described by which
the proper temperature was determined and then the following
experiments were made it should be premised that the beans were
always fixed to the corklids for the convenience of manipulation
with the edge from which the radicle and plumule protrudes outwards
and it must be remembered that owing to what we have called sachs
curvature the radicles instead of growing perpendicularly downwards
often bend somewhat even as much as about 45 inwards or under the
suspended bean therefore when a square of card was fixed to the apex
in front the bowing induced by it coincided with sachs curvature and
could be distinguished from it only by being more strongly pronounced
or by occurring more quickly to avoid this source of doubt the
squares
were fixed either behind causing a curvature in direct opposition to
that of sachs or more commonly to the right or left sides for the
sake of brevity we will speak of the bits of card etc as fixed in
front or behind or laterally as the chief curvature of the radicle
is at a little distance from the apex and as the extreme terminal and
basal portions are nearly straight it is possible to estimate in a
rough manner the amount of curvature by an angle and when it is said
that the radicle became deflected at any angle from the perpendicular
this implies that the apex was turned upwards by so many degrees from
the downward direction which it would naturally have followed and to
the side opposite to that to which the card was affixed that the
reader may have a clear idea of the kind of movement excited by the
bits of attached card we append here accurate sketches of three
germinating beans thus treated and selected out of several specimens
to show the gradations in the degrees of curvature we will now give in
detail a series of experiments and afterwards a summary of the
results
fig 65 vicia faba a radicle beginning to bend from the attached
little square of card b bent at a rectangle c bent into a circle or
loop with the tip beginning to bend downwards through the action of
geotropism
in the first 12 trials little squares or oblongs of sanded card 18
mm in length and 15 or only 09 mm in breadth ie 071 of an inch
in length and 059 or 035 of an inch in breadth were fixed with
shellac to the tips of the radicles in the subsequent trials the
little squares were only occasionally measured but were of about the
same size
1 a young radicle 4 mm in length had a card fixed behind after 9
h deflected in the plane in which the bean is flattened 50 from the
perpendicular and from the card and in opposition to sachs curvature
no change next morning 23 h from the time of attachment
2 radicle 55 mm in length card fixed behind after 9 h deflected
in the plane of the bean 20 from the perpendicular and from the card
and in opposition to sachs curvature after 23 h no change
3 radicle 11 mm in length card fixed behind after 9 h deflected
in the plane of the bean 40 from the perpendicular and from the card
and in opposition to sachs curvature the tip of the radicle more
curved than the upper part but in the same plane after 23 h the
extreme tip was slightly bent towards the card the general curvature
of the radicle remaining the same
4 radicle 9 mm long card fixed behind and a little laterally
after 9 h deflected in the plane of the bean only about 7 or 8 from
the perpendicular and from the card in opposition to sachs curvature
there was in addition a slight lateral curvature directed partly from
the card after 23 h no change
5 radicle 8 mm long card affixed almost laterally after 9 h
deflected 30 from the perpendicular in the plane of the bean and in
opposition to sachs curvature also deflected in a plane at right
angles to the above one 20 from the perpendicular after 23 h no
change
6 radicle 9 mm long card affixed in front after 9 h deflected in
the plane of the bean about 40 from the vertical away from the card
and in the direction of sachs curvature here therefore we have no
evidence of the card being the cause of the deflection except that a
radicle never moves spontaneously as far as we have seen as much as
40 in the course of 9 h after 23 h no change
7 radicle 7 mm long card affixed to the back after 9 h the
terminal part of the radicle deflected in the plane of the bean 20
from the vertical away from the card and in opposition to sachs
curvature after 22 h 30 m this part of the radicle had become
straight
8 radicle 12 mm long card affixed almost laterally after 9 h
deflected laterally in a plane at right angles to that of the bean
between 40 and 50 from the vertical and from the card in the plane
of the bean itself the deflection amounted to 8 or 9 from the
vertical and from the card in opposition to sachs curvature after 22
h 30 m the extreme tip had become slightly curved towards the card
9 card fixed laterally after 11 h 30 m no effect the radicle
being still almost vertical
10 card fixed almost laterally after 11 h 30 m deflected 90 from
the vertical and from the card in a plane intermediate between that of
the bean itself and one at right
angles to it radicle consequently partially deflected from sachs
curvature
11 tip of radicle protected with goldbeaters skin with a square of
card of the usual dimensions affixed with shellac after 11 h greatly
deflected in the plane of the bean in the direction of sachs
curvature but to a much greater degree and in less time than ever
occurs spontaneously
12 tip of radicle protected as in last case after 11 h no effect
but after 24 h 40 m radicle clearly deflected from the card this
slow action was probably due to a portion of the goldbeaters skin
having curled round and lightly touched the opposite side of the tip
and thus irritated it
13 a radicle of considerable length had a small square of card fixed
with shellac to its apex laterally after only 7 h 15 m a length of
4 of an inch from the apex measured along the middle was
considerably curved from the side bearing the card
14 case like the last in all respects except that a length of only
25 of an inch of the radicle was thus deflected
15 a small square of card fixed with shellac to the apex of a young
radicle after 9 h 15 m deflected through 90 from the perpendicular
and from the card after 24 h deflection much decreased and after an
additional day reduced to 23 from the perpendicular
16 square of card fixed with shellac behind the apex of a radicle
which from its position having been changed during growth had become
very crooked but the terminal portion was straight and this became
deflected to about 45 from the perpendicular and from the card in
opposition to sachs curvature
17 square of card affixed with shellac after 8 h radicle curved at
right angles from the perpendicular and from the card after 15
additional hours curvature much decreased
18 square of card affixed with shellac after 8 h no effect after
23 h 3 m from time of affixing radicle much curved from the square

both curved at about 45 from the perpendicular and from the cards
23 square of card fixed with shellac to young radicle after
9 h very slightly curved from the card after 24 h tip curved towards
card refixed new square laterally after 9 h distinctly curved from
the card and after 24 h curved at right angles from the perpendicular
and from the card
24 a rather large oblong piece of card fixed with shellac to apex
after 24 h no effect but the card was found not to be touching the
apex a small square was now refixed with shellac after 16 h slight
deflection from the perpendicular and from the card after an
additional day the radicle became almost straight
25 square of card fixed laterally to apex of young radicle after 9
h deflection from the perpendicular considerable after 24 h
deflection reduced refixed a fresh square with shellac after 24 h
deflection about 40 from the perpendicular and from the card
26 a very small square of card fixed with shellac to apex of young
radicle after 9 h the deflection from the perpendicular and from the
card amounted to nearly a right angle after 24 h deflection much
reduced after an additional 24 h radicle almost straight
27 square of card fixed with shellac to apex of young radicle after
9 h deflection from the card and from the perpendicular a right angle
next morning quite straight refixed a square laterally with shellac
after 9 h a little deflection which after 24 h increased to nearly
20 from the perpendicular and from the card
28 square of card fixed with shellac after 9 h some deflection
next morning the card dropped off refixed it with shellac it again
became loose and was refixed and now on the third trial the radicle
was deflected after 14 h at right angles from the card
29 a small square of card was first fixed with thick gumwater to
the apex it produced a slight effect but soon fell off a similar
square was now affixed laterally with shellac after 9 h the radicle
was deflected nearly 45 from the perpendicular and from the card
after 36 additional hours angle of deflection reduced to about 30
30 a very small piece less than 120th of an inch square of thin
tinfoil fixed with shellac to the apex of a young radicle after 24 h
no effect tinfoil removed and a small square of sanded card fixed
with shellac after 9 h deflection at nearly right angles from the
perpendicular and from the card next
morning deflection reduced to about 40 from the perpendicular
31 a splinter of thin glass gummed to apex after 9 h no effect
but it was then found not to be touching the apex of the radicle next
morning a square of card was fixed with shellac to it and after 9 h
radicle greatly deflected from the card after two additional days the
deflection had decreased and was only 35 from the perpendicular
32 small square of sanded card attached with thick gumwater
laterally to the apex of a long straight radicle after 9 h greatly
deflected from the perpendicular and from the card curvature extended
for a length of 22 of an inch from the apex after 3 additional hours
terminal portion deflected at right angles from the perpendicular next
morning the curved portion was 36 in length
33 square of card gummed to apex after 15 h deflected at nearly
90 from the perpendicular and from the card
34 small oblong of sanded card gummed to apex after 15 h deflected
90 from the perpendicular and from the card in the course of the
three following days the terminal portion became much contorted and
ultimately coiled into a helix
35 square of card gummed to apex after 9 h deflected from card
after 24 h from time of attachment greatly deflected obliquely and
partly in opposition to sachs curvature
36 small piece of card rather less than 120th of an inch square
gummed to apex in 9 h considerably deflected from card and in
opposition to sachs curvature after 24 h greatly deflected in the
same direction after an additional day the extreme tip was curved
towards the card
37 square of card gummed to apex in front caused after 8 h 30 m
hardly any effect refixed fresh square laterally after 15 h
deflected almost 90 from the perpendicular and from the card after 2
additional days deflection much reduced
38 square of card gummed to apex after 9 h much deflection which
after 24 h from time of fixing increased to nearly 90 after an
additional day terminal portion was curled into a loop and on the
following day into a helix
39 small oblong piece of card gummed to apex nearly in front but a
little to one side in 9 h slightly deflected in the direction of
sachs curvature but rather obliquely and to side opposite to card
next day more curved in the same direction and after 2 additional days
coiled into a ring
40 square of card gummed to apex after 9 h slightly curved from
card next morning radicle straight and apex had grown beyond the
card refixed another square laterally with shellac in 9 h deflected
laterally but also in the direction of sachs curvature after 2
additional days curvature considerably increased in the same
direction
41 little square of tinfoil fixed with gum to one side of apex of a
young and short radicle after 15 h no effect but tinfoil had become
displaced a little square of card was now gummed to one side of apex
which after 8 h 40 m was slightly deflected in 24 h from the time
of attachment deflected at 90 from the perpendicular and from the
card after 9 additional hours became hooked with the apex pointing to
the zenith in 3 days from the time of attachment the terminal portion
of the radicle formed a ring or circle
42 a little square of thick letterpaper gummed to the apex of a
radicle which after 9 h was deflected from it in 24 h from time
when the paper was affixed the deflection much increased and after 2
additional days it amounted to 50 from the perpendicular and from the
paper
43 a narrow chip of a quill was fixed with shellac to the apex of a
radicle after 9 h no effect after 24 h moderate deflection but now
the quill had ceased to touch the apex removed quill and gummed a
little square of card to apex which after 8 h caused slight
deflection on the fourth day from the first attachment of any object
the extreme tip was curved towards the card
44 a rather long and narrow splinter of extremely thin glass fixed
with shellac to apex it caused in 9 h slight deflection which
disappeared in 24 h the splinter was then found not touching the
apex it was twice refixed with nearly similar results that is it
caused slight deflection which soon disappeared on the fourth day
from the time of first attachment the tip was bent towards the
splinter
from these experiments it is clear that the apex of the radicle of the
bean is sensitive to contact and that it causes the upper part to bend
away from the touching object but before giving a summary of the
results it will be convenient briefly to give a few other
observations bits of very thin glass and little squares
of common card were affixed with thick gumwater to the tips of the
radicles of seven beans as a preliminary trial six of these were
plainly acted on and in two cases the radicles became coiled up into
complete loops one radicle was curved into a semicircle in so short a
period as 6 h 10 m the seventh radicle which was not affected was
apparently sickly as it became brown on the following day so that it
formed no real exception some of these trials were made in the early
spring during cold weather in a sittingroom and others in a
greenhouse but the temperature was not recorded these six striking
cases almost convinced us that the apex was sensitive but of course we
determined to make many more trials as we had noticed that the
radicles grew much more quickly when subjected to considerable heat
and as we imagined that heat would increase their sensitiveness
vessels with germinating beans suspended in damp air were placed on a
chimneypiece where they were subjected during the greater part of the
day to a temperature of between 69 and 72 f some however were
placed in the hothouse where the temperature was rather higher above
two dozen beans were thus tried and when a square of glass or card did
not act it was removed and a fresh one affixed this being often done
thrice to the same radicle therefore between five and six dozen trials
were altogether made but there was moderately distinct deflection from
the perpendicular and from the attached object in only one radicle out
of this large number of cases in five other cases there was very
slight and doubtful deflection we were astonished at this result and
concluded that we had made some inexplicable mistake in the first six
experiments but before finally relinquishing the subject we resolved
to make one
other trial for it occurred to us that sensitiveness is easily affected
by external conditions and that radicles growing naturally in the
earth in the early spring would not be subjected to a temperature
nearly so high as 70 f we therefore allowed the radicles of 12 beans
to grow at a temperature of between 55 and 60 f the result was that
in every one of these cases included in the abovedescribed
experiments the radicle was deflected in the course of a few hours
from the attached object all the above recorded successful trials and
some others presently to be given were made in a sittingroom at the
temperatures just specified it therefore appears that a temperature of
about or rather above 70 f destroys the sensitiveness of the
radicles either directly or indirectly through abnormally accelerated
growth and this curious fact probably explains why sachs who
expressly states that his beans were kept at a high temperature failed
to detect the sensitiveness of the apex of the radicle
but other causes interfere with this sensibility eighteen radicles
were tried with little squares of sanded card some affixed with
shellac and some with gumwater during the few last days of 1878 and
few first days of the next year they were kept in a room at the proper
temperature during the day but were probably too cold at night as
there was a hard frost at the time the radicles looked healthy but
grew very slowly the result was that only 6 out of the 18 were
deflected from the attached cards and this only to a slight degree and
at a very slow rate these radicles therefore presented a striking
contrast with the 44 above described on march 6th and 7th when the
temperature of the room varied between 53 and 59 f eleven
germinating beans were tried in the
same manner and now every one of the radicles became curved away from
the cards though one was only slightly deflected some horticulturists
believe that certain kinds of seeds will not germinate properly in the
middle of the winter although kept at a right temperature if there
really is any proper period for the germination of the bean the feeble
degree of sensibility of the above radicles may have resulted from the
trial having been made in the middle of the winter and not simply from
the nights being too cold lastly the radicles of four beans which
from some innate cause germinated later than all the others of the same
lot and which grew slowly though appearing healthy were similarly
tried and even after 24 h they were hardly at all deflected from the
attached cards we may therefore infer that any cause which renders the
growth of the radicles either slower or more rapid than the normal
rate lessens or annuls the sensibility of their tips to contact it
deserves particular attention that when the attached objects failed to
act there was no bending of any kind excepting sachs curvature the
force of our evidence would have been greatly weakened if occasionally
though rarely the radicles had become curved in any direction
independently of the attached objects in the foregoing numbered
paragraphs however it may be observed that the extreme tip sometimes
becomes after a considerable interval of time abruptly curved towards
the bit of card but this is a totally distinct phenomenon as will
presently be explained
a summary of the results of the foregoing experiments on the radicles
of vicia fabaaltogether little squares about 120th of an inch
generally of sanded paper as stiff as thin card between 15 and 20
mm in thickness sometimes of ordinary card or little
fragments of very thin glass etc were affixed at different times to
one side of the conical tips of 55 radicles the 11 lastmentioned
cases but not the preliminary ones are here included the squares
etc were most commonly affixed with shellac but in 19 cases with
thick gumwater when the latter was used the squares were sometimes
found as previously stated to be separated from the apex by a layer
of thick fluid so that there was no contact and consequently no
bending of the radicle and such few cases were not recorded but in
every instance in which shellac was employed unless the square fell
off very soon the result was recorded in several instances when the
squares became displaced so as to stand parallel to the radicle or
were separated by fluid from the apex or soon fell off fresh squares
were attached and these cases described under the numbered
paragraphs are here included out of 55 radicles experimented on under
the proper temperature 52 became bent generally to a considerable
extent from the perpendicular and away from the side to which the
object was attached of the three failures one can be accounted for
as the radicle became sickly on the following day and a second was
observed only during 11 h 30 m as in several cases the terminal
growing part of the radicle continued for some time to bend from the
attached object it formed itself into a hook with the apex pointing
to the zenith or even into a ring and occasionally into a spire or
helix it is remarkable that these latter cases occurred more
frequently when objects were attached with thick gumwater which never
became dry than when shellac was employed the curvature was often
wellmarked in from 7 h to 11 h and in one instance a semicircle was
formed in 6 h 10 m from the time
of attachment but in order to see the phenomenon as well displayed as
in the above described cases it is indispensable that the bits of
card etc should be made to adhere closely to one side of the conical
apex that healthy radicles should be selected and kept at not too high
or too low a temperature and apparently that the trials should not be
made in the middle of the winter
in ten instances radicles which had curved away from a square of card
or other object attached to their tips straightened themselves to a
certain extent or even completely in the course of from one to two
days from the time of attachment this was more especially apt to occur
when the curvature was slight but in one instance no 27 a radicle
which in 9 h had been deflected about 90 from the perpendicular
became quite straight in 24 h from the period of attachment with no
26 the radicle was almost straight in 48 h we at first attributed the
straightening process to the radicles becoming accustomed to a slight
stimulus in the same manner as a tendril or sensitive petiole becomes
accustomed to a very light loop of thread and unbends itself though
the loop remains still suspended but sachs states2 that radicles of
the bean placed horizontally in damp air after curving downwards
through geotropism straighten themselves a little by growth along
their lower or concave sides why this should occur is not clear but
perhaps it likewise occurred in the above ten cases there is another
occasional movement which must not be passed over the tip of the
radicle for a length of from 2 to 3 mm was found in six instances
after an interval of about 24 or more hours bent towards the bit of
still attached cardthat is in a direction exactly opposite to the
previously induced curvature of the whole growing part for a length of
from 7 to 8 mm this occurred chiefly when the first curvature was
small and when an object had been affixed more than once to the apex
of the same radicle the attachment of a bit of card by shellac to one
side of the tender apex may sometimes mechanically prevent its growth
or the application of thick gumwater more than once to the same side
may injure it and then checked growth on this side with continued
growth on the opposite and unaffected side would account for the
reversed curvature of the apex
 2 arbeiten bot instit wrzburg heft iii p 456
various trials were made for ascertaining as far as we could the
nature and degree of irritation to which the apex must be subjected in
order that the terminal growing part should bend away as if to avoid
the cause of irritation we have seen in the numbered experiments that
a little square of rather thick letterpaper gummed to the apex
induced though slowly considerable deflection judging from several
cases in which various objects had been affixed with gum and had soon
become separated from the apex by a layer of fluid as well as from
some trials in which drops of thick gumwater alone had been applied
this fluid never causes bending we have also seen in the numbered
experiments that narrow splinters of quill and of very thin glass
affixed with shellac caused only a slight degree of deflection and
this may perhaps have been due to the shellac itself little squares of
goldbeaters skin which is excessively thin were damped and thus
made to adhere to one side of the tips of two radicles one of these
after 24 h produced no effect nor did the
other in 8 h within which time squares of card usually act but after
24 h there was slight deflection
an oval bead or rather cake of dried shellac 101 mm in length and
063 in breadth caused a radicle to become deflected at nearly right
angles in the course of only 6 h but after 23 h it had nearly
straightened itself a very small quantity of dissolved shellac was
spread over a bit of card and the tips of 9 radicles were touched
laterally with it only two of them became slightly deflected to the
side opposite to that bearing the speck of dried shellac and they
afterwards straightened themselves these specks were removed and both
together weighed less than 1100th of a grain so that a weight of
rather less than 1200th of a grain 032 mg sufficed to excite
movement in two out of the nine radicles here then we have apparently
reached nearly the minimum weight which will act
a moderately thick bristle which on measurement was found rather
flattened being 033 mm in one diameter and 020 mm in the other
was cut into lengths of about 120th of an inch these after being
touched with thick gumwater were placed on the tips of eleven
radicles three of them were affected one being deflected in 8 h 15
m to an angle of about 90 from the perpendicular a second to the
same amount when looked at after 9 h but after 24 h from the time of
first attachment the deflection had decreased to only 19 the third
was only slightly deflected after 9 h and the bit of bristle was then
found not touching the apex it was replaced and after 15 additional
hours the deflection amounted to 26 from the perpendicular the
remaining eight radicles were not at all acted on by the bits of
bristle so that we here appear to have nearly reached the minimum
of size of an object which will act on the radicle of the bean but it
is remarkable that when the bits of bristle did act that they should
have acted so quickly and efficiently
as the apex of a radicle in penetrating the ground must be pressed on
all sides we wished to learn whether it could distinguish between
harder or more resisting and softer substances a square of the sanded
paper almost as stiff as card and a square of extremely thin paper
too thin for writing on of exactly the same size about 120th of an
inch were fixed with shellac on opposite sides of the apices of 12
suspended radicles the sanded card was between 015 and 020 mm or
between 00059 and 00079 of an inch and the thin paper only 0045
mm or 000176 of an inch in thickness in 8 out of the 12 cases
there could be no doubt that the radicle was deflected from the side to
which the cardlike paper was attached and towards the opposite side
bearing the very thin paper this occurred in some instances in 9 h
but in others not until 24 h had elapsed moreover some of the four
failures can hardly be considered as really failures thus in one of
them in which the radicle remained quite straight the square of thin
paper was found when both were removed from the apex to have been so
thickly coated with shellac that it was almost as stiff as the card in
the second case the radicle was bent upwards into a semicircle but
the deflection was not directly from the side bearing the card and
this was explained by the two squares having become cemented laterally
together forming a sort of stiff gable from which the radicle was
deflected in the third case the square of card had been fixed by
mistake in front and though there was deflection from it this might
have been due to sachs curvature
in the fourth case alone no reason could be assigned why the radicle
had not been at all deflected these experiments suffice to prove that
the apex of the radicle possesses the extraordinary power of
discriminating between thin card and very thin paper and is deflected
from the side pressed by the more resisting or harder substance
some trials were next made by irritating the tips without any object
being left in contact with them nine radicles suspended over water
had their tips rubbed each six times with a needle with sufficient
force to shake the whole bean the temperature was favourable viz
about 63 f in 7 out of these cases no effect whatever was produced
in the eighth case the radicle became slightly deflected from and in
the ninth case slightly deflected towards the rubbed side but these
two latter opposed curvatures were probably accidental as radicles do
not always grow perfectly straight downwards the tips of two other
radicles were rubbed in the same manner for 15 seconds with a little
round twig two others for 30 seconds and two others for 1 minute but
without any effect being produced we may therefore conclude from these
15 trials that the radicles are not sensitive to temporary contact but
are acted on only by prolonged though very slight pressure
we then tried the effects of cutting off a very thin slice parallel to
one of the sloping sides of the apex as we thought that the wound
would cause prolonged irritation which might induce bending towards
the opposite side as in the case of an attached object two
preliminary trials were made firstly slices were cut from the
radicles of 6 beans suspended in damp air with a pair of scissors
which though sharp probably caused considerable crushing and no
curvature followed secondly thin slices were cut with a razor
obliquely off the tips of three radicles similarly suspended and after
44 h two were found plainly bent from the sliced surface and the
third the whole apex of which had been cut off obliquely by accident
was curled upwards over the bean but it was not clearly ascertained
whether the curvature had been at first directed from the cut surface
these results led us to pursue the experiment and 18 radicles which
had grown vertically downwards in damp air had one side of their
conical tips sliced off with a razor the tips were allowed just to
enter the water in the jars and they were exposed to a temperature
1416 c 5761 f the observations were made at different times
three were examined 12 h after being sliced and were all slightly
curved from the cut surface and the curvature increased considerably
after an additional 12 h eight were examined after 19 h four after
22 h 30 m and three after 25 h the final result was that out of the
18 radicles thus tried 13 were plainly bent from the cut surface after
the above intervals of time and one other became so after an
additional interval of 13 h 30 m so that only 4 out of the 18
radicles were not acted on to these 18 cases the 3 previously
mentioned ones should be added it may therefore be concluded that a
thin slice removed by a razor from one side of the conical apex of the
radicle causes irritation like that from an attached object and
induces curvature from the injured surface
lastly dry caustic nitrate of silver was employed to irritate one
side of the apex if one side of the apex or of the whole terminal
growing part of a radicle is by any means killed or badly injured the
other side continues to grow and this causes the part
to bend over towards the injured side3 but in the following
experiments we endeavoured generally with success to irritate the
tips on one side without badly injuring them this was effected by
first drying the tip as far as possible with blottingpaper though it
still remained somewhat damp and then touching it once with quite dry
caustic seventeen radicles were thus treated and were suspended in
moist air over water at a temperature of 58 f they were examined
after an interval of 21 h or 24h the tips of two were found blackened
equally all round so that they could tell nothing and were rejected
15 being left of these 10 were curved from the side which had been
touched where there was a minute brown or blackish mark five of these
radicles three of which were already slightly deflected were allowed
to enter the water in the jar and were reexamined after an additional
interval of 27 h ie in 48 h after the application of the caustic
and now four of them had become hooked being bent from the discoloured
side with their points directed to the zenith the fifth remained
unaffected and straight thus 11 radicles out of the 15 were acted on
but the curvature of the four just described was so plain that they
alone would have sufficed to show that the radicles of the bean bend
away from that side of the apex which has been slightly irritated by
caustic
 3 ciesielski found this to be the case untersuchungen ber die
 abwartskrmmung der wurzel 1871 p 28 after burning with heated
 platinum one side of a radicle so did we when we painted
 longitudinally half of the whole length of 7 radicles suspended over
 water with a thick layer of grease which is very injurious or even
 fatal to growing parts for after 48 hours five of these radicles were
 curved towards the greased side two remaining straight
the power of an irritant on the apex of the radicle
of the bean compared with that of geotropismwe know that when a
little square of card or other object is fixed to one side of the tip
of a vertically dependent radicle the growing part bends from it often
into a semicircle in opposition to geotropism which force is
conquered by the effect of the irritation from the attached object
radicles were therefore extended horizontally in damp air kept at the
proper low temperature for full sensitiveness and squares of card were
affixed with shellac on the lower sides of their tips so that if the
squares acted the terminal growing part would curve upwards firstly
eight beans were so placed that their short young horizontally
extended radicles would be simultaneously acted on both by geotropism
and by sachs curvature if the latter came into play and they all
eight became bowed downwards to the centre of the earth in 20 h
excepting one which was only slightly acted on two of them were a
little bowed downwards in only 5 h therefore the cards affixed to
the lower sides of their tips seemed to produce no effect and
geotropism easily conquered the effects of the irritation thus caused
secondly 5 oldish radicles 1 inch in length and therefore less
sensitive than the abovementioned young ones were similarly placed
and similarly treated from what has been seen on many other occasions
it may be safely inferred that if they had been suspended vertically
they would have bent away from the cards and if they had been extended
horizontally without cards attached to them they would have quickly
bent vertically downwards through geotropism but the result was that
two of these radicles were still horizontal after 23 h two were
curved only slightly and the fifth as much as 40 beneath the horizon
thirdly 5 beans were fastened
with their flat surfaces parallel to the corklid so that sachs
curvature would not tend to make the horizontally extended radicles
turn either upwards or downwards and little squares of card were
affixed as before to the lower sides of their tips the result was
that all five radicles were bent down or towards the centre of the
earth after only 8 h 20 m at the same time and within the same jars
3 radicles of the same age with squares affixed to one side were
suspended vertically and after 8 h 20 m they were considerably
deflected from the cards and therefore curved upwards in opposition to
geotropism in these latter cases the irritation from the squares had
overpowered geotropism whilst in the former cases in which the
radicles were extended horizontally geotropism had overpowered the
irritation thus within the same jars some of the radicles were
curving upwards and others downwards at the same timethese opposite
movements depending on whether the radicles when the squares were
first attached to them projected vertically down or were extended
horizontally this difference in their behaviour seems at first
inexplicable but can we believe be simply explained by the
difference between the initial power of the two forces under the above
circumstances combined with the wellknown principle of the
aftereffects of a stimulus when a young and sensitive radicle is
extended horizontally with a square attached to the lower side of the
tip geotropism acts on it at right angles and as we have seen is
then evidently more efficient than the irritation from the square and
the power of geotropism will be strengthened at each successive period
by its previous actionthat is by its aftereffects on the other
hand when a square is affixed to a vertically dependent radicle and
the apex begins to
curve upwards this movement will be opposed by geotropism acting only
at a very oblique angle and the irritation from the card will be
strengthened by its previous action we may therefore conclude that the
initial power of an irritant on the apex of the radicle of the bean is
less than that of geotropism when acting at right angles but greater
than that of geotropism when acting obliquely on it
sensitiveness of the tips of the secondary radicles of the bean to
contactall the previous observations relate to the main or primary
radicle some beans suspended to corklids with their radicles dipping
into water had developed secondary or lateral radicles which were
afterwards kept in very damp air at the proper low temperature for
full sensitiveness they projected as usual almost horizontally with
only a slight downward curvature and retained this position during
several days sachs has shown4 that these secondary roots are acted
on in a peculiar manner by geotropism so that if displaced they
reassume their former subhorizontal position and do not bend
vertically downwards like the primary radicle minute squares of the
stiff sanded paper were affixed by means of shellac but in some
instances with thick gumwater to the tips of 39 secondary radicles of
different ages generally the uppermost ones most of the squares were
fixed to the lower sides of the apex so that if they acted the radicle
would bend upwards but some were fixed laterally and a few on the
upper side owing to the extreme tenuity of these radicles it was very
difficult to attach the square to the actual apex whether owing to
this or some other circumstance only nine of the squares induced any
curvature the curvature amounted in some cases to about 45 above the
horizon in others to 90 and then the tip pointed to the zenith in
one instance a distinct upward curvature was observed in 8 h 15 m
but usually not until 24 h had elapsed although only 9 out of 39
radicles were affected yet the curvature was so distinct in several of
them that there could be no doubt that the tip is sensitive to slight
contact and that the growing part bends away from the touching object
it is possible that some secondary radicles are more sensitive than
others for sachs has proved5 the interesting fact that each
individual secondary radicle possesses its own peculiar constitution

sensitiveness to contact of the primary radicle a little above the
apex in the bean vicia faba and pea pisum sativumthe
sensitiveness of the apex of the radicle in the previously described
cases and the consequent curvature of the upper part from the touching
object or other source of irritation is the more remarkable because
sachs6 has shown that pressure at the distance of a few millimeters
above the apex causes the radicle to bend like a tendril towards the
touching object by fixing pins so that they pressed against the
radicles of beans suspended vertically in damp air we saw this kind of
curvature but rubbing the part with a twig or needle for a few minutes
produced no effect haberlandt remarks7 that these radicles in
breaking through the seedcoats often rub and press against the
ruptured edges and consequently bend round them as little squares of
the cardlike paper affixed with shellac to the tips were highly
efficient in causing the radicles to bend away from them similar
pieces of about 120th
inch square or rather less were attached in the same manner to one
side of the radicle at a distance of 3 or 4 mm above the apex in our
first trial on 15 radicles no effect was produced in a second trial on
the same number three became abruptly curved but only one strongly
towards the card within 24 h from these cases we may infer that the
pressure from a bit of card affixed with shellac to one side above the
apex is hardly a sufficient irritant but that it occasionally causes
the radicle to bend like a tendril towards this side

 7 die schutzeinrichtungen der keimpflanze 1877 p 25
we next tried the effect of rubbing several radicles at a distance of 4
mm from the apex for a few seconds with lunar caustic nitrate of
silver and although the radicles had been wiped dry and the stick of
caustic was dry yet the part rubbed was much injured and a slight
permanent depression was left in such cases the opposite side
continues to grow and the radicle necessarily becomes bent towards the
injured side but when a point 4 mm from the apex was momentarily
touched with dry caustic it was only faintly discoloured and no
permanent injury was caused this was shown by several radicles thus
treated straightening themselves after one or two days yet at first
they became curved towards the touched side as if they had been there
subjected to slight continued pressure these cases deserve notice
because when one side of the apex was just touched with caustic the
radicle as we have seen curved itself in an opposite direction that
is away from the touched side
the radicle of the common pea at a point a little above the apex is
rather more sensitive to continued pressure than that of the bean and
bends towards the pressed side8 we experimented on a variety
yorkshire hero which has a much wrinkled tough skin too large for
the included cotyledons so that out of 30 peas which had been soaked
for 24 h and allowed to germinate on damp sand the radicles of three
were unable to escape and were crumpled up in a strange manner within
the skin four other radicles were abruptly bent round the edges of the
ruptured skin against which they had pressed such abnormalities would
probably never or very rarely occur with forms developed in a state
of nature and subjected to natural selection one of the four radicles
just mentioned in doubling backwards came into contact with the pin by
which the pea was fixed to the corklid and now it bent at right
angles round the pin in a direction quite different from that of the
first curvature due to contact with the ruptured skin and it thus
afforded a good illustration of the tendrillike sensitiveness of the
radicle a little above the apex
 8 sachs arbeiten bot institut wrzburg heft iii p 438
little squares of the cardlike paper were next affixed to radicles of
the pea at 4 mm above the apex in the same manner as with the bean
twentyeight radicles suspended vertically over water were thus treated
on different occasions and 13 of them became curved towards the cards
the greatest degree of curvature amounted to 62 from the
perpendicular but so large an angle was only once formed on one
occasion a slight curvature was perceptible after 5 h 45 m and it
was generally wellmarked after 14 h there can therefore be no doubt
that with the pea irritation from a bit of card attached to one side
of the radicle above the apex suffices to induce curvature
squares of card were attached to one side of the tips of 11 radicles
within the same jars in which the above trials were made and five of
them became plainly and one slightly curved away from this side
other
analogous cases will be immediately described the fact is here
mentioned because it was a striking spectacle showing the difference
in the sensitiveness of the radicle in different parts to behold in
the same jar one set of radicles curved away from the squares on their
tips and another set curved towards the squares attached a little
higher up moreover the kind of curvature in the two cases is
different the squares attached above the apex cause the radicle to
bend abruptly the part above and beneath remaining nearly straight so
that here there is little or no transmitted effect on the other hand
the squares attached to the apex affect the radicle for a length of
from about 4 to even 8 mm inducing in most cases a symmetrical
curvature so that here some influence is transmitted from the apex for
this distance along the radicle
pisum sativum var yorkshire hero sensitiveness of the apex of the
radiclelittle squares of the same cardlike paper were affixed april
24th with shellac to one side of the apex of 10 vertically suspended
radicles the temperature of the water in the bottom of the jars was
6061 f most of these radicles were acted on in 8 h 30 m and
eight of them became in the course of 24 h conspicuously and the
remaining two slightly deflected from the perpendicular and from the
side bearing the attached squares thus all were acted on but it will
suffice to describe two conspicuous cases in one the terminal portion
of the radicle was bent at right angles a fig 66 after 24h and in
the other b it had by this time become hooked with the apex pointing
to the zenith the two bits of card here used were 07 inch in length
and 04 inch in breadth two other radicles which after 8 h 30 m
were moderately deflected became straight again after 24h another
trial was made in the same manner with 15 radicles but from
circumstances not worth explaining they were only once and briefly
examined after the short interval of 5 h 30 m and we merely record
in our notes almost all bent slightly from the perpendicular and away
from the squares the deflection amounting in one or two instances to
nearly a rectangle these two sets of cases especially the first one
prove that the apex of the radicle is sensitive to slight contact and
that the upper part bends from the touching object nevertheless on
june 1st and 4th 8 other radicles were tried in the same manner at a
temperature of 5860 f and after 24 h only 1 was decidedly bent
from the card 4 slightly 2 doubtfully and 1 not in the least the
amount of curvature was unaccountably small but all the radicles which
were at all bent were bent away from the cards

we now tried the effects of widely different temperatures on the
sensitiveness of these radicles with squares
of card attached to their tips firstly 13 peas most of them having
very short and young radicles were placed in an icebox in which the
temperature rose during three days from 44 to 47 f they grew slowly
but 10 out of the 13 became in the course of the three days very
slightly curved from the squares the other 3 were not affected so
that this temperature was too low for any high degree of sensitiveness
or for much movement jars with 13 other radicles were next placed on a
chimneypiece where they were subjected to a temperature of between
68 and 72 f and after 24 h 4 were conspicuously curved from the
cards 2 slightly and 7 not at all so that this temperature was
rather too high lastly 12 radicles were subjected to a temperature
varying between 72 and 85 f and none of them were in the least
affected by the squares the above several trials especially the first
recorded one indicate that the most favourable temperature for the
sensitiveness of the radicle of the pea is about 60 f
the tips of 6 vertically dependent radicles were touched once with dry
caustic in the manner described under vicia faba after 24 h four of
them were bent from the side bearing a minute black mark and the
curvature increased in one case after 38 h and in another case after
48 h until the terminal part projected almost horizontally the two
remaining radicles were not affected
with radicles of the bean when extended horizontally in damp air
geotropism always conquered the effects of the irritation caused by
squares of card attached to the lower sides of their tips a similar
experiment was tried on 13 radicles of the pea the squares being
attached with shellac and the temperature between 5860 f the
result was somewhat different for
these radicles are either less strongly acted on by geotropism or
what is more probable are more sensitive to contact after a time
geotropism always prevailed but its action was often delayed and in
three instances there was a most curious struggle between geotropism
and the irritation caused by the cards four of the 13 radicles were a
little curved downwards within 6 or 8 h always reckoning from the
time when the squares were first attached and after 23 h three of
them pointed vertically downwards and the fourth at an angle of 45
beneath the horizon these four radicles therefore did not seem to have
been at all affected by the attached squares four others were not
acted on by geotropism within the first 6 or 8 h but after 23 h were
much bowed down two others remained almost horizontal for 23 h but
afterwards were acted on so that in these latter six cases the action
of geotropism was much delayed the eleventh radicle was slightly
curved down after 8 h but when looked at again after 23 h the
terminal portion was curved upwards if it had
been longer observed the tip no doubt would have been found again
curved down and it would have formed a loop as in the following case
the twelfth radicle after 6 h was slightly curved downwards but when
looked at again after 21 h this curvature had disappeared and the
apex pointed upwards after 30 h the radicle formed a hook as shown
at a fig 67 which hook after 45 h was converted into a loop b
the thirteenth radicle after 6 h was slightly curved downwards but
within 21 h had curved considerably up and then down again at an
angle of 45 beneath the horizon afterwards becoming perpendicular in
these three last cases geotropism and the irritation caused by the
attached squares alternately prevailed in a highly remarkable manner
geotropism being ultimately victorious
fig 67 pisum sativum a radicle extended horizontally in damp air
with a little square of card affixed to the lower side of its tip
causing it to bend upwards in opposition to geotropism the deflection
of the radicle after 21 hours is shown at a and of the same radicle
after 45 hours at b now forming a loop
similar experiments were not always quite so successful as in the above
cases thus 6 radicles horizontally extended with attached squares
were tried on june 8th at a proper temperature and after 7 h 30 m
none were in the least curved upwards and none were distinctly
geotropic whereas of 6 radicles without any attached squares which
served as standards of comparison or controls 3 became slightly and 3
almost rectangularly geotropic within the 7 h 30 m but after 23 h
the two lots were equally geotropic on july 10th another trial was
made with 6 horizontally extended radicles with squares attached in
the same manner beneath their tips and after 7 h 30 m 4 were
slightly geotropic 1 remained horizontal and 1 was curved upwards in
opposition to gravity or geotropism this latter radicle after 48 h
formed a loop like that at b fig 67
an analogous trial was now made but instead of attaching squares of
card to the lower sides of the
tips these were touched with dry caustic the details of the
experiment will be given in the chapter on geotropism and it will
suffice here to say that 10 peas with radicles extended horizontally
and not cauterised were laid on and under damp friable peat these
which served as standards or controls as well as 10 others which had
been touched on the upper side with the caustic all became strongly
geotropic in 24 h nine radicles similarly placed had their tips
touched on the lower side with the caustic and after 24 h 3 were
slightly geotropic 2 remained horizontal and 4 were bowed upwards in
opposition to gravity and to geotropism this upward curvature was
distinctly visible in 8 h 45m after the lower sides of the tips had
been cauterised
little squares of card were affixed with shellac on two occasions to
the tips of 22 young and short secondary radicles which had been
emitted from the primary radicle whilst growing in water but were now
suspended in damp air besides the difficulty of attaching the squares
to such finely pointed objects as were these radicles the temperature
was too highvarying on the first occasion from 72 to 77 f and on
the second being almost steadily 78 f and this probably lessened the
sensitiveness of the tips the result was that after an interval of 8
h 30 m 6 of the 22 radicles were bowed upwards one of them greatly
in opposition to gravity and 2 laterally the remaining 14 were not
affected considering the unfavourable circumstances and bearing in
mind the case of the bean the evidence appears sufficient to show that
the tips of the secondary radicles of the pea are sensitive to slight
contact
phaseolus multiflorus sensitiveness of the apex of the
radiclefiftynine radicles were tried with squares
of various sizes of the same cardlike paper also with bits of thin
glass and rough cinders affixed with shellac to one side of the apex
rather large drops of the dissolved shellac were also placed on them
and allowed to set into hard beads the specimens were subjected to
various temperatures between 60 and 72 f more commonly at about the
latter but out of this considerable number of trials only 5 radicles
were plainly bent and 8 others slightly or even doubtfully from the
attached objects the remaining 46 not being at all affected it is
therefore clear that the tips of the radicles of this phaseolus are
much less sensitive to contact than are those of the bean or pea we
thought that they might be sensitive to harder pressure but after
several trials we could not devise any method for pressing harder on
one side of the apex than on the other without at the same time
offering mechanical resistance to its growth we therefore tried other
irritants
the tips of 13 radicles dried with blottingpaper were thrice touched
or just rubbed on one side with dry nitrate of silver they were rubbed
thrice because we supposed from the foregoing trials that the tips
were not highly sensitive after 24 h the tips were found greatly
blackened 6 were blackened equally all round so that no curvature to
any one side could be expected 6 were much blackened on one side for a
length of about 110th of an inch and this length became curved at
right angles towards the blackened surface the curvature afterwards
increasing in several instances until little hooks were formed it was
manifest that the blackened side was so much injured that it could not
grow whilst the opposite side continued to grow one alone out of
these 13 radicles became curved from the blackened side the
curvature extending for some little distance above the apex
after the experience thus gained the tips of six almost dry radicles
were once touched with the dry caustic on one side and after an
interval of 10 m were allowed to enter water which was kept at a
temperature of 6567 f the result was that after an interval of 8 h
a minute blackish speck could just be distinguished on one side of the
apex of five of these radicles all of which became curved towards the
opposite sidein two cases at about an angle of 45in two other cases
at nearly a rectangleand in the fifth case at above a rectangle so
that the apex was a little hooked in this latter case the black mark
was rather larger than in the others after 24 h from the application
of the caustic the curvature of three of these radicles including the
hooked one had diminished in the fourth it remained the same and in
the fifth it had increased the tip being now hooked it has been said
that after 8 h black specks could be seen on one side of the apex of
five of the six radicles on the sixth the speck which was extremely
minute was on the actual apex and therefore central and this radicle
alone did not become curved it was therefore again touched on one side
with caustic and after 15 h 30 m was found curved from the
perpendicular and from the blackened side at an angle of 34 which
increased in nine additional hours to 54
it is therefore certain that the apex of the radicle of this phaseolus
is extremely sensitive to caustic more so than that of the bean
though the latter is far more sensitive to pressure in the experiments
just given the curvature from the slightly cauterised side of the tip
extended along the radicle for a length of nearly 10 mm whereas in
the first set
of experiments when the tips of several were greatly blackened and
injured on one side so that their growth was arrested a length of
less than 3 mm became curved towards the much blackened side owing to
the continued growth of the opposite side this difference in the
results is interesting for it shows that too strong an irritant does
not induce any transmitted effect and does not cause the adjoining
upper and growing part of the radicle to bend we have analogous cases
with drosera for a strong solution of carbonate of ammonia when
absorbed by the glands or too great heat suddenly applied to them or
crushing them does not cause the basal part of the tentacles to bend
whilst a weak solution of the carbonate or a moderate heat or slight
pressure always induced such bending similar results were observed
with dionaea and pinguicula
the effect of cutting off with a razor a thin slice from one side of
the conical apex of 14 young and short radicles was next tried six of
them after being operated on were suspended in damp air the tips of
the other eight similarly suspended were allowed to enter water at a
temperature of about 65 f it was recorded in each case which side of
the apex had been sliced off and when they were afterwards examined
the direction of the curvature was noted before the record was
consulted of the six radicles in damp air three had their tips curved
after an interval of 10 h 15 m directly away from the sliced surface
whilst the other three were not affected and remained straight
nevertheless one of them after 13 additional hours became slightly
curved from the sliced surface of the eight radicles with their tips
immersed in water seven were plainly curved away from the sliced
surfaces after 10 h 15 m and with
respect to the eighth which remained quite straight too thick a slice
had been accidentally removed so that it hardly formed a real
exception to the general result when the seven radicles were looked at
again after an interval of 23 h from the time of slicing two had
become distorted four were deflected at an angle of about 70 from the
perpendicular and from the cut surface and one was deflected at nearly
90 so that it projected almost horizontally but with the extreme tip
now beginning to bend downwards through the action of geotropism it is
therefore manifest that a thin slice cut off one side of the conical
apex causes the upper growing part of the radicle of this phaseolus to
bend through the transmitted effects of the irritation away from the
sliced surface
tropaeolum majus sensitiveness of the apex of the radicle to
contactlittle squares of card were attached with shellac to one side
of the tips of 19 radicles some of which were subjected to 78 f and
others to a much lower temperature only 3 became plainly curved from
the squares 5 slightly 4 doubtfully and 7 not at all these seeds
were as we believed old so we procured a fresh lot and now the
results were widely different twentythree were tried in the same
manner five of the squares produced no effect but three of these
cases were no real exceptions for in two of them the squares had
slipped and were parallel to the apex and in the third the shellac was
in excess and had spread equally all round the apex one radicle was
deflected only slightly from the perpendicular and from the card
whilst seventeen were plainly deflected the angles in several of these
latter cases varied between 40 and 65 from the perpendicular and in
two of them it amounted after 15 h or 16 h to about 90 in one
instance a loop
was nearly completed in 16 h there can therefore be no doubt that
the apex is highly sensitive to slight contact and that the upper part
of the radicle bends away from the touching object
gossypium herbaceum sensitiveness of the apex of the radicleradicles
were experimented on in the same manner as before but they proved
illfitted for our purpose as they soon became unhealthy when
suspended in damp air of 38 radicles thus suspended at temperatures
varying from 66 to 69 f with squares of card attached to their
tips 9 were plainly and 7 slightly or even doubtfully deflected from
the squares and from the perpendicular 22 not being affected we
thought that perhaps the above temperature was not high enough so 19
radicles with attached squares likewise suspended in damp air were
subjected to a temperature of from 74 to 79 f but not one of them
was acted on and they soon became unhealthy lastly 19 radicles were
suspended in water at a temperature from 70 to 75 f with bits of
glass or squares of the card attached to their tips by means of
canadabalsam or asphalte which adhered rather better than shellac
beneath the water the radicles did not keep healthy for long the
result was that 6 were plainly and 2 doubtfully deflected from the
attached objects and the perpendicular 11 not being affected the
evidence consequently is hardly conclusive though from the two sets of
cases tried under a moderate temperature it is probable that the
radicles are sensitive to contact and would be more so under
favourable conditions
fifteen radicles which had germinated in friable peat were suspended
vertically over water seven of them served as controls and they
remained quite straight during 24 h the tips of the other eight
radicles
were just touched with dry caustic on one side after only 5 h 10 m
five of them were slightly curved from the perpendicular and from the
side bearing the little blackish marks after 8 h 40 m 4 out of
these 5 were deflected at angles between 15 and 65 from the
perpendicular on the other hand one which had been slightly curved
after 5 h 10 m now became straight after 24 h the curvature in two
cases had considerably increased also in four other cases but these
latter radicles had now become so contorted some being turned upwards
that it could no longer be ascertained whether they were still curved
from the cauterised side the control specimens exhibited no such
irregular growth and the two sets presented a striking contrast out
of the 8 radicles which had been touched with caustic two alone were
not affected and the marks left on their tips by the caustic were
extremely minute these marks in all cases were oval or elongated they
were measured in three instances and found to be of nearly the same
size viz 23 of a mm in length bearing this fact in mind it should
be observed that the length of the curved part of the radicle which
had become deflected from the cauterised side in the course of 8 h 40
m was found to be in three cases 6 7 and 9 mm
cucurbita ovifera sensitiveness of the apex of the radiclethe tips
proved illfitted for the attachment of cards as they are extremely
fine and flexible moreover owing to the hypocotyls being soon
developed and becoming arched the whole radicle is quickly displaced
and confusion is thus caused a large number of trials were made but
without any definite result excepting on two occasions when out of 23
radicles 10 were deflected from the attached squares
of card and 13 were not acted on rather large squares though
difficult to affix seemed more efficient than very small ones
we were much more successful with caustic but in our first trial 15
radicles were too much cauterised and only two became curved from the
blackened side the others being either killed on one side or
blackened equally all round in our next trial the dried tips of 11
radicles were touched momentarily with dry caustic and after a few
minutes were immersed in water the elongated marks thus caused were
never black only brown and about  mm in length or even less in 4
h 30 m after the cauterisation 6 of them were plainly curved from
the side with the brown mark 4 slightly and 1 not at all the latter
proved unhealthy and never grew and the marks on 2 of the 4 slightly
curved radicles were excessively minute one being distinguishable only
with the aid of a lens of 10 control specimens tried in the same jars
at the same time not one was in the least curved in 8 h 40 m after
the cauterisation 5 of the radicles out of the 10 the one unhealthy
one being omitted were deflected at about 90 and 3 at about 45 from
the perpendicular and from the side bearing the brown mark after 24 h
all 10 radicles had increased immensely in length in 5 of them the
curvature was nearly the same in 2 it had increased and in 3 it had
decreased the contrast presented by the 10 controls after both the 8
h 40 m and the 24 h intervals was very great for they had
continued to grow vertically downwards excepting two which from some
unknown cause had become somewhat tortuous
in the chapter on geotropism we shall see that 10 radicles of this
plant were extended horizontally on and beneath damp friable peat
under which conditions
they grow better and more naturally than in damp air and their tips
were slightly cauterised on the lower side brown marks about  mm in
length being thus caused uncauterised specimens similarly placed
became much bent downwards through geotropism in the course of 5 or 6
hours after 8 h only 3 of the cauterised ones were bowed downwards
and this in a slight degree 4 remained horizontal and 3 were curved
upwards in opposition to geotropism and from the side bearing the brown
mark ten other specimens had their tips cauterised at the same time
and in the same degree on the upper side and this if it produced any
effect would tend to increase the power of geotropism and all these
radicles were strongly bowed downwards after 8 h from the several
foregoing facts there can be no doubt that the cauterisation of the
tip of the radicle of this cucurbita on one side if done lightly
enough causes the whole growing part to bend to the opposite side
raphanus sativus sensitiveness of the apex of the radiclewe here
encountered many difficulties in our trials both with squares of card
and with caustic for when seeds were pinned to a corklid many of the
radicles to which nothing had been done grew irregularly often
curving upwards as if attracted by the damp surface above and when
they were immersed in water they likewise often grew irregularly we
did not therefore dare to trust our experiments with attached squares
of card nevertheless some of them seemed to indicate that the tips
were sensitive to contact our trials with caustic generally failed
from the difficulty of not injuring too greatly the extremely fine
tips out of 7 radicles thus tried one became bowed after 22 h at an
angle of 60 a second at 40
and a third very slightly from the perpendicular and from the
cauterised side
sculus hippocastanum sensitiveness of the apex of the radiclebits
of glass and squares of card were affixed with shellac or gumwater to
the tips of 12 radicles of the horsechestnut and when these objects
fell off they were refixed but not in a single instance was any
curvature thus caused these massive radicles one of which was above 2
inches in length and 3 inch in diameter at its base seemed insensible
to so slight a stimulus as any small attached object nevertheless
when the apex encountered an obstacle in its downward course the
growing part became so uniformly and symmetrically curved that its
appearance indicated not mere mechanical bending but increased growth
along the whole convex side due to the irritation of the apex
that this is the correct view may be inferred from the effects of the
more powerful stimulus of caustic the bending from the cauterised side
occurred much slower than in the previously described species and it
will perhaps be worth while to give our trials in detail
the seeds germinated in sawdust and one side of the tips of the
radicles were slightly rubbed once with dry nitrate of silver and
after a few minutes were allowed to dip into water they were subjected
to a rather varying temperature generally between 52 and 58 f a few
cases have not been thought worth recording in which the whole tip was
blackened or in which the seedling soon became unhealthy
1 the radicle was slightly deflected from the cauterised side in one
day ie 24 h in three days it stood at 60 from the perpendicular
in four days at 90 on the fifth day it was curved up about 40 above
the horizon so that it had passed through an angle of 130 in the five
days and this was the greatest amount of curvature observed
2 in two days radicle slightly deflected after seven days
deflected 69 from the perpendicular and from the cauterised side
after eight days the angle amounted to nearly 90
3 after one day slight deflection but the cauterised mark was so
faint that the same side was again touched with caustic in four days
from the first touch deflection amounted to 78 which in an additional
day increased to 90
4 after two days slight deflection which during the next three days
certainly increased but never became great the radicle did not grow
well and died on the eighth day
5 after two days very slight deflection but this on the fourth day
amounted to 56 from the perpendicular and from the cauterised side
6 after three days doubtfully but after four days certainly
deflected from the cauterised side on the fifth day deflection
amounted to 45 from the perpendicular and this on the seventh day
increased to about 90
7 after two days slightly deflected on the third day the deflection
amounted to 25 from the perpendicular and this did not afterwards
increase
8 after one day deflection distinct on the third day it amounted to
44 and on the fourth day to 72 from the perpendicular and the
cauterised side
9 after two days deflection slight yet distinct on the third day
the tip was again touched on the same side with caustic and thus
killed
10 after one day slight deflection which after six days increased
to 50 from the perpendicular and the cauterised side
11 after one day decided deflection which after six days increased
to 62 from the perpendicular and from the cauterised side
12 after one day slight deflection which on the second day amounted
to 35 on the fourth day to 50 and the sixth day to 63 from the
perpendicular and the cauterised side
13 whole tip blackened but more on one side than the other on the
fourth day slightly and on the sixth day greatly deflected from the
more blackened side the deflection on the ninth day amounted to 90
from the perpendicular
14 whole tip blackened in the same manner as in the last case on
the second day decided deflection from the more blackened side which
increased on the seventh day to nearly 90 on the following day the
radicle appeared unhealthy
15 here we had the anomalous case of a radicle bending
slightly towards the cauterised side on the first day and continuing
to do so for the next three days when the deflection amounted to about
90 from the perpendicular the cause appeared to lie in the
tendrillike sensitiveness of the upper part of the radicle against
which the point of a large triangular flap of the seedcoats pressed
with considerable force and this irritation apparently conquered that
from the cauterised apex
these several cases show beyond doubt that the irritation of one side
of the apex excites the upper part of the radicle to bend slowly
towards the opposite side this fact was well exhibited in one lot of
five seeds pinned to the corklid of a jar for when after 6 days the
lid was turned upside down and viewed from directly above the little
black marks made by the caustic were now all distinctly visible on the
upper sides of the tips of the laterally bowed radicles a thin slice
was shaved off with a razor from one side of the tips of 22 radicles
in the manner described under the common bean but this kind of
irritation did not prove very effective only 7 out of the 22 radicles
became moderately deflected in from 3 to 5 days from the sliced
surface and several of the others grew irregularly the evidence
therefore is far from conclusive
quercus robur sensitiveness of the apex of the radiclethe tips of
the radicles of the common oak are fully as sensitive to slight contact
as are those of any plant examined by us they remained healthy in damp
air for 10 days but grew slowly squares of the cardlike paper were
fixed with shellac to the tips of 15 radicles and ten of these became
conspicuously bowed from the perpendicular and from the squares two
slightly and three not at all but two of the latter were not real
exceptions as they were at first very short and hardly grew
afterwards some of the more
remarkable cases are worth describing the radicles were examined on
each successive morning at nearly the same hour that is after
intervals of 24 h
no 1 this radicle suffered from a series of accidents and acted in
an anomalous manner for the apex appeared at first insensible and
afterwards sensitive to contact the first square was attached on oct
19th on the 21st the radicle was not at all curved and the square was
accidentally knocked off it was refixed on the 22nd and the radicle
became slightly curved from the square but the curvature disappeared
on the 23rd when the square was removed and refixed no curvature
ensued and the square was again accidentally knocked off and refixed
on the morning of the 27th it was washed off by having reached the
water in the bottom of the jar the square was refixed and on the
29th that is ten days after the first square had been attached and
two days after the attachment of the last square the radicle had grown
to the great length of 32 inches and now the terminal growing part
had become bent away from the square into a hook see fig 68
fig 68 quercus robur radicle with square of card attached to one
side of apex causing it to become hooked drawing onehalf natural
scale
no 2 square attached on the 19th on the 20th radicle slightly
deflected from it and from the perpendicular on the 21st deflected at
nearly right angles it remained during the next two days in this
position but on the 25th the upward curvature was lessened through the
action of geotropism and still more so on the 26th
no 3 square attached on the 19th on the 21st a trace of curvature
from the square which amounted on the 22nd to about 40 and on the
23rd to 53 from the perpendicular
no 4 square attached on the 21st on the 22nd trace of curvature from
the square on the 23rd completely hooked with the point turned up to
the zenith three days afterwards ie 26th the curvature had wholly
disappeared and the apex pointed perpendicularly downwards
no 5 square attached on the 21st on the 22nd decided
though slight curvature from the square on the 23rd the tip had curved
up above the horizon and on the 24th was hooked with the apex pointing
almost to the zenith as in fig 68
no 6 square attached on the 21st on the 22nd slightly curved from
the square 23rd more curved 25th considerably curved 27th all
curvature lost and the radicle was now directed perpendicularly
downwards
no 7 square attached on the 21st on the 22nd a trace of curvature
from the square which increased next day and on the 24th amounted to
a right angle
it is therefore manifest that the apex of the radicle of the oak is
highly sensitive to contact and retains its sensitiveness during
several days the movement thus induced was however slower than in
any of the previous cases with the exception of that of sculus as
with the bean the terminal growing part after bending sometimes
straightened itself through the action of geotropism although the
object still remained attached to the tip
the same remarkable experiment was next tried as in the case of the
bean namely little squares of exactly the same size of the cardlike
sanded paper and of very thin paper the thicknesses of which have been
given under vicia faba were attached with shellac on opposite sides
as accurately as could be done of the tips of 13 radicles suspended
in damp air at a temperature of 6566 f the result was striking
for 9 out of these 13 radicles became plainly and 1 very slightly
curved from the thick paper towards the side bearing the thin paper in
two of these cases the apex became completely hooked after two days in
four cases the deflection from the perpendicular and from the side
bearing the thick paper amounted in from two to four days to angles of
90 72 60 and 49 but in two other cases to only 18 and 15 it
should however be stated that in the
case in which the deflection was 49 the two squares had accidentally
come into contact on one side of the apex and thus formed a lateral
gable and the deflection was directed in part from this gable and in
part from the thick paper in three cases alone the radicles were not
affected by the difference in thickness of the squares of paper
attached to their tips and consequently did not bend away from the
side bearing the stiffer paper
zea mays sensitiveness of the apex of the radicle to contacta large
number of trials were made on this plant as it was the only
monocotyledon on which we experimented an abstract of the results will
suffice in the first place 22 germinating seeds were pinned to
corklids without any object being attached to their radicles some
being exposed to a temperature of 6566 f and others to between 74
and 79 and none of them became curved though some were a little
inclined to one side a few were selected which from having germinated
on sand were crooked but when suspended in damp air the terminal part
grew straight downwards this fact having been ascertained little
squares of the cardlike paper were affixed with shellac on several
occasions to the tips of 68 radicles of these the terminal growing
part of 39 became within 24 h conspicuously curved away from the
attached squares and from the perpendicular 13 out of the 39 forming
hooks with their points directed towards the zenith and 8 forming
loops moreover 7 other radicles out of the 68 were slightly and two
doubtfully deflected from the cards there remain 20 which were not
affected but 10 of these ought not to be counted for one was
diseased two had their tips quite surrounded by shellac and the
squares on 7 had slipped so as to stand parallel to the apex instead
of obliquely
on it there were therefore only 10 out of the 68 which certainly were
not acted on some of the radicles which were experimented on were
young and short most of them of moderate length and two or three
exceeded three inches in length the curvature in the above cases
occurred within 24 h but it was often conspicuous within a much
shorter period for instance the terminal growing part of one radicle
was bent upwards into a rectangle in 8 h 15 m and of another in 9 h
on one occasion a hook was formed in 9 h six of the radicles in a jar
containing nine seeds which stood on a sandbath raised to a
temperature varying from 76 to 82 f became hooked and a seventh
formed a complete loop when first looked at after 15 hours
the accompanying figures of four germinating seeds fig 69 show
firstly a radicle a the apex of which has become so much bent away
from the attached square as to form a hook secondly b a hook
converted through the continued irritation of the card aided perhaps
by geotropism into an almost complete circle or loop the tip in the
act of forming a loop generally rubs against the upper part of the
radicle and pushes off the attached square the loop then contracts or
closes but never disappears and the apex afterwards grows vertically
downwards being no longer irritated by any attached object this
frequently occurred and is represented at c the jar above mentioned
with the six hooked radicles and another jar were kept for two
additional days for the sake of observing how the hooks would be
modified most of them became converted into simple loops like that
figured at c but in one case the apex did not rub against the upper
part of the radicle and thus remove the card and it consequently made
owing
to the continued irritation from the card two complete loops that is
a helix of two spires which afterwards became pressed closely
together then geotropism prevailed and caused the apex to grow
perpendicularly downwards in another case shown at d the apex in
making a second turn or spire passed through the first loop which was
at first widely open and in doing so knocked off the card it then
grew perpendicularly downwards and thus tied itself into a knot which
soon became tight
fig 69 zea mays radicles excited to bend away from the little
squares of card attached to one side of their tips
secondary radicles of zeaa short time after the first radicle has
appeared others protrude from the
seed but not laterally from the primary one ten of these secondary
radicles which were directed obliquely downwards were experimented on
with very small squares of card attached with shellac to the lower
sides of their tips if therefore the squares acted the radicles would
bend upwards in opposition to gravity the jar stood protected from
light on a sandbath which varied between 76 and 82 f after only 5
h one appeared to be a little deflected from the square and after 20
h formed a loop four others were considerably curved from the squares
after 20 h and three of them became hooked with their tips pointing
to the zenithone after 29 h and the two others after 44 h by this
latter time a sixth radicle had become bent at a right angle from the
side bearing the square thus altogether six out of the ten secondary
radicles were acted on four not being affected there can therefore
be no doubt that the tips of these secondary radicles are sensitive to
slight contact and that when thus excited they cause the upper part to
bend from the touching object but generally as it appears not in so
short a time as in the case of the firstformed radicle
sensitiveness of the tip of the radicle to moist air
sachs made the interesting discovery a few years ago that the
radicles of many seedling plants bend towards an adjoining damp
surface9 we shall here endeavour to show that this peculiar form of
sensitiveness resides in their tips the movement is directly the
reverse of that excited by the irritants hitherto considered which
cause the growing part of the
radicle to bend away from the source of irritation in our experiments
we followed sachs plan and sieves with seeds germinating in damp
sawdust were suspended so that the bottom was generally inclined at 40
with the horizon if the radicles had been acted on solely by
geotropism they would have grown out of the bottom of the sieve
perpendicularly downwards but as they were attracted by the adjoining
damp surface they bent towards it and were deflected 50 from the
perpendicular for the sake of ascertaining whether the tip or the
whole growing part of the radicle was sensitive to the moist air a
length of from 1 to 2 mm was coated in a certain number of cases with
a mixture of oliveoil and lampblack this mixture was made in order
to give consistence to the oil so that a thick layer could be applied
which would exclude at least to a large extent the moist air and
would be easily visible a greater number of experiments than those
which were actually tried would have been necessary had not it been
clearly established that the tip of the radicle is the part which is
sensitive to various other irritants

phaseolus multiflorustwentynine radicles to which nothing had been
done growing out of a sieve were observed at the same time with those
which had their tips greased and for an equal length of time of the
29 24 curved themselves so as to come into close contact with the
bottom of the sieve the place of chief curvature was generally at a
distance of 5 or 6 mm from the apex eight radicles had their tips
greased for a length of 2 mm and two others for a length of 1 mm
they were kept at a temperature of 1516 c after intervals of from
19 h to 24 h all were still vertically or almost vertically
dependent for some of them had moved towards the adjoining damp
surface by about 10 they had therefore not been acted on or only
slightly acted on by the damper air on one side although the whole
upper part was freely exposed after 48 h three of these radicles
became
considerably curved towards the sieve and the absence of curvature in
some of the others might perhaps be accounted for by their not having
grown very well but it should be observed that during the first 19 h
to 24 h all grew well two of them having increased 2 and 3 mm in
length in 11 h five others increased 5 to 8 mm in 19 h and two
which had been at first 4 and 6 mm in length increased in 24 h to 15
and 20 mm
the tips of 10 radicles which likewise grew well were coated with the
grease for a length of only 1 mm and now the result was somewhat
different for of these 4 curved themselves to the sieve in from 21 h
to 24h whilst 6 did not do so five of the latter were observed for
an additional day and now all excepting one became curved to the
sieve
the tips of 5 radicles were cauterised with nitrate of silver and
about 1 mm in length was thus destroyed they were observed for
periods varying between 11 h and 24h and were found to have grown
well one of them had curved until it came into contact with the sieve
another was curving towards it whilst the remaining three were still
vertically dependent of 7 not cauterised radicles observed at the same
time all had come into contact with the sieve
the tips of 11 radicles were protected by moistened goldbeaters skin
which adheres closely for a length varying from 1 to 2 mm after 22
h to 24 h 6 of these radicles were clearly bent towards or had come
into contact with the sieve 2 were slightly curved in this direction
and 3 not at all all had grown well of 14 control specimens observed
at the same time all excepting one had closely approached the sieve
it appears from these cases that a cap of goldbeaters skin checks
though only to a slight degree the bending of the radicles to an
adjoining damp surface whether an extremely thin sheet of this
substance when moistened allows moisture from the air to pass through
it we do not know one case indicated that the caps were sometimes
more efficient than appears from the above results for a radicle
which after 23 h had only slightly approached the sieve had its cap
1 mm in length removed and during the next 15 h it curved itself
abruptly towards the source of moisture the chief seat of curvature
being at a distance of 2 to 3 mm from the apex
vicia fabathe tips of 13 radicles were coated with the grease for a
length of 2 mm and it should be remembered that with these radicles
the seat of chief curvature is about
4 or 5 mm from the apex four of them were examined after 22h three
after 26 h and six after 36 h and none had been attracted towards
the damp lower surface of the sieve in another trial 7 radicles were
similarly treated and 5 of them still pointed perpendicularly
downwards after 11 h whilst 2 were a little curved towards the sieve
by an accident they were not subsequently observed in both these
trials the radicles grew well 7 of them which were at first from 4 to
11 mm in length were after 11 h between 7 and 16 mm 3 which were
at first from 6 to 8 mm after 26 h were 115 to 18 mm in length and
lastly 4 radicles which were at first 5 to 8 mm after 46 h were 18
to 23 mm in length the control or ungreased radicles were not
invariably attracted towards the bottom of the sieve but on one
occasion 12 out of 13 which were observed for periods between 22 h
and 36 h were thus attracted on two other occasions taken together
38 out of 40 were similarly attracted on another occasion only 7 out
of 14 behaved in this manner but after two more days the proportion of
the curved increased to 17 out of 23 on a last occasion only 11 out of
20 were thus attracted if we add up these numbers we find that 78 out
of 96 of the control specimens curved themselves towards the bottom of
the sieve of the specimens with greased tips 2 alone out of the 20
but 7 of these were not observed for a sufficiently long time thus
curved themselves we can therefore hardly doubt that the tip for a
length of 2 mm is the part which is sensitive to a moist atmosphere
and causes the upper part to bend towards its source
the tips of 15 radicles were cauterised with nitrate of silver and
they grew as well as those above described with greased tips after an
interval of 24 h 9 of them were not at all curved towards the bottom
of the sieve 2 were curved towards it at angles of 20 and 12 from
their former vertical position and 4 had come into close contact with
it thus the destruction of the tip for a length of about 1 mm
prevented the curvature of the greater number of these radicles to the
adjoining damp surface of 24 control specimens 23 were bent to the
sieve and on a second occasion 15 out of 16 were similarly curved in a
greater or less degree these control trials are included in those
given in the foregoing paragraph
avena sativathe tips of 13 radicles which projected between 2 and 4
mm from the bottom of the sieve many of
them not quite perpendicularly downwards were coated with the black
grease for a length of from 1 to 1 mm the sieves were inclined at 30
with the horizon the greater number of these radicles were examined
after 22 h and a few after 25 h and within these intervals they had
grown so quickly as to have nearly doubled their lengths with the
ungreased radicles the chief seat of curvature is at a distance of not
less than between 35 and 55 mm and not more than between 7 and 10
mm from the apex out of the 13 radicles with greased tips 4 had not
moved at all towards the sieve 6 were deflected towards it and from
the perpendicular by angles varying between 10 and 35 and 3 had come
into close contact with it it appears therefore at first sight that
greasing the tips of these radicles had checked but little their
bending to the adjoining damp surface but the inspection of the sieves
on two occasions produced a widely different impression on the mind
for it was impossible to behold the radicles with the black greased
tips projecting from the bottom and all those with ungreased tips at
least 40 to 50 in number clinging closely to it and feel any doubt
that the greasing had produced a great effect on close examination
only a single ungreased radicle could be found which had not become
curved towards the sieve it is probable that if the tips had been
protected by grease for a length of 2 mm instead of from 1 to 1 mm
they would not have been affected by the moist air and none would have
become curved
triticum vulgareanalogous trials were made on 8 radicles of the
common wheat and greasing their tips produced much less effect than in
the case of the oats after 22 h 5 of them had come into contact with
the bottom of the sieve 2 had moved towards it 10 and 15 and one
alone remained perpendicular not one of the very numerous ungreased
radicles failed to come into close contact with the sieve these trials
were made on nov 28th when the temperature was only 48 c at 10
am we should hardly have thought this case worth notice had it not
been for the following circumstance in the beginning of october when
the temperature was considerably higher viz 12 to 13 c we found
that only a few of the ungreased radicles became bent towards the
sieve and this indicates that sensitiveness to moisture in the air is
increased by a low temperature as we have seen with the radicles of
vicia faba relatively to objects attached to their tips but in the
present instance it is possible that a difference in the dryness
of the air may have caused the difference in the results at the two
periods
finally the facts just given with respect to phaseolus multiflorus
vicia faba and avena sativa show as it seems to us that a layer of
grease spread for a length of 1 to 2 mm over the tip of the radicle
or the destruction of the tip by caustic greatly lessens or quite
annuls in the upper and exposed part the power of bending towards a
neighbouring source of moisture we should bear in mind that the part
which bends most lies at some little distance above the greased or
cauterised tip and that the rapid growth of this part proves that it
has not been injured by the tips having been thus treated in those
cases in which the radicles with greased tips became curved it is
possible that the layer of grease was not sufficiently thick wholly to
exclude moisture or that a sufficient length was not thus protected
or in the case of the caustic not destroyed when radicles with
greased tips are left to grow for several days in damp air the grease
is drawn out into the finest reticulated threads and dots with narrow
portions of the surface left clean such portions would it is
probable be able to absorb moisture and thus we can account for
several of the radicles with greased tips having become curved towards
the sieve after an interval of one or two days on the whole we may
infer that sensitiveness to a difference in the amount of moisture in
the air on the two sides of a radicle resides in the tip which
transmits some influence to the upper part causing it to bend towards
the source of moisture consequently the movement is the reverse of
that caused by objects attached to one side of the tip or by a thin
slice being cut off or by being slightly cauterised in a future
chapter it will be shown that sensitiveness to the attraction of
gravity likewise resides in the tip so that it is the tip which
excites the adjoining parts of a horizontally extended radicle to bend
towards the centre of the earth
secondary radicles becoming vertically geotropic by the destruction or
injury of the terminal part of the primary radicle
sachs has shown that the lateral or secondary radicles of the bean and
probably of other plants are acted on by geotropism in so peculiar a
manner that they grow out horizontally or a little inclined downwards
and he has further shown10 the interesting fact that if the end of
the primary radicle be cut off one of the nearest secondary radicles
changes its nature and grows perpendicularly downwards thus replacing
the primary radicle we repeated this experiment and planted beans
with amputated radicles in friable peat and saw the result described
by sachs but generally two or three of the secondary radicles grew
perpendicularly downwards we also modified the experiment by pinching
young radicles a little way above their tips between the arms of a
ushaped piece of thick leaden wire the part pinched was thus
flattened and was afterwards prevented from growing thicker five
radicles had their ends cut off and served as controls or standards
eight were pinched of these 2 were pinched too severely and their ends
died and dropped off 2 were not pinched enough and were not sensibly
affected the remaining 4 were pinched sufficiently to check the growth
of the terminal part but did not appear otherwise injured when the
ushaped wires were removed after an
interval of 15 days the part beneath the wire was found to be very
thin and easily broken whilst the part above was thickened now in
these four cases one or more of the secondary radicles arising from
the thickened part just above the wire had grown perpendicularly
downwards in the best case the primary radicle the part below the
wire being 1 inch in length was somewhat distorted and was not half
as long as three adjoining secondary radicles which had grown
vertically or almost vertically downwards some of these secondary
radicles adhered together or had become confluent we learn from these
four cases that it is not necessary in order that a secondary radicle
should assume the nature of a primary one that the latter should be
actually amputated it is sufficient that the flow of sap into it
should be checked and consequently should be directed into the
adjoining secondary radicles for this seems to be the most obvious
result of the primary radicle being pinched between the arms of a
ushaped wire
 10 arbeiten bot institut wrzburg heft iv 1874 p 622
this change in the nature of secondary radicles is clearly analogous
as sachs has remarked to that which occurs with the shoots of trees
when the leading one is destroyed and is afterwards replaced by one or
more of the lateral shoots for these now grow upright instead of
subhorizontally but in this latter case the lateral shoots are
rendered apogeotropic whereas with radicles the lateral ones are
rendered geotropic we are naturally led to suspect that the same cause
acts with shoots as with roots namely an increased flow of sap into
the lateral ones we made some trials with abies communis and
pectinata by pinching with wire the leading and all the lateral shoots
excepting one but we believe that they were too old when experimented
on and some were pinched too severely and
some not enough only one case succeeded namely with the sprucefir
the leading shoot was not killed but its growth was checked at its
base there were three lateral shoots in a whorl two of which were
pinched one being thus killed the third was left untouched these
lateral shoots when operated on july 14th stood at an angle of 8
above the horizon by sept 8th the unpinched one had risen 35 by
oct 4th it had risen 46 and by jan 26th 48 and it had now become
a little curved inwards part of this rise of 48 may be attributed to
ordinary growth for the pinched shoot rose 12 within the same period
it thus follows that the unpinched shoot stood on jan 26th 56 above
the horizon or 34 from the vertical and it was thus obviously almost
ready to replace the slowly growing pinched leading shoot
nevertheless we feel some doubt about this experiment for we have
since observed with sprucefirs growing rather unhealthily that the
lateral shoots near the summit sometimes become highly inclined whilst
the leading shoot remains apparently sound
a widely different agency not rarely causes shoots which naturally
would have brown out horizontally to grow up vertically the lateral
branches of the silver fir a pectinata are often affected by a
fungus cidium elatinum which causes the branch to enlarge into an
oval knob formed of hard wood in one of which we counted 24 rings of
growth according to de bary11 when the mycelium penetrates a bud
beginning to elongate the shoot developed from it grows vertically
upwards such upright shoots
afterwards produce lateral and horizontal branches and they then
present a curious appearance as if a young firtree had grown out of a
ball of clay surrounding the branch these upright shoots have
manifestly changed their nature and become apogeotropic for if they
had not been affected by the cidium they would have grown out
horizontally like all the other twigs on the same branches this change
can hardly be due to an increased flow of sap into the part but the
presence of the mycelium will have greatly disturbed its natural
constitution
 11 see his valuable article in bot zeitung 1867 p 257 on
 these monstrous growths which are called in german hexenbesen or
 witchbrooms
according to mr meehan12 the stems of three species of euphorbia
and of portulaca oleracea are normally prostrate or procumbent but
when they are attacked by an cidium they assume an erect habit dr
stahl informs us that he knows of several analogous cases and these
seem to be closely related to that of the abies the rhizomes of
sparganium ramosum grow out horizontally in the soil to a considerable
length or are diageotropic but f elfving found that when they were
cultivated in water their tips turned upwards and they became
apogeotropic the same result followed when the stem of the plant was
bent until it cracked or was merely much bowed13

 in wrzburg vol ii 1880 p 489 carl kraus triesdorf had
 previously observed flora 1878 p 324 that the underground
 shoots of triticum repens bend vertically up when the parts above
 ground are removed and when the rhizomes are kept partly immersed in
 water
no explanation has hitherto been attempted of such cases as the
foregoingnamely of secondary radicles growing vertically downwards
and of lateral shoots growing vertically upwards after the amputation
of
the primary radicle or of the leading shoot the following
considerations give us as we believe the clue firstly any cause
which disturbs the constitution14 is apt to induce reversion such as
the crossing of two distinct races or a change of conditions as when
domestic animals become feral but the case which most concerns us is
the frequent appearance of peloric flowers on the summit of a stem or
in the centre of the inflorescenceparts which it is believed
receive the most sap for when an irregular flower becomes perfectly
regular or peloric this may be attributed at least partly to
reversion to a primitive and normal type even the position of a seed
at the end of the capsule sometimes gives to the seedling developed
from it a tendency to revert secondly reversions often occur by means
of buds independently of reproduction by seed so that a bud may
revert to the character of a former state many budgenerations ago in
the case of animals reversions may occur in the individual with
advancing age thirdly and lastly radicles when they first protrude
from the seed are always geotropic and plumules or shoots almost
always apogeotropic if then any cause such as an increased flow of
sap or the presence of mycelium disturbs the constitution of a lateral
shoot or of a secondary radicle it is apt to revert to its primordial
state and it becomes either apogeotropic or geotropic as the case may
be and consequently grows either vertically upwards or downwards it
is indeed
possible or even probable that this tendency to reversion may have
been increased as it is manifestly of service to the plant
 14 the facts on which the following conclusions are founded are
 given in the variation of animals and plants under domestication

a summary of chapter
a part or organ may be called sensitive when its irritation excites
movement in an adjoining part now it has been shown in this chapter
that the tip of the radicle of the bean is in this sense sensitive to
the contact of any small object attached to one side by shellac or
gumwater also to a slight touch with dry caustic and to a thin slice
cut off one side the radicles of the pea were tried with attached
objects and caustic both of which acted with phaseolus multiflorus
the tip was hardly sensitive to small squares of attached card but was
sensitive to caustic and to slicing the radicles of tropaeolum were
highly sensitive to contact and so as far as we could judge were
those of gossypium herbaceum and they were certainly sensitive to
caustic the tips of the radicles of cucurbita ovifera were likewise
highly sensitive to caustic though only moderately so to contact
raphanus sativus offered a somewhat doubtful case with sculus the
tips were quite indifferent to bodies attached to them though
sensitive to caustic those of quercus robur and zea mays were highly
sensitive to contact as were the radicles of the latter to caustic in
several of these cases the difference in sensitiveness of the tip to
contact and to caustic was as we believe merely apparent for with
gossypium raphanus and cucurbita the tip was so fine and flexible
that it was very difficult to attach any object to one of its sides
with the radicles of sculus the tips were not at all sensitive to
small bodies attached to them but it does not follow from this
fact that they would not have been sensitive to somewhat greater
continued pressure if this could have been applied
the peculiar form of sensitiveness which we are here considering is
confined to the tip of the radicle for a length of from 1 mm to 15
mm when this part is irritated by contact with any object by caustic
or by a thin slice being cut off the upper adjoining part of the
radicle for a length of from 6 or 7 to even 12 mm is excited to bend
away from the side which has been irritated some influence must
therefore be transmitted from the tip along the radicle for this
length the curvature thus caused is generally symmetrical the part
which bends most apparently coincides with that of the most rapid
growth the tip and the basal part grow very slowly and they bend very
little
considering the widely separated position in the vegetable series of
the several abovenamed genera we may conclude that the tips of the
radicles of all or almost all plants are similarly sensitive and
transmit an influence causing the upper part to bend with respect to
the tips of the secondary radicles those of vicia faba pisum sativum
and zea mays were alone observed and they were found similarly
sensitive
in order that these movements should be properly displayed it appears
necessary that the radicles should grow at their normal rate if
subjected to a high temperature and made to grow rapidly the tips seem
either to lose their sensitiveness or the upper part to lose the power
of bending so it appears to be if they grow very slowly from not being
vigorous or from being kept at too low a temperature also when they
are forced to germinate in the middle of the winter
the curvature of the radicle sometimes occurs within from 6 to 8 hours
after the tip has been irritated and almost always within 24 h
excepting in the case of the massive radicles of sculus the curvature
often amounts to a rectanglethat is the terminal part bends upwards
until the tip which is but little curved projects almost
horizontally occasionally the tip from the continued irritation of
the attached object continues to bend up until it forms a hook with
the point directed towards the zenith or a loop or even a spire
after a time the radicle apparently becomes accustomed to the
irritation as occurs in the case of tendrils for it again grows
downwards although the bit of card or other object may remain attached
to the tip it is evident that a small object attached to the free
point of a vertically suspended radicle can offer no mechanical
resistance to its growth as a whole for the object is carried
downwards as the radicle elongates or upwards as the radicle curves
upwards nor can the growth of the tip itself be mechanically checked
by an object attached to it by gumwater which remains all the time
perfectly soft the weight of the object though quite insignificant
is opposed to the upward curvature we may therefore conclude that it
is the irritation due to contact which excites the movement the
contact however must be prolonged for the tips of 15 radicles were
rubbed for a short time and this did not cause them to bend here then
we have a case of specialised sensibility like that of the glands of
drosera for these are exquisitely sensitive to the slightest pressure
if prolonged but not to two or three rough touches
when the tip of a radicle is lightly touched on one side with dry
nitrate of silver the injury caused is
very slight and the adjoining upper part bends away from the
cauterised point with more certainty in most cases than from an object
attached on one side here it obviously is not the mere touch but the
effect produced by the caustic which induces the tip to transmit some
influence to the adjoining part causing it to bend away if one side
of the tip is badly injured or killed by the caustic it ceases to
grow whilst the opposite side continues growing and the result is
that the tip itself bends towards the injured side and often becomes
completely hooked and it is remarkable that in this case the adjoining
upper part does not bend the stimulus is too powerful or the shock too
great for the proper influence to be transmitted from the tip we have
strictly analogous cases with drosera dionaea and pinguicula with
which plants a too powerful stimulus does not excite the tentacles to
become incurved or the lobes to close or the margin to be folded
inwards
with respect to the degree of sensitiveness of the apex to contact
under favourable conditions we have seen that with vicia faba a little
square of writingpaper affixed with shellac sufficed to cause
movement as did on one occasion a square of merely damped goldbeaters
skin but it acted very slowly short bits of moderately thick bristle
of which measurements have been given affixed with gumwater acted in
only three out of eleven trials and beads of dried shellac under
1200th of a grain in weight acted only twice in nine cases so that
here we have nearly reached the minimum of necessary irritation the
apex therefore is much less sensitive to pressure than the glands of
drosera for these are affected by far thinner objects than bits of
bristle and by a very much less weight than 1200th of a grain
but the most interesting evidence of the delicate sensitiveness of the
tip of the radicle was afforded by its power of discriminating between
equalsized squares of cardlike and very thin paper when these were
attached on opposite sides as was observed with the radicles of the
bean and oak
when radicles of the bean are extended horizontally with squares of
card attached to the lower sides of their tips the irritation thus
caused was always conquered by geotropism which then acts under the
most favourable conditions at right angles to the radicle but when
objects were attached to the radicles of any of the abovenamed genera
suspended vertically the irritation conquered geotropism which latter
power at first acted obliquely on the radicle so that the immediate
irritation from the attached object aided by its aftereffects
prevailed and caused the radicle to bend upwards until sometimes the
point was directed to the zenith we must however assume that the
aftereffects of the irritation of the tip by an attached object come
into play only after movement has been excited the tips of the
radicles of the pea seem to be more sensitive to contact than those of
the bean for when they were extended horizontally with squares of card
adhering to their lower sides a most curious struggle occasionally
arose sometimes one and sometimes the other force prevailing but
ultimately geotropism was always victorious nevertheless in two
instances the terminal part became so much curved upwards that loops
were subsequently formed with the pea therefore the irritation from
an attached object and from geotropism when acting at right angles to
the radicle are nearly balanced forces closely similar results were
observed with the horizontally extended radicles of cucurbita
ovifera
when their tips were slightly cauterised on the lower side
finally the several coordinated movements by which radicles are
enabled to perform their proper functions are admirably perfect in
whatever direction the primary radicle first protrudes from the seed
geotropism guides it perpendicularly downwards and the capacity to be
acted on by the attraction of gravity resides in the tip but sachs has
proved15 that the secondary radicles or those emitted by the primary
one are acted on by geotropism in such a manner that they tend to bend
only obliquely downwards if they had been acted on like the primary
radicle all the radicles would have penetrated the ground in a close
bundle we have seen that if the end of the primary radicle is cut off
or injured the adjoining secondary radicles become geotropic and grow
vertically downwards this power must often be of great service to the
plant when the primary radicle has been destroyed by the larvae of
insects burrowing animals or any other accident the tertiary
radicles or those emitted by the secondary ones are not influenced
at least in the case of the bean by geotropism so they grow out
freely in all directions from this manner of growth of the various
kinds of radicles they are distributed together with their absorbent
hairs throughout the surrounding soil as sachs has remarked in the
most advantageous manner for the whole soil is thus closely searched
 15 arbeiten bot institut wrzburg heft iv 1874 pp 605631
geotropism as was shown in the last chapter excites the primary
radicle to bend downwards with very little force quite insufficient to
penetrate the ground such penetration is effected by the pointed
apex protected by the rootcap being pressed down by the longitudinal
expansion or growth of the terminal rigid portion aided by its
transverse expansion both of which forces act powerfully it is
however indispensable that the seeds should be at first held down in
some manner when they lie on the bare surface they are held down by
the attachment of the roothairs to any adjoining objects and this
apparently is effected by the conversion of their outer surfaces into a
cement but many seeds get covered up by various accidents or they
fall into crevices or holes with some seeds their own weight suffices
the circumnutating movement of the terminal growing part both of the
primary and secondary radicles is so feeble that it can aid them very
little in penetrating the ground excepting when the superficial layer
is very soft and damp but it must aid them materially when they happen
to break obliquely into cracks or into burrows made by earthworms or
larvae this movement moreover combined with the sensitiveness of the
tip to contact can hardly fail to be of the highest importance for as
the tip is always endeavouring to bend to all sides it will press on
all sides and will thus be able to discriminate between the harder and
softer adjoining surfaces in the same manner as it discriminated
between the attached squares of cardlike and thin paper consequently
it will tend to bend from the harder soil and will thus follow the
lines of least resistance so it will be if it meets with a stone or
the root of another plant in the soil as must incessantly occur if
the tip were not sensitive and if it did not excite the upper part of
the root to bend away whenever it encountered at right angles some
obstacle in the ground it would be liable
to be doubled up into a contorted mass but we have seen with radicles
growing down inclined plates of glass that as soon as the tip merely
touched a slip of wood cemented across the plate the whole terminal
growing part curved away so that the tip soon stood at right angles to
its former direction and thus it would be with an obstacle encountered
in the ground as far as the pressure of the surrounding soil would
permit we can also understand why thick and strong radicles like
those of sculus should be endowed with less sensitiveness than more
delicate ones for the former would be able by the force of their
growth to overcome any slight obstacle
after a radicle which has been deflected by some stone or root from
its natural downward course reaches the edge of the obstacle
geotropism will direct it to grow again straight downward but we know
that geotropism acts with very little force and here another excellent
adaptation as sachs has remarked16 comes into play for the upper
part of the radicle a little above the apex is as we have seen
likewise sensitive and this sensitiveness causes the radicle to bend
like a tendril towards the touching object so that as it rubs over the
edge of an obstacle it will bend downwards and the curvature thus
induced is abrupt in which respect it differs from that caused by the
irritation of one side of the tip this downward bending coincides with
that due to geotropism and both will cause the root to resume its
original course
 16 arbeiten bot inst wrzburg heft iii p 456
as radicles perceive an excess of moisture in the air on one side and
bend towards this side we may infer that they will act in the same
manner with respect to moisture in the earth the sensitiveness to
moisture
resides in the tip which determines the bending of the upper part
this capacity perhaps partly accounts for the extent to which
drainpipes often become choked with roots
considering the several facts given in this chapter we see that the
course followed by a root through the soil is governed by
extraordinarily complex and diversified agenciesby geotropism acting
in a different manner on the primary secondary and tertiary
radiclesby sensitiveness to contact different in kind in the apex
and in the part immediately above the apex and apparently by
sensitiveness to the varying dampness of different parts of the soil
these several stimuli to movement are all more powerful than
geotropism when this acts obliquely on a radicle which has been
deflected from its perpendicular downward course the roots moreover
of most plants are excited by light to bend either to or from it but
as roots are not naturally exposed to the light it is doubtful whether
this sensitiveness which is perhaps only the indirect result of the
radicles being highly sensitive to other stimuli is of any service to
the plant the direction which the apex takes at each successive period
of the growth of a root ultimately determines its whole course it is
therefore highly important that the apex should pursue from the first
the most advantageous direction and we can thus understand why
sensitiveness to geotropism to contact and to moisture all reside in
the tip and why the tip determines the upper growing part to bend
either from or to the exciting cause a radicle may be compared with a
burrowing animal such as a mole which wishes to penetrate
perpendicularly down into the ground by continually moving his head
from side to side or circumnutating he will feel any stone
or other obstacle as well as any difference in the hardness of the
soil and he will turn from that side if the earth is damper on one
than on the other side he will turn thitherward as a better
huntingground nevertheless after each interruption guided by the
sense of gravity he will be able to recover his downward course and to
burrow to a greater depth

we have seen in the first chapter that the stems of all seedlings
whether hypocotyls or epicotyls as well as the cotyledons and the
radicles are continually circumnutatingthat is they grow first on one
side and then on another such growth being probably preceded by
increased turgescence of the cells as it was unlikely that plants
should change their manner of growth with advancing age it seemed
probable that the various organs of all plants at all ages as long as
they continued to grow would be found to circumnutate though perhaps
to an extremely small extent as it was important for us to discover
whether this was the case we determined to observe carefully a certain
number of plants which were growing vigorously and which were not
known to move in any manner we commenced with stems observations of
this kind are tedious and it appeared to us that it would be
sufficient to observe the stems in about a score of genera belonging
to widely distinct families and inhabitants of various countries
several plants
were selected which from being woody or for other reasons seemed the
least likely to circumnutate the observations and the diagrams were

length was placed under a microscope furnished with an eyepiece
micrometer and the tip of the largest leaf was
found to be in constant movement it crossed five divisions of the
micrometer that is 1100th of an inch in 6 m 20 s there could
hardly be a doubt that it was the stem which chiefly moved for the tip
did not get quickly out of focus and this would have occurred had the
movement been confined to the leaf which moves up or down in nearly
the same vertical plane

4 pelargonium zonale geraniaceae fam 47a young plant 7
inches in height was observed in the usual manner but in order to
see the bead at the end of the glass filament and at the same time the
mark beneath it was necessary to cut off three leaves on one side we
do not know whether it was owing to this cause or to the plant having
previously become bent to one side through heliotropism but from the
morning of the 7th of march to 1030 pm on the 8th the stem moved a
considerable distance in a zigzag line in the same general direction
during the night of the 8th it moved to some distance at right angles
to its former course and next morning 9th stood for a time almost
still at noon on the 9th a new tracing was begun see fig 71 which
was continued till 8 am on the 11th between noon on the 9th and 5
pm on the 10th ie in the course of 29 h the stem described a
circle this plant therefore circumnutates but at a very slow rate
and to a small extent

5 tropaeolum majus  dwarfed var called tom thumb
geraniaceae fam 47the species of this genus climb by the
aid of their sensitive petioles but some of them also twine round
supports but even these latter species do not begin to circumnutate in
a conspicuous manner whilst young the variety here treated of has a
rather thick stem and is so dwarf that apparently it does not climb in
any manner we therefore wished to ascertain whether the stem of a
young plant consisting of two internodes together 32 inches in
height circumnutated it was observed during 25 h and we see in fig
72 that the stem moved in a zigzag course indicating circumnutation

here give only a single instance fig 73 showing the circumnutation
of the stem of a large plant of a clover trifolium resupinatum in the

raised from a cross between the raspberry rubus idus and a north
american rubus it was observed in the usual manner during the morning
of march 14th the stem almost completed a circle and then moved far to
the right at 4 pm it reversed its course and now a fresh tracing
was begun which was continued during 40 h and is given in fig 74

10 cereus speciocissimus garden var sometimes called phyllocactus
multiflorus cacte fam 109this plant which was growing
vigorously from having been removed a few days before from the
greenhouse to the hothouse was observed with especial interest as it
seemed so little probable that the stem would circumnutate the
branches are flat or flabelliform but some of them are triangular in
section with the three sides hollowed out a branch of this latter
shape 9 inches in length and 1 in diameter was chosen for
observation as less likely to circumnutate than a flabelliform branch
the movement of the bead at the end of the glass filament affixed to
the summit of the branch was traced a fig 77 from 923 am to
430 pm on nov 23rd during which time it changed its course greatly
six times on the 24th another tracing was made see b and the bead
on this day changed its course oftener making in 8 h what may be
considered as four ellipses with their longer axes differently
directed the position of the stem and its commencing course on the
following morning are likewise shown there can be no doubt that this
branch though appearing quite rigid circumnutated but the
extreme amount of movement during the time was very small probably
rather less than the 120th of an inch

11 hedera helix araliaceae fam 114the stem is known to be
apheliotropic and several seedlings growing in a pot in the greenhouse
became bent in the middle of the summer at right angles from the light
on sept 2nd some of these stems were tied up so as to stand
vertically and were placed before a northeast window but to our
surprise they were now decidedly heliotropic for during 4 days they
curved themselves towards the light and their course being traced on a
horizontal glass was strongly zigzag during the 6 succeeding days
they circumnutated over the same small space at a slow rate but there
could be no doubt about their circumnutation the plants were kept
exactly in the same place before the window and after an interval of
15 days the stems were again observed during 2 days and their movements
traced and
they were found to be still circumnutating but on a yet smaller scale

14 plumbago capensis plumbagineae fam 134a small lateral
branch which projected from a tall freely growing bush at an angle of
35 above the horizon was selected for observation for the first 11
h it moved to a considerable distance in a nearly straight line to one
side owing probably to its having been previously deflected by the
light whilst standing in the greenhouse at 720 pm on march 7th a
fresh tracing was begun and continued for the next 43 h 40 m see
fig 80 during the first 2 h it followed nearly the same direction
as before and then changed it a little during the night it moved at
nearly right angles to its previous course next
day 8th it zigzagged greatly and on the 9th moved irregularly round
and round a small circular space by 3 pm on the 9th the figure had
become so complicated that no more dots could be made but the shoot
continued during the evening of the 9th the whole of the 10th and the
morning of the 11th to circumnutate over the same small space which
was only about the 126th of an inch 97 mm in diameter although
this branch circumnutated to a very small extent yet it changed its
course frequently the movements ought to have been more magnified

16 verbena melindres  a scarletflowered herbaceous var
verbenaceaea shoot 8 inches in height had been laid horizontally
for the sake of observing its apogeotropism and the terminal portion
had grown vertically upwards for a length of 1 inch a glass filament
with a bead at the end was fixed upright to the tip and its movements
were traced during 41 h 30 m on a vertical glass fig 82 under
these circumstances the lateral movements were chiefly shown but as
the lines from side to side are not on the same level the shoot
must have moved in a plane at right angles to that of the lateral
movement that is it must have circumnutated on the next day 6th
the shoot moved in the course of 16 h four times to the right and
four times to the left and this apparently represents the formation of
four ellipses so that each was completed in 4 h 17 ceratophyllum
demersum ceratophylleae fam 220an interesting account of the
movements of the stem of this waterplant has been published by m e
rodier1 the movements are confined to the young internodes becoming
less and less lower down the stem and they are extraordinary from
their amplitude the stems sometimes moved through an angle of above
200 in 6 h and in one instance through 220 in 3 h they generally
bent from right to left in the morning and in an opposite direction in
the afternoon but the movement was sometimes temporarily reversed or
quite arrested it was not affected by light it does not appear that
m rodier made any diagram on a horizontal plane representing the
actual course pursued by the apex but he speaks of the branches
executing round their axes of growth a movement of torsion from the
particulars above given and remembering in the case of twining plants
and of tendrils how difficult it is not to mistake their bending to
all points of the compass for true torsion we are led to believe that
the stems of this ceratophyllum circumnutate probably in the shape of
narrow ellipses each completed in about 26 h the following statement
however seems to indicate something different from ordinary
circumnutation but we cannot fully understand it m rodier says il
est alors facile de voir que le mouvement de flexion se produit dabord
dans les mrithalles suprieurs quil se propage ensuite en
samoindrissant du haut en bas tandis quau contraire le movement de

figures in the course of 35 h 15 m
concluding remarks on the circumnutation of stemsany one who will
inspect the diagrams now given and will bear in mind the widely
separated position of the plants described in the seriesremembering
that we have good grounds for the belief that the hypocotyls and
epicotyls of all seedlings circumnutatenot forgetting the number of
plants distributed in the most distinct families which climb by a
similar movementwill probably admit that the growing stems of all
plants if carefully observed would be found to circumnutate to a
greater or less extent when we treat of the sleep and other movements
of plants many other cases of circumnutating stems will be
incidentally given in looking at the diagrams we should remember that
the stems were always growing so that in each case the circumnutating
apex as it rose will have described a spire of some kind the dots were
made on the glasses generally at intervals of an hour or hour and a
half and were then joined by straight lines if they had been made at
intervals of 2 or 3 minutes the lines would have been more
curvilinear as in the case of the tracks left on the smoked
glassplates by the tips of the circumnutating radicles of seedling
plants the diagrams generally approach in form to a succession of more
or less irregular ellipses or ovals with their longer axes directed to
different points of the compass during the same day or on succeeding
days the stems
therefore sooner or later bend to all sides but after a stem has
bent in any one direction it commonly bends back at first in nearly
though not quite the opposite direction and this gives the tendency
to the formation of ellipses which are generally narrow but not so
narrow as those described by stolons and leaves on the other hand the
figures sometimes approach in shape to circles whatever the figure may
be the course pursued is often interrupted by zigzags small
triangles loops or ellipses a stem may describe a single large
ellipse one day and two on the next with different plants the
complexity rate and amount of movement differ much the stems for
instance of iberis and azalea described only a single large ellipse in
24 h whereas those of the deutzia made four or five deep zigzags or
narrow ellipses in 11 h and those of the trifolium three triangular
or quadrilateral figures in 7 h
circumnutation of stolons or runners
stolons consist of much elongated flexible branches which run along
the surface of the ground and form roots at a distance from the
parentplant they are therefore of the same homological nature as
stems and the three following cases may be added to the twenty
previously given cases
fragaria cultivated garden var rosaceaea plant growing in a pot
had emitted a long stolon this was supported by a stick so that it
projected for the length of several inches horizontally a glass
filament bearing two minute triangles of paper was affixed to the
terminal bud which was a little upturned and its movements were
traced during 21 h as shown in fig 85 in the course of the first 12
h it moved twice up and twice down in somewhat zigzag lines and no
doubt travelled in the same manner during the night on the following
morning after an interval of 20 h the apex stood a little higher than
it did at first and this shows that the stolon had not been acted on
within this time by geotropism2 nor had its own weight caused it to
bend downwards
 2 dr a b frank states die naturliche wagerechte richtung von
 pflanzentheilen 1870 p 20 that the stolons of this plant are
 acted on by geotropism but only after a considerable interval of
 time
fig 85 fragaria circumnutation of stolon kept in darkness traced
on vertical glass from 1045 am may 18th to 745 am on 19th
on the following morning 19th the glass filament was detached and
refixed close behind the bud as it appeared possible that the
circumnutation of the terminal bud and of the adjoining part of the
stolon might be different the movement was now traced during two
consecutive days fig 86 during the first day the filament travelled
in the course of 14 h 30 m five times up and four times down besides
some lateral movement on the 20th the course was even more
complicated and can hardly be followed in the figure but the filament
moved in 16 h at least five times up and five times down with very
little
lateral deflection the first and last dots made on this second day
viz at 7 am and 11 pm were close together showing that the
stolon had not fallen or risen nevertheless by comparing its position
on the morning of the 19th and 21st it is obvious that the stolon had
sunk and this may be attributed to slow bending down either from its
own weight or from geotropism
fig 86 fragaria circumnutation of the same stolon as in the last
figure observed in the same manner and traced from 8 am may 19th to
8 am 21st
during a part of the 20th an orthogonal tracing was made by applying a
cube of wood to the vertical glass and bringing the apex of the stolon
at successive periods into a line with one edge a dot being made each
time on the glass this tracing therefore represented very nearly the
actual amount of movement of the apex and in the course of 9 h the
distance of the extreme dots from one another was 45 inch by the same
method it was ascertained that the apex moved between 7 am on the
20th and 8 am on the 21st a distance of 82 inch
a younger and shorter stolon was supported so that it projected at
about 45 above the horizon and its movement was traced by the same
orthogonal method on the first day the apex soon rose above the field
of vision by the next morning it had sunk and the course pursued was
now traced during 14 h 30 m fig 87 the amount of movement was
almost the same
from side to side as up and down and differed in this respect
remarkably from the movement in the previous cases during the latter
part of the day viz between 3 and 1030 pm the actual distance
travelled by the apex amounted to 115 inch and in the course of the
whole day to at least 267 inches this is an amount of movement almost
comparable with that of some climbing plants the same stolon was
observed on the following day and now it moved in a somewhat less
complex manner in a plane not far from vertical the extreme amount of
actual movement was 155 inch in one direction and 6 inch in another
direction at right angles during neither of these days did the stolon
bend downwards through geotropism or its own weight
fig 87 fragaria circumnutation of another and younger stolon traced
from 8 am to 1030 pm figure reduced to onehalf of original scale
four stolons still attached to the plant were laid on damp sand in the
back of a room with their tips facing the northeast windows they
were thus placed because de vries says3 that they are apheliotropic
when exposed to the light of the sun but we could not perceive any
effect from the above feeble degree of illumination we may add that on
another occasion late in the summer some stolons placed upright
before a southwest window
on a cloudy day became distinctly curved towards the light and were
therefore heliotropic close in front of the tips of the prostrate
stolons a crowd of very thin sticks and the dried haulms of grasses
were driven into the sand to represent the crowded stems of
surrounding plants in a state of nature this was done for the sake of
observing how the growing stolons would pass through them they did so
easily in the course of 6 days and their circumnutation apparently
facilitated their passage when the tips encountered sticks so close
together that they could not pass between them they rose up and passed
over them the sticks and haulms were removed after the passage of the
four stolons two of which were found to have assumed a permanently
sinuous shape and two were still straight but to this subject we
shall recur under saxifraga
 3 arbeiten bot inst wrzburg 1872 p 434
saxifraga sarmentosa saxifrageaea plant in a suspended pot had
emitted long branched stolons which depended like threads on all
sides two were tied up so as to stand vertically and their upper ends
became gradually bent downwards but so slowly in the course of several
days that the bending was probably due to their weight and not to
geotropism a glass filament with little triangles of paper was fixed
to the end of one of these stolons which was 17 inches in length and
had already become much bent down but still projected at a
considerable angle above the horizon it moved only slightly three
times from side to side and then upwards on the following day
the movement was even less as this stolon was so long we thought that
its growth was nearly completed so we tried another which was thicker
and shorter viz 10 14 inches in length it moved greatly chiefly
upwards and changed its course five times in the course of the day
during the night it curved so much upwards in opposition to gravity
that the movement could no longer be traced on the vertical glass and
a horizontal one had to be used the movement was followed during the
next 25 h as shown in fig 88 three irregular ellipses with their
longer axes somewhat differently directed were almost completed in the
first 15 h the extreme actual amount of movement of the tip during the
25 h was 75 inch several stolons were laid on a flat surface of damp
sand in the same manner as with those of the strawberry the friction
of the sand did not interfere with their circumnutation nor could we
detect any evidence of their being sensitive to contact in order to
see how in a state of nature they would act when encountering a stone
or other obstacle on the ground short pieces of smoked glass an inch
in height were stuck upright into the sand in front of two thin
lateral branches their tips scratched the smoked surface in various
directions one made three upward and two downward lines besides a
nearly horizontal one the other curled quite away from the glass but
ultimately both surmounted the glass and pursued their original course
the apex of a third thick stolon swept up the glass in a curved line
recoiled and again came into contact with it it then moved to the
right and after ascending descended vertically ultimately it passed
round one end of the glass instead of over it
fig 88 saxifraga sarmentosa circumnutation of an inclined stolon
traced in darkness on a horizontal glass from 745 am april 18th to
9 am on 19th movement of end of stolon magnified 22 times
many long pins were next driven rather close together into the sand so
as to form a crowd in front of the same two thin lateral branches but
these easily wound their way through the crowd a thick stolon was much
delayed in its passage at one place it was forced to turn at right
angles to its former course at another place it could not pass through
the pins and the hinder part became bowed it then curved upwards and
passed through an opening between the upper part of some pins which
happened to diverge it then descended and finally emerged through the
crowd this stolon was rendered permanently sinuous to a slight degree
and was thicker where sinuous than elsewhere apparently from its
longitudinal growth having been checked
cotyledon umbilicus crassulacea plant growing in a pan
of damp moss had emitted 2 stolons 22 and 20 inches in length one of
these was supported so that a length of 4 inches projected in a
straight and horizontal line and the movement of the apex was traced
the first dot was made at 910 am the terminal portion soon began to
bend downwards and continued to do so until noon therefore a straight
line very nearly as long as the whole figure here given fig 89 was
first traced on the glass but the upper part of this line has not been
copied in the diagram the curvature occurred in the middle
of the penultimate internode and its chief seat was at the distance of
1 14 inch from the apex it appeared due to the weight of the terminal
portion acting on the more flexible part of the internode and not to
geotropism the apex after thus sinking down from 910 am to noon
moved a little to the left it then rose up and circumnutated in a
nearly vertical plane until 1035 pm on the following day 26th it
was observed from 640 am to 520 pm and within this time it moved
twice up and twice down on the morning of the 27th the apex stood as
high as it did at 1130 am on the 25th nor did it sink down during
the 28th but continued to circumnutate about the same place
fig 89 cotyledon umbilicus circumnutation of stolon traced from
1115 am aug 25th to 11 am 27th plant illuminated from above the
terminal internode was 25 inch in length the penultimate 225 and the
third 30 inches in length apex of stolon stood at a distance of 575
inches from the vertical glass but it was not possible to ascertain
how much the tracing was magnified as it was not known how great a
length of the internode circumnutated
another stolon which resembled the last in almost every
respect was observed during the same two days but only two inches of
the terminal portion was allowed to project freely and horizontally on
the 25th it continued from 910 am to 130 pm to bend straight
downwards apparently owing to its weight fig 90 but after this
hour until 1035 pm it zigzagged this fact deserves notice for we
here probably see the combined effects of the bending down from weight
and of circumnutation the stolon however did not circumnutate when
it first began to bend down as may be observed in the present diagram
and as was still more evident in the last case when a longer portion
of the stolon was left unsupported on the following day 26th the
stolon moved twice up and twice down but still continued to fall in
the evening and during the night it travelled from some unknown cause
in an oblique direction
fig 90 cotyledon umbilicus circumnutation and downward movement of
another stolon traced on vertical glass from 911 am aug 25th to
11 am 27th apex close to glass so that figure but little magnified
and here reduced to twothirds of original size
we see from these three cases that stolons or runners circumnutate in a
very complex manner the lines generally extend in a vertical plane
and this may probably be attributed to the effect of the weight of the
unsupported end of the stolon but there is always some and
occasionally a considerable amount of lateral movement the
circumnutation is so great in amplitude that it may almost be compared
with that of climbing plants that the stolons are thus aided in
passing over obstacles and in winding between the stems of the
surrounding plants the observations above given render almost certain
if they had not circumnutated their tips would have been liable to
have been doubled up as often as they met with obstacles in their
path but as it is they easily avoid them this must be a considerable
advantage to the plant in spreading from its parentstock but we are
far from supposing that the power has been gained by the stolons for
this purpose for circumnutation seems to be of universal occurrence
with all growing parts but it is not improbable that the amplitude of
the movement may have been specially increased for this purpose
circumnutation of flowerstems
we did not think it necessary to make any special observations on the
circumnutation of flowerstems these being axial in their nature like
stems or stolons but some were incidentally made whilst attending to
other subjects and these we will here briefly give a few observations
have also been made by other botanists these taken together suffice to
render it probable that all peduncles and subpeduncles circumnutate
whilst growing
oxalis carnosathe peduncle which springs from the thick and woody
stem of this plant bears three or four subpeduncles a filament with
little triangles of paper was fixed within the calyx of a flower which
stood upright its movements were observed for 48 h during the first
half of this time the flower was fully expanded and during the second
half withered the figure here given fig 91 represents 8 or 9
ellipses although the main peduncle circumnutated and described one
large and
two smaller ellipses in the course of 24 h yet the chief seat of
movement lies in the subpeduncles which ultimately bend vertically
downwards as will be described in a future chapter the peduncles of
oxalis acetosella likewise bend downwards and afterwards when the
pods are nearly mature upwards and this is effected by a
circumnutating movement
fig 91 oxalis carnosa flowerstem feebly illuminated from above
its circumnutation traced from 9 am april 13th to 9 am 15th summit
of flower 8 inches beneath the horizontal glass movement probably
magnified about 6 times
it may be seen in the above figure that the flowerstem of o carnosa
circumnutated during two days about the same spot on the other hand
the flowerstem of o sensitiva undergoes a strongly marked daily
periodical change of position when kept at a proper temperature in
the middle of the day it stands vertically up or at a high angle in
the afternoon it sinks and in the evening projects horizontally or
almost horizontally rising again during the night this movement
continues from the period when the flowers are in bud to when as we
believe the pods are mature and it ought perhaps to have been
included amongst the socalled sleepmovements of plants a tracing was
not made but the angles were measured at successive periods during one
whole day and these showed that the movement was not continuous but
that the peduncle oscillated up and down we may therefore conclude
that it circumnutated at the base of the peduncle there is a mass of
small cells forming a welldeveloped pulvinus which is exteriorly
coloured purple and hairy in no other genus as far as we know is the
peduncle furnished with a pulvinus the peduncle of o ortegesii
behaved differently from that of o sensitiva for it stood at a less
angle above the horizon in the middle of the day then in the morning
or evening by 1020 pm it had risen greatly during the middle of
the day it oscillated much up and down
trifolium subterraneuma filament was fixed vertically to the
uppermost part of the peduncle of a young and upright flowerhead the
stem of the plant having been secured to a stick and its movements
were traced during 36 h within this time it described see fig 92 a
figure which represents four ellipses but during the latter part of
the time the peduncle began to bend downwards and after 1030 pm on
the 24th it curved so rapidly down that by 645 am on the 25th it
stood only 19 above the horizon it went on circumnutating in nearly
the same position for two days even after the flowerheads have buried
themselves in the ground they continue as will hereafter be shown to
circumnutate it will also be seen in the next chapter that the
subpeduncles of the separate flowers of
trifolium repens circumnutate in a complicated course during several
days i may add that the gynophore of arachis hypogoea which looks
exactly like a peduncle circumnutates whilst growing vertically
downwards in order to bury the young pod in the ground

the movements of the flowers of cyclamen persicum were not observed
but the peduncle whilst the pod is forming increases much in length
and bows itself down by a circumnutating movement a young peduncle of
maurandia semperflorens 1 inch in length was carefully observed
during a whole day and it made 4 narrow vertical irregular and
short ellipses each at an average rate of about 2 h 25 m an
adjoining peduncle described during the same time similar though
fewer ellipses4 according to sachs5 the flowerstems whilst
growing
of many plants for instance those of brassica napus revolve or
circumnutate those of allium porrum bend from side to side and if
this movement had been traced on a horizontal glass no doubt ellipses
would have been formed fritz mller has described6 the spontaneous
revolving movements of the flowerstems of an alisma which he compares
with those of a climbing plant

 state that the flowerstalks of many plants occupy different positions

 plants that this implies circumnutation

we made no observations on the movements of the different parts of
flowers morren however has observed7 in the stamens of sparmannia
and cereus a fremissement spontan which it may be suspected is a
circumnutating movement the circumnutation of the gynostemium of
stylidium as described by gad8 is highly remarkable and apparently
aids in the fertilisation of the flowers the gynostemium whilst
spontaneously moving comes into contact with the viscid labellum to
which it adheres until freed by the increasing tension of the parts or
by being touched

we have now seen that the flowerstems of plants belonging to such
widely different families as the cruciferae oxalid leguminosae
primulaceae scrophularineae alismaceae and liliaceae circumnutate
and that there are indications of this movement in many other families
with these facts before us bearing also in mind that the tendrils of
not a few plants consist of modified peduncles we may admit without
much doubt that all growing flowerstems circumnutate
circumnutation of leaves dicotyledons
several distinguished botanists hofmeister sachs pfeffer de vries
batalin millardet etc have
observed and some of them with the greatest care the periodical
movements of leaves but their attention has been chiefly though not
exclusively directed to those which move largely and are commonly said
to sleep at night from considerations hereafter to be given plants of
this nature are here excluded and will be treated of separately as we
wished to ascertain whether all young and growing leaves circumnutated
we thought that it would be sufficient if we observed between 30 and 40
genera widely distributed throughout the vegetable series selecting
some unusual forms and others on woody plants all the plants were
healthy and grew in pots they were illuminated from above but the
light perhaps was not always sufficiently bright as many of them were
observed under a skylight of groundglass except in a few specified
cases a fine glass filament with two minute triangles of paper was
fixed to the leaves and their movements were traced on a vertical
glass when not stated to the contrary in the manner already
described i may repeat that the broken lines represent the nocturnal
course the stem was always secured to a stick close to the base of
the leaf under observation the arrangement of the species with the
number of the family appended is the same as in the case of stems

pitcher 8 inches in height with the bladder swollen but with the
hood not as yet open had a filament fixed transversely
across its apex it was observed for 48 h and during the whole of
this time it circumnutated in a nearly similar manner but to a very
small extent the tracing given fig 93 relates only to the movement
during the first 26 h
2 glaucium luteum papaveraceae fam 12a young plant bearing
only 8 leaves had a filament attached to the youngest leaf but one
which was 3 inches in length including the petiole the circumnutating
movement was traced during 47 h on both days the leaf descended from
before 7 am until about 11 am and then ascended slightly during
the rest of the day and the early part of the night during the latter
part of the night it fell greatly it did not ascend so much during the
second as during the first day and it descended considerably lower on
the second night than on the first this difference was probably due to
the illumination from above having been insufficient during the two
days of observation its course during the two days is shown in fig
94

3 crambe maritima cruciferae fam 14a leaf 9 inches in length
on a plant not growing vigorously was first observed its apex was in
constant movement but this could hardly be traced from being so small
in extent the apex however certainly changed its course at least 6
times in the course of 14 h a more vigorous young plant bearing only
4 leaves was then selected and a filament was affixed to the midrib
of the third leaf from the base which with the petiole was 5 inches
in length the leaf stood up almost vertically but the tip
was deflected so that the filament projected almost horizontally and
its movements were traced during 48 h on a vertical glass as shown in
the accompanying figure fig 95 we here plainly see that the leaf
was continually circumnutating but the proper periodicity of its
movements was disturbed by its being only dimly illuminated from above
through a double skylight we infer that this was the case because two
leaves on plants growing out of doors had their angles above the
horizon measured in the middle of the day and at 9 to about 10 pm on
successive nights and they were found at this latter hour to have
risen by an average angle of 9 above their midday position on the
following morning they fell to their former position now it may be
observed in the diagram that the leaf rose during the second night so
that it stood at 640 am higher than at 1020 pm on the preceding
night and this may be attributed to the leaf adjusting itself to the
dim light coming exclusively from above

4 brassica oleracea cruciferaehofmeister and batalin9 state
that the leaves of the cabbage rise at night and fall by day we
covered a young plant bearing 8 leaves under a large bellglass
placing it in the same position with respect to the
light in which it had long remained and a filament was fixed at the
distance of 4 of an inch from the apex of a young leaf nearly 4 inches
in length its movements were then traced during three days but the
tracing is not worth giving the leaf fell during the whole morning
and rose in the evening and during the early part of the night the
ascending and descending lines did not coincide so that an irregular
ellipse was formed each 24 h the basal part of the midrib did not
move as was ascertained by measuring at successive periods the angle
which it formed with the horizon so that the movement was confined to
the terminal portion of the leaf which moved through an angle of 11
in the course of 24 h and the distance travelled by the apex up and
down was between 8 and 9 of an inch
 9 flora 1873 p 437
in order to ascertain the effect of darkness a filament was fixed to a
leaf 5 inches in length borne by a plant which after forming a head
had produced a stem the leaf was inclined 44 above the horizon and
its movements were traced on a vertical glass every hour by the aid of
a taper during the first day the leaf rose from 8 am to 1040 pm
in a slightly zigzag course the actual distance travelled by the apex
being 67 of an inch during the night the leaf fell whereas it ought
to have risen and by 7 am on the following morning it had fallen 23
of an inch and it continued falling until 940 am it then rose until
1050 pm but the rise was interrupted by one considerable
oscillation that is by a fall and reascent during the second night
it again fell but only to a very short distance and on the following
morning reascended to a very short distance thus the normal course of
the leaf was greatly disturbed or rather completely inverted by the
absence of light and the movements were likewise greatly diminished in
amplitude
we may add that according to mr a stephen wilson10 the young
leaves of the swedish turnip which is a hybrid between b oleracea and
rapa draw together in the evening so much that the horizontal breadth
diminishes about 30 per cent of the daylight breadth therefore the
leaves must rise considerably at night

5 dianthus caryophyllus caryophylleae fam 26the
terminal shoot of a young plant growing very vigorously was selected
for observation the young leaves at first stand up vertically and
close together but they soon bend outwards and downwards so as to
become horizontal and often at the same time a little to one side a
filament was fixed to the tip of a young leaf whilst still highly
inclined and the first dot was made on the vertical glass at 830 am
june 13th but it curved downwards so quickly that by 640 am on the
following morning it stood only a little above the horizon in fig 96
the long slightly zigzag line representing this rapid downward course
which was somewhat inclined to the left is not given but the figure
shows the highly tortuous and zigzag course together with some loops
pursued during the next 2 days as the leaf continued to move all the
time to the left it is evident that the zigzag line represents many
circumnutations

6 camellia japonica camelliaceae fam 32a youngish leaf which
together with its petiole was 2 34 inches in length and which arose
from a side branch on a tall bush had a filament attached to its apex
this leaf sloped downwards at an angle of 40 beneath the horizon as
it was thick and rigid and its
petiole very short much movement could not be expected nevertheless
the apex changed its course completely seven times in the course of 11
h but moved to only a very small distance on the next day the
movement of the apex was traced during 26 h 20 m as shown in fig
97 and was nearly of the same nature but rather less complex the
movement seems to be periodical for on both days the leaf
circumnutated in the forenoon fell in the afternoon on the first day
until between 3 and 4 pm and on the second day until 6 pm and
then rose falling again during the night or early morning

at night and as they often do not then occupy a vertical position
especially if they have not been well illuminated during
the day it is doubtful whether some of these cases ought not to have
been included in the present chapter

was observed in the usual manner during 61 h and its course is shown

leaf moved downwards but circumnutated between 10 am and 430 pm
on the second day it sank and rose again but between 10 am and 6
pm it circumnutated on an extremely small scale on the third day the
circumnutation was more plainly marked

length measured from base of petiole to end of leaflets had a
filament affixed to the midrib of one of the two terminal leaflets and
its movements were traced during 51 h the filament fell all morning
july 2nd till 3 pm and then rose greatly till 1035 pm but the
rise this day was so great compared with that which subsequently
occurred that it was probably due in part to the plant being
illuminated from above the latter part of the course on july 2nd is
alone given in the following figure fig 100 on the next day july
3rd the leaf again fell in the morning then circumnutated in a
conspicuous manner and rose till late at night but the movement was
not traced after 715 pm as by that time the filament pointed
towards the upper edge of the glass during the latter part of the
night or early morning it again fell in the same manner as before
as the evening rise and the early morning fall were unusually large
the angle of the petiole above the horizon was measured at the two
periods and the leaf was found to have risen 19 between 1220 pm
and 1045 pm and to have fallen 23 30 seconds between the latter
hour and 1020 am on the following morning

the main petiole was now secured to a stick close to the base
of the two terminal leaflets which were 14 inch in length and the
movements of one of them were traced during 48 h see fig 101 the
course pursued is closely analogous to that of the whole leaf the
zigzag line between 830 am and 330 pm on the second day
represents 5 very small ellipses with their longer axes differently
directed from these observations it follows that both the whole leaf
and the terminal leaflets undergo a wellmarked daily periodical
movement rising in the evening and falling during the latter part of
the night or early morning whilst in the middle of the day they
generally circumnutate round the same small space

a figure representing 5 or 6 small ellipses the actual amount of

considerably between 130 pm and 4 pm but there was no evidence on
either day of a regular periodic movement

11 lupinus speciosus leguminosaeplants were raised from seed
purchased under this name this is one of the species in this large
genus the leaves of which do not sleep at night the petioles rise
direct from the ground and are from 5 to 7 inches in length a
filament was fixed to the midrib of one of the longer leaflets and the
movement of the whole leaf was traced as shown in fig 103 in the
course of 6 h 30 m the filament went four times up and three times
down a new tracing was then begun not here given and during 12 h
the leaf moved eight times up and seven times down so that it
described 7 ellipses in this time and this is an extraordinary rate
of movement the summit of the petiole was then secured to a stick and
the separate leaflets were found to be continually circumnutating

12 echeveria stolonifera crassulace fam 84the older leaves of
this plant are so thick and fleshy and the young ones so short and
broad that it seemed very improbable that any circumnutation could be
detected a filament was fixed to a young upwardly inclined leaf 75
inch in length and 28 in breadth which stood on the outside of a
terminal rosette of leaves produced by a plant growing very
vigorously its movement was traced during 3 days as here shown fig
104 the course was chiefly in an upward direction and this may be
attributed to the elongation of the leaf through growth but we see
that the lines are strongly zigzag and that occasionally there was
distinct circumnutation though on a very small scale

820 am june 25th to 845 am 28th apex of leaf 12 14 inches from

bull soc bot de france feb 14th 1868 measured the distance

we see from this table that the leaves stood considerably further apart
at 2 pm than at either 8 am or 7 pm and this shows that they
rise a little in the evening and fall or open in the forenoon
14 drosera rotundifolia droseraceae fam 85the movements of a
young leaf having a long petiole but with its tentacles or
glandbearing hairs as yet unfolded were traced during 47 h 15 m
the figure fig 105 shows that it circumnutated largely chiefly in a
vertical direction making two ellipses each
day on both days the leaf began to descend after 12 or 1 oclock and
continued to do so all night though to a very unequal distance on the
two occasions we therefore thought that the movement was periodic but
on observing three other leaves during several successive days and
nights we found this to be an error and the case is given merely as a
caution on the third morning the above leaf occupied almost exactly
the same position as on the first morning and the tentacles by this
time had unfolded sufficiently to project at right angles to the blade
or disc
fig 105 drosera rotundifolia circumnutation of young leaf with
filament fixed to back of blade traced from 915 am june 7th to 830
am june 9th figure here reduced to onehalf original scale
the leaves as they grow older generally sink more and more downwards
the movement of an oldish leaf the glands of which were still
secreting freely was traced for 24 h during which time it continued
to sink a little in a slightly zigzag line on the following morning
at 7 am a drop of a solution of carbonate of ammonia 2 gr to 1 oz
of water was placed on the disc and this blackened the glands and
induced inflection of many of the tentacles the weight of the drop
caused the leaf at first to sink a little but immediately afterwards
it began to rise in a somewhat zigzag course and continued to do so
till 3 pm it then circumnutated about the same spot on a very small
scale for 21 h and during the next 21 h it sank in a zigzag line to
nearly the same level which it had held when the ammonia was first
administered by this time the tentacles had reexpanded and the
glands had recovered their proper colour we thus learn that an old
leaf
circumnutates on a small scale at least whilst absorbing carbonate of
ammonia for it is probable that this absorption may stimulate growth
and thus reexcite circumnutation whether the rising of the glass
filament which was attached to the back of the leaf resulted from its
margin becoming slightly inflected as generally occurs or from the
rising of the petiole was not ascertained
in order to learn whether the tentacles or glandbearing hairs
circumnutate the back of a young leaf with the innermost tentacles as
yet incurved was firmly cemented with shellac to a flat stick driven
into compact damp argillaceous sand the plant was placed under a
microscope with the stage removed and with an eyepiece micrometer of
which each division equalled 1500 of an inch it should be stated that
as the leaves grow older the tentacles of the exterior rows bend
outwards and downwards so as ultimately to become deflected
considerably beneath the horizon a tentacle in the second row from the
margin was selected for observation and was found to be moving
outwards at a rate of 1500 of an inch in 20 m or 1100 of inch in 1
h 40 m but as it likewise moved from side to side to an extent of
above 1500 of inch the movement was probably one of modified
circumnutation a tentacle on an old leaf was next observed in the same
manner in 15 m after being placed under the microscope it had moved
about 11000 of an inch during the next 7 h it was looked at
repeatedly and during this whole time it moved only another 11000 of
an inch and this small movement may have been due to the settling of
the damp sand on which the plant rested though the sand had been
firmly pressed down we may therefore conclude that the tentacles when
old do not circumnutate yet this tentacle was so sensitive that in 23
seconds after its gland had been merely touched with a bit of raw meat
it began to curl inwards this fact is of some importance as it
apparently shows that the inflection of the tentacles from the stimulus
of absorbed animal matter and no doubt from that of contact with any
object is not due to modified circumnutation
15 dionoea muscipula droseraceaeit should be premised that the
leaves at an early stage of their development have the two lobes
pressed closely together these are at first directed back towards the
centre of the plant but they gradually rise up and soon stand at right
angles to the petiole and ultimately in nearly a straight line with
it a young leaf which with the
petiole was only 12 inch in length had a filament fixed externally
along the midrib of the still closed lobes which projected at right
angles to the petiole in the evening this leaf completed an ellipse in
the course of 2 h on the following day sept 25th its movements were
traced during 22 h and we see in fig 106 that it moved in the same
general direction due to the straightening of the leaf but in an
extremely zigzag line this line represents several drawnout or
modified ellipses there can therefore be no doubt that this young leaf
circumnutated
fig 106 dionaea muscipula circumnutation of a young and expanding
leaf traced on a horizontal glass in darkness from noon sept 24th to
10 am 25th apex of leaf 13 inches from the glass so tracing
considerably magnified
a rather old horizontally extended leaf with a filament attached
along the under side of the midrib was next observed during 7 h it
hardly moved but when one of its sensitive hairs was touched the
blades closed though not very quickly a new dot was now made on the
glass but in the course of 14 h 20 m there was hardly any change in
the position of the filament we may therefore infer that an old and
only moderately sensitive leaf does not circumnutate plainly but we
shall soon see that it by no means follows that such a leaf is
absolutely motionless we may further infer that the stimulus from a
touch does not reexcite plain circumnutation
another fullgrown leaf had a filament attached externally along one
side of the midrib and parallel to it so that the filament would move
if the lobes closed it should be first stated that although a touch
on one of the sensitive hairs of a vigorous leaf causes it to close
quickly often almost instantly yet when a bit of damp meat or some
solution of carbonate of ammonia is placed on the lobes they close so
slowly that generally 24 h is required for the completion of the act
the above leaf was first observed for 2 h 30 m and did not
circumnutate but it ought to have been observed for a
longer period although as we have seen a young leaf completed a
fairly large ellipse in 2 h a drop of an infusion of raw meat was then
placed on the leaf and within 2 h the glass filament rose a little
and this implies that the lobes had begun to close and perhaps the
petiole to rise it continued to rise with extreme slowness for the
next 8 h 30 m the position of the pot was then 715 pm sept
24th slightly changed and an additional drop of the infusion given
and a new tracing was begun fig 107 by 1050 pm the filament had
risen only a little more and it fell during the night on the
following morning the lobes were closing more quickly and by 5 pm it
was evident to the eye that they had closed considerably by 848 pm
this was still plainer and by 1045 pm the marginal spikes were
interlocked the leaf fell a little during the night and next morning
25th at 7 am the lobes were completely shut the course pursued as
may be seen in the figure was strongly zigzag and this indicates that
the closing of the lobes was combined with the circumnutation of the
whole leaf and there cannot be much doubt considering how motionless
the leaf was during 2 h 30 m before it received the infusion that
the absorption of the animal matter had excited it to circumnutate the
leaf was occasionally observed for the next four days but was kept in
rather too cool a place nevertheless it continued to circumnutate to
a small extent and the lobes remained closed

a fullgrown leaf whilst absorbing an infusion of raw meat traced in
darkness from 715 pm sept 24th to 9 am 26th apex of leaf 8
inches from the vertical glass figure here reduced to twothirds of

it is sometimes stated in botanical works that the lobes close or sleep
at night but this is an error to test the statement very long glass
filaments were fixed inside the two lobes of three leaves and the
distances between their tips were measured in the middle of the day and
at night but no difference could be detected
the previous observations relate to the movements of the whole leaf
but the lobes move independently of the petiole and
seem to be continually opening and shutting to a very small extent a
nearly fullgrown leaf afterwards proved to be highly sensitive to
contact stood almost horizontally so that by driving a long thin pin
through the foliaceous petiole close to the blade it was rendered
motionless the plant with a little triangle of paper attached to one
of the marginal spikes was placed under a microscope with an eyepiece
micrometer each division of which equalled 1500 of an inch the apex
of the papertriangle was now seen to be in constant slight movement
for in 4 h it crossed nine divisions or 9500 of an inch and after
ten additional hours it moved back and had crossed 5500 in an opposite
direction the plant was kept in rather too cool a place and on the
following day it moved rather less namely 1500 in 3 h and 2500 in
an opposite direction during the next 6 h the two lobes therefore
seem to be constantly closing or opening though to a very small
distance for we must remember that the little triangle of paper
affixed to the marginal spike increased its length and thus
exaggerated somewhat the movement similar observations with the
important difference that the petiole was left free and the plant kept
under a high temperature were made on a leaf which was healthy but
so old that it did not close when its sensitive hairs were repeatedly
touched though judging from other cases it would have slowly closed if
it had been stimulated by animal matter the apex of the triangle was
in almost though not quite constant movement sometimes in one
direction and sometimes in an opposite one and it thrice crossed five
divisions of the micrometer ie 1100 of an inch in 30 m this
movement on so small a scale is hardly comparable with ordinary
circumnutation but it may perhaps be compared with the zigzag lines
and little loops by which the larger ellipses made by other plants are
often interrupted
in the first chapter of this volume the remarkable oscillatory
movements of the circumnutating hypocotyl of the cabbage have been
described the leaves of dionaea present the same phenomenon which is
a wonderful one as viewed under a low power 2inch objectglass
with an eyepiece micrometer of which each division 1500 of an inch
appeared as a rather wide space the young unexpanded leaf of which
the circumnutating movements were traced fig 106 had a glass
filament fixed perpendicularly to it and the movement of the apex was
observed in the hothouse temp 84 to 86 f with light admitted
only from above and with any lateral currents of air
excluded the apex sometimes crossed one or two divisions of the
micrometer at an imperceptibly slow rate but generally it moved
onwards by rapid starts or jerks of 21000 or 31000 and in one
instance of 41000 of an inch after each jerk forwards the apex drew
itself backwards with comparative slowness for part of the distance
which had just been gained and then after a very short time made
another jerk forwards four conspicuous jerks forwards with slower
retreats were seen on one occasion to occur in exactly one minute
besides some minor oscillations as far as we could judge the
advancing and retreating lines did not coincide and if so extremely
minute ellipses were each time described sometimes the apex remained
quite motionless for a short period its general course during the
several hours of observation was in two opposite directions so that
the leaf was probably circumnutating
an older leaf with the lobes fully expanded and which was afterwards
proved to be highly sensitive to contact was next observed in a
similar manner except that the plant was exposed to a lower
temperature in a room the apex oscillated forwards and backwards in
the same manner as before but the jerks forward were less in extent
viz about 11000 inch and there were longer motionless periods as it
appeared possible that the movements might be due to currents of air a
wax taper was held close to the leaf during one of the motionless
periods but no oscillations were thus caused after 10 m however
vigorous oscillations commenced perhaps owing to the plant having been
warmed and thus stimulated the candle was then removed and before long
the oscillations ceased nevertheless when looked at again after an
interval of 1 h 30 m it was again oscillating the plant was taken
back into the hothouse and on the following morning was seen to be
oscillating though not very vigorously another old but healthy leaf
which was not in the least sensitive to a touch was likewise observed
during two days in the hothouse and the attached filament made many
little jerks forwards of about 21000 or only 11000 of an inch
finally to ascertain whether the lobes independently of the petiole
oscillated the petiole of an old leaf was cemented close to the blade
with shellac to the top of a little stick driven into the soil but
before this was done the leaf was observed and found to be vigorously
oscillating or jerking and after it had been cemented to the stick
the oscillations of about 21000 of an inch still continued on the
following day a little infusion
of raw meat was placed on the leaf which caused the lobes to close
together very slowly in the course of two days and the oscillations
continued during this whole time and for the next two days after nine
additional days the leaf began to open and the margins were a little
everted and now the apex of the glass filament remained for long
periods motionless and then moved backwards and forwards for a
distance of about 11000 of an inch slowly without any jerks
nevertheless after warming the leaf with a taper held close to it the
jerking movement recommenced
this same leaf had been observed 2 months previously and was then
found to be oscillating or jerking we may therefore infer that this
kind of movement goes on night and day for a very long period and it
is common to young unexpanded leaves and to leaves so old as to have
lost their sensitiveness to a touch but which were still capable of
absorbing nitrogenous matter the phenomenon when well displayed as in
the young leaf just described is a very interesting one it often
brought before our minds the idea of effort or of a small animal
struggling to escape from some constraint
16 eucalyptus resinifera myrtaceae fam 94a young leaf two
inches in length together with the petiole produced by a lateral shoot
from a cutdown tree was observed in the usual manner the blade had
not as yet assumed its vertical position on june 7th only a few
observations were made and the tracing merely showed that the leaf had
moved three times upwards and three downwards on the following day it
was observed more frequently and two tracings were made see a and b
fig 108 as a single one would have been too complicated the apex
changed its course 13 times in the course of 16 h chiefly up and
down but with some lateral movement the actual amount of movement in
any one direction was small

17 dahlia garden var composit fam 122a fine young
leaf 5 34 inches in length produced by a young plant 2 feet high
growing vigorously in a large pot was directed at an angle of about
45 beneath the horizon on june 18th the leaf descended from 10 am
till 1135 am see fig 109 it then ascended greatly till 6 pm
this ascent being probably due to the light coming only from above it
zigzagged between 6 pm and 1035 pm and ascended a little during
the night it should be remarked that the vertical distances in the
lower part of the diagram are much exaggerated as the leaf was at
first deflected beneath the horizon and after it had sunk downwards
the filament pointed in a very oblique line towards the glass next
day the leaf descended from 820 am till 715 pm then zigzagged
and ascended greatly during the night on the morning of the 20th the
leaf was probably beginning to descend though the short line in the
diagram is horizontal the actual distances travelled by the apex of
the leaf were considerable but could not be calculated with safety
from the course pursued on the second day when the plant had
accommodated itself to the light from above there cannot be much doubt
that the leaves undergo a daily periodic movement sinking during the
day and rising at night

the pot had to be slightly moved therefore the relative position of
the two tracings is somewhat arbitrary the figure here given is

18 mutisia clematis compositthe leaves terminate in tendrils
and circumnutate like those of other tendrilbearers but this plant is
here mentioned on account of an erroneous statement11 which has been
published namely that the leaves sink at night and rise during the
day the leaves which behaved in this manner had been kept for some
days in a northern room and had not been sufficiently illuminated a
plant therefore was left undisturbed in the hothouse and three leaves
had their angles measured at noon and at 10 pm all three were
inclined a little beneath the horizon at noon but one stood at night
2 the second 21 and the third 10 higher than in the middle of the
day so that instead of sinking they rise a little at night

19 cyclamen persicum primulaceae fam 135a young leaf 18 of
an inch in length petiole included produced by an old rootstock was
observed during three days in the usual manner fig 110 on the first
day the leaf fell more than afterwards apparently from adjusting
itself to the light from above on all three days it fell from the
early morning to about 7 pm and from that hour rose during the
night the course being slightly zigzag the movement therefore is
strictly periodic it should be noted that the leaf would have sunk
each evening a little lower down than it did had not the glass
filament rested between 5 and 6 pm on the rim of the pot the amount
of movement was considerable for if we assume that the whole leaf to
the base of the petiole became bent the tracing would be magnified
rather less than five times and this would give to the apex a rise and
fall of half an inch with some lateral movement this amount however
would not attract attention without the aid of a tracing or measurement
of some kind
20 allamanda schottii apocyneae fam 144the young leaves of
this shrub are elongated with the blade bowed so much downwards as
almost to form a semicircle the chordthat is a line drawn from the
apex of the blade to the base of the petioleof a young leaf 4 34
inches in length stood at 250 pm on
dec 5th at an angle of 13 beneath the horizon but by 930 pm the
blade had straightened itself so much which implies the raising of the
apex that the chord now stood at 37 above the horizon and had
therefore risen 50 on the next day similar angular measurements of
the same leaf were made and at noon the chord stood 36 beneath the
horizon and 930 pm 3 above it so had risen 39 the chief cause
of the rising movement lies in the straightening of the blade but the
short petiole rises between 4 and 5 on the third night the chord
stood at 35 above the horizon and if the leaf occupied the same
position at noon as on the previous day it had risen 71 with older
leaves no such change of curvature could be detected the plant was
then brought into the house and kept in a northeast room but at night
there was no change in the curvature of the young leaves so that
previous exposure to a strong light is apparently requisite for the
periodical change of curvature in the blade and for the slight rising
of the petiole

22 petunia violacea solaneae fam 157a very young leaf only
34 inch in length highly inclined upwards was observed for four
days during the whole of this time it bent outwards and downwards so
as to become more and more nearly horizontal the strongly marked
zigzag line in the figure on p 248 fig 111 shows that this was
effected by modified circumnutation and during the latter part of the
time there was much ordinary circumnutation on a small scale the
movement in the diagram is magnified between 10 and 11 times it
exhibits a clear trace of periodicity as the leaf rose a little each
evening but this upward tendency appeared to be almost conquered by
the leaf striving to become more and more horizontal as it grew older
the angles which two older leaves formed together were measured in the
evening and about noon on 3 successive days and each night the angle
decreased a little though irregularly

23 acanthus mollis acanthaceae fam 168the younger of two
leaves 2 14 inches in length petiole included produced by a
seedling plant was observed during 47 h early on each of the three
mornings the apex of the leaf fell and it continued to fall till 3
pm on the two afternoons when observed after 3 pm it rose
considerably and continued to rise on the second night until the early
morning but on the first night it fell instead of rising and we have
little doubt that this was owing to the leaf being very young and
becoming through epinastic growth more and more horizontal for it may
be seen in the diagram fig 112 that the leaf stood on a higher
level on the first than on the second day the leaves of an allied
species a spinosus certainly rose every night and the rise
between noon and 1015 pm when measured on one occasion was 10
this rise was chiefly
or exclusively due to the straightening of the blade and not to the
movement of the petiole we may therefore conclude that the leaves of
acanthus circumnutate periodically falling in the morning and rising
in the afternoon and night
24 cannabis sativa cannabineae fam 195we have here the rare
case of leaves moving downwards in the evening but not to a sufficient
degree to be called sleep12 in the early morning or in the latter
part of the night they move upwards for instance all the young
leaves near the summits of several stems stood almost horizontally at 8
am may 29th and at 1030 pm were considerably declined on a
subsequent day two leaves stood at 2 pm at 21 and 12 beneath the
horizon and at 10 pm at 38 beneath it two other leaves on a
younger plant were horizontal at 2 pm and at 10 pm had sunk to 36
beneath the horizon with respect to this downward movement of the
leaves kraus believes that it is due to their epinastic growth he
adds that the leaves are relaxed during the day and tense at night
both in sunny and rainy weather

25 pinus pinaster conifer fam 223the leaves on the summits of
the terminal shoots stand at first in a bundle almost upright but they
soon diverge and ultimately become almost horizontal the movements of
a young leaf nearly one inch in length on the summit of a seedling
plant only 3 inches high were traced from the early morning of june
2nd to the evening of the 7th during these five days the leaf
diverged and its apex descended at first in an almost straight line
but during the two latter days it zigzagged so much that it was
evidently circumnutating the same little plant when grown to a height
of 5 inches was again observed during four days a filament was fixed
transversely to the apex of a leaf one inch in length and which had
already diverged considerably from its originally upright position it
continued to diverge see a fig 113 and to descend from 1145 am
july 31st to 640 am aug 1st on august 1st it circumnutated about
the same small space and again descended at night next morning the
pot was moved nearly one inch to the right and a new tracing was begun
b from this time viz 7 am august 2nd to 820 am on the 4th
the leaf manifestly circumnutated it does not appear from the diagram
that the leaves move periodically for the descending course during the
first two nights was clearly due to epinastic growth and at the close
of our observations the leaf was not nearly so horizontal as it would
ultimately become

downward but as the terminal part was upturned the filament projected
almost horizontally the leaflet moved see fig 114 largely and
periodically for it fell until about 7 pm and rose during the night
falling again next morning after 640 am the descending lines are in
a marked manner zigzag and so probably would have been the ascending
lines if they had been traced throughout the night

29 crinum capense amaryllideae fam 11the leaves of this plant
are remarkable for their great length and narrowness one was measured
and found to be 53 inches long and only 14 broad at the base whilst
quite young they stand up almost vertically to the height of about a
foot afterwards
their tips begin to bend over and subsequently hang vertically down
and thus continue to grow a rather young leaf was selected of which
the dependent tapering point was as yet only 5 inches in length the
upright basal part being 20 inches high though this part would
ultimately become shorter by being more bent over a large bellglass
was placed over the plant with a black dot on one side and by
bringing the dependent apex of the leaf into a line with this dot the
accompanying figure fig 117 was traced on the other side of the
bell during 2 days during the first day 22nd the tip travelled
laterally far to the left perhaps in consequence of the plant having
been disturbed and the last dot made at 1030 pm on this day is
alone here given as we see in the figure there can be no doubt that
the apex of this leaf circumnutated
fig 117 crinum capense circumnutation of dependent tip of young

a glass filament with little triangles of paper was at the same time
fixed obliquely across the tip of a still younger leaf which stood
vertically up and was as yet straight its movements were traced from 3
pm may 22nd to 1015 am 25th the leaf was growing rapidly so that
the apex ascended greatly during this period as it zigzagged much it
was clearly circumnutating and it apparently tended to form one
ellipse each day the lines traced during the night were much more
vertical than those traced during the day and this indicates that the
tracing would have exhibited a nocturnal rise and a diurnal fall if
the leaf had not grown so quickly the movement of this same leaf after
an interval of six days may 31st by which time the tip had curved
outwards into a horizontal position
and had thus made the first step towards becoming dependent was traced
orthogonically by the aid of a cube of wood in the manner before
explained and it was thus ascertained that the actual distance
travelled by the apex and due to circumnutation was 3 18 inches in
the course of 20 h during the next 24 h it travelled 2 inches the
circumnutating movement therefore of this young leaf was strongly
marked
30 pancratium littorale amaryllideaethe movements much
magnified of a leaf 9 inches in length and inclined at about 45
above the horizon were traced during two days on the first day it
changed its course completely upwards and downwards and laterally 9
times in 12 h and the figure traced apparently represented five
ellipses on the second day it was observed seldomer and was therefore
not seen to change its course so often viz only 6 times but in the
same complex manner as before the movements were small in extent but
there could be no doubt about the circumnutation of the leaf
31 imatophyllum vel clivia sp amaryllideaea long glass
filament was fixed to a leaf and the angle formed by it with the
horizon was measured occasionally during three successive days it fell
each morning until between 3 and 4 pm and rose at night the
smallest angle at any time above the horizon was 48 and the largest
50 so that it rose only 2 at night but as this was observed each
day and as similar observations were nightly made on another leaf on a
distinct plant there can be no doubt that the leaves move
periodically though to a very small extent the position of the apex
when it stood highest was 8 of an inch above its lowest point
32 pistia stratiotes aroideae fam 30hofmeister remarks that
the leaves of this floating waterplant are more highly inclined at
night than by day13 we therefore fastened a fine glass filament to
the midrib of a moderately young leaf and on sept 19th measured the
angle which it formed with the horizon 14 times between 9 am and
1150 pm the temperature of the hothouse varied during the two days
of observation between 18 and 23 c at 9 am the filament stood at
32 above the horizon at 334 pm at 10 and at 1150 pm at 55
these two latter angles being the highest and the lowest observed
during the day showing a difference of 45 the rising did not become
strongly marked until between
5 and 6 pm on the next day the leaf stood at only 10 above the
horizon at 825 am and it remained at about 15 till past 3 pm at
540 pm it was 23 and at 930 pm 58 so that the rise was more
sudden this evening than on the previous one and the difference in the
angle amounted to 48 the movement is obviously periodical and as the
leaf stood on the first night at 55 and on the second night at 58
above the horizon it appeared very steeply inclined this case as we
shall see in a future chapter ought perhaps to have been included
under the head of sleeping plants

traced during 42 h see fig 118 on the first evening when the
tracing was begun and during the night the leaf descended
considerably on the next morning it ascended in a strongly marked
zigzag line and descended again in the evening and during the night
the movement therefore seems to be periodic but some doubt is thrown
on this conclusion because another leaf 8 inches in height appearing
older and standing more highly inclined behaved differently during
the first 12 h it circumnutated over a
small space but during the night and the whole following day it
ascended in the same general direction the ascent being effected by
repeated up and down wellpronounced oscillations

see in fig 119 that it plainly circumnutated the movement was not
greatly magnified as the frond was placed near to the vertical glass
and would probably have been greater and more rapid had the day been
warmer for the plant was brought out of a warm greenhouse and observed
under a skylight where the temperature was between 15 and 16 c we
have seen in chap i that a frond of this fern as yet only slightly
lobed and with a rachis only 23 inch in height plainly
circumnutated14
 14 mr loomis and prof asa gray have described botanical
 gazette 1880 pp 27 43 an extremely curious case of movement in
 the fronds but only in the fruiting fronds of asplenium trichomanes
 they move almost as rapidly as the little leaflets of desmodium
 gyrans alternately backwards and forwards through from 20 to 40
 degrees in a plane at right angles to that of the frond the apex of
 the frond describes a long and very narrow ellipse so that it
 circumnutates but the movement differs from ordinary circumnutation
 as it occurs only when the plant is exposed to the light even
 artificial light is sufficient to excite motion for a few minutes

35 lunularia vulgaris hepaticae fam 11 muscalesthe earth in
an old flowerpot was coated with this plant bearing gemmae a highly
inclined frond which projected 3 inch above the soil and was 4 inch
in breadth was selected for observation a glass hair of extreme
tenuity 75 inch in length with its end whitened was cemented with
shellac to the frond at right angles to its breadth and a white stick
with a minute black spot was driven into the soil close behind the end
of the hair the white end could be accurately brought into a line with
the black spot and dots could thus be successively made on the
vertical glassplate in front any movement of the frond would of
course be exhibited and increased by the long glass hair and the black
spot was placed so close behind the end of the hair relatively to the
distance of the glassplate in front that the movement of the end was
magnified about 40 times nevertheless we are convinced that our
tracing gives a fairly faithful representation of the movements of the
frond in the intervals between each observation the plant was covered
by a small bellglass the frond as already stated
was highly inclined and the pot stood in front of a northeast window
during the five first days the frond moved downwards or became less
inclined and the long line which was traced was strongly zigzag with
loops occasionally formed or nearly formed and this indicated
circumnutation whether the sinking was due to epinastic growth or
apheliotropism we do not know as the sinking was slight on the fifth
day a new tracing was begun on the sixth day oct 25th and was
continued for 47 h it is here given fig 120 another tracing was
made on the next day 27th and the frond was found to be still
circumnutating for during 14 h 30 m it changed its course completely
besides minor changes 10 times it was casually observed for two more
days and was seen to be continually moving

the lowest members of the vegetable series the thallogens apparently
circumnutate if an oscillaria be watched under the microscope it may
be seen to describe circles about every 40 seconds after it has bent
to one side the tip first begins to bend back to the opposite side and
then the whole filament curves over in the same direction
hofmeister15 has given a minute account of the curious but less
regular though constant movements of spirogyra during 2 h the
filament moved 4 times to the left and 3 times to the right and he
refers to a movement at right angles to the above the tip moved at the
rate of about 01 mm in five minutes he compares the movement with
the nutation of the higher plants16 we shall hereafter see that
heliotropic movements result from modified circumnutation and as
unicellular moulds bend to the light we may infer that they also
circumnutate

 1880 vol iii p 320 that the movements of spirulina a member of

 of growing shoots and tendrils
concluding remarks on the circumnutation of leaves
the circumnutating movements of young leaves in 33 genera belonging to
25 families widely distributed
amongst ordinary and gymnospermous dicotyledons and amongst
monocotyledons together with several cryptogams have now been
described it would therefore not be rash to assume that the growing
leaves of all plants circumnutate as we have seen reason to conclude
is the case with cotyledons the seat of movement generally lies in the
petiole but sometimes both in the petiole and blade or in the blade
alone the extent of the movement differed much in different plants
but the distance passed over was never great except with pistia which
ought perhaps to have been included amongst sleeping plants the
angular movement of the leaves was only occasionally measured it
commonly varied from only 2 and probably even less in some instances
to about 10 but it amounted to 23 in the common bean the movement
is chiefly in a vertical plane but as the ascending and descending
lines never coincided there was always some lateral movement and thus
irregular ellipses were formed the movement therefore deserves to be
called one of circumnutation for all circumnutating organs tend to
describe ellipsesthat is growth on one side is succeeded by growth
on nearly but not quite the opposite side the ellipses or the zigzag
lines representing drawnout ellipses are generally very narrow yet
with the camellia their minor axes were half as long and with the
eucalyptus more than half as long as their major axes in the case of
cissus parts of the figure more nearly represented circles than
ellipses the amount of lateral movement is therefore sometimes
considerable moreover the longer axes of the successively formed
ellipses as with the bean cissus and seakale and in several
instances the zigzag lines representing ellipses were extended in very
different directions during the same day or on
the next day the course followed was curvilinear or straight or
slightly or strongly zigzag and little loops or triangles were often
formed a single large irregular ellipse may be described on one day
and two smaller ones by the same plant on the next day with drosera
two and with lupinus eucalyptus and pancratium several were formed
each day
the oscillatory and jerking movements of the leaves of dionaea which
resemble those of the hypocotyl of the cabbage are highly remarkable
as seen under the microscope they continue night and day for some
months and are displayed by young unexpanded leaves and by old ones
which have lost their sensibility to a touch but which after
absorbing animal matter close their lobes we shall hereafter meet
with the same kind of movement in the joints of certain gramine and
it is probably common to many plants while circumnutating it is
therefore a strange fact that no such movement could be detected in
the tentacles of drosera rotundifolia though a member of the same
family with dionaea yet the tentacle which was observed was so
sensitive that it began to curl inwards in 23 seconds after being
touched by a bit of raw meat
one of the most interesting facts with respect to the circumnutation of
leaves is the periodicity of their movements for they often or even
generally rise a little in the evening and early part of the night
and sink again on the following morning exactly the same phenomenon
was observed in the case of cotyledons the leaves in 16 genera out of
the 33 which were observed behaved in this manner as did probably 2
others nor must it be supposed that in the remaining 15 genera there
was no periodicity in their movements for 6 of them were observed
during too short a period for any judgment to be formed on this head
and 3 were so young that their epinastic growth which serves to bring
them down into a horizontal position overpowered every other kind of
movement in only one genus cannabis did the leaves sink in the
evening and kraus attributes this movement to the prepotency of their
epinastic growth that the periodicity is determined by the daily
alternations of light and darkness there can hardly be a doubt as will
hereafter be shown insectivorous plants are very little affected as
far as their movements are concerned by light and hence probably it
is that their leaves at least in the cases of sarracenia drosera and
dionaea do not move periodically the upward movement in the evening
is at first slow and with different plants begins at very different
hourswith glaucium as early as 11 am commonly between 3 and 5
pm but sometimes as late as 7 pm it should be observed that none
of the leaves described in this chapter except as we believe those
of lupinus speciosus possess a pulvinus for the periodical movements
of leaves thus provided have generally been amplified into socalled
sleepmovements with which we are not here concerned the fact of
leaves and cotyledons frequently or even generally rising a little in
the evening and sinking in the morning is of interest as giving the
foundation from which the specialised sleepmovements of many leaves
and cotyledons not provided with a pulvinus have been developed the
above periodicity should be kept in mind by any one considering the
problem of the horizontal position of leaves and cotyledons during the
day whilst illuminated from above

the radicles hypocotyls and epicotyls of seedling plants even before
they emerge from the ground and afterwards the cotyledons are all
continually circumnutating so it is with the stems stolons
flowerpeduncles and leaves of older plants we may therefore infer
with a considerable degree of safety that all the growing parts of all
plants circumnutate although this movement in its ordinary or
unmodified state appears in some cases to be of service to plants
either directly or indirectlyfor instance the circumnutation of the
radicle in penetrating the ground or that of the arched hypocotyl and
epicotyl in breaking through the surfaceyet circumnutation is so
general or rather so universal a phenomenon that we cannot suppose it
to have been gained for any special purpose we must believe that it
follows in some unknown way from the manner in which vegetable tissues
grow
we shall now consider the many cases in which circumnutation has been
modified for various special purposes that is a movement already in
progress is temporarily increased in some one direction and
temporarily diminished or quite arrested in other directions these
cases may be divided in two subclasses in one of which the
modification depends on innate or constitutional causes and is
independent of external conditions excepting in so far that the proper
ones for growth must be present in the second subclass the
modification depends to a large extent on external agencies such as
the daily alternations of light and darkness or light alone
temperature or the attraction of gravity the first small subclass
will be considered in the present chapter and the second subclass in
the remainder of this volume
the circumnutation of climbing plants
the simplest case of modified circumnutation is that offered by
climbing plants with the exception of those which climb by the aid of
motionless hooks or of rootlets for the modification consists chiefly
in the greatly increased amplitude of the movement this would follow
either from greatly increased growth over a small length or more
probably from moderately increased growth spread over a considerable
length of the moving organ preceded by turgescence and acting
successively on all sides the circumnutation of climbers is more
regular than that of ordinary plants but in almost every other respect
there is a close similarity between their movements namely in their
tendency to describe ellipses directed successively to all points of
the compassin their courses being often interrupted by zigzag lines
triangles loops or small
ellipsesin the rate of movement and in different species revolving
once or several times within the same length of time in the same
internode the movements cease first in the lower part and then slowly
upwards in both sets of cases the movement may be modified in a
closely analogous manner by geotropism and by heliotropism though few
climbing plants are heliotropic other points of similarity might be
pointed out
that the movements of climbing plants consist of ordinary
circumnutation modified by being increased in amplitude is well
exhibited whilst the plants are very young for at this early age they
move like other seedlings but as they grow older their movements
gradually increase without undergoing any other change that this power
is innate and is not excited by any external agencies beyond those
necessary for growth and vigour is obvious no one doubts that this
power has been gained for the sake of enabling climbing plants to
ascend to a height and thus to reach the light this is effected by
two very different methods first by twining spirally round a support
but to do so their stems must be long and flexible and secondly in
the case of leafclimbers and tendrilbearers by bringing these organs
into contact with a support which is then seized by the aid of their
sensitiveness it may be here remarked that these latter movements have
no relation as far as we can judge with circumnutation in other
cases the tips of tendrils after having been brought into contact with
a support become developed into little discs which adhere firmly to
it
we have said that the circumnutation of climbing plants differs from
that of ordinary plants chiefly by its greater amplitude but most
leaves circumnutate
in an almost vertical plane and therefore describe very narrow
ellipses whereas the many kinds of tendrils which consist of
metamorphosed leaves make much broader ellipses or nearly circular
figures and thus they have a far better chance of catching hold of a
support on any side the movements of climbing plants have also been
modified in some few other special ways thus the circumnutating stems
of solnanum dulcamara can twine round a support only when this is as
thin and flexible as a string or thread the twining stems of several
british plants cannot twine round a support when it is more than a few
inches in thickness whilst in tropical forests some can embrace thick
trunks1 and this great difference in power depends on some unknown
difference in their manner of circumnutation the most remarkable
special modification of this movement which we have observed is in the
tendrils of echinocystis lobata these are usually inclined at about
45 above the horizon but they stiffen and straighten themselves so as
to stand upright in a part of their circular course namely when they
approach and have to pass over the summit or the shoot from which they
arise if they had not possessed and exercised this curious power they
would infallibly have struck against the summit of the shoot and been
arrested in their course as soon as one of these tendrils with its
three branches begins to stiffen itself and rise up vertically the
revolving motion becomes more rapid and as soon as it has passed over
the point of difficulty its motion coinciding with that from its own
weight causes it to fall into its previously inclined position so
quickly that the apex can be seen travelling like the hand of a
gigantic clock
 1 the movements and habits of climbing plants p 36
a large number of ordinary leaves and leaflets and a few
flowerpeduncles are provided with pulvini but this is not the case
with a single tendril at present known the cause of this difference
probably lies in the fact that the chief service of a pulvinus is to
prolong the movement of the part thus provided after growth has ceased
and as tendrils or other climbingorgans are of use only whilst the
plant is increasing in height or growing a pulvinus which served to
prolong their movements would be useless
it was shown in the last chapter that the stolons or runners of certain
plants circumnutate largely and that this movement apparently aids
them in finding a passage between the crowded stems of adjoining
plants if it could be proved that their movements had been modified
and increased for this special purpose they ought to have been
included in the present chapter but as the amplitude of their
revolutions is not so conspicuously different from that of ordinary
plants as in the case of climbers we have no evidence on this head
we encounter the same doubt in the case of some plants which bury their
pods in the ground this burying process is certainly favoured by the
circumnutation of the flowerpeduncle but we do not know whether it
has been increased for this special purpose
epinastyhyponasty
the term epinasty is used by de vries2 to express greater
longitudinal growth along the upper than
along the lower side of a part which is thus caused to bend downwards
and hyponasty is used for the reversed process by which the part is
made to bend upwards these actions come into play so frequently that
the use of the above two terms is highly convenient the movements thus
induced result from a modified form of circumnutation for as we shall
immediately see an organ under the influence of epinasty does not
generally move in a straight line downwards or under that of hyponasty
upwards but oscillates up and down with some lateral movement it
moves however in a preponderant manner in one direction this shows
that there is some growth on all sides of the part but more on the
upper side in the case of epinasty and more on the lower side in that
of hyponasty than on the other sides at the same time there may be in
addition as de vries insists increased growth on one side due to
geotropism and on another side due to heliotropism and thus the
effects of epinasty or of hyponasty may be either increased or
lessened
 2 arbeiten des bot inst in wrzburg heft ii 1872 p 223 de
 vries has slightly modified p 252 the meaning of the above two
 terms as first used by schimper and they have been adopted in this
 sense by sachs
he who likes may speak of ordinary circumnutation as being combined
with epinasty hyponasty the effects of gravitation light etc but
it seems to us from reasons hereafter to be given to be more correct
to say that circumnutation is modified by these several agencies we
will therefore speak of circumnutation which is always in progress as
modified by epinasty hyponasty geotropism or other agencies whether
internal or external
one of the commonest and simplest cases of epinasty is that offered by
leaves which at an early age are crowded together round the buds and
diverge as they grow older sachs first remarked that this was due to
increased growth along the upper side of the petiole and blade and de
vries has now shown in more detail that the movement is thus caused
aided slightly by
the weight of the leaf and resisted as he believes by apogeotropism
at least after the leaf has somewhat diverged in our observations on
the circumnutation of leaves some were selected which were rather too
young so that they continued to diverge or sink downwards whilst their
movements were being traced this may be seen in the diagrams figs 98
and 112 pp 232 and 249 representing the circumnutation of the young
leaves of acanthus mollis and pelargonium zonale similar cases were
observed with drosera the movements of a young leaf only 34 inch in
length of petunia violacea were traced during four days and offers a
better instance fig 111 p 248 as it diverged during the whole of
this time in a curiously zigzag line with some of the angles sharply
acute and during the latter days plainly circumnutated some young
leaves of about the same age on a plant of this petunia which had been
laid horizontally and on another plant which was left upright both
being kept in complete darkness diverged in the same manner for 48 h
and apparently were not affected by apogeotropism though their stems
were in a state of high tension for when freed from the sticks to
which they had been tied they instantly curled upwards
the leaves whilst very young on the leading shoots of the carnation
dianthus caryophyllus are highly inclined or vertical and if the
plant is growing vigorously they diverge so quickly that they become
almost horizontal in a day but they move downwards in a rather oblique
line and continue for some time afterwards to move in the same
direction in connection we presume with their spiral arrangement on
the stem the course pursued by a young leaf whilst thus obliquely
descending was traced and the line was distinctly yet not strongly
zigzag the larger angles formed by the successive lines amounting only
to 135 154 and 163 the subsequent lateral movement shown in fig
96 p 231 was strongly zigzag with occasional circumnutations the
divergence and sinking of the young leaves of this plant seem to be
very little affected by geotropism or heliotropism for a plant the
leaves of which were growing rather slowly as ascertained by
measurement was laid horizontally and the opposite young leaves
diverged from one another symmetrically in the usual manner without
any upturning in the direction of gravitation or towards the light
the needlelike leaves of pinus pinaster form a bundle whilst young
afterwards they slowly diverge so that those on the upright shoots
become horizontal the movements of one such
young leaf was traced during 4 days and the tracing here given fig
121 shows that it descended at first in a nearly straight line but
afterwards zigzagged making one or two little loops the diverging and
descending movements of a rather older leaf were also traced see
former fig 113 p 251 it descended during the first day and night
in a somewhat zigzag line it then circumnutated round a small space
and again descended by this time the leaf had nearly assumed its final
position and now plainly circumnutated as in the case of the
carnation the leaves whilst very young do not seem to be much
affected by geotropism or heliotropism for those on a young plant laid
horizontally and those on another plant left upright both kept in the
dark continued to diverge in the usual manner without bending to
either side
fig 121 pinus pinaster epinastic downward movement of a young leaf
produced by a young plant in a pot traced on a vertical glass under a
skylight from 645 am june 2nd to 1040 pm 6th
with coba scandens the young leaves as they successively diverge
from the leading shoot which is bent to one side rise up so as to
project vertically and they retain this position for some time whilst
the tendril is revolving the diverging and ascending movements of the
petiole of one such a leaf were traced on a vertical glass under a
skylight and the course pursued was in most parts nearly straight but
there were two
wellmarked zigzags one of them forming an angle of 112 and this
indicates circumnutation
the still closed lobes of a young leaf of dionaea projected at right
angles to the petiole and were in the act of slowly rising a glass
filament was attached to the under side of the midrib and its
movements were traced on a vertical glass it circumnutated once in the
evening and on the next day rose as already described see fig 106
p 240 by a number of acutely zigzag lines closely approaching in
character to ellipses this movement no doubt was due to epinasty
aided by apogeotropism for the closed lobes of a very young leaf on a
plant which had been placed horizontally moved into nearly the same
line with the petiole as if the plant had stood upright but at the
same time the lobes curved laterally upwards and thus occupied an
unnatural position obliquely to the plane of the foliaceous petiole
as the hypocotyls and epicotyls of some plants protrude from the
seedcoats in an arched form it is doubtful whether the arching of
these parts which is invariably present when they break through the
ground ought always to be attributed to epinasty but when they are at
first straight and afterwards become arched as often happens the
arching is certainly due to epinasty as long as the arch is surrounded
by compact earth it must retain its form but as soon as it rises above
the surface or even before this period if artificially freed from the
surrounding pressure it begins to straighten itself and this no doubt
is mainly due to hyponasty the movement of the upper and lower half of
the arch and of the crown was occasionally traced and the course was
more or less zigzag showing modified circumnutation
with not a few plants especially climbers the summit of the shoot is
hooked so that the apex points vertically downwards in seven genera
of twining plants3 the hooking or as it has been called by sachs
the nutation of the tip is mainly due to an exaggerated form of
circumnutation that is the growth is so great along one side that it
bends the shoot completely over to the opposite side thus forming a
hook the longitudinal line or zone of growth then travels a little
laterally round the shoot and the hook points in a slightly different
direction and so onwards until the hook is completely reversed
ultimately it
comes back to the point whence it started this was ascertained by
painting narrow lines with indian ink along the convex surface of
several hooks and the line was found slowly to become at first
lateral then to appear along the concave surface and ultimately back
again on the convex surface in the case of lonicera brachypoda the
hooked terminal part of the revolving shoot straightens itself
periodically but is never reversed that is the periodically
increased growth of the concave side of the hook is sufficient only to
straighten it and not to bend it over to the opposite side the
hooking of the tip is of service to twining plants by aiding them to
catch hold of a support and afterwards by enabling this part to
embrace the support much more closely than it could otherwise have done
at first thus preventing it as we often observed from being blown
away by a strong wind whether the advantage thus gained by twining
plants accounts for their summits being so frequently hooked we do not
know as this structure is not very rare with plants which do not
climb and with some climbers for instance vitis ampelopsis cissus
etc to whom it does not afford any assistance in climbing
 3 the movements and habits of climbing plants 2nd edit p 13
with respect to those cases in which the tip remains always bent or
hooked towards the same side as in the genera just named the most
obvious explanation is that the bending is due to continued growth in
excess along the convex side wiesner however maintains4 that in
all cases the hooking of the tip is the result of its plasticity and
weighta conclusion which from what we have already seen with several
climbing plants is certainly erroneous nevertheless we fully admit
that the weight of the part as well as geotropism etc sometimes
come into play
 4 sitzb der k akad der wissensch vienna jan 1880 p 16
ampelopsis tricuspidatathis plant climbs by the aid of adhesive
tendrils and the hooked tips of the shoots do not appear to be of any
service to it the hooking depends chiefly as far as we could
ascertain on the tip being affected by epinasty and geotropism the
lower and older parts continually straightening themselves through
hyponasty and apogeotropism we believe that the weight of the apex is
an unimportant element because on horizontal or inclined shoots the
hook is often extended horizontally or even faces upwards moreover
shoots frequently form loops instead of hooks and in this case the
extreme part instead of hanging vertically down as would follow if
weight was the efficient cause extends horizontally or even points
upwards a shoot which terminated in a rather open hook was fastened
in a highly inclined downward position so that the concave side faced
upwards and the result was that the apex at first curved upwards this
apparently was due to epinasty and not to apogeotropism for the apex
soon after passing the perpendicular curved so rapidly downwards that
we could not doubt that the movement was at least aided by geotropism
in the course of a few hours the hook was thus converted into a loop
with the apex of the shoot pointing straight downwards the longer axis
of the loop was at first horizontal but afterwards became vertical
during this same time the basal part of the hook and subsequently of
the loop curved itself slowly upwards and this must have been wholly
due to apogeotropism in opposition to hyponasty the loop was then
fastened upside down so that its basal half would be simultaneously
acted on by hyponasty if present and by apogeotropism and now it
curved itself so greatly upwards in the course of only 4 h that there
could hardly be a doubt that both forces were acting
together at the same time the loop became open and was thus
reconverted into a hook and this apparently was effected by the
geotropic movement of the apex in opposition to epinasty in the case
of ampelopsis hederacea weight plays as far as we could judge a more
important part in the hooking of the tip
fig 122 ampelopsis tricuspidata hyponastic movement of hooked tip of

in order to ascertain whether the shoots of a tricuspidata in
straightening themselves under the combined action of hyponasty and
apogeotropism moved in a simple straight course or whether they
circumnutated glass filaments were fixed to the crowns of four hooked
tips standing in their natural position and the movements of the
filaments were traced on a vertical glass all four tracings resembled
each other in a general manner but we will give only one see fig
122 p 273 the filament rose at first which shows that the hook was
straightening itself it then zigzagged moving a little to the left
between 925 am and 9 pm from this latter hour on the 13th to 1050
am on the following morning 14th the hook continued to straighten
itself and then zigzagged a short distance to the right but from 1
pm to 1040 pm on the 14th the movement
was reversed and the shoot became more hooked during the night after
1040 pm to 815 am on the 15th the hook again opened or
straightened itself by this time the glass filament had become so
highly inclined that its movements could no longer be traced with
accuracy and by 130 pm on this same day the crown of the former
arch or hook had become perfectly straight and vertical there can
therefore be no doubt that the straightening of the hooked shoot of
this plant is effected by the circumnutation of the arched portionthat
is by growth alternating between the upper and lower surface but
preponderant on the lower surface with some little lateral movement
we were enabled to trace the movement of another straightening shoot
for a longer period owing to its slower growth and to its having been
placed further from the vertical glass namely from the early morning
on july 13th to late in the evening of the 16th during the whole
daytime of the 14th the hook straightened itself very little but
zigzagged and plainly circumnutated about nearly the same spot by the
16th it had become nearly straight and the tracing was no longer
accurate yet it was manifest that there was still a considerable
amount of movement both up and down and laterally for the crown whilst
continuing to straighten itself occasionally became for a short time
more curved causing the filament to descend twice during the day
smithia pfundiithe stiff terminal shoots of this leguminous
waterplant from africa project so as to make a rectangle with the stem
below but this occurs only when the plants are growing vigorously for
when kept in a cool place the summits of the stems become straight as
they likewise did at the close of the growing season the direction of
the rectangularly bent part is independent of the chief source of
light but from observing the effects of placing plants in the dark in
which case several shoots became in two or three days upright or nearly
upright and when brought back into the light again became
rectangularly curved we believe that the bending is in part due to
apheliotropism apparently somewhat opposed by apogeotropism on the
other hand from observing the effects of tying a shoot downwards so
that the rectangle faced upwards we are led to believe that the
curvature is partly due to epinasty as the rectangularly bent portion
of an upright stem grows older the lower part straightens itself and
this is effected through hyponasty he who has read sachs recent essay
on the vertical
and inclined positions of the parts of plants5 will see how difficult
a subject this is and will feel no surprise at our expressing
ourselves doubtfully in this and other such cases
 5 ueber orthotrope und plagiotrope pflanzentheile arbeiten des
 bot inst in wrzburg heft ii 1879 p 226
a plant 20 inches in height was secured to a stick close beneath the
curved summit which formed rather less than a rectangle with the stem
below the shoot pointed away from the observer and a glass filament
pointing towards the vertical glass on which the tracing was made was
fixed to the convex surface of the curved portion therefore the
descending lines in the figure represent the straightening of the
curved portion as it grew older the tracing fig 123 p 274 was
begun at 9 am on july 10th the filament at first moved but little in
a zigzag line but at 2 pm it began rising and continued to do so
till 9 pm and this proves that the terminal portion was being more
bent downwards after 9 pm on the 10th an opposite movement
commenced and the curved portion began to straighten itself and this
continued till 1110 am on the 12th but was interrupted by some
small oscillations and zigzags showing movement in different
directions after 1110 am on the 12th this part of the stem still
considerably curved circumnutated in a conspicuous manner until nearly
3 pm on the 13th but during all this time a downward movement of the
filament prevailed caused by the continued straightening of the stem
by the afternoon of the 13th the summit which had originally been
deflected more than a right angle from the perpendicular had grown so
nearly straight that the tracing could no longer be continued on the
vertical glass there can therefore be no doubt that the straightening
of the abruptly curved portion of the growing stem of this plant which
appears to be wholly due to hyponasty is the result of modified
circumnutation we will only add that a filament was fixed in a
different manner across the curved summit of another plant and the
same general kind of movement was observed
trifolium repensin many but not in all the species of trifolium as
the separate little flowers wither the subpeduncles bend downwards
so as to depend parallel to the upper part of the main peduncle in tr
subterraneum the main peduncle curves downwards for the sake of burying
its capsules and in this species the subpeduncles of the separate
flowers bend
upwards so as to occupy the same position relatively to the upper part
of the main peduncle as in tr repens this fact alone would render it
probable that the movements of the subpeduncles in tr repens were
independent of geotropism nevertheless to make sure some
flowerheads were tied to little sticks upside down and others in a
horizontal position their subpeduncles however all quickly curved
upwards through the action of heliotropism we therefore protected some
flowerheads similarly secured to sticks from the light and although
some of them rotted many of their subpeduncles turned very slowly
from their reversed or from their horizontal positions so as to stand
in the normal manner parallel to the upper part of the main peduncle
these facts show that the movement is independent of geotropism or
apheliotropism it must therefore be attributed to epinasty which
however is checked at least as long as the flowers are young by
heliotropism most of the above flowers were never fertilised owing to
the exclusion of bees they consequently withered very slowly and the
movements of the subpeduncles were in like manner much retarded
fig 124 trifolium repens circumnutating and epinastic movements of
the subpeduncle of a single flower traced on a vertical glass under a
skylight in a from 1130 am aug 27th to 7 am 30th in b from 7
am aug 30th to a little after 6 pm sept 8th
to ascertain the nature of the movement of the subpeduncle whilst
bending downwards a filament was fixed across the summit of the calyx
of a not fully expanded and almost upright flower nearly in the centre
of the head the main peduncle was secured to a stick close beneath the
head in order to see the marks on the glass filament a few flowers
had to be cut away on the lower side of the head the flower under
observation at first diverged a little from its upright position so as
to occupy the open space caused by the removal of the adjoining
flowers this required two days after which time a new tracing was
begun fig 124 in a we see the complex circumnutating course pursued
from 1130 am aug 26th to 7 am on the 30th the pot was then moved
a very little to the right and the tracing b was continued without
interruption from 7 am aug 30th to after 6 pm sept 8th it should
be observed that on most of these days only a single dot was made each
morning at the same hour whenever the flower was observed carefully
as on aug 30th and sept 5th and 6th it was found to be
circumnutating over a small space at last on sept 7th it began to
bend downwards and continued to do so until after 6 pm on the 8th
and indeed until the morning of the 9th when its movements could no
longer be traced on the vertical glass it was carefully observed
during the whole of the 8th and by
1030 pm it had descended to a point lower down by twothirds of the
length of the figure as here given but from want of space the tracing
has been copied in b only to a little after 6 pm on the morning of
the 9th the flower was withered and the subpeduncle now stood at an
angle of 57 beneath the horizon if the flower had been fertilised it
would have withered much sooner and have moved much more quickly we
thus see that the subpeduncle oscillated up and down or
circumnutated during its whole downward epinastic course
the subpeduncles of the fertilised and withered flowers of oxalis
carnosa likewise bend downwards through epinasty as will be shown in a
future chapter and their downward course is strongly zigzag
indicating circumnutation
the number of instances in which various organs move through epinasty
or hyponasty often in combination with other forces for the most
diversified purposes seems to be inexhaustibly great and from the
several cases which have been here given we may safely infer that such
movements are due to modified circumnutation

said to sleep but we are not here concerned with their movements for
although effected by the same mechanism as in the case of young leaves
namely unequal growth on the opposite sides as first proved by
pfeffer yet they differ essentially in being excited chiefly by
changes of temperature instead of light and in being effected as far
as we can judge for a different purpose hardly any one supposes that
there is any real analogy
between the sleep of animals and that of plants2 whether of leaves
or flowers it seems therefore advisable to give a distinct name to
the socalled sleepmovements of plants these have also generally been
confounded under the term periodic with the slight daily rise and
fall of leaves as described in the fourth chapter and this makes it
all the more desirable to give some distinct name to sleepmovements
nyctitropism and nyctitropic ie nightturning may be applied both
to leaves and flowers and will be occasionally used by us but it
would be best to confine the term to leaves the leaves of some few
plants move either upwards or downwards when the sun shines intensely
on them and this movement has sometimes been called diurnal sleep but
we believe it to be of an essentially different nature from the
nocturnal movement and it will be briefly considered in a future
chapter
 1 pfeffer has given a clear and interesting sketch of the history of
 this subject in his die periodischen bewegungen der blattorgane
 1875 p 163
 2 ch royer must however be excepted see annales des sc nat
 5th series bot vol ix 1868 p 378
the sleep or nyctitropism of leaves is a large subject and we think
that the most convenient plan will be first to give a brief account of
the position which leaves assume at night and of the advantages
apparently thus gained afterwards the more remarkable cases will be
described in detail with respect to cotyledons in the present chapter
and to leaves in the next chapter finally it will be shown that these
movements result from circumnutation much modified and regulated by
the alternations of day and night or light and darkness but that they
are also to a certain extent inherited
leaves when they go to sleep move either upwards or downwards or in
the case of the leaflets of
compound leaves forwards that is towards the apex of the leaf or
backwards that is towards its base or again they may rotate on
their own axes without moving either upwards or downwards but in
almost every case the plane of the blade is so placed as to stand
nearly or quite vertically at night therefore the apex or the base
or either lateral edge may be directed towards the zenith moreover
the upper surface of each leaf and more especially of each leaflet is
often brought into close contact with that of the opposite one and
this is sometimes effected by singularly complicated movements this
fact suggests that the upper surface requires more protection than the
lower one for instance the terminal leaflet in trifolium after
turning up at night so as to stand vertically often continues to bend
over until the upper surface is directed downwards whilst the lower
surface is fully exposed to the sky and an arched roof is thus formed
over the two lateral leaflets which have their upper surfaces pressed
closely together here we have the unusual case of one of the leaflets
not standing vertically or almost vertically at night
considering that leaves in assuming their nyctitropic positions often
move through an angle of 90 that the movement is rapid in the
evening that in some cases as we shall see in the next chapter it is
extraordinarily complicated that with certain seedlings old enough to
bear true leaves the cotyledons move vertically upwards at night
whilst at the same time the leaflets move vertically downwards and
that in the same genus the leaves or cotyledons of some species move
upwards whilst those of other species move downwardsfrom these and
other such facts it is hardly possible to doubt that plants must
derive some
great advantage from such remarkable powers of movement
the nyctitropic movements of leaves and cotyledons are effected in two
ways3 firstly by means of pulvini which become as pfeffer has
shown alternately more turgescent on opposite sides and secondly by
increased growth along one side of the petiole or midrib and then on
the opposite side as was first proved by batalin4 but as it has
been shown by de vries5 that in these latter cases increased growth
is preceded by the increased turgescence of the cells the difference
between the above two means of movement is much diminished and
consists chiefly in the turgescence of the cells of a fully developed
pulvinus not being followed by growth when the movements of leaves or
cotyledons furnished with a pulvinus and destitute of one are
compared they are seen to be closely similar and are apparently
effected for the same purpose therefore with our object in view it
does not appear advisable to separate the above two sets of cases into
two distinct classes there is however one important distinction
between them namely that movements effected by growth on the
alternate sides are confined to young growing leaves whilst those
effected by means of a pulvinus last for a long time we have already
seen wellmarked instances of this latter fact with cotyledons and so
it is with leaves as has been observed by pfeffer and by ourselves
the long endurance of the nyctitropic movements when effected by the
aid of pulvini indicates in addition to the evidence already advanced
the functional
importance of such movements to the plant there is another difference
between the two sets of cases namely that there is never or very
rarely any torsion of the leaves excepting when a pulvinus is
present6 but this statement applies only to periodic and nyctitropic
movements as may be inferred from other cases given by frank7 the
fact that the leaves of many plants place themselves at night in widely
different positions from what they hold during the day but with the
one point in common that their upper surfaces avoid facing the zenith
often with the additional fact that they come into close contact with
opposite leaves or leaflets clearly indicates as it seems to us that
the object gained is the protection of the upper surfaces from being
chilled at night by radiation there is nothing improbable in the upper
surface needing protection more than the lower as the two differ in
function and structure all gardeners know that plants suffer from
radiation it is this and not cold winds which the peasants of southern
europe fear for their olives8 seedlings are often protected from
radiation by a very thin covering of straw and fruittrees on walls by
a few firbranches or even by a fishingnet suspended over them
there is a variety of the gooseberry9 the flowers of which from
being produced before the leaves are not protected by them from
radiation and consequently often fail to yield fruit an excellent
observer10 has remarked
that one variety of the cherry has the petals of its flowers much
curled backwards and after a severe frost all the stigmas were killed
whilst at the same time in another variety with incurved petals the
stigmas were not in the least injured
 3 this distinction was first pointed out according to pfeffer die
 periodischen bewegungen der blattorgane 1875 p 161 by dassen in

 his famous essay on dew remarks that an exposed thermometer rises
 as soon as even a fleecy cloud high in the sky passes over the
 zenith

this view that the sleep of leaves saves them from being chilled at
night by radiation would no doubt have occurred to linnus had the
principle of radiation been then discovered for he suggests in many
parts of his somnus plantarum that the position of the leaves at
night protects the young stems and buds and often the young
inflorescence against cold winds we are far from doubting that an
additional advantage may be thus gained and we have observed with
several plants for instance desmodium gyrans that whilst the blade
of the leaf sinks vertically down at night the petiole rises so that
the blade has to move through a greater angle in order to assume its
vertical position than would otherwise have been necessary but with
the result that all the leaves on the same plant are crowded together
as if for mutual protection
we doubted at first whether radiation would affect in any important
manner objects so thin as are many cotyledons and leaves and more
especially affect differently their upper and lower surfaces for
although the temperature of their upper surfaces would undoubtedly fall
when freely exposed to a clear sky yet we thought that they would so
quickly acquire by conduction the temperature of the surrounding air
that it could hardly make any sensible difference to them whether they
stood horizontally and radiated into the open sky or vertically and
radiated chiefly in a lateral direction towards neighbouring plants and
other objects we endeavoured therefore to ascertain something on
this head by preventing the leaves
of several plants from going to sleep and by exposing to a clear sky
when the temperature was beneath the freezingpoint these as well as
the other leaves on the same plants which had already assumed their
nocturnal vertical position our experiments show that leaves thus
compelled to remain horizontal at night suffered much more injury from
frost than those which were allowed to assume their normal vertical
position it may however be said that conclusions drawn from such
observations are not applicable to sleeping plants the inhabitants of
countries where frosts do not occur but in every country and at all
seasons leaves must be exposed to nocturnal chills through radiation
which might be in some degree injurious to them and which they would
escape by assuming a vertical position
in our experiments leaves were prevented from assuming their
nyctitropic position generally by being fastened with the finest
entomological pins which did not sensibly injure them to thin sheets
of cork supported on sticks but in some instances they were fastened
down by narrow strips of card and in others by their petioles being
passed through slits in the cork the leaves were at first fastened
close to the cork for as this is a bad conductor and as the leaves
were not exposed for long periods we thought that the cork which had
been kept in the house would very slightly warm them so that if they
were injured by the frost in a greater degree than the free vertical
leaves the evidence would be so much the stronger that the horizontal
position was injurious but we found that when there was any slight
difference in the result which could be detected only occasionally
the leaves which had been fastened closely down suffered rather more
than those fastened with very long and
thin pins so as to stand from  to 34 inch above the cork this
difference in the result which is in itself curious as showing what a
very slight difference in the conditions influences the amount of
injury inflicted may be attributed as we believe to the surrounding
warmer air not circulating freely beneath the closely pinned leaves and
thus slightly warming them this conclusion is supported by some
analogous facts hereafter to be given
we will now describe in detail the experiments which were tried these
were troublesome from our not being able to predict how much cold the
leaves of the several species could endure many plants had every leaf
killed both those which were secured in a horizontal position and
those which were allowed to sleepthat is to rise up or sink down
vertically others again had not a single leaf in the least injured
and these had to be reexposed either for a longer time or to a lower
temperature
oxalis acetosellaa very large pot thickly covered with between 300
and 400 leaves had been kept all winter in the greenhouse seven
leaves were pinned horizontally open and were exposed on march 16th
for 2 h to a clear sky the temperature on the surrounding grass being
4 c 24 to 25 f next morning all seven leaves were found quite
killed so were many of the free ones which had previously gone to
sleep and about 100 of them either dead or browned and injured were
picked off some leaves showed that they had been slightly injured by
not expanding during the whole of the next day though they afterwards
recovered as all the leaves which were pinned open were killed and
only about a third or fourth of the others were either killed or
injured we had some little evidence that those which were prevented
from assuming their vertically dependent position suffered most
the following night 17th was clear and almost equally cold 3 to
4 c on the grass and the pot was again exposed but this time for
only 30 m eight leaves had been pinned out
and in the morning two of them were dead whilst not a single other
leaf on the many plants was even injured
on the 23rd the pot was exposed for 1 h 30 m the temperature on the
grass being only 2 c and not one leaf was injured the pinned open
leaves however all stood from  to 34 of an inch above the cork
on the 24th the pot was again placed on the ground and exposed to a
clear sky for between 35 m and 40 m by a mistake the thermometer was
left on an adjoining sundial 3 feet high instead of being placed on
the grass it recorded 25 to 26 f 33 to 38 c but when
looked at after 1 h had fallen to 22 f 55 c so that the pot
was perhaps exposed to rather a lower temperature than on the two first
occasions eight leaves had been pinned out some close to the cork and
some above it and on the following morning five of them ie 63 per
cent were found killed by counting a portion of the leaves we
estimated that about 250 had been allowed to go to sleep and of these
about 20 were killed ie only 8 per cent and about 30 injured
considering these cases there can be no doubt that the leaves of this
oxalis when allowed to assume their normal vertically dependent
position at night suffer much less from frost than those 23 in
number which had their upper surfaces exposed to the zenith
oxalis carnosaa plant of this chilian species was exposed for 30 m
to a clear sky the thermometer on the grass standing at 2 c with
some of its leaves pinned open and not one leaf on the whole bushy
plant was in the least injured on the 16th of march another plant was
similarly exposed for 30 m when the temperature on the grass was only
a little lower viz 3 to 4 c six of the leaves had been pinned
open and next morning five of them were found much browned the plant
was a large one and none of the free leaves which were asleep and
depended vertically were browned excepting four very young ones but
three other leaves though not browned were in a rather flaccid
condition and retained their nocturnal position during the whole of
the following day in this case it was obvious that the leaves which
were exposed horizontally to the zenith suffered most this same pot
was afterwards exposed for 3540 m on a slightly colder night and
every leaf both the pinned open and the free ones was killed it may
be added that two pots of o corniculata var
atropurpurea were exposed for 2 h and 3 h to a clear sky with the
temp on grass 2 c and none of the leaves whether free or pinned
open were at all injured
arachis hypogoeasome plants in a pot were exposed at night for 30 m
to a clear sky the temperature on the surrounding grass being 2 c
and on two nights afterwards they were again exposed to the same
temperature but this time during 1 h 30 m on neither occasion was a
single leaf whether pinned open or free injured and this surprised
us much considering its native tropical african home two plants were
next exposed march 16th for 30 m to a clear sky the temperature of
the surrounding grass being now lower viz between 3 and 4 c
and all four pinnedopen leaves were killed and blackened these two
plants bore 22 other and free leaves excluding some very young
budlike ones and only two of these were killed and three somewhat
injured that is 23 per cent were either killed or injured whereas
all four pinnedopen leaves were utterly killed
on another night two pots with several plants were exposed for between
35 m and 40 m to a clear sky and perhaps to a rather lower
temperature for a thermometer on a dial 3 feet high close by stood
at 33 to 38 c in one pot three leaves were pinned open and all
were badly injured of the 44 free leaves 26 were injured that is 59
per cent in the other pot 3 leaves were pinned open and all were
killed four other leaves were prevented from sleeping by narrow strips
of stiff paper gummed across them and all were killed of 24 free
leaves 10 were killed 2 much injured and 12 unhurt that is 50 per
cent of the free leaves were either killed or much injured taking the
two pots together we may say that rather more than half of the free
leaves which were asleep were either killed or injured whilst all
the ten horizontally extended leaves which had been prevented from
going to sleep were either killed or much injured
cassia floribundaa bush was exposed at night for 40 m to a clear
sky the temperature on the surrounding grass being 2 c and not a
leaf was injured11 it was again exposed on
another night for 1 h when the temperature of the grass was 4 c
and now all the leaves on a large bush whether pinned flat open or
free were killed blackened and shrivelled with the exception of
those on one small branch low down which was very slightly protected
by the leaves on the branches above another tall bush with four of
its large compound leaves pinned out horizontally was afterwards
exposed temp of surrounding grass exactly the same viz 4 c
but only for 30 m on the following morning every single leaflet on
these four leaves was dead with both their upper and lower surfaces
completely blackened of the many free leaves on the bush only seven
were blackened and of these only a single one which was a younger and
more tender leaf than any of the pinned ones had both surfaces of the
leaflets blackened the contrast in this latter respect was well shown
by a free leaf which stood between two pinnedopen ones for these
latter had the lower surfaces of their leaflets as black as ink whilst
the intermediate free leaf though badly injured still retained a
plain tinge of green on the lower surface of the leaflets this bush
exhibited in a striking manner the evil effects of the leaves not being
allowed to assume at night their normal dependent position for had
they all been prevented from doing so assuredly every single leaf on
the bush would have been utterly killed by this exposure of only 30 m
the leaves whilst sinking downwards in the evening twist round so that
the upper surface is turned inwards and is thus better protected than
the outwardly turned lower surface nevertheless it was always the
upper surface which was more blackened than the lower whenever any
difference could be perceived between them but whether this was due to
the cells near the upper surface being more tender or merely to their
containing more chlorophyll we do not know
 11 cassia laevigata was exposed to a clear sky for 35 m and c
 calliantha a guiana species for 60 m the temperature on the
 surrounding grass being 2 c and neither was in the least injured
 but when c laevigata was exposed for 1 h the temp on the
 surrounding grass being between 3 and 4 c every leaf was killed
melilotus officinalisa large pot with many plants which had been
kept during the winter in the greenhouse was exposed during 5 h at
night to a slight frost and clear sky four leaves had been pinned out
and these died after a few days but so did many of the free leaves
therefore nothing certain could be inferred from this trial though it
indicated that the horizontally extended leaves suffered most another
large pot with many plants was next exposed for 1 h the temperature
on the surrounding grass being lower viz 3 to 4 c ten leaves
had been pinned out and the result was striking for on the following
morning all these were found much injured or
killed and none of the many free leaves on the several plants were at
all injured with the doubtful exception of two or three very young
ones
melilotus italicasix leaves were pinned out horizontally three with
their upper and three with their lower surfaces turned to the zenith
the plants were exposed for 5 h to a clear sky the temperature on
ground being about 1 c next morning the six pinnedopen leaves
seemed more injured even than the younger and more tender free ones on
the same branches the exposure however had been too long for after
an interval of some days many of the free leaves seemed in almost as
bad a condition as the pinnedout ones it was not possible to decide
whether the leaves with their upper or those with their lower surfaces
turned to the zenith had suffered most
melilotus suaveolenssome plants with 8 leaves pinned out were exposed
to a clear sky during 2 h the temperature on the surrounding grass
being 2 c next morning 6 out of these 8 leaves were in a flaccid
condition there were about 150 free leaves on the plant and none of
these were injured except 2 or 3 very young ones but after two days
the plants having been brought back into the greenhouse the 6
pinnedout leaves all recovered
melilotus tauricaseveral plants were exposed for 5 h during two
nights to a clear sky and slight frost accompanied by some wind and 5
leaves which had been pinned out suffered more than those both above
and below on the same branches which had gone to sleep another pot
which had likewise been kept in the greenhouse was exposed for 3540
m to a clear sky the temperature of the surrounding grass being
between 3 and 4 c nine leaves had been pinned out and all of
these were killed on the same plants there were 210 free leaves which
had been allowed to go to sleep and of these about 80 were killed
ie only 38 per cent
melilotus petitpierreanathe plants were exposed to a clear sky for
3540 m temperature on surrounding grass 3 to 4 c six leaves had
been pinned out so as to stand about  inch above the cork and four
had been pinned close to it these 10 leaves were all killed but the
closely pinned ones suffered most as 4 of the 6 which stood above the
cork still retained small patches of a green colour a considerable
number but not nearly all of the free leaves were killed or much
injured whereas all the pinned out ones were killed
melilotus macrorrhizathe plants were exposed in the same manner as in
the last case six leaves had been pinned out horizontally and five of
them were killed that is 83 percent we estimated that there were 200
free leaves on the plants and of these about 50 were killed and 20
badly injured so that about 35 per cent of the free leaves were killed
or injured
lotus aristatasix plants were exposed for nearly 5 h to a clear sky
temperature on surrounding grass 15 c four leaves had been pinned
out horizontally and 2 of these suffered more than those above or
below on the same branches which had been allowed to go to sleep it
is rather a remarkable fact that some plants of lotus jacoboeus an
inhabitant of so hot a country as the cape verde islands were exposed
one night to a clear sky with the temperature of the surrounding grass
2 c and on a second night for 30 m with the temperature of the
grass between 3 and 4 c and not a single leaf either the
pinnedout or free ones was in the least injured
marsilea quadrifoliataa large plant of this speciesthe only
cryptogamic plant known to sleepwith some leaves pinned open was
exposed for 1 h 35 m to a clear sky the temperature on the
surrounding ground being 2 c and not a single leaf was injured
after an interval of some days the plant was again exposed for 1 h to
a clear sky with the temperature on the surrounding ground lower
viz 4 c six leaves had been pinned out horizontally and all of
them were utterly killed the plant had emitted long trailing stems
and these had been wrapped round with a blanket so as to protect them
from the frozen ground and from radiation but a very large number of
leaves were left freely exposed which had gone to sleep and of these
only 12 were killed after another interval the plant with 9 leaves
pinned out was again exposed for 1 h the temperature on the ground
being again 4 c six of the leaves were killed and one which did not
at first appear injured afterwards became streaked with brown the
trailing branches which rested on the frozen ground had onehalf or
threequarters of their leaves killed but of the many other leaves on
the plant which alone could be fairly compared with the pinnedout
ones none appeared at first sight to have been killed but on careful
search 12 were found in this state after another interval the plant
with 9 leaves pinned out was exposed for 3540 m to a clear sky and
to nearly the same or perhaps a rather lower temperature for the
thermometer by an accident had been left on a
sundial close by and 8 of these leaves were killed of the free
leaves those on the trailing branches not being considered a good
many were killed but their number compared with the uninjured ones
was small finally taking the three trials together 24 leaves
extended horizontally were exposed to the zenith and to unobstructed
radiation and of these 20 were killed and 1 injured whilst a
relatively very small proportion of the leaves which had been allowed
to go to sleep with their leaflets vertically dependent were killed or
injured
the cotyledons of several plants were prepared for trial but the
weather was mild and we succeeded only in a single instance in having
seedlings of the proper age on nights which were clear and cold the
cotyledons of 6 seedlings of mimosa pudica were fastened open on cork
and were thus exposed for 1 h 45 m to a clear sky with the
temperature on the surrounding ground at 29 f of these 3 were
killed two other seedlings after their cotyledons had risen up and
had closed together were bent over and fastened so that they stood
horizontally with the lower surface of one cotyledon fully exposed to
the zenith and both were killed therefore of the 8 seedlings thus
tried 5 or more than half were killed seven other seedlings with
their cotyledons in their normal nocturnal position viz vertical and
closed were exposed at the same time and of these only 2 were
killed12 hence it appears as far as these few trials tell anything
that the vertical position at night of the cotyledons of mimosa pudica
protects them to a certain degree from the evil effects of radiation
and cold
 12 we were surprised that young seedlings of so tropical a plant as
 mimosa pudica were able to resist as well as they did exposure for 1
 hr 45 m to a clear sky the temperature on the surrounding ground
 being 29 f it may be added that seedlings of the indian cassia
 pubescens were exposed for 1 h 30 m to a clear sky with the temp
 on the surrounding ground at 2 c and they were not in the least
 injured
concluding remarks on the radiation from leaves at nightwe exposed on
two occasions during the summer to a clear sky several pinnedopen
leaflets of trifolium pratense which naturally rise at night and of
oxalis purpurea which naturally sink at night the plants growing out
of doors and looked at
them early on several successive mornings after they had assumed their
diurnal positions the difference in the amount of dew on the
pinnedopen leaflets and on those which had gone to sleep was generally
conspicuous the latter being sometimes absolutely dry whilst the
leaflets which had been horizontal were coated with large beads of dew
this shows how much cooler the leaflets fully exposed to the zenith
must have become than those which stood almost vertically either
upwards or downwards during the night
from the several cases above given there can be no doubt that the
position of the leaves at night affects their temperature through
radiation to such a degree that when exposed to a clear sky during a
frost it is a question of life and death we may therefore admit as
highly probable seeing that their nocturnal position is so well
adapted to lessen radiation that the object gained by their often
complicated sleep movements is to lessen the degree to which they are
chilled at night it should be kept in mind that it is especially the
upper surface which is thus protected as it is never directed towards
the zenith and is often brought into close contact with the upper
surface of an opposite leaf or leaflet
we failed to obtain sufficient evidence whether the better protection
of the upper surface has been gained from its being more easily injured
than the lower surface or from its injury being a greater evil to the
plant that there is some difference in constitution between the two
surfaces is shown by the following cases cassia floribunda was exposed
to a clear sky on a sharp frosty night and several leaflets which had
assumed their nocturnal dependent position with their lower surfaces
turned outwards so as to be
exposed obliquely to the zenith nevertheless had these lower surfaces
less blackened than the upper surfaces which were turned inwards and
were in close contact with those of the opposite leaflets again a pot
full of plants of trifolium resupinatum which had been kept in a warm
room for three days was turned out of doors sept 21st on a clear
and almost frosty night next morning ten of the terminal leaflets were
examined as opaque objects under the microscope these leaflets in
going to sleep either turn vertically upwards or more commonly bend a
little over the lateral leaflets so that their lower surfaces are more
exposed to the zenith than their upper surfaces nevertheless six of
these ten leaflets were distinctly yellower on the upper than on the
lower and more exposed surface in the remaining four the result was
not so plain but certainly whatever difference there was leaned to the
side of the upper surface having suffered most
it has been stated that some of the leaflets experimented on were
fastened close to the cork and others at a height of from  to 34 of
an inch above it and that whenever after exposure to a frost any
difference could be detected in their states the closely pinned ones
had suffered most we attributed this difference to the air not cooled
by radiation having been prevented from circulating freely beneath the
closely pinned leaflets that there was really a difference in the
temperature of leaves treated in these two different methods was
plainly shown on one occasion for after the exposure of a pot with
plants of melilotus dentata for 2 h to a clear sky the temperature on
the surrounding grass being 2 c it was manifest that more dew had
congealed into hoarfrost on the closely pinned leaflets than on those
which stood horizontally
a little above the cork again the tips of some few leaflets which
had been pinned close to the cork projected a little beyond the edge
so that the air could circulate freely round them this occurred with
six leaflets of oxalis acetosella and their tips certainly suffered
rather less then the rest of the same leaflets for on the following
morning they were still slightly green the same result followed even
still more clearly in two cases with leaflets of melilotus officinalis
which projected a little beyond the cork and in two other cases some
leaflets which were pinned close to the cork were injured whilst other
free leaflets on the same leaves which had not space to rotate and
assume their proper vertical position were not at all injured
another analogous fact deserves notice we observed on several
occasions that a greater number of free leaves were injured on the
branches which had been kept motionless by some of their leaves having
been pinned to the corks than on the other branches this was
conspicuously the case with those of melilotus petitpierreana but the
injured leaves in this instance were not actually counted with arachis
hypogaea a young plant with 7 stems bore 22 free leaves and of these
5 were injured by the frost all of which were on two stems bearing
four leaves pinned to the corksupports with oxalis carnosa 7 free
leaves were injured and every one of them belonged to a cluster of
leaves some of which had been pinned to the cork we could account for
these cases only by supposing that the branches which were quite free
had been slightly waved about by the wind and that their leaves had
thus been a little warmed by the surrounding warmer air if we hold our
hands motionless before a hot fire and then wave them about we
immediately feel relief and this is evidently an analogous though
reversed case these several factsin relation to leaves pinned close
to or a little above the corksupportsto their tips projecting beyond
itand to the leaves on branches kept motionlessseem to us curious as
showing how a difference apparently trifling may determine the
greater or less injury of the leaves we may even infer as probable
that the less or greater destruction during a frost of the leaves on a
plant which does not sleep may often depend on the greater or less
degree of flexibility of their petioles and of the branches which bear
them
nyctitropic or sleep movements of cotyledons
we now come to the descriptive part of our work and will begin with
cotyledons passing on to leaves in the next chapter we have met with
only two brief notices of cotyledons sleeping hofmeister13 after
stating that the cotyledons of all the observed seedlings of the
caryophylleae alsineae and sileneae bend upwards at night but to
what angle he does not state remarks that those of stellaria media
rise up so as to touch one another they may therefore safely be said
to sleep secondly according to ramey14 the cotyledons of mimosa
pudica and of clianthus dampieri rise up almost vertically at night and
approach each other closely it has been shown in a previous chapter
that the cotyledons of a large number of plants bend a little upwards
at night and we here have to meet the difficult question at what
inclination may they be said to sleep according to the view which we
maintain no movement deserves to be called
nyctitropic unless it has been acquired for the sake of lessening
radiation but this could be discovered only by a long series of
experiments showing that the leaves of each species suffered from this
cause if prevented from sleeping we must therefore take an arbitrary
limit if a cotyledon or leaf is inclined at 60 above or beneath the
horizon it exposes to the zenith about onehalf of its area
consequently the intensity of its radiation will be lessened by about
half compared with what it would have been if the cotyledon or leaf
had remained horizontal this degree of diminution certainly would make
a great difference to a plant having a tender constitution we will
therefore speak of a cotyledon and hereafter of a leaf as sleeping
only when it rises at night to an angle of about 60 or to a still
higher angle above the horizon or sinks beneath it to the same
amount not but that a lesser diminution of radiation may be
advantageous to a plant as in the case of datura stramonium the
cotyledons of which rose from 31 at noon to 55 at night above the
horizon the swedish turnip may profit by the area of its leaves being
reduced at night by about 30 per cent as estimated by mr a s
wilson though in this case the angle through which the leaves rose was
not observed on the other hand when the angular rise of cotyledons or
of leaves is small such as less than 30 the diminution of radiation
is so slight that it probably is of no significance to the plant in
relation to radiation for instance the cotyledons of geranium
ibericum rose at night to 27 above the horizon and this would lessen
radiation by only 11 per cent those of linum berendieri rose to 33
and this would lessen radiation by 16 per cent

there are however some other sources of doubt with
respect to the sleep of cotyledons in certain cases the cotyledons
whilst young diverge during the day to only a very moderate extent so
that a small rise at night which we know occurs with the cotyledons of
many plants would necessarily cause them to assume a vertical or
nearly vertical position at night and in this case it would be rash to
infer that the movement was effected for any special purpose on this
account we hesitated long whether we should introduce several
cucurbitaceous plants into the following list but from reasons
presently to be given we thought that they had better be at least
temporarily included this same source of doubt applies in some few
other cases for at the commencement of our observations we did not
always attend sufficiently to whether the cotyledons stood nearly
horizontally in the middle of the day with several seedlings the
cotyledons assume a highly inclined position at night during so short a
period of their life that a doubt naturally arises whether this can be
of any service to the plant nevertheless in most of the cases given
in the following list the cotyledons may be as certainly said to sleep
as may the leaves of any plant in two cases namely with the cabbage
and radish the cotyledons of which rise almost vertically during the
few first nights of their life it was ascertained by placing young
seedlings in the klinostat that the upward movement was not due to
apogeotropism
the names of the plants the cotyledons of which stand at night at an
angle of at least 60 with the horizon are arranged in the appended
list on the same system as previously followed the numbers of the
families and with the leguminosae the numbers of the tribes have been
added to show how widely the plants in question are distributed
throughout the
dicotyledonous series a few remarks will have to be made about many of
the plants in the list in doing so it will be convenient not to
follow strictly any systematic order but to treat of the oxalid and
the leguminosae at the close for in these two families the cotyledons
are generally provided with a pulvinus and their movements endure for
a much longer time than those of the other plants in the list

to an angle of at least 60 above or beneath the horizon

brassica oleracea cruciferaeit was shown in the first chapter that
the cotyledons of the common cabbage rise in the evening and stand
vertically up at night with their petioles in contact but as the two
cotyledons are of unequal height they frequently interfere a little
with each others movements the shorter one often not standing quite
vertically they awake early in the morning thus at 645 am on nov
27th whilst if was still dark the cotyledons which had been vertical
and in contact on the previous evening were reflexed and thus
presented a very different appearance it should be borne in mind that
seedlings in germinating at the proper season would not be subjected
to darkness at this hour in the morning the above amount of movement
of the cotyledons is only temporary lasting with plants kept in a warm
greenhouse from four to six days how long it would last with seedlings
growing out of doors we do not know
raphanus sativusin the middle of the day the blades of the cotyledons
of 10 seedlings stood at right angles to their hypocotyls with their
petioles a little divergent at night the blades stood vertically with
their bases in contact and with their petioles parallel next morning
at 645 am whilst it was still dark the blades were horizontal on
the following night they were much raised but hardly stood
sufficiently vertical to be said to be asleep and so it was in a still
less degree on the third night therefore the cotyledons of this plant
kept in the greenhouse go to sleep for even a shorter time than those
of the cabbage similar observations were made but only during a
single day and night on 13 other seedlings likewise raised in the
greenhouse with the same result
the petioles of the cotyledons of 11 young seedlings of sinapis nigra
were slightly divergent at noon and the blades stood at right angles
to the hypocotyls at night the petioles were in close contact and the
blades considerably raised with their bases in contact but only a few
stood sufficiently upright to be called asleep on the following
morning
the petioles diverged before it was light the hypocotyl is slightly
sensitive so that if rubbed with a needle it bends towards the rubbed
side in the case of lepidium sativum the petioles of the cotyledons
of young seedlings diverge during the day and converge so as to touch
each other during the night by which means the bases of the tripartite
blades are brought into contact but the blades are so little raised
that they cannot be said to sleep the cotyledons of several other
cruciferous plants were observed but they did not rise sufficiently
during the night to be said to sleep
githago segetum caryophylleaeon the first day after the cotyledons
had burst through the seedcoats they stood at noon at an angle of 75
above the horizon at night they moved upwards each through an angle
of 15 so as to stand quite vertical and in contact with one another
on the second day they stood at noon at 59 above the horizon and
again at night were completely closed each having risen 31 on the
fourth day the cotyledons did not quite close at night the first and
succeeding pairs of young true leaves behaved in exactly the same
manner we think that the movement in this case may be called
nyctitropic though the angle passed through was small the cotyledons
are very sensitive to light and will not expand if exposed to an
extremely dim one
anoda wrightii malvaceaethe cotyledons whilst moderately young and
only from 2 to 3 inch in diameter sink in the evening from their
midday horizontal position to about 35 beneath the horizon but when
the same seedlings were older and had produced small true leaves the
almost orbicular cotyledons now 55 inch in diameter moved vertically
downwards at night this fact made us suspect that their sinking might
be due merely to their weight but they were not in the least flaccid
and when lifted up sprang back through elasticity into their former
dependent position a pot with some old seedlings was turned upside
down in the afternoon before the nocturnal fall had commenced and at
night they assumed in opposition to their own weight and to any
geotropic action an upwardly directed vertical position when pots
were thus reversed after the evening fall had already commenced the
sinking movement appeared to be somewhat disturbed but all their
movements were occasionally variable without any apparent cause this
latter fact as well as that of the young cotyledons not sinking nearly
so much as the older ones deserves notice
although the movement of the cotyledons endured for a long time no
pulvinus was exteriorly visible but their growth continued for a long
time the cotyledons appear to be only slightly heliotropic though the
hypocotyl is strongly so
gossypium arboreum  var nankin cotton malvaceaethe cotyledons
behave in nearly the same manner as those of the anoda on june 15th
the cotyledons of two seedlings were 65 inch in length measured along
the midrib and stood horizontally at noon at 10 pm they occupied
the same position and had not fallen at all on june 23rd the
cotyledons of one of these seedlings were 11 inch in length and by 10
pm they had fallen from a horizontal position to 62 beneath the
horizon the cotyledons of the other seedling were 13 inch in length
and a minute true leaf had been formed they had fallen at 10 pm to
70 beneath the horizon on june 25th the true leaf of this latter
seedling was 9 inch in length and the cotyledons occupied nearly the
same position at night by july 9th the cotyledons appeared very old
and showed signs of withering but they stood at noon almost
horizontally and at 10 pm hung down vertically
gossypium herbaceumit is remarkable that the cotyledons of this
species behave differently from those of the last they were observed
during 6 weeks from their first development until they had grown to a
very large size still appearing fresh and green viz 2 inches in
breadth at this age a true leaf had been formed which with its
petiole was 2 inches long during the whole of these 6 weeks the
cotyledons did not sink at night yet when old their weight was
considerable and they were borne by much elongated petioles seedlings
raised from some seed sent us from naples behaved in the same manner
as did those of a kind cultivated in alabama and of the seaisland
cotton to what species these three latter forms belong we do not know
we could not make out in the case of the naples cotton that the
position of the cotyledons at night was influenced by the soil being
more or less dry care being taken that they were not rendered flaccid
by being too dry the weight of the large cotyledons of the alabama and
seaisland kinds caused them to hang somewhat downwards when the pots
in which they grew were left for a time upside down it should
however be observed that these three kinds were raised in the middle
of the winter which sometimes greatly interferes with the proper
nyctitropic movements of leaves and cotyledons
cucurbitacethe cotyledons of cucurbita aurantia and ovifera and of
lagenaria vulgaris stand from the 1st to the 3rd day of their life at
about 60 above the horizon and at night rise up so as to become
vertical and in close contact with one another with cucumis dudaim
they stood at noon at 45 above the horizon and closed at night the
tips of the cotyledons of all these species are however reflexed so
that this part is fully exposed to the zenith at night and this fact
is opposed to the belief that the movement is of the same nature as
that of sleeping plants after the first two or three days the
cotyledons diverge more during the day and cease to close at night
those of trichosanthes anguina are somewhat thick and fleshy and did
not rise at night and they could perhaps hardly be expected to do so
on the other hand those of acanthosicyos horrida15 present nothing
in their appearance opposed to their moving at night in the same manner
as the preceding species yet they did not rise up in any plain manner
this fact leads to the belief that the nocturnal movements of the
abovenamed species has been acquired for some special purpose which
may be to protect the young plumule from radiation by the close
contact of the whole basal portion of the two cotyledons
 15 this plant from dammara land in s africa is remarkable from
 being the one known member of the family which is not a climber it
 has been described in transact linn soc xxvii p 30
geranium rotundifolium geraniaceaea single seedling came up
accidentally in a pot and its cotyledons were observed to bend
perpendicularly downwards during several successive nights having been
horizontal at noon it grew into a fine plant but died before
flowering it was sent to kew and pronounced to be certainly a
geranium and in all probability the abovenamed species this case is
remarkable because the cotyledons of g cinereum endressii ibericum
richardsoni and subcaulescens were observed during some weeks in the
winter and they did not sink whilst those of g ibericum rose 27 at
night
apium petroselinum umbelliferaea seedling had its cotyledons nov
22nd almost fully expanded during the day by 830 pm they had risen
considerably and at 1030 pm were almost closed their tips being
only 8100 of an inch apart on the following morning 23rd the tips
were 58100 of an inch apart
or more than seven times as much on the next night the cotyledons
occupied nearly the same position as before on the morning of the 24th
they stood horizontally and at night were 60 above the horizon and
so it was on the night of the 25th but four days afterwards on the
29th when the seedlings were a week old the cotyledons had ceased to
rise at night to any plain degree
apium graveolensthe cotyledons at noon were horizontal and at 10
pm stood at an angle of 61 above the horizon
lactuca scariola compositthe cotyledons whilst young stood
subhorizontally during the day and at night rose so as to be almost
vertical and some were quite vertical and closed but this movement
ceased when they had grown old and large after an interval of 11 days
helianthus annuus compositthis case is rather doubtful the
cotyledons rise at night and on one occasion they stood at 73 above
the horizon so that they might then be said to have been asleep
ipoma caerulea vel pharbitis nil convolvulaceaethe cotyledons
behave in nearly the same manner as those of the anoda and nankin
cotton and like them grow to a large size whilst young and small so
that their blades were from 5 to 6 of an inch in length measured
along the middle to the base of the central notch they remained
horizontal both during the middle of the day and at night as they
increased in size they began to sink more and more in the evening and
early night and when they had grown to a length measured in the above
manner of from 1 to 125 inch they sank between 55 and 70 beneath
the horizon they acted however in this manner only when they had
been well illuminated during the day nevertheless the cotyledons have
little or no power of bending towards a lateral light although the
hypocotyl is strongly heliotropic they are not provided with a
pulvinus but continue to grow for a long time
ipoma purpurea vel pharbitis hispidathe cotyledons behave in all
respects like those of i caerulea a seedling with cotyledons 75 inch
in length measured as before and 165 inch in breadth having a small
true leaf developed was placed at 530 pm on a klinostat in a
darkened box so that neither weight nor geotropism could act on them
at 10 pm one cotyledon stood at 77 and the other at 82 beneath the
horizon before being placed in the klinostat they stood at 15 and 29
beneath the horizon the nocturnal position depends chiefly on the
curvature of the petiole close to the blade but the whole petiole
becomes slightly curved downwards it deserves notice that seedlings of
this and the lastnamed species were raised at the end of february and
another lot in the middle of march and the cotyledons in neither case
exhibited any nyctitropic movement
ipoma bonanoxthe cotyledons after a few days grow to an enormous
size those on a young seedling being 3 14 inches in breadth they
were extended horizontally at noon and at 10 pm stood at 63 beneath
the horizon five days afterwards they were 4 inches in breadth and
at night one stood at 64 and the other 48 beneath the horizon though
the blades are thin yet from their great size and from the petioles
being long we imagined that their depression at night might be
determined by their weight but when the pot was laid horizontally
they became curved towards the hypocotyl which movement could not have
been in the least aided by their weight at the same time they were
somewhat twisted upwards through apogeotropism nevertheless the
weight of the cotyledons is so far influential that when on another
night the pot was turned upside down they were unable to rise and thus
to assume their proper nocturnal position
ipoma coccineathe cotyledons whilst young do not sink at night but
when grown a little older but still only 4 inch in length measured
as before and 82 in breadth they became greatly depressed in one
case they were horizontal at noon and at 10 pm one of them stood at
64 and the other at 47 beneath the horizon the blades are thin and
the petioles which become much curved down at night are short so
that here weight can hardly have produced any effect with all the
above species of ipoma when the two cotyledons on the same seedling
were unequally depressed at night this seemed to depend on the
position which they had held during the day with reference to the
light
solanum lycopersicum solaneaethe cotyledons rise so much at night
as to come nearly in contact those of s palinacanthum were
horizontal at noon and by 10 pm had risen only 27 30 minutes but
on the following morning before it was light they stood at 59 above
the horizon and in the afternoon of the same day were again
horizontal the behaviour of the cotyledons of this latter species
seems therefore to be anomalous
mirabilis jalapa and longiflora nyctagineaethe cotyledons which
are of unequal size stand horizontally during the middle of the day
and at night rise up vertically and come into close contact with one
another but this movement with m longiflora lasted for only the three
first nights
beta vulgaris polygoneaea large number of seedlings were observed
on three occasions during the day the cotyledons sometimes stood
subhorizontally but more commonly at an angle of about 50 above the
horizon and for the first two or three nights they rose up vertically
so as to be completely closed during the succeeding one or two nights
they rose only a little and afterwards hardly at all
amaranthus caudatus amaranthaceaeat noon the cotyledons of many
seedlings which had just germinated stood at about 45 above the
horizon and at 1015 pm some were nearly and the others quite
closed on the following morning they were again well expanded or open
cannabis sativa cannabineaewe are very doubtful whether this plant
ought to be here included the cotyledons of a large number of
seedlings after being well illuminated during the day were curved
downwards at night so that the tips of some pointed directly to the
ground but the basal part did not appear to be at all depressed on
the following morning they were again flat and horizontal the
cotyledons of many other seedlings were at the same time not in any way
affected therefore this case seems very different from that of
ordinary sleep and probably comes under the head of epinasty as is
the case with the leaves of this plant according to kraus the
cotyledons are heliotropic and so is the hypocotyl in a still stronger
degree
oxaliswe now come to cotyledons provided with a pulvinus all of
which are remarkable from the continuance of the nocturnal movements
during several days or even weeks and apparently after growth has
ceased the cotyledons of o rosea floribunda and articulata sink
vertically down at night and clasp the upper part of the hypocotyl
those of o valdiviana and sensitiva on the contrary rise vertically
up so that their upper surfaces come into close contact and after the
young leaves are developed these are clasped by the cotyledons as in
the daytime they stand horizontally or are even a little deflected
beneath the horizon they move in the evening through an angle of at
least 90 their complicated circumnutating movements during the day
have
been described in the first chapter the experiment was a superfluous
one but pots with seedlings of o rosea and floribunda were turned
upside down as soon as the cotyledons began to show any signs of
sleep and this made no difference in their movements
leguminosaeit may be seen in our list that the cotyledons of several
species in nine genera widely distributed throughout the family sleep
at night and this probably is the case with many others the
cotyledons of all these species are provided with a pulvinus and the
movement in all is continued during many days or weeks in cassia the
cotyledons of the ten species in the list rise up vertically at night
and come into close contact with one another we observed that those of
c florida opened in the morning rather later than those of c glauca
and pubescens the movement is exactly the same in c mimosoides as in
the other species though its subsequently developed leaves sleep in a
different manner the cotyledons of an eleventh species namely c
nodosa are thick and fleshy and do not rise up at night the
circumnutation of the cotyledons during the day of c tora has been
described in the first chapter although the cotyledons of smithia
sensitiva rose from a horizontal position in the middle of the day to a
vertical one at night those of s pfundii which are thick and fleshy
did not sleep when mimosa pudica and albida have been kept at a
sufficiently high temperature during the day the cotyledons come into
close contact at night otherwise they merely rise up almost
vertically the circumnutation of those of m pudica has been
described the cotyledons of a bauhinia from st catharina in brazil
stood during the day at an angle of about 50 above the horizon and at
night rose to 77 but it is probable that they would have closed
completely if the seedlings had been kept in a warmer place
lotusin three species of lotus the cotyledons were observed to sleep
those of l jacoboeus present the singular case of not rising at night
in any conspicuous manner for the first 5 or 6 days of their life and
the pulvinus is not well developed at this period afterwards the
sleeping movement is well displayed though to a variable degree and
is long continued we shall hereafter meet with a nearly parallel case
with the leaves of sida rhombifolia the cotyledons of l gebelii are
only slightly raised at night and differ much in this respect from the
three species in our list
trifoliumthe germination of 21 species was observed in most of them
the cotyledons rise hardly at all or only slightly at night but
those of t glomeratum striatum and incarnactum rose from 45 to 55
above the horizon with t subterraneum leucanthemum and strictum
they stood up vertically and with t strictum the rising movement is
accompanied as we shall see by another movement which makes us
believe that the rising is truly nyctitropic we did not carefully
examine the cotyledons of all the species for a pulvinus but this
organ was distinctly present in those of t subterraneum and strictum
whilst there was no trace of a pulvinus in some species for instance
in t resupinatum the cotyledons of which do not rise at night
trifolium subterraneumthe blades of the cotyledons on the first day
after germination nov 21st were not fully expanded being inclined
at about 35 above the horizon at night they rose to about 75 two
days afterwards the blades at noon were horizontal with the petioles
highly inclined upwards and it is remarkable that the nocturnal
movement is almost wholly confined to the blades being effected by the
pulvinus at their bases whilst the petioles retain day and night
nearly the same inclination on this night nov 23rd and for some
few succeeding nights the blades rose from a horizontal into a
vertical position and then became bowed inwards at about an average
angle of 10 so that they had passed through an angle of 100 their
tips now almost touched one another their bases being slightly
divergent the two blades thus formed a highly inclined roof over the
axis of the seedling this movement is the same as that of the terminal
leaflet of the tripartite leaves of many species of trifolium after an
interval of 8 days nov 29th the blades were horizontal during the
day and vertical at night and now they were no longer bowed inwards
they continued to move in the same manner for the following two months
by which time they had increased greatly in size their petioles being
no less than 8 of an inch in length and two true leaves had by this
time been developed
trifolium strictumon the first day after germination the cotyledons
which are provided with a pulvinus stood at noon horizontally and at
night rose to only about 45 above the horizon four days afterwards
the seedlings were again observed at night and now the blades stood
vertically and were in contact excepting the tips which were much
deflexed so that they faced the zenith at this age the petioles are
curved
upwards and at night when the bases of the blades are in contact the
two petioles together form a vertical ring surrounding the plumule the
cotyledons continued to act in nearly the same manner for 8 or 10 days
from the period of germination but the petioles had by this time
become straight and had increased much in length after from 12 to 14
days the first simple true leaf was formed and during the ensuing
fortnight a remarkable movement was repeatedly observed at i fig
125 we have a sketch made in the middle of the day of a seedling
about a fortnight old the two cotyledons of which rc is the right and
lc the left one stand directly opposite one another and the first
true leaf f projects at right angles to them at night see ii and
iii the right cotyledon rc is greatly raised but is not otherwise
changed in position the left cotyledon lc is likewise raised but it
is also twisted so that its blade instead of exactly facing the
opposite one now stands at nearly right angles to it this nocturnal
twisting movement is effected not by means of the pulvinus but by the
twisting of the whole length of the petiole as could be seen by the
curved line of its upper concave surface at the same time the true
leaf f rises up so as to stand vertically or it even passes the
vertical and is inclined a little inwards it also twists a little by
which means the upper surface of its blade fronts and almost comes
into contact with the upper surface of the twisted
left cotyledon this seems to be the object gained by these singular
movements altogether 20 seedlings were examined on successive nights
and in 19 of them it was the left cotyledon alone which became twisted
with the true leaf always so twisted that its upper surface approached
closely and fronted that of the left cotyledon in only one instance
was the right cotyledon twisted with the true leaf twisted towards it
but this seedling was in an abnormal condition as the left cotyledon
did not rise up properly at night this whole case is remarkable as
with the cotyledons of no other plant have we seen any nocturnal
movement except vertically upwards or downwards it is the more
remarkable because we shall meet with an analogous case in the leaves
of the allied genus melilotus in which the terminal leaflet rotates at
night so as to present one edge to the zenith and at the same time
bends to one side so that its upper surface comes into contact with
that of one of the two now vertical lateral leaflets

concluding remarks on the nyctitropic movements of cotyledonsthe
sleep of cotyledons though this is a subject which has been little
attended to seems to be a more common phenomenon than that of leaves
we observed the position of the cotyledons during the day and night in
153 genera widely distributed throughout the dicotyledonous series
but otherwise selected almost by hazard and one or more species in 26
of these genera placed their cotyledons at night so as to stand
vertically or almost vertically having generally moved through an
angle of at least 60 if we lay on one side the leguminosae the
cotyledons of which are particularly liable to sleep 140 genera
remain and out of these the cotyledons of at least one species in 19
genera slept now if we were to select by hazard 140 genera excluding
the leguminosae and observed their leaves at night assuredly not
nearly so many as 19 would be found to include sleeping species we
here refer exclusively to the plants observed by ourselves
in our entire list of seedlings there are 30 genera belonging to 16
families the cotyledons of which in some of the species rise or sink
in the evening or early night so as to stand at least 60 above or
beneath the horizon in a large majority of the genera namely 24 the
movement is a rising one so that the same direction prevails in these
nyctitropic movements as in the lesser periodic ones described in the
second chapter the cotyledons move downwards during the early part of
the night in only 6 of the genera and in one of them cannabis the
curving down of the tip is probably due to epinasty as kraus believes
to be the case with the leaves the downward movement to the amount of
90 is very decided in oxalis valdiviana and sensitiva and in geranium
rotundifolium it is a remarkable fact that with anoda wrightii one
species of gossypium and at least 3 species of ipoma the cotyledons
whilst young and light sink at night very little or not at all
although this movement becomes well pronounced as soon as they have
grown large and heavy although the downward movement cannot be
attributed to the weight of the cotyledons in the several cases which
were investigated namely in those of the anoda ipoma purpurea and
bonanox nor in that of i coccinea yet bearing in mind that
cotyledons are continually circumnutating a slight cause might at
first have determined whether the great nocturnal movement should be
upwards or downwards we may therefore suspect that in some aboriginal
member of the groups in question the weight of the cotyledons first
determined the downward direction the fact of the cotyledons of these
species not sinking down much whilst they are young and tender seems
opposed to the belief that the greater movement when they are
grown older has been acquired for the sake of protecting them from
radiation at night but then we should remember that there are many
plants the leaves of which sleep whilst the cotyledons do not and if
in some cases the leaves are protected from cold at night whilst the
cotyledons are not protected so in other cases it may be of more
importance to the species that the nearly fullgrown cotyledons should
be better protected than the young ones
in all the species of oxalis observed by us the cotyledons are
provided with pulvini but this organ has become more or less
rudimentary in o corniculata and the amount of upward movement of its
cotyledons at night is very variable but is never enough to be called
sleep we omitted to ascertain whether the cotyledons of geranium
rotundifolium possess pulvini in the leguminosae all the cotyledons
which sleep as far as we have seen are provided with pulvini but
with lotus jacobus these are not fully developed during the first few
days of the life of the seedling and the cotyledons do not then rise
much at night with trifolium strictum the blades of the cotyledons
rise at night by the aid of their pulvini whilst the petiole of one
cotyledon twists halfround at the same time independently of its
pulvinus
as a general rule cotyledons which are provided with pulvini continue
to rise or sink at night during a much longer period than those
destitute of this organ in this latter case the movement no doubt
depends on alternately greater growth on the upper and lower side of
the petiole or of the blade or of both preceded probably by the
increased turgescence of the growing cells such movements generally
last for a very short periodfor instance with brassica and githago
for 4 or 5 nights with beta for 2 or 3 and with
raphanus for only a single night there are however some strong
exceptions to this rule as the cotyledons of gossypium anoda and
ipoma do not possess pulvini yet continue to move and to grow for a
long time we thought at first that when the movement lasted for only 2
or 3 nights it could hardly be of any service to the plant and hardly
deserved to be called sleep but as many quicklygrowing leaves sleep
for only a few nights and as cotyledons are rapidly developed and soon
complete their growth this doubt now seems to us not wellfounded
more especially as these movements are in many instances so strongly
pronounced we may here mention another point of similarity between
sleeping leaves and cotyledons namely that some of the latter for
instance those of cassia and githago are easily affected by the
absence of light and they then either close or if closed do not open
whereas others as with the cotyledons of oxalis are very little
affected by light in the next chapter it will be shown that the
nyctitropic movements both of cotyledons and leaves consist of a
modified form of circumnutation
as in the leguminosae and oxalid the leaves and the cotyledons of the
same species generally sleep the idea at first naturally occurred to
us that the sleep of the cotyledons was merely an early development of
a habit proper to a more advanced stage of life but no such
explanation can be admitted although there seems to be some
connection as might have been expected between the two sets of cases
for the leaves of many plants sleep whilst their cotyledons do not do
soof which fact desmodium gyrans offers a good instance as likewise
do three species of nicotiana observed by us also sida rhombifolia
abutilon darwinii and chenopodium album on the other
hand the cotyledons of some plants sleep and not the leaves as with
the species of beta brassica geranium apium solanum and mirabilis
named in our list still more striking is the fact that in the same
genus the leaves of several or of all the species may sleep but the
cotyledons of only some of them as occurs with trifolium lotus
gossypium and partially with oxalis again when both the cotyledons
and the leaves of the same plant sleep their movements may be of a
widely dissimilar nature thus with cassia the cotyledons rise
vertically up at night whilst their leaves sink down and twist round
so as to turn their lower surfaces outwards with seedlings of oxalis
valdiviana having 2 or 3 welldeveloped leaves it was a curious
spectacle to behold at night each leaflet folded inwards and hanging
perpendicularly downwards whilst at the same time and on the same
plant the cotyledons stood vertically upwards
these several facts showing the independence of the nocturnal
movements of the leaves and cotyledons on the same plant and on plants
belonging to the same genus lead to the belief that the cotyledons
have acquired their power of movement for some special purpose other
facts lead to the same conclusion such as the presence of pulvini by
the aid of which the nocturnal movement is continued during some weeks
in oxalis the cotyledons of some species move vertically upwards and
of others vertically downwards at night but this great difference
within the same natural genus is not so surprising as it may at first
appear seeing that the cotyledons of all the species are continually
oscillating up and down during the day so that a small cause might
determine whether they should rise or sink at night again the
peculiar nocturnal movement of the lefthand
cotyledon of trifolium strictum in combination with that of the first
true leaf lastly the wide distribution in the dicotyledonous series
of plants with cotyledons which sleep reflecting on these several
facts our conclusion seems justified that the nyctitropic movements
of cotyledons by which the blade is made to stand either vertically or
almost vertically upwards or downwards at night has been acquired at
least in most cases for some special purpose nor can we doubt that
this purpose is the protection of the upper surface of the blade and
perhaps of the central bud or plumule from radiation at night

we now come to the nyctitropic or sleep movements of leaves it should
be remembered that we confine this term to leaves which place their
blades at night either in a vertical position or not more than 30 from
the verticalthat is at least 60 above or beneath the horizon in
some few cases this is effected by the rotation of the blade the
petiole not being either raised or lowered to any considerable extent
the limit of 30 from the vertical is obviously an arbitrary one and
has been selected for reasons previously assigned namely that when
the blade approaches the perpendicular as nearly as this only half as
much of the surface is exposed at night to the
zenith and to free radiation as when the blade is horizontal
nevertheless in a few instances leaves which seem to be prevented by
their structure from moving to so great an extent as 60 above or
beneath the horizon have been included amongst sleeping plants
it should be premised that the nyctitropic movements of leaves are
easily affected by the conditions to which the plants have been
subjected if the ground is kept too dry the movements are much
delayed or fail according to dassen1 even if the air is very dry
the leaves of impatiens and malva are rendered motionless carl kraus
has also lately insisted2 on the great influence which the quantity
of water absorbed has on the periodic movements of leaves and he
believes that this cause chiefly determines the variable amount of
sinking of the leaves of polygonum convolvulus at night and if so
their movements are not in our sense strictly nyctitropic plants in
order to sleep must have been exposed to a proper temperature
erythrina cristagalli out of doors and nailed against a wall seemed
in fairly good health but the leaflets did not sleep whilst those on
another plant kept in a warm greenhouse were all vertically dependent
at night in a kitchengarden the leaflets of phaseolus vulgaris did
not sleep during the early part of the summer ch royer says3
referring i suppose to the native plants in france that they do not
sleep when the temperature is below 5 c or 41 f in the case of
several sleeping plants viz species of
tropaeolum lupinus ipoma abutilon siegesbeckia and probably other
genera it is indispensable that the leaves should be well illuminated
during the day in order that they may assume at night a vertical
position and it was probably owing to this cause that seedlings of
chenopodium album and siegesbeckia orientalis raised by us during the
middle of the winter though kept at a proper temperature did not
sleep lastly violent agitation by a strong wind during a few
minutes of the leaves of maranta arundinacea which previously had not
been disturbed in the hothouse prevented their sleeping during the
two next nights

we will now give our observations on sleeping plants made in the
manner described in the introduction the stem of the plant was always
secured when not stated to the contrary close to the base of the
leaf the movements of which were being observed so as to prevent the
stem from circumnutating as the tracings were made on a vertical glass
in front of the plant it was obviously impossible to trace its course
as soon as the leaf became in the evening greatly inclined either
upwards or downwards it must therefore be understood that the broken
lines in the diagrams which represent the evening and nocturnal
courses ought always to be prolonged to a much greater distance
either upwards or downwards than appears in them the conclusions
which may be deduced from our observations will be given near the end
of this chapter
in the following list all the genera which include sleeping plants are
given as far as known to us the same arrangement is followed as in
former cases and the number of the family is appended this list
possesses some interest as it shows that the habit of
sleeping is common to some few plants throughout the whole vascular
series the greater number of the genera in the list have been observed
by ourselves with more or less care but several are given on the
authority of others whose names are appended in the list and about
these we have nothing more to say no doubt the list is very imperfect
and several genera might have been added from the somnus plantarum by
linnus but we could not judge in some of his cases whether the
blades occupied at night a nearly vertical position he refers to some
plants as sleeping for instance lathyrus odoratus and vicia faba in
which we could observe no movement deserving to be called sleep and as
no one can doubt the accuracy of linnus we are left in doubt

githago segetum caryophylleaethe first leaves produced by young
seedlings rise up and close together at night on a rather older
seedling two young leaves stood at noon at 55 above the horizon and
at night at 86 so each had risen 31 the angle however was less in
some cases similar observations were occasionally made on young leaves
for the older ones moved very little produced by nearly fullgrown
plants batalin says flora oct 1st 1873 p 437 that the young
leaves of stellaria close up so completely at night that they form
together great buds
sida malvaceaethe nyctitropic movements of the leaves in this genus
are remarkable in some respects batalin informs
us see also flora oct 1st 1873 p 437 that those of s napaea
fall at night but to what angle he cannot remember the leaves of s
rhombifolia and retusa on the other hand rise up vertically and are
pressed against the stem we have therefore here within the same genus
directly opposite movements again the leaves of s rhombifolia are
furnished with a pulvinus formed of a mass of small cells destitute of
chlorophyll and with their longer axes perpendicular to the axis of
the petiole as measured along this latter line these cells are only
15th of the length of those of the petiole but instead of being
abruptly separated from them as is usual with the pulvinus in most
plants they graduate into the larger cells of the petiole on the
other hand s napaea according to batalin does not possess a
pulvinus and he informs us that a gradation may be traced in the
several species of the genus between these two states of the petiole
sida rhombifolia presents another peculiarity of which we have seen no
other instance with leaves that sleep for those on very young plants
though they rise somewhat in the evening do not go to sleep as we
observed
on several occasions whilst those on rather older plants sleep in a
conspicuous manner for instance a leaf 85 of an inch in length on a
very young seedling 2 inches high stood at noon 9 above the horizon
and at 10 pm at 28 so it had risen only 19 another leaf 14 inch
in length on a seedling of the same height stood at the same two
periods at 7 and 32 and therefore had risen 25 these leaves which
moved so little had a fairly welldeveloped pulvinus after an
interval of some weeks when the same seedlings were 2 and 3 inches in
height some of the young leaves stood up at night quite vertically
and others were highly inclined and so it was with bushes which were
fully grown and were flowering

movements of a leaf on a young plant 9 inches high filament fixed to
midrib of nearly fullgrown leaf 2 38 inches in length movement
traced under a skylight apex of leaf 5 58 inches from the vertical
glass so diagram not greatly enlarged
the movement of a leaf was traced from 915 am on may 28th to 830
am on the 30th the temperature was too low 1516 c and the
illumination hardly sufficient consequently the leaves did not become
quite so highly inclined at night as they had done previously and as
they did subsequently in the hothouse but the movements did not
appear otherwise disturbed on the first day the leaf sank till 515
pm it then rose rapidly and greatly till 105 pm and only a
little higher during the rest of the night fig 126 early on the
next day 29th it fell in a slightly zigzag line rapidly until 9 am
by which time it had reached nearly the same place as on the previous
morning during the remainder of the day it fell slowly and zigzagged
laterally the evening rise began after 4 pm in the same manner as
before and on the second morning it again fell rapidly the ascending
and descending lines do not coincide as may be seen in the diagram on
the 30th a new tracing was made not here given on a rather enlarged
scale as the apex of the leaf now stood 9 inches from the vertical
glass in order to observe more carefully the course pursued at the
time when the diurnal fall changes into the nocturnal rise dots were
made every halfhour between 4 pm and 1030 pm this rendered the
lateral zigzagging movement during the evening more conspicuous than in
the diagram given but it was of the same nature as there shown the
impression forced on our minds was that the leaf was expending
superfluous movement so that the great nocturnal rise might not occur
at too early an hour
abutilon darwinii malvaceaethe leaves on some very young plants
stood almost horizontally during the day and hung down vertically at
night very fine plants kept in a
large hall lighted only from the roof did not sleep at night for in
order to do so the leaves must be well illuminated during the day the
cotyledons do not sleep linnus says that the leaves of his sida
abutilon sink perpendicularly down at night though the petioles rise
prof pfeffer informs us that the leaves of a malva allied to m
sylvestris rise greatly at night and this genus as well as that of
hibiscus are included by linnus in his list of sleeping plants
anoda wrightii malvaceaethe leaves produced by very young plants
when grown to a moderate size sink at night either almost vertically
down or to an angle of about 45 beneath the horizon for there is a
considerable degree of variability in the amount of sinking at night
which depends in part on the degree to which they have been illuminated
during the day but the leaves whilst quite young do not sink down at
night and this is a very unusual circumstance the summit of the
petiole where it joins the blade is developed into a pulvinus and
this is present in very young leaves which do not sleep though it is
not so well defined as in older leaves
gossypium var nankin cotton malvaceaesome young leaves between 1
and 2 inches in length borne by two seedlings 6 and 7 inches in
height stood horizontally or were raised a little above the horizon
at noon on july 8th and 9th but by 10 pm they had sunk down to
between 68 and 90 beneath the horizon when the same plants had grown
to double the above height their leaves stood at night almost or quite
vertically dependent the leaves on some large plants of g maritimum
and brazilense which were kept in a very badly lighted hothouse only
occasionally sank much downwards at night and hardly enough to be
called sleep
oxalis oxalidin most of the species in this large genus the three
leaflets sink vertically down at night but as their subpetioles are
short the blades could not assume this position from the want of space
unless they were in some manner rendered narrower and this is effected
by their becoming more or less folded fig 127 the angle formed by
the two halves of the same leaflet was found to vary in different
individuals of several species between 92 and 150 in three of the
best folded leaflets of o fragrans it was 76 74 and 54 the angle
is often different in the three leaflets of the same leaf as the
leaflets sink down at night and become folded their lower surfaces are
brought near together see b or even into
close contact and from this circumstance it might be thought that the
object of the folding was the protection of their lower surfaces if
this had been the case it would have formed a strongly marked
exception to the rule that when there is any difference in the degree
of protection from radiation of the two surfaces of the leaves it is
always the upper surface which is the best protected but that the
folding of the leaflets and consequent mutual approximation of their
lower surfaces serves merely to allow them to sink down vertically
may be inferred from the fact that when the leaflets do not radiate
from the summit of a common petiole or again when there is plenty of
room from the subpetioles not being very short the leaflets sink down
without becoming folded this occurs with the leaflets of o sensitiva
plumierii and bupleurifolia

there is no use in giving a long list of the many species which sleep
in the above described manner this holds good with species having
rather fleshy leaves like those of o carnosa or large leaves like
those of o ortegesii or four leaflets like those of o variabilis
there are however some species which show no signs of sleep viz o
pentaphylla enneaphylla hirta and rubella we will now describe the
nature of the movements in some of the species
oxalis acetosellathe movement of a leaflet together with that of the
main petiole are shown in the following diagram fig 128 traced
between 11 am on october 4th and 745 am on the 5th after 530
pm on the 4th the leaflet sank rapidly and at 7 pm depended
vertically for some time before it assumed this latter position its
movements could of course no longer be traced on the vertical glass
and the broken line in the diagram ought to be extended much further
down in this and all other cases by 645 am on the following morning
it had risen considerably and continued to rise for the next hour
but judging from other observations it would soon have begun to fall
again between 11 am and 530 pm the leaflet moved at least four
times up and four times down before the great nocturnal fall commenced
it reached its highest point at noon similar observations were made on
two other leaflets with nearly the same results sachs and pfeffer
have also described briefly4 the autonomous movements of the leaves
of this plant

fig 128 oxalis acetosella circumnutation and nyctitropic movements of
a nearly fullgrown leaf with filament attached to the midrib of one
of the leaflets traced on vertical glass during 20 h 45m
on another occasion the petiole of a leaf was secured to a little stick
close beneath the leaflets and a filament tipped with a bead of
sealingwax was affixed to the midrib of one of them and a mark was
placed close behind at 7 pm when the leaflets were asleep the
filament depended vertically down and the movements of the bead were
then traced till 1040 pm as shown in the following diagram fig
129 we here see that the leaflet moved a little from side to side as
well as a little up and down whilst asleep
oxalis valdivianathe leaves resemble those of the last species and
the movements of two leaflets the main petioles of both having been
secured were traced during two days but the tracings are not given
as they resembled that of o acetosella with the exception that the up
and down oscillations were not so frequent during the day and there
was more lateral movement so that broader ellipses were described the
leaves awoke early in the morning for by 645 am on june 12th and
13th they had not only risen to their full height but had already
begun to fall that is they were circumnutating we have seen in the
last chapter that the cotyledons instead of sinking rise up
vertically at night
fig 129 oxalis acetosella circumnutation of leaflet when asleep
traced on vertical glass during 3 h 40 m
oxalis ortegesiithe large leaves of this plant sleep like those of
the previous species the main petioles are long and that of a young
leaf rose 20 between noon and 10 pm whilst the petiole of an older
leaf rose only 13 owing to this rising of the petioles and the
vertical sinking of the large leaflets the leaves become crowded
together at night and the whole plant then exposes a much smaller
surface to radiation than during the day
oxalis plumieriiin this species the three leaflets do not surround
the summit of the petiole but the terminal leaflet projects in the
line of the petiole with a lateral leaflet on each side they all
sleep by bending vertically downwards but do not become at all folded
the petiole is rather long and one having been secured to a stick
the movement of the terminal leaflet was traced during 45 h on a
vertical glass it moved in a very simple manner sinking rapidly after
5 pm and rising rapidly early next morning during the middle of the
day it moved slowly and a little laterally consequently the ascending
and descending lines did not coincide and a single great ellipse was
formed each day there was no other evidence of circumnutation and
this fact is of interest as we shall hereafter see
oxalis sensitivathe leaflets as in the last species bend vertically
down at night without becoming folded the much elongated main petiole
rises considerably in the evening but in
some very young plants the rise did not commence until late at night
we have seen that the cotyledons instead of sinking like the leaflets
rise up vertically at night
oxalis bupleurifoliathis species is rendered remarkable by the
petioles being foliaceous like the phyllodes of many acacias the
leaflets are small of a paler green and more tender consistence than
the foliaceous petioles the leaflet which was observed was 55 inch in
length and was borne by a petiole 2 inches long and 3 inch broad it
may be suspected that the leaflets are on the road to abortion or
obliteration as has actually occurred with those of another brazilian
species o rusciformis nevertheless in the present species the
nyctitropic movements are perfectly performed the foliaceous petiole
was first observed during 48 h and found to be in continued
circumnutation as shown in the accompanying figure fig 130 it rose
during the day and early part of the night and fell during the
remainder of the night and early morning but the movement was not
sufficient to be called sleep the ascending and descending lines did
not coincide so that an ellipse was formed each day there was but
little zigzagging if the filament had been fixed longitudinally we
should probably have seen that there was more lateral movement than
appears in the diagram

a terminal leaflet on another leaf was next observed the petiole being
secured and its movements are shown in fig 131 during the day the
leaflets are extended horizontally and at night depend vertically and
as the petiole rises during the day the leaflets have to bend down in
the evening
more than 90 so as to assume at night their vertical position on the
first day the leaflet simply moved up and down on the
second day it plainly circumnutated between 8 am and 430 pm after
which hour the great evening fall commenced

averrhoa bilimbi oxalidit has long been known5 firstly that
the leaflets in this genus sleep secondly that they move
spontaneously during the day and thirdly that they are sensitive to a
touch but in none of these respects do they differ essentially from
the species of oxalis they differ however as mr r i lynch6 has
lately shown in their spontaneous movements being strongly marked in
the case of a bilimbi it is a wonderful spectacle to behold on a warm
sunny day the leaflets one after the other sinking rapidly downwards
and again ascending slowly their movements rival those of desmodium
gyrans at night the leaflets hang vertically down and now they are
motionless but this may be due to the opposite ones being pressed
together fig 132 the main petiole is in constant movement during
the day but no careful observations were made on it the following
diagrams are graphic representations of the variations in the angle
which a given leaflet makes with the vertical the observations were
made as follows the plant growing in a pot was kept in a high
temperature the petiole of the leaf to be observed pointing straight
at the observer being separated from him by a vertical pane of glass
the petiole was secured so that the basal joint or pulvinus of one of
the lateral leaflets was at the centre of a graduated arc placed close
behind the leaflet a fine glass filament was fixed to the leaf so as
to project like a continuation of the
midrib this filament acted as an index and as the leaf rose and fell
rotating about its basal joint its angular movement could be recorded
by reading off at short intervals of time the position of the glass
filament on the graduated arc in order
to avoid errors of parallax all readings were made by looking through
a small ring painted on the vertical glass in a line with the joint of
the leaflet and the centre of the graduated arc in the following
diagrams the ordinates represent the angles which the leaflet made with
the vertical at successive instants7 it follows that a fall in the
curve represents an actual dropping of the leaf and that the zero line
represents a vertically dependent position fig 133 represents the
nature of the movements which occur in the evening as soon as the
leaflets begin to assume their nocturnal position at 455 pm the
leaflet formed an angle of 85 with the vertical or was only 5 below
the horizontal but in order that the diagram might get into our page
the leaflet is represented falling from 75 instead of 85 shortly
after 6 pm it hung vertically down and had attained its nocturnal
position between 610 and 635 pm it performed a number of minute
oscillations of about 2 each occupying periods of 4 or 5 m the
complete state of rest of the leaflet which ultimately followed is not
shown in the diagram it is manifest that each oscillation consists of
a gradual rise followed by a sudden fall each time the leaflet fell
it approached nearer to the nocturnal position than it did on the
previous fall the amplitude of the oscillations diminished while the
periods of oscillation became shorter

in bright sunshine the leaflets assume a highly inclined dependent
position a leaflet in diffused light was observed rising for 25 m a
blind was then pulled up so that the plant was brightly illuminated br
in fig 134 and within a minute it began to fall and ultimately fell
47 as shown in the diagram this descent was performed by six
descending steps precisely similar to those by which the nocturnal
fall is effected the plant was then again shaded sh and a long slow
rise occurred until another series of falls commenced at br when the
sun was again admitted in this experiment cool air was allowed to
enter by the windows being opened at the same time that the blinds were
pulled up so that in spite of the sun shining on the plant the
temperature was not raised
the effect of an increase of temperature in diffused light is
shown in fig 135 the temperature began to rise at 1135 am in
consequence of the fire being lighted but by 1242 a marked fall had
occurred it may be seen in the diagram that when the temperature was
highest there were rapid oscillations of small amplitude the mean
position of the leaflet being at the time nearer the vertical when the
temperature began to fall the oscillations became slower and larger
and the mean position of the leaf again approached the horizontal the
rate of oscillation was sometimes quicker than is represented in the
above diagram thus when the temperature was between 31 and
32 c 14 oscillations of a few degrees occurred in 19 m on the other
hand an oscillation may be much slower thus a leaflet was observed
temperature 25 c to rise during 40 m before it fell and completed
its oscillation

temp 1920 c
porlieria hygrometrica zygophyllethe leaves of this plant chilian
form are from 1 to 1 inch in length and bear as many as 16 or 17
small leaflets on each side which do not stand opposite one another
they are articulated to the petiole and the petiole to the branch by a
pulvinus we must premise that apparently two forms are confounded
under the same name the leaves on a bush from chili which was sent to
us from kew bore many leaflets whilst those on plants in the botanic
garden at wrzburg bore only 8 or 9 pairs and the whole character of
the bushes appeared somewhat different we shall also see that they
differ in a remarkable physiological peculiarity on the chilian plant
the petioles of the younger leaves on upright branches stood
horizontally during the day and at night sank down vertically so as to
depend parallel and close to the branch beneath the petioles of rather
older leaves did not become at night vertically depressed but only
highly inclined in one instance we found a branch which had grown
perpendicularly downwards and the petioles on it moved in the same
direction relatively to the branch as just stated and therefore moved
upwards on horizontal branches the younger petioles likewise move at
night in the same direction as before that is towards the branch and
are consequently then extended horizontally but it is remarkable that
the older petioles on the
same branch though moving a little in the same direction also bend
downwards they thus occupy a somewhat different position relatively
to the centre of the earth and to the branch from that of the petioles
on the upright branches with respect to the leaflets they move at
night towards the apex of the petiole until their midribs stand nearly
parallel to it and they then lie neatly imbricated one over the other
thus half of the upper surface of each leaflet is in close contact with
half of the lower surface of the one next in advance and all the
leaflets excepting the basal ones have the whole of their upper
surfaces and half of their lower surfaces well protected those on the
opposite sides of the same petiole do not come into close contact at
night as occurs with the leaflets of so many leguminosae but are
separated by an open furrow nor could they exactly coincide as they
stand alternately with respect to one another
the circumnutation of the petiole of a leaf 34 of an inch in length
on an upright branch was observed during 36h and is shown in the
preceding diagram fig 136 on the first morning the leaf fell a
little and then rose until 1 pm and this was probably due to its
being now illuminated through a skylight from above it then
circumnutated on a very small scale round the same spot until about 4
pm when the great evening fall commenced during the latter part of
the night or very early on the next morning the leaf rose again on the
second day it fell during the morning till 1 pm and this no doubt is
its normal habit from 1 to 4 pm it rose in a zigzag line and soon
afterwards the great evening fall commenced it thus completed a double
oscillation during the 24 h
the specific name given to this plant by ruiz and pavon indicates that
in its native arid home it is affected in some manner by the dryness or
dampness of the atmosphere8 in the botanic garden at wrzburg there
was a plant in a pot out of doors which was daily watered and another
in the open ground which was never watered after some hot and dry
weather there was a great difference in the state of the leaflets on
these two plants those on the unwatered plant in the open ground
remaining half
or even quite closed during the day but twigs cut from this bush
with their ends standing in water or wholly immersed in it or kept in
damp air under a bellglass opened their leaves though exposed to a
blazing sun whilst those on the plant in the ground remained closed
the leaves on this same plant after some heavy rain remained open for
two days they then became half closed during two days and after an
additional day were quite closed this plant was now copiously watered
and on the following morning the leaflets were fully expanded the
other plant growing in a pot after having been exposed to heavy rain
was placed before a window in the laboratory with its leaflets open
and they remained so during the daytime for 48 h but after an
additional day were half closed the plant was then watered and the
leaflets on the two following days remained open on the third day they
were again half closed but on being again watered remained open during
the two next days from these several facts we may conclude that the
plant soon feels the want of water and that as soon as this occurs it
partially or quite closes its leaflets which in their then imbricated
condition expose a small surface to evaporation it is therefore
probable that this sleeplike movement which occurs only when the
ground is dry is an adaptation against the loss of moisture

 1798 we cannot understand the account given by the authors of the
 behaviour of this plant in its native home there is much about its
 power of foretelling changes in the weather and it appears as if the
 brightness of the sky largely determined the opening and closing of
 the leaflets
a bush about 4 feet in height a native of chili which was thickly
covered with leaves behaved very differently for during the day it
never closed its leaflets on july 6th the earth in the small pot in
which it grew appeared extremely dry and it was given a very little
water after 21 and 22 days on the 27th and 28th during the whole of
which time the plant did not receive a drop of water the leaves began
to droop but they showed no signs of closing during the day it
appeared almost incredible that any plant except a fleshy one could
have kept alive in soil so dry which resembled the dust on a road on
the 29th when the bush was shaken some leaves fell off and the
remaining ones were unable to sleep at night it was therefore
moderately watered as well as syringed late in the evening on the
next morning 30th the bush looked as fresh as ever and at night the
leaves went to sleep it may be added that a small branch while growing
on the bush was enclosed by means of a curtain of bladder during 13
days in a large bottle half full of quicklime so that the air within
must have been intensely dry yet the leaves on this branch did not
suffer in the
least and did not close at all during the hottest days another trial
was made with the same bush on august 2nd and 6th the soil appearing
at this latter date extremely dry for it was exposed out of doors
during the whole day to the wind but the leaflets showed no signs of
closing the chilian form therefore differs widely from the one at
wrzburg in not closing its leaflets when suffering from the want of
water and it can live for a surprisingly long time without water
tropaeolum majus  cultivated var tropaeoleaeseveral plants in
pots stood in the greenhouse and the blades of the leaves which faced
the frontlights were during the day highly inclined and at night
vertical whilst the leaves on the back of the pots though of course
illuminated through the roof did not become vertical at night we
thought at first that this difference in their positions was in some
manner due to heliotropism for the leaves are highly heliotropic the
true explanation however is that unless they are well illuminated
during at least a part of the day they do not sleep at night and a
little difference in the degree of illumination determines whether or
not they shall become vertical at night we have observed no other so
wellmarked a case as this of the influence of previous illumination
on nyctitropic movements the leaves present also another peculiarity
in their habit of rising or awaking in the morning being more strongly
fixed or inherited than that of sinking or sleeping at night the
movements are caused by the bending of an upper part of the petiole
between  and 1 inch in length but the part close to the blade for
about 14 of an inch in length does not bend and always remains at
right angles to the blade the bending portion does not present any
external or internal difference in structure from the rest of the
petiole we will now give the experiments on which the above
conclusions are founded
a large pot with several plants was brought on the morning of sept 3rd
out of the greenhouse and placed before a northeast window in the
same position as before with respect to the light as far as that was
possible on the front of the plants 24 leaves were marked with
thread some of which had their blades horizontal but the greater
number were inclined at about 45 beneath the horizon at night all
these without exception became vertical early on the following
morning 4th they reassumed their former positions and at night again
became vertical on the 5th the shutters were opened at 615 am and
by 818 am after the leaves had been illuminated for 2 h 3 m and
had acquired their diurnal position they were placed in a dark
cupboard they were looked at twice during the day and thrice in the
evening the last time at 1030 pm and not one had become vertical
at 8 am on the following morning 6th they still retained the same
diurnal position and were now replaced before the northeast window
at night all the leaves which had faced the light had their petioles
curved and their blades vertical whereas none of the leaves on the
back of the plants although they had been moderately illuminated by
the diffused light of the room were vertical they were now at night
placed in the same dark cupboard at 9 am on the next morning 7th
all those which had been asleep had reassumed their diurnal position
the pot was then placed for 3 h in the sunshine so as to stimulate
the plants at noon they were placed before the same northeast window
and at night the leaves slept in the usual manner and awoke on the
following morning at noon on this day 8th the plants after having
been left before the northeast window for 5 h 45 m and thus
illuminated though not brightly as the sky was cloudy during the
whole time were replaced in the dark cupboard and at 3 pm the
position of the leaves was very little if at all altered so that
they are not quickly affected by darkness but by 1015 pm all the
leaves which had faced the northeast sky during the 5 h 45 m of
illumination stood vertical whereas those on the back of the plant
retained their diurnal position on the following morning 9th the
leaves awoke as on the two former occasions in the dark and they were
kept in the dark during the whole day at night a very few of them
became vertical and this was the one instance in which we observed any
inherited tendency or habit in this plant to sleep at the proper time
that it was real sleep was shown by these same leaves reassuming their
diurnal position on the following morning 10th whilst still kept in
the dark
the pot was then 945 am 10th replaced after having been kept for
36 h in darkness before the northeast window and at night the
blades of all the leaves excepting a few on the back of the plants
became conspicuously vertical
at 645 am 11th after the plants had been illuminated on the same
side as before during only 25 m the pot was turned round so that the
leaves which had faced the light now faced the interior of the room
and not one of these went to sleep at night
whilst some but not many of those which had formerly stood facing the
back of the room and which had never before been well illuminated or
gone to sleep now assumed a vertical position at night on the next
day 12th the plant was turned round into its original position so
that the same leaves faced the light as formerly and these now went to
sleep in the usual manner we will only add that with some young
seedlings kept in the greenhouse the blades of the first pair of true
leaves the cotyledons being hypogean stood during the day almost
horizontally and at night almost vertically
a few observations were subsequently made on the circumnutation of
three leaves whilst facing a northeast window but the tracings are
not given as the leaves moved somewhat towards the light it was
however manifest that they rose and fell more than once during the
daytime the ascending and descending lines being in parts extremely
zigzag the nocturnal fall commenced about 7 pm and the leaves had
risen considerably by 645 am on the following morning
leguminosaethis family includes many more genera with sleeping
species than all the other families put together the number of the
tribes to which each genus belongs according to bentham and hookers
arrangement has been added
crotolaria sp tribe 2this plant is monophyllous and we are
informed by mr t thiselton dyer that the leaves rise up vertically at
night and press against the stem
lupinus tribe 2the palmate or digitate leaves of the species in
this large genus sleep in three different manners one of the simplest
is that all the leaflets become steeply inclined downwards at night
having been during the day extended horizontally this is shown in the
accompanying figures fig 137 of a leaf of l pilosus as seen
during the day from vertically above and of another leaf asleep with
the leaflets inclined downwards as in this position they are crowded
together and as they do not become folded like those in the genus
oxalis they cannot occupy a vertically dependent position but they
are often inclined at an angle of 50 beneath the horizon in this
species whilst the leaflets are sinking the petioles rise up in two
instances when the angles were measured to the extent of 23 the
leaflets of l subcarnosus and arboreus which were horizontal during
the day sank down at night in nearly the same manner the former to an
angle of 38 and the latter of 36 beneath the horizon but their
petioles
did not move in any plainly perceptible degree it is however quite
possible as we shall presently see that if a large number of plants
of the three foregoing and of the following species were to be observed
at all seasons some of the leaves would be found to sleep in a
different manner
fig 137 lupinus pilosus a leaf seen from vertically above in
daytime b leaf asleep seen laterally at night
in the two following species the leaflets instead of moving downwards
rise at night with l hartwegii some stood at noon at a mean angle of
36 above the horizon and at night at 51 thus forming together a
hollow cone with moderately steep sides the petiole of one leaf rose
14 and of a second 11 at night with l luteus a leaflet rose from
47 at noon to 65 above the horizon at night and another on a
distinct leaf rose from 45 to 69 the petioles however sink at
night to a small extent viz in three instances by 2 6 and 9 30
seconds owing to this movement of the petioles the outer and longer
leaflets have to bend up a little more than the shorter and inner ones
in order that all should stand symmetrically at night we shall
presently see that some leaves on the same individual plants of l
luteus sleep in a very different manner
we now come to a remarkable position of the leaves when asleep which
is common to several species of lupines on the same leaf the shorter
leaflets which generally face the centre of the plant sink at night
whilst the longer ones on the opposite side rise the intermediate and
lateral ones merely twisting on their own axes but there is some
variability with respect to which leaflets rise or fall as might have
been expected from such diverse and complicated movements the
base of each leaflet is developed at least in the case of l luteus
into a pulvinus the result is that all the leaflets on the same leaf
stand at night more or less highly inclined or even quite vertically
forming in this latter case a vertical star this occurs with the
leaves of a species purchased under the name of l pubescens and in
the accompanying figures we see at a fig 138 the leaves in their
diurnal position and at b the same plant at night with the two upper
leaves having their leaflets almost vertical at c another leaf viewed
laterally is shown with the leaflets quite vertical it is chiefly or
exclusively the youngest leaves which form at night vertical stars but
there
is much variability in the position of the leaves at night on the same
plant some remaining with their leaflets almost horizontal others
forming more or less highly inclined or vertical stars and some with
all their leaflets sloping downwards as in our first class of cases
it is also a remarkable fact that although all the plants produced
from the same lot of seeds were identical in appearance yet some
individuals at night had the leaflets of all their leaves arranged so
as to form more or less highly inclined stars others had them all
sloping downwards and never forming a star and others again retained
them either in a horizontal position or raised them a little
fig 138 lupinus pubescens a leaf viewed laterally during the day
b same leaf at night c another leaf with the leaflet forming a
vertical star at night figures reduced
we have as yet referred only to the different positions of the leaflets
of l pubescens at night but the petioles likewise differ in their
movements that of a young leaf which formed a highly inclined star at
night stood at noon at 42 above the horizon and during the night at
72 so had risen 30 the petiole of another leaf the leaflets of
which occupied a similar position at night rose only 6 on the other
hand the petiole of a leaf with all its leaflets sloping down at
night fell at this time 4 the petioles of two rather older leaves
were subsequently observed both of which stood during the day at
exactly the same angle viz 50 above the horizon and one of these
rose 78 and the other fell 34 at night we meet with cases like
that of l pubescens with some other species on a single plant of l
mutabilis some leaves which stood horizontally during the day formed
highly inclined stars at night and the petiole of one rose 7 other
leaves which likewise stood horizontally during the day had at night
all their leaflets sloping downwards at 46 beneath the horizon but
their petioles had hardly moved again l luteus offered a still more
remarkable case for on two leaves the leaflets which stood at noon at
about 45 above the horizon rose at night to 65 and 69 so that they
formed a hollow cone with steep sides four leaves on the same plant
which had their leaflets horizontal at noon formed vertical stars at
night and three other leaves equally horizontal at noon had all their
leaflets sloping downwards at night so that the leaves on this one
plant assumed at night three different positions though we cannot
account for this fact we can see that such a stock might readily give
birth to species having widely different nyctitropic habits
little more need be said about the sleep of the species of lupinus
several namely l polyphyllus nanus menziesii speciosus
and albifrons though observed out of doors and in the greenhouse did
not change the position of their leaves sufficiently at night to be
said to sleep from observations made on two sleeping species it
appears that as with tropaeolum majus the leaves must be well
illuminated during the day in order to sleep at night for several
plants kept all day in a sittingroom with northeast windows did not
sleep at night but when the pots were placed on the following day out
of doors and were brought in at night they slept in the usual manner
the trial was repeated on the following day and night with the same
result
some observations were made on the circumnutation of the leaves of l
luteus and arboreus it will suffice to say that the leaflets of the
latter exhibited a double oscillation in the course of 24 h for they
fell from the early morning until 1015 am then rose and zigzagged
greatly till 4 pm after which hour the great nocturnal fall
commenced by 8 am on the following morning the leaflets had risen to
their proper height we have seen in the fourth chapter that the
leaves of lupinus speciosus which do not sleep circumnutate to an
extraordinary extent making many ellipses in the course of the day
cytisus tribe 2 trigonella and medicago tribe 3only a few
observations were made on these three genera the petioles on a young
plant about a foot in height of cytisus fragrans rose at night on
one occasion 23 and on another 33 the three leaflets also bend
upwards and at the same time
approach each other so that the base of the central leaflet overlaps
the bases of the two lateral leaflets they bend up so much that they
press against the stem and on looking down on one of these young
plants from vertically above the lower surfaces of the leaflets are
visible and thus their upper surfaces in accordance with the general
rule are best protected from radiation whilst the leaves on these
young plants were thus behaving those on an old bush in full flower
did not sleep at night
fig 139 medicago marina a leaves during the day b leaves asleep
at night
trigonella cretica resembles a melilotus in its sleep which will be
immediately described according to m royer9 the leaves of medicago

 9 annales des sc nat bot 5th series ix 1868 p 368
melilotus tribe 3the species in this genus sleep in a remarkable
manner the three leaflets of each leaf twist through an angle of 90
so that their blades stand vertically at night with one lateral edge
presented to the zenith fig 140 we shall best understand the other
and more complicated movements if we imagine ourselves always to hold
the leaf with the tip of the terminal leaflet pointed to the north the
leaflets in becoming vertical at night could of course twist so that
their upper surfaces should face to either side but the two lateral
leaflets always twist so that this surface tends to face the north but
as they move at the same time towards the terminal leaflet the upper
surface of the one faces about nnw and that of the other nne the
terminal leaflet behaves differently for it twists to either side the
upper surface facing sometimes east and sometimes west but rather more
commonly west than east the terminal leaflet also moves in another and
more remarkable manner for whilst its blade is twisting and becoming
vertical the whole leaflet bends to one side and invariably to the
side towards which the upper surface is directed so that if this
surface faces the west the whole leaflet bends to the west until it
comes into contact with the upper and vertical surface of the western
lateral leaflet thus the upper surface of the terminal and of one of
the two lateral leaflets is well protected
the fact of the terminal leaflet twisting indifferently to either
side and afterwards bending to the same side seemed to us so
remarkable that we endeavoured to discover the cause we imagined that
at the commencement of the movement it might be determined by one of
the two halves of the leaflet being a little heavier than the other
therefore bits of wood were gummed on one side of several leaflets but
this produced no effect and they continued to twist in the same
direction as they had previously done in order to discover whether the
same leaflet twisted permanently in the same direction black threads
were tied to 20 leaves the terminal leaflets of which twisted so that
their upper surfaces faced west and 14 white threads to leaflets which
twisted to the east these were observed occasionally during 14 days
and they all continued with a single exception to twist and bend in
the same direction for
one leaflet which had originally faced east was observed after 9 days
to face west the seat of both the twisting and bending movement is in
the pulvinus of the subpetioles
fig 140 melilotus officinalis a leaf during the daytime b another
leaf asleep c a leaf asleep as viewed from vertically above but in
this case the terminal leaflet did not happen to be in such close
contact with the lateral one as is usual
we believe that the leaflets especially the two lateral ones in
performing the above described complicated movements generally bend a
little downwards but we are not sure of this for as far as the main
petiole is concerned its nocturnal movement is largely determined by
the position which the leaf happens to occupy during the day thus one
main petiole was observed to rise at night 59 whilst three others
rose only 7 and 9 the petioles and subpetioles are continually
circumnutating during the whole 24 h as we shall presently see
the leaves of the following 15 species m officinalis suaveolens
parviflora alba infesta dentata gracilis sulcata elegans
coerulea petitpierreana macrorrhiza italica secundiflora and
taurica sleep in nearly the same manner as just described but the
bending to one side of the terminal leaflet is apt to fail unless the
plants are growing vigorously with m petitpierreana and secundiflora
the terminal leaflet was rarely seen to bend to one side in young
plants of m italica it bent in the usual manner but with old plants
in full flower growing in the same pot and observed at the same hour
viz 830 pm none of the terminal leaflets on several scores of
leaves had bent to one side though they stood vertically nor had the
two lateral leaflets though standing vertically moved towards the
terminal one at 1030 pm and again one hour after midnight the
terminal leaflets had become very slightly bent to one side and the
lateral leaflets had moved a very little towards the terminal one so
that the position of the leaflets even at this late hour was far from
the ordinary one again with m taurica the terminal leaflets were
never seen to bend towards either of the two lateral leaflets though
these whilst becoming vertical had bent towards the terminal one the
subpetiole of the terminal leaflet in this species is of unusual
length and if the leaflet had bent to one side its upper surface
could have come into contact only with the apex of either lateral
leaflet and this perhaps is the meaning of the loss of the lateral
movement
the cotyledons do not sleep at night the first leaf consists of a
single orbicular leaflet which twists at night so that the blade
stands vertically it is a remarkable fact that with m taurica and in
a somewhat less degree with m macrorrhiza and petitpierreana all the
many small and young leaves produced during
the early spring from shoots on some cutdown plants in the greenhouse
slept in a totally different manner from the normal one for the three
leaflets instead of twisting on their own axes so as to present their
lateral edges to the zenith turned upwards and stood vertically with
their apices pointing to the zenith they thus assumed nearly the same
position as in the allied genus trifolium and on the same principle
that embryological characters reveal the lines of descent in the animal
kingdom so the movements of the small leaves in the above three
species of melilotus perhaps indicate that this genus is descended
from a form which was closely allied to and slept like a trifolium
moreover there is one species m messanensis the leaves of which on
fullgrown plants between 2 and 3 feet in height sleep like the
foregoing small leaves and like those of a trifolium we were so much
surprised at this latter case that until the flowers and fruit were
examined we thought that the seeds of some trifolium had been sown by
mistake instead of those of a melilotus it appears therefore probable
that m messanensis has either retained or recovered a primordial
habit
the circumnutation of a leaf of m officinalis was traced the stem
being left free and the apex of the terminal leaflet described three
laterally extended ellipses between 8 am and 4 pm after the
latter hour the nocturnal twisting movement commenced it was
afterwards ascertained that the above movement was compounded of the
circumnutation of the stem on a small scale of the main petiole which
moved most and of the subpetiole of the terminal leaflet the main
petiole of a leaf having been secured to a stick close to the base of
the subpetiole of the terminal leaflet the latter described two small
ellipses between 1030 am and 2 pm at 715 pm after this same
leaflet as well as another had twisted themselves into their vertical
nocturnal position they began to rise slowly and continued to do so
until 1035 pm after which hour they were no longer observed
as m messanensis sleeps in an anomalous manner unlike that of any
other species in the genus the circumnutation of a terminal leaflet
with the stem secured was traced during two days on each morning the
leaflet fell until about noon and then began to rise very slowly but
on the first day the rising movement was interrupted between 1 and 3
pm by the formation of a laterally extended ellipse and on the
second day at the same time by two smaller ellipses the rising
movement then
recommenced and became rapid late in the evening when the leaflet was
beginning to go to sleep the awaking or sinking movement had already
commenced by 645 am on both mornings
trifolium tribe 3the nyctitropic movements of 11 species were
observed and were found to be closely similar if we select a leaf of
t repens having an upright petiole and with the three leaflets
expanded horizontally the two lateral leaflets will be seen in the
evening to twist and approach each other until their upper surfaces
come into contact at the same time they bend downwards in a plane at
right angles to that of their former position until their midribs form
an angle of about 45 with the upper part of the petiole this peculiar
change of position requires a considerable amount of torsion in the
pulvinus the terminal leaflet merely rises up without any twisting and
bends over until it rests on and forms a roof over the edges of the now
vertical and united lateral leaflets thus the terminal leaflet always
passes through an angle of at least 90 generally of 130 or 140 and
not rarelyas was often observed with t subterraneumof 180 in this
latter case the terminal leaflet stands at night horizontally as in
fig 141 with its lower surface fully exposed to the zenith besides
the difference in the angles at which the terminal leaflets stand at
night in the individuals of the same species the degree to which the
lateral leaflets approach each other often likewise differs
fig 141 trifolium repens a leaf during the day b leaf asleep at
night
we have seen that the cotyledons of some species and not of others rise
up vertically at night the first true leaf is generally unifoliate and
orbicular it always rises and either stands vertically at night or
more commonly bends a little over so as to expose the lower surface
obliquely to the zenith in the same manner as does the terminal
leaflet of the mature leaf but it does not twist itself like the
corresponding first simple leaf of melilotus
with t pannonicum the first true leaf was generally unifoliate but
sometimes trifoliate or again partially lobed and in an intermediate
condition
circumnutationsachs described in 186310 the spontaneous up and down
movements of the leaflets of t incarnatum when kept in darkness
pfeffer made many observations on the similar movements in t
pratense11 he states that the terminal leaflet of this species
observed at different times passed through angles of from 30 to 120
in the course of from 1 to 4 h we observed the movements of t

trifolium subterraneuma petiole was secured close to the base of the
three leaflets and the movement of the terminal leaflet was traced
during 26 h as shown in the figure on the next page
between 645 am and 6 pm the apex moved 3 times up and 3 times
down completing 3 ellipses in 11 h 15 m the ascending and descending
lines stand nearer to one another than is usual with most plants yet
there was some lateral motion at 6 pm the great nocturnal rise
commenced and on the next morning the sinking of the leaflet was
continued until 830 am after which hour it circumnutated in the
manner just described in the figure the great nocturnal rise and the
morning fall are greatly abbreviated from the want of space and are
merely represented by a short curved line the leaflet stood
horizontally when at a point a little beneath the middle of the
diagram so that during the daytime it oscillated almost equally above
and beneath a horizontal position at 830 am it stood 48 beneath
the horizon and by 1130 am it had risen 50 above the horizon so
that it passed through 98 in 3 h by the aid of the tracing we
ascertained that the distance travelled in the 3 h by the apex of this
leaflet was 103 inch if we look at the figure and prolong upwards in
our minds eye the short curved broken line which represents the
nocturnal course we see that the latter movement is merely an
exaggeration or prolongation of one of the diurnal ellipses the same
leaflet had been observed on the previous day and the course then
pursued was almost identically the same as that here described

trifolium resupinatuma plant left entirely free was placed before a
northeast window in such a position that a terminal leaflet projected
at right angles to the source of the light the sky being uniformly
clouded all day the movements of this leaflet were traced during two
days and on both were closely similar those executed on the second
day are shown in fig 143 the obliquity of the several lines is due
partly to the manner in which the leaflet was viewed and partly to its
having moved a little towards the light from 750 am to 840 am
the leaflet fell that is the awakening movement was continued it
then rose and moved a little laterally towards the light at 1230 it
retrograded and at 230 resumed its original course having thus
completed a small ellipse during the middle of the day in the evening
it rose rapidly and by 8 am on the following morning had returned to
exactly the same spot as on the previous morning the line representing
the nocturnal course ought to be extended much higher up and is here
abbreviated into a short
curved broken line the terminal leaflet therefore of this species
described during the daytime only a single additional ellipse instead
of two additional ones as in the case of t subterraneum but we
should remember that it was shown in the fourth chapter that the stem
circumnutates as no doubt does the main petiole and the subpetioles
so that the movement represented in fig 143 is a compounded one we
tried to observe the movements of a leaf kept during the day in
darkness but it began to go to sleep after 2 h 15 m and this was
well pronounced after 4 h 30 m
fig 143 trifolium resupinatum circumnutation and nyctitropic
movements of the terminal leaflet during 24 hours
trifolium repensa stem was secured close to the base of a moderately
old leaf and the movement of the terminal leaflet was observed during
two days this case is interesting solely from the simplicity of the
movements in contrast with those of the two preceding species on the
first day the leaflet fell between 8 am and 3 pm and on the second
between 7 am and 1 pm on both days the descending course was
somewhat zigzag and this evidently represents the circumnutating
movement of the two previous species during the middle of the day
after 1 pm oct 1st fig 144 the leaflet began to rise but the
movement was slow on both days both before and after this hour until
4 pm the rapid evening and nocturnal rise then commenced thus in
this species the course during 24 h consists of a single great
ellipse in t resupinatum of two ellipses one of which includes the
nocturnal movement and is much elongated and in t subterraneum of
three ellipses of which the nocturnal one is likewise of great length

lotus tribe 4the nyctitropic movements of 10 species in this genus
were observed and found to be the same the main petiole rises a
little at night and the three leaflets rise till they become vertical
and at the same time approach each other this was conspicuous with l
jacoboeus in which the leaflets are almost linear in most of the
species the leaflets rise so much as to press against the stem and not
rarely they become inclined a little inwards with their lower surfaces
exposed obliquely to the zenith this was clearly the case with l
major as its petioles are unusually long and the leaflets are thus
enabled to bend further inwards the young leaves on the summits of the
stems close up at night so much as often to resemble large buds the
stipulelike leaflets which are often of large size rise up like the
other leaflets and press against the stem fig 145 all the leaflets
of l gebelii and probably of the other species are provided at their
bases with distinct pulvini of a yellowish colour and formed of very
small cells the circumnutation of a terminal leaflet of l peregrinus
with the stem secured was traced during two days but the movement
was so simple that it is not worth while to give the diagram the
leaflet fell slowly from the early morning till about 1 pm it then
rose gradually at first but rapidly late in the evening it
occasionally stood still for about 20 m during the day and sometimes
zigzagged a little the movement of one of the basal stipulelike
leaflets was likewise traced in the same manner and at the same time
and its course was closely similar to that of the terminal leaflet

were traced during two days and were simple the leaflet fell slowly
in a slightly zigzag line from 8 am to 5 pm and then more
rapidly by 7 am on the following morning it had risen to its diurnal
position there was only one peculiarity in the movement namely that
on both days there was a distinct though small oscillation up and down
between 830 and 10 am and this would probably have been more
strongly pronounced if the leaf had been younger

coronilla rosea tribe 6the leaves bear 9 or 10 pairs of opposite
leaflets which during the day stand horizontally with their midribs
at right angles to the petiole at night they rise up so that the
opposite leaflets come nearly into contact and those on the younger
leaves into close contact at the same time they bend back towards the
base of the petiole until their midribs form with it angles of from
40 to 50 in a vertical plane as here figured fig 146 the
leaflets however sometimes bend so much back that their midribs
become parallel to and lie on the petiole they thus occupy a reversed
position to what they do in several leguminosae for instance in
mimosa
pudica but from standing further apart they do not overlap one
another nearly so much as in this latter plant the main petiole is
curved slightly downwards during the day but straightens itself at
night in three cases it rose from 3 above the horizon at noon to 9
at 10 pm from 11 to 33 and from 5 to 33the amount of angular
movement in this latter case amounting to 28 in several other species
of coronilla the leaflets showed only feeble movements of a similar
kind

arachis hypogoea tribe 6the shape of a leaf with its two pairs of
leaflets is shown at a fig 147 and a leaf asleep traced from a
photograph made by the aid of aluminium light is given at b the two
terminal leaflets twist round at night until their blades stand
vertically and approach each other until they meet at the same time
moving a little upwards and backwards the two lateral leaflets meet
each other in this same manner but move to a greater extent forwards
that is in a contrary direction to the two terminal leaflets which
they partially embrace thus all four leaflets form together a single
packet with their edges directed to the zenith and with their lower
surfaces turned outwards on a plant which was not growing vigorously
the closed leaflets seemed too heavy for the
petioles to support them in a vertical position so that each night the
main petiole became twisted and all the packets were extended
horizontally with the lower surfaces of the leaflets on one side
directed to the zenith in a most anomalous manner this fact is
mentioned solely as a caution as it surprised us greatly until we
discovered that it was an anomaly the petioles are inclined upwards
during the day but sink at night so as to stand at about right angles
with the stem the amount of sinking was measured only on one occasion
and found to be 39 a petiole was secured to a stick at the base of
the two terminal leaflets and the circumnutating movement of one of
these leaflets was traced from 640 am to 1040 pm the plant being
illuminated from above the temperature was 1717 c and therefore
rather too low during the 16 h the leaflet moved thrice up and thrice
down and as the ascending and descending lines did not coincide three
ellipses were formed

cotyledons do not sleep but the firstformed leaf sleeps equally well
as the older ones the appearance presented by a sleeping branch and
one in the daytime copied from two photographs are shown at a and b
fig 149 and we see how at night the leaves are crowded together as
if for mutual protection by the rising of the petioles the petioles
of the younger leaves near the summits of the shoots rise up at night
so as to stand vertical and parallel to the stem whilst those on the
sides were found in four cases to have risen respectively 46 36
20 and 195 above the inclined positions which they had occupied
during the day for instance in the first of these four cases the
petiole stood in the day at 23 and at night at 69 above the
horizon in the evening the rising of the petioles is almost completed
before the leaflets sink perpendicularly downwards
circumnutationthe circumnutating movements of four young shoots were
observed during 5 h 15 m and in this time each completed an oval
figure of small size the main petiole also circumnutates rapidly for
in the course of 31 m temp 91 f it changed its course by as much
as a rectangle six times describing a figure which apparently
represented two ellipses the movement of the terminal leaflet by means
of its subpetiole or pulvinus is quite as rapid or even more so than
that of the main petiole and has much greater amplitude pfeffer has
seen15 these leaflets move through an angle of 8 in the course of
from 10 to 30 seconds

in the diagram given on the next page fig 150 the two curved broken
lines at the base which represent the nocturnal courses ought to be
prolonged far downwards on the first day the leaflet moved thrice down
and thrice up and to a considerable distance laterally the course was
also remarkably crooked the dots were generally made every hour if
they had been made every few minutes all the lines would have been
zigzag to an extraordinary degree with here and there a loop formed
we may infer that this would have been the case because five dots were
made in the course of 31 m between 1234 and 15 pm and we see in
the upper part of the diagram how crooked the course here is if only
the first and last dots had been joined we should have had a straight
line exactly the same fact may be seen in the lines representing the
course between 224 pm and 3 pm when six intermediate dots were
made and again at 446 and 450 but the result was widely different
after 6 pmthat is after the great nocturnal descent had commenced
for though nine dots were then made in the course of 32 m when these
were joined see figure the line thus formed was almost straight the
leaflets therefore begin to descend in the afternoon by zigzag lines
but as soon as the descent becomes rapid their whole energy is expended
in thus moving and their course becomes rectilinear after the
leaflets are completely asleep they move very little or not at all

had the above plant been subjected to a higher temperature than 6770
f the movements of the terminal leaflet would probably have been even
more rapid and wider in extent than those shown in the diagram for a
plant was kept for some time in the hothouse at from 9293 f and
in the course of 35 m the apex of a leaflet twice descended and once
ascended travelling over a space of 12 inch in a vertical direction
and of 82 inch in a horizontal direction whilst thus moving the
leaflet also rotated on its own axis and this was a point to which no
attention had been before paid for the plane of the blade differed by
41 after an interval of only a few minutes occasionally the leaflet
stood still for a short time there was no jerking movement which is
so characteristic of the little lateral leaflets a sudden and
considerable fall of temperature causes the terminal leaflet to sink
downwards thus a cutoff leaf was immersed in water at 95 f which
was slowly raised to 103 f and afterwards allowed to sink to 70 f
and the subpetiole of the terminal leaflet then curved downwards the
water was afterwards
raised to 120 f and the subpetiole straightened itself similar
experiments with leaves in water were twice repeated with nearly the
same result it should be added that water raised to even 122 f does
not soon kill a leaf a plant was placed in darkness at 837 am and
at 2 pm ie after 5 h 23 m though the leaflets had sunk
considerably they had by no means acquired their nocturnal vertically
dependent position pfeffer on the other hand says16 that this
occurred with him in from 34 h to 2 h perhaps the difference in our
results may be due to the plant on which we experimented being a very
young and vigorous seedling

the movements of the little lateral leaflets these have been so often
described that we will endeavour to be as brief as possible in giving
a few new facts and conclusions the leaflets sometimes quickly change
their position by as much as nearly 180 and their subpetioles can
then be seen to become greatly curved they rotate on their own axes
so that their upper surfaces are directed to all points of the compass
the figure described by the apex is an irregular oval or ellipse they
sometimes remain stationary for a period in these several respects
there is no difference except in rapidity and extent between their
movements and the lesser ones performed by the large terminal leaflet
whilst making its great oscillations the movements of the little
leaflets are much influenced as is well known by temperature this
was clearly shown by immersing leaves with motionless leaflets in cold
water which was slowly raised to 103 f and the leaflets then moved
quickly describing about a dozen little irregular circles in 40 m by
this time the water had become much cooler and the movements became
slower or almost ceased it was then raised to 100 f and the
leaflets again began to move quickly on another occasion a tuft of
fine leaves was immersed in water at 53 f and the leaflets were of
course motionless the water was raised to 99 and the leaflets soon
began to move it was raised to 105 and the movements became much
more rapid each little circle or oval being completed in from 1 m 30
s to 1 m 45 s there was however no jerking and this fact may
perhaps be attributed to the resistance of the water
sachs states that the leaflets do not move until the surrounding air is
as high as 7172 f and this agrees with our
experience on fullgrown or nearly fullgrown plants but the
leaflets of young seedlings exhibit a jerking movement at much lower
temperatures a seedling was kept april 16th in a room for half the
day where the temperature was steady at 64 f and the one leaflet
which it bore was continually jerking but not so rapidly as in the
hothouse the pot was taken in the evening into a bedroom where the
temperature remained at 62 during nearly the whole night at 10 and 11
pm and at 1 am the leaflet was still jerking rapidly at 330 am
it was not seen to jerk but was observed during only a short time it
was however now inclined at a much lower angle than that occupied at
1 am at 630 am temp 61 f its inclination was still less than
before and again less at 645 am by 740 am it had risen and at
830 am was again seen to jerk this leaflet therefore was moving
during the whole night and the movement was by jerks up to 1 am and
possibly later and again at 830 am though the temperature was only
61 to 62 f we must therefore conclude that the lateral leaflets
produced by young plants differ somewhat in constitution from those on
older plants
in the large genus desmodium by far the greater number of the species
are trifoliate but some are unifoliate and even the same plant may
bear uni and trifoliate leaves in most of the species the lateral
leaflets are only a little smaller than the terminal one therefore the
lateral leaflets of d gyrans see fig 148 must be considered as
almost rudimentary they are also rudimentary in function if this
expression may be used for they certainly do not sleep like the
fullsized terminal leaflets it is however possible that the sinking
down of the leaflets between 1 am and 645 am as above described
may represent sleep it is well known that the leaflets go on jerking
during the early part of the night but my gardener observed oct
13th a plant in the hothouse between 5 and 530 am the temperature
having been kept up to 82 f and found that all the leaflets were
inclined but he saw no jerking movement until 655 am by which time
the terminal leaflet had risen and was awake two days afterwards oct
15th the same plant was observed by him at 447 am temp 77 f
and he found that the large terminal leaflets were awake though not
quite horizontal and the only cause which we could assign for this
anomalous wakefulness was that the plant had been kept for experimental
purposes during
the previous day at an unusually high temperature the little lateral
leaflets were also jerking at this hour but whether there was any
connection between this latter fact and the subhorizontal position of
the terminal leaflets we do not know anyhow it is certain that the
lateral leaflets do not sleep like the terminal leaflets and in so far
they may be said to be in a functionally rudimentary condition they
are in a similar condition in relation to irritability for if a plant
be shaken or syringed the terminal leaflets sink down to about 45
beneath the horizon but we could never detect any effect thus produced
on the lateral leaflets yet we are not prepared to assert positively
that rubbing or pricking the pulvinus produces no effect
as in the case of most rudimentary organs the leaflets are variable in
size they often depart from their normal position and do not stand
opposite one another and one of the two is frequently absent this
absence appeared in some but not in all the cases to be due to the
leaflet having become completely confluent with the main petiole as
might be inferred from the presence of a slight ridge along its upper
margin and from the course of the vessels in one instance there was a
vestige of the leaflet in the shape of a minute point at the further
end of the ridge the frequent sudden and complete disappearance of
one or both of the rudimentary leaflets is a rather singular fact but
it is a much more surprising one that the leaves which are first
developed on seedling plants are not provided with them thus on one
seedling the seventh leaf above the cotyledons was the first which bore
any lateral leaflets and then only a single one on another seedling
the eleventh leaf first bore a leaflet of the nine succeeding leaves
five bore a single lateral leaflet and four bore none at all at last
a leaf the twentyfirst above the cotyledons was provided with two
rudimentary lateral leaflets from a widespread analogy in the animal
kingdom it might have been expected that these rudimentary leaflets
would have been better developed and more regularly present on very
young than on older plants but bearing in mind firstly that
longlost characters sometimes reappear late in life and secondly
that the species of desmodium are generally trifoliate but that some
are unifoliate the suspicion arises that d gyrans is descended from a
unifoliate species and that this was descended from a trifoliate one
for in this case both the absence of the little lateral leaflets on
very young seedlings and their
subsequent appearance may be attributed to reversion to more or less
distant progenitors17
 17 desmodium vespertilionis is closely allied to d gyrans and it
 seems only occasionally to bear rudimentary lateral leaflets
 duchartre elments de botanique 1867 p 353
no one supposes that the rapid movements of the lateral leaflets of d
gyrans are of any use to the plant and why they should behave in this
manner is quite unknown we imagined that their power of movement might
stand in some relation with their rudimentary condition and therefore
observed the almost rudimentary leaflets of mimosa albida vel sensitiva
of which a drawing will hereafter be given fig 159 but they
exhibited no extraordinary movements and at night they went to sleep
like the fullsized leaflets there is however this remarkable
difference in the two cases in desmodium the pulvinus of the
rudimentary leaflets has not been reduced in length in correspondence
with the reduction of the blade to the same extent as has occurred in
the mimosa and it is on the length and degree of curvature of the
pulvinus that the amount of movement of the blade depends thus the
average length of the pulvinus in the large terminal leaflets of
desmodium is 3 mm whilst that of the rudimentary leaflets is 286
mm so that they differ only a little in length but in diameter they
differ much that of the pulvinus of the little leaflets being only 03
mm to 04 mm whilst that of the terminal leaflets is 133 mm if we
now turn to the mimosa we find that the average length of the pulvinus
of the almost rudimentary leaflets is only 0466 mm or rather more
than a quarter of the length of the pulvinus of the fullsized
leaflets namely 166 mm in this small reduction in length of the
pulvinus of the rudimentary leaflets of desmodium we apparently have
the proximate cause of their great and rapid circumnutating movement
in contrast with that of the almost rudimentary leaflets of the mimosa
the small size and weight of the blade and the little resistance
opposed by the air to its movement no doubt also come into play for
we have seen that these leaflets if immersed in water when the
resistance would be much greater were prevented from jerking forwards
why during the reduction of the lateral leaflets of desmodium or
during their reappearanceif they owe their origin to reversionthe
pulvinus should have been so much less affected than the blade whilst
with the
mimosa the pulvinus has been greatly reduced we do not know
nevertheless it deserves notice that the reduction of the leaflets in
these two genera has apparently been effected by a different process
and for a different end for with the mimosa the reduction of the inner
and basal leaflets was necessary from the want of space but no such
necessity exists with desmodium and the reduction of its lateral
leaflets seems to have been due to the principle of compensation in
consequence of the great size of the terminal leaflet uraria tribe 6
and centrosema tribe 8the leaflets of uraria lagopus and the leaves
of a centrosema from brazil both sink vertically down at night in the
latter plant the petiole at the same time rose 16
amphicarpoea monoica tribe 8the leaflets sink down vertically at
night and the petioles likewise fall considerably a petiole which
was carefully observed stood during the day 25 above the horizon and
at night 32 below it it therefore fell 57 a filament was fixed
transversely across the terminal leaflet of a fine young leaf 2 14
inches in length including the
petiole and the movement of the whole leaf was traced on a vertical
glass this was a bad plan in some respects because the rotation of
the leaflet independently of its rising or falling raised and
depressed the filament but it was the best plan for our special
purpose of observing whether the leaf moved much after it had gone to
sleep the plant had twined closely round a thin stick so that the
circumnutation of the stem was prevented the movement of the leaf was
traced during 48 h from 9 am july 10th to 9 am july 12th in the
figure given fig 151 we see how complicated its course was on both
days during the second day it changed its course greatly 13 times the
leaflets began to go to sleep a little after 6 pm and by 715 pm
hung vertically down and were completely asleep but on both nights
they continued to move from 715 pm to 1040 and 1050 pm quite as
much as during the day and this was the point which we wished to
ascertain we see in the figure that the great sinking movement late in
the evening does not differ essentially from the circumnutation during
the day

movements of the terminal leaflet of e cristagalli with the main
petiole secured to a stick were traced from 640 am june 8th to 8
am on the 10th in order to observe the nyctitropic movements of this
plant it is necessary that it should have grown in a warm greenhouse
for out of doors in our climate it does not sleep we see in the
tracing fig 152 that the leaflet oscillated twice up and down
between early morning and noon it then fell greatly afterwards rising
till 3 pm at this latter hour the great nocturnal fall commenced on
the second day of which the tracing is not given there was exactly
the same double oscillation before noon but only a very small one in
the afternoon on the third morning the leaflet moved laterally which
was due to its beginning to assume an oblique position as seems
invariably to occur with the leaflets of this species as they grow old
on both nights after the leaflets were asleep and hung vertically down
they continued to move a little both up and down and from side to
side
erythrina caffraa filament was fixed transversely across
a terminal leaflet as we wished to observe its movements when asleep
the plant was placed in the morning of june 10th under a skylight
where the light was not bright and we do not know whether it was owing
to this cause or to the plant having been disturbed but the leaflet
hung vertically down all day nevertheless it circumnutated in this
position describing a figure which represented two irregular ellipses
on the next day it circumnutated in a greater degree describing four
irregular ellipses and by 3 pm had risen into a horizontal position
by 715 pm it was asleep and vertically dependent but continued to
circumnutate as long as observed until 11 pm

and that of an older leaf 10 at night with plants growing out of
doors the leaflets apparently do not sleep until somewhat late in the
season for on the nights of july 11th and 12th none of them were
asleep whereas on the night of august 15th the same plants had most of
their leaflets vertically dependent and asleep with ph caracalla and
hernandesii the primary unifoliate leaves and the leaflets of the
secondary trifoliate leaves sink vertically down at night this holds
good with the secondary trifoliate leaves of ph roxburghii but it is
remarkable that the primary unifoliate leaves which are much elongated
rise at night from about 20 to about 60 above the horizon with older
seedlings however having the secondary leaves just developed the
primary leaves stand in the middle of the day horizontally or are
deflected a little beneath the horizon in one such case the primary
leaves rose from 26 beneath the horizon at noon to 20 above it at 10
pm whilst at this same hour the leaflets of the secondary leaves
were vertically dependent here then we have the extraordinary case
of the primary and secondary leaves on the same plant moving at the
same time in opposite directions
we have now seen that the leaflets in the six genera of phaseoleae
observed by us with the exception of the primary leaves of phaseolus
roxburghii all sleep in the same manner namely by sinking vertically
down the movements of the petioles were observed in only three of
these genera they rose in centrosema and phaseolus and sunk in

the same manner

cassia tribe 14the nyctitropic movements of the leaves in many
species in this genus are closely alike and are highly complex they
were first briefly described by linnus and since by duchartre our
observations were made chiefly on c floribunda18 and corymbosa but
several other species were casually observed the horizontally extended
leaflets sink down vertically at night but not simply as in so many
other genera for each leaflet rotates on its own axis so that its
lower surface faces outwards the upper surfaces of the opposite
leaflets are thus brought into contact with one another beneath the
petiole and are well protected fig 154 the rotation and other
movements are effected by means of a welldeveloped pulvinus at the
base of each leaflet as could be plainly seen when a straight narrow
black line had been painted along it during the day the two terminal
leaflets in the daytime include rather less than a right angle but
their divergence increases greatly whilst they
sink downwards and rotate so that they stand laterally at night as
may be seen in the figure moreover they move somewhat backwards so
as to point towards the base of the petiole in one instance we found
that the midrib of a terminal leaflet formed at night an angle of 36
with a line dropped
perpendicularly from the end of the petiole the second pair of
leaflets likewise moves a little backwards but less than the terminal
pair and the third pair moves vertically downwards or even a little
forwards thus all the leaflets in those species which bear only 3 or
4 pairs tend to form a single packet with their upper surfaces in
contact and their lower surfaces turned outwards lastly the main
petiole rises at night but with leaves of different ages to very
different degrees namely some rose through an angle of only 12 and
others as much as 41

petioles apparently do not rise and one which was carefully observed
certainly fell 3 cassia pubescensthe chief difference in the
nyctitropic movements of this species compared with those of the
former species consists in the leaflets not rotating nearly so much
therefore their lower surfaces face but little outwards at night the
petioles which during the day are inclined only a little above the
horizon rise at night in a remarkable manner and stand nearly or
quite vertically this together with the dependent position of the
leaflets makes the whole plant wonderfully compact at night in the
two foregoing figures copied from photographs the same plant is
represented awake and asleep fig 155 and we see how different is
its appearance
fig 155 cassia pubescens a upper part of plant during the day b
same plant at night figures reduced from photographs
cassia mimosoidesat night the numerous leaflets on each leaf rotate
on their axes and their tips move towards the apex of the leaf they
thus become imbricated with their lower surfaces directed upwards and
with their midribs almost parallel to the petiole consequently this
species differs from all the others seen by us with the exception of
the following one in the leaflets not sinking down at night a
petiole the movement of which was measured rose 8 at night
cassia barclayanathe leaflets of this australian species are
numerous very narrow and almost linear at night they rise up a
little and also move towards the apex of the leaf for instance two
opposite leaflets which diverged from one another during the day at an
angle of 104 diverted at night only 72 so that each had risen 16
above its diurnal position the petiole of a young leaf rose at night
34 and that of an older leaf 19 owing to the slight movement of the
leaflets and the considerable movement of the petiole the bush
presents a different appearance at night to what it does by day yet
the leaves can hardly be said to sleep
the circumnutating movements of the leaves of c floribunda
calliantha and pubescens were observed each during three or four
days they were essentially alike those of the lastnamed species
being the simplest the petiole of c floribunda was secured to a stick
at the base of the two terminal leaflets and a filament was fixed
along the midrib of one of them its movements were traced from 1 pm
on august 13th to 830 am 17th but those during the last 2 h are
alone given in fig 156 from 8 am on each day by which hour the
leaf had assumed its diurnal position to 2 or 3 pm it either
zigzagged or circumnutated over nearly the same small space at between
2 and 3 pm the great evening fall commenced the lines representing
this fall and the early morning rise are oblique owing to the peculiar
manner in which the leaflets sleep as already described after the
leaflet was asleep at 6 pm and whilst the glass filament hung
perpendicularly down the movement of its apex was traced until 1030
pm and during this whole time it swayed from side to side
completing more than one ellipse

bauhinia tribe 15the nyctitropic movements of four species were
alike and were highly peculiar a plant raised from seed sent us from
south brazil by fritz mller was more especially observed the leaves
are large and deeply notched at their ends at night the two halves
rise up and close completely together like the opposite leaflets of
many leguminosae with very young plants the petioles rise considerably
at the same time one which was inclined at noon 45 above the
horizon at night stood at 75 it thus rose 30 another rose 34
whilst the two halves of the leaf are closing the midrib at first
sinks vertically downwards and afterwards bends backwards so as to
pass close along one side of its own upwardly inclined petiole the
midrib being thus directed towards the stem or axis of the plant the
angle which the midrib formed with the horizon was measured in one case
at different hours at noon it stood horizontally late in the evening
it depended vertically then rose to the opposite side and at 1015
pm stood at only 27 beneath the horizon being directed towards the
stem it had thus travelled through 153
owing to this movementto the leaves being foldedand to the petioles
rising the whole plant is as much more compact at night than during
the day as a fastigiate lombardy poplar is compared with any other
species of poplar it is remarkable that when our plants had grown a
little older viz to a height of 2 or 3 feet the petioles did not
rise at night and the midribs of the folded leaves were no longer bent
back along one side of the petiole we have noticed in some other
genera that the petioles of very young plants rise much more at night
than do those of older plants
tamarindus indica tribe 16the leaflets approach or meet each other
at night and are all directed towards the apex of the leaf they thus
become imbricated with their midribs parallel to the petiole the
movement is closely similar to that of haematoxylon see fig 153 but
more striking from the greater number of the leaflets
adenanthera prosopis and neptunia tribe 20with adenanthera
pavonia the leaflets turn edgeways and sink at night in prosopis they
turn upwards with neptunia oleracea the leaflets on the opposite sides
of the same pinna come into contact at night and are directed forwards
the pinnae themselves move downwards and at the same time backwards or
towards the stem of the plant the main petiole rises
mimosa pudica tribe 20this plant has been the subject of
innumerable observations but there are some points in relation to our
subject which have not been sufficiently attended to at night as is
well known the opposite leaflets come into contact and point towards
the apex of the leaf they thus become neatly imbricated with their
upper surfaces protected the four pinnae also approach each other
closely and the whole leaf is thus rendered very compact the main
petiole sinks downwards during the day till late in the evening and
rises until very early in the morning the stem is continually
circumnutating at a rapid rate though not to a wide extent some very
young plants kept in darkness were observed during two days and
although subjected to a rather low temperature of 5759 f the stem
of one described four small ellipses in the course of 12 h we shall
immediately see that the main petiole is likewise continually
circumnutating as is each separate pinna and each separate leaflet
therefore if the movement of the apex of any one leaflet were to be
traced the course described would be compounded of the movements of
four separate parts
a filament had been fixed on the previous evening longitudinally to
the main petiole of a nearly fullgrown highlysensitive leaf four
inches in length the stem having been secured to a stick at its base
and a tracing was made on a vertical glass in the hothouse under a
high temperature in the figure given fig 157 the first dot was
made at 830 am august 2nd and the last at 7 pm on the 3rd during
12 h on the first day the petiole moved thrice downwards and twice
upwards within the same length of time on the second day it moved
five times downwards and four times upwards as the ascending and
descending lines do not coincide the petiole manifestly circumnutates
the great evening fall and nocturnal rise being an exaggeration of one
of the circumnutations it should however be observed that the
petiole fell much lower down in the evenings than could be seen on the
vertical glass or is represented in the diagram after 7 pm on the
3rd when the last dot in fig 157 was made the pot was carried into a
bedroom and the petiole was found at 1250 am ie after midnight
standing almost upright and much more highly inclined than it was at
1040 pm when observed again at 4 am it had begun to fall and
continued falling till 615 am after which hour it zigzagged and
again circumnutated similar observations were made on another petiole
with nearly the same result
fig 157 mimosa pudica circumnutation and nyctitropic movement of main
petiole traced during 34 h 30 m
on two other occasions the movement of the main petiole
was observed every two or three minutes the plants being kept at a
rather high temperature viz on the first occasion at 7781 f and
the filament then described 2 ellipses in 69 m on the second
occasion when the temperature was 8186 f it made rather more than
3 ellipses in 67 m therefore fig 157 though now sufficiently
complex would have been incomparably more so if dots had been made on
the glass every 2 or 3 minutes instead of every hour or halfhour
although the main petiole is continually and rapidly describing small
ellipses during the day yet after the great nocturnal rising movement
has commenced if dots are made every 2 or 3 minutes as was done for
an hour between 930 and 1030 pm temp 84 f and the dots are
then joined an almost absolutely straight line is the result
to show that the movement of the petiole is in all probability due to
the varying turgescence of the pulvinus and not to growth in
accordance with the conclusions of pfeffer a very old leaf with some
of its leaflets yellowish and hardly at all sensitive was selected for
observation and the plant was kept at the highly favourable temp of
80 f the petiole fell from 8 am till 1015 am it then rose a
little in a somewhat zigzag line often remaining stationary till 5
pm when the great evening fall commenced which was continued till
at least 10 pm by 7 am on the following morning it had risen to the
same level as on the previous morning and then descended in a zigzag
line but from 1030 am till 415 pm it remained almost motionless
all power of movement being now lost the petiole therefore of this
very old leaf which must have long ceased growing moved periodically
but instead of circumnutating several times during the day it moved
only twice down and twice up in the course of 24 h with the ascending
and descending lines not coincident
it has already been stated that the pinnae move independently of the
main petiole the petiole of a leaf was fixed to a cork support close
to the point whence the four pinnae diverge with a short fine filament
cemented longitudinally to one of the two terminal pinnae and a
graduated semicircle was placed close beneath it by looking vertically
down its angular or lateral movements could be measured with accuracy
between noon and 415 pm the pinna changed its position to one side
by only 7 but not continuously in the same direction as it moved
four times to one side and three times to the opposite side
in one instance to the extent of 16 this pinna therefore
circumnutated later in the evening the four pinnae approach each
other and the one which was observed moved inwards 59 between noon
and 645 pm ten observations were made in the course of 2 h 20 m
at average intervals of 14 m between 425 and 645 pm and there
was now when the leaf was going to sleep no swaying from side to
side but a steady inward movement here therefore there is in the
evening the same conversion of a circumnutating into a steady movement
in one direction as in the case of the main petiole
it has also been stated that each separate leaflet circumnutates a
pinna was cemented with shellac on the summit of a little stick driven
firmly into the ground immediately beneath a pair of leaflets to the
midribs of both of which excessively fine glass filaments were
attached this treatment did not injure the leaflets for they went to
sleep in the usual manner and long retained their sensitiveness the
movements of one of them were traced during 49 h as shown in fig
158 on the first day the leaflet sank down till 1130 am and then
rose till late in the evening in a zigzag line indicating
circumnutation on the second day when more accustomed to its new
state it oscillated twice up and twice down during the 24 h this
plant was subjected to a rather low temperature viz 6264 f had
it been kept warmer no doubt the movements of the leaflet would have
been much more rapid and complicated it may be seen in the diagram
that the ascending and descending lines do not coincide but the large
amount of lateral movement in the evening is the result of the leaflets
bending towards the apex of the leaf when going to sleep another
leaflet was casually observed and found to be continually
circumnutating during the same length of time
the circumnutation of the leaves is not destroyed by their being
subjected to moderately long continued darkness but the proper
periodicity of their movements is lost some very young seedlings were
kept during two days in the dark temp 5759 f except when the
circumnutation of their stems was occasionally observed and on the
evening of the second day the leaflets did not fully and properly go to
sleep the pot was then placed for three days in a dark cupboard under
nearly the same temperature and at the close of this period the
leaflets showed no signs of sleeping and were only slightly sensitive
to a touch on the following day the stem was cemented to a
stick and the movements of two leaves were traced on a vertical glass
during 72 h the plants were still kept in the dark excepting that at
each observation which lasted 3 or 4 minutes they were illuminated by
two candles on the third day the leaflets still exhibited a vestige of
sensitiveness when forcibly pressed but in the evening they showed no
signs of sleep nevertheless their petioles continued to circumnutate
distinctly
although the proper order of their movements in relation to the day and
night was wholly lost thus one leaf descended during the first two
nights ie between 10 pm and 7 am next morning instead of
ascending and on the third night it moved chiefly in a lateral
direction the second leaf behaved in an equally abnormal manner
moving laterally during the first night descending greatly during the
second and ascending to an unusual height during the third night
fig 158 mimosa pudica circumnutation and nyctitropic movement of a
leaflet with pinna secured traced on a vertical glass from 8 am
sept 14th to 9 am 16th
with plants kept at a high temperature and exposed to the light the
most rapid circumnutating movement of the apex of a leaf which was
observed amounted to 1500 of an inch in one second and this would
have equalled 18 of an inch in a minute had not the leaf occasionally
stood still the actual distance travelled by the apex as ascertained
by a measure placed close to the leaf was on one occasion nearly 34
of an inch in a vertical direction in 15 m and on another occasion
58 of an inch in 60 m but there was also some lateral movement
mimosa albida19the leaves of this plant one of which is here
figured fig 159 reduced to 23 of the natural size present some
interesting peculiarities it consists of a long petiole bearing only
two pinnae here represented as rather more divergent than is usual
each with two pairs of leaflets but the inner
basal leaflets are greatly reduced in size owing probably to the want
of space for their full development so that they may be considered as
almost rudimentary they vary somewhat in size and both occasionally
disappear or only one nevertheless they are not in the least
rudimentary in function for they are sensitive extremely heliotropic
circumnutate at nearly the same rate as the fully developed leaflets
and assume when asleep exactly the same position with m pudica the
inner leaflets at the base and between the pinnae are likewise much
shortened and obliquely truncated this fact was well seen in some
seedlings of m pudica in which the third leaf above the cotyledons
bore only two pinnae each with only 3 or 4 pairs of leaflets of which
the inner basal one was less than half as long as its fellow so that
the whole leaf resembled pretty closely that of m albida in this
latter species the main petiole terminates in a little point and on
each side of this there is a pair of minute flattened lancetshaped
projections hairy on their margins which drop off and disappear soon
after the leaf is fully developed there can hardly be a doubt that
these little projections are the last and fugacious representatives of
an additional pair of leaflets to each pinna for the outer one is
twice as broad as the inner one and a little longer viz 7100 of an
inch whilst the inner one is only 51006100 long now if the basal
pair of leaflets of the existing leaves were to become rudimentary we
should expect that the rudiments would still exhibit some trace of
their present great inequality of size the conclusion that the pinnae
of the parentform of m albida possessed at least three pairs of
leaflets instead of as at present only two is supported by the
structure of the first true leaf for this consists of a simple
petiole often bearing three pairs of leaflets this latter fact as
well as the presence of the rudiments both lead to the conclusion that
m albida is descended from a form the leaves of which bore more than
two pairs of leaflets the second leaf above the cotyledons resembles
in all respects the leaves on fully developed plants
 19 mr thiselton dyer informs us that this peruvian plant which was
 sent to us from kew is considered by mr bentham trans linn
 soc vol xxx p 390 to be the species or variety which most
 commonly represents the m sensitiva of our gardens
fig 159 mimosa albida leaf seen from vertically above
when the leaves go to sleep each leaflet twists half round so as to
present its edge to the zenith and comes into close contact with its
fellow the pinnae also approach each other closely so that the four
terminal leaflets come together the large basal leaflets with the
little rudimentary ones in contact with them move inwards and
forwards so as to embrace the outside of the united terminal leaflets
and thus all eight leaflets
the rudimentary ones included form together a single vertical packet
the two pinnae at the same time that they approach each other sink
downwards and thus instead of extending horizontally in the same line
with the main petiole as during the day they depend at night at about
45 or even at a greater angle beneath the horizon the movement of
the main petiole seems to be variable we have seen it in the evening
27 lower than during the day but sometimes in nearly the same
position nevertheless a sinking movement in the evening and a rising
one during the night is probably the normal course for this was
wellmarked in the petiole of the firstformed true leaf
the circumnutation of the main petiole of a young leaf was traced
during 2 34 days and was considerable in extent but less complex
than that of m pudica the movement was much more lateral than is
usual with circumnutating leaves and this was the sole peculiarity
which it presented the apex of one of the terminal leaflets was seen
under the microscope to travel 150 of an inch in 3 minutes
mimosa marginatathe opposite leaflets rise up and approach each other
at night but do not come into close contact except in the case of

schrankia uncinata tribe 20a leaf consists of two or three pairs of
pinnae each bearing many small leaflets these when the plant is
asleep are directed forwards and become imbricated the angle between
the two terminal pinnae was diminished at night in one case by 15
and they sank almost vertically downwards the hinder pairs of pinnae
likewise sink downwards but do not converge that is move towards the
apex of the leaf the main petiole does not become depressed at least
during the evening in this latter respect as well as in the sinking
of the pinnae there is a marked difference between the nyctitropic
movements of the present plant and of mimosa pudica it should
however be added that our specimen was not in a very vigorous
condition the pinnae of schrankia aculeata also sink at night
acacia farnesiana tribe 22the different appearance presented by a
bush of this plant when asleep and awake is wonderful the same leaf in
the two states is shown in the following figure fig 160 the
leaflets move towards the apex of the pinna and become imbricated and
the pinnae then look like bits of dangling string the following
remarks and measurements
do not fully apply to the small leaf here figured the pinnae move
forwards and at the same time sink downwards whilst the main petiole
rises considerably with respect to the degree of movement the two
terminal pinnae of one specimen formed together an angle of 100 during
the day and at night of only 38 so each had moved 31 forwards the
penultimate pinnae during the day formed together an angle of 180
that is they stood in a straight line opposite one another and at
night each had moved 65 forwards the basal pair of pinnae were
directed during the day each about 21 backwards and at night 38
forwards so each had moved 59 forwards but the pinnae at the same
time sink greatly and sometimes hang almost perpendicularly downwards
the main petiole on the other hand rises much by 830 pm one stood
34 higher than at noon and by 640 am on the following morning it
was still higher by 10 shortly after this hour the diurnal sinking
movement commenced the course of a nearly fullgrown leaf was traced
during 14 h it was strongly zigzag and apparently
represented five ellipses with their longer axes differently directed

albizzia lophantha tribe 23the leaflets at night come into contact

schrankia and acacia the main petiole rises but little the
firstformed leaf above the cotyledons bore 11 leaflets on each side
and these slept like those on the subsequently formed leaves but the
petiole of this first leaf was curved downwards during the day and at
night straightened itself so that the chord of its arc then stood 16
higher than in the daytime

when the blade was vertically dependent at only 15 so the petiole
had fallen 18 that of the next older leaf fell only 7 from some
unknown cause the leaves do not always sleep properly the stem of a
plant which had stood for some time before a northeast window was
secured to a stick at the base of a young leaf the blade of which was
inclined at 40 below the horizon from its position the leaf had to be
viewed obliquely consequently the vertically ascending and descending
movements appeared when traced oblique on the first day oct 12th
the leaf descended in a zigzag line until late in the evening and by
815 am on the 13th had risen to nearly the same level as on the
previous morning a new tracing was now begun fig 161 the leaf
continued to rise until 850 am then moved a little to the right
and afterwards descended between 11 am and 5 pm it circumnutated
and after the latter hour the great nocturnal fall commenced at 715
pm it depended vertically the dotted line ought to have been
prolonged much lower down in the figure by 650 am on the following
morning 14th the
leaf had risen greatly and continued to rise till 750 am after
which hour it redescended it should be observed that the lines traced
on this second morning would have coincided with and confused those
previously traced had not the pot been slided a very little to the
left in the evening 14th a mark was placed behind the filament
attached to the apex of the leaf and its movement was carefully traced
from 5 pm to 1015 pm between 5 and 715 pm the leaf descended in
a straight line and at the latter hour it appeared vertically
dependent but between 715 and 1015 pm the line consisted of a
succession of steps the cause of which we could not understand it
was however manifest that the movement was no longer a simple
descending one

siegesbeckia orientalis compositsome seedlings were raised in the
middle of winter and kept in the hothouse they flowered but did not
grow well and their leaves never showed any signs of sleep the leaves
on other seedlings raised in may were horizontal at noon june 22nd
and depended at a
considerable angle beneath the horizon at 10 pm in the case of four
youngish leaves which were from 2 to 2 inches in length these angles
were found to be 50 56 60 and 65 at the end of august when the
plants had grown to a height of 10 to 11 inches the younger leaves
were so much curved downwards at night that they might truly be said to
be asleep this is one of the species which must be well illuminated
during the day in order to sleep for on two occasions when plants were
kept all day in a room with northeast windows the leaves did not
sleep at night the same cause probably accounts for the leaves on our
seedlings raised in the dead of the winter not sleeping professor
pfeffer informs us that the leaves of another species s jorullensis
 hang vertically down at night

plants a foot or two in height are depressed at night to between 68

on the following morning they again rise into a horizontal position
the petioles become at night downwardly curved either through their
entire length or in the upper part alone and this apparently causes
the depression of the blade it seems necessary that the leaves should
be well illuminated during the day in order to sleep for those which
stood on the back of a plant before a northeast window did not sleep

at the base of the petiole of n tabacum on the outside there is a
mass of cells which are rather smaller than elsewhere and
have their longer axes differently directed from the cells of the
parenchyma and may therefore be considered as forming a sort of
pulvinus a young plant of n tabacum was selected and the
circumnutation of the fifth leaf above the cotyledons was observed
during three days on the first morning july 10th the leaf fell from
9 to 10 am which is its normal course but rose during the remainder
of the day and this no doubt was due to its being illuminated
exclusively from above for properly the evening rise does not commence
until 3 or 4 pm in the figure as given on p 386 fig 163 the first
dot was made at 3 pm and the tracing was continued for the following
65 h when the leaf pointed to the dot next above that marked 3 pm it
stood horizontally the tracing is remarkable only from its simplicity
and the straightness of the lines the leaf each day described a single
great ellipse for it should be observed that the ascending and
descending lines do not coincide on the evening of the 11th the leaf
did not descend quite so low as usual and it now zigzagged a little
the diurnal sinking movement had already commenced each morning by 7
am the broken lines at the top of the figure representing the
nocturnal vertical position of the leaf ought to be prolonged much

mirabilis longiflora and jalapa nyctagineaethe first pair of leaves

offered by the central bud

young leaves rise up vertically at night this is likewise the case
according to linnus with several species of amaranthus

member of the genus again with chenopodium album chenopodieae the
upper young leaves of some seedlings about 4 inches in height were
horizontal or subhorizontal during the day and at 10 pm on march
7th were quite or almost quite vertical other seedlings raised in
the greenhouse during the winter jan 28th were observed day and
night and no difference could be perceived in the position of their
leaves according to bouch bot zeitung 1874 p 359 the leaves
of pimelia linoides and spectabilis thymeleae sleep at night
euphorbia jacquiniaeflora euphorbiaceaemr lynch called our
attention to the fact that the young leaves of this plant sleep by
depending vertically the third leaf from the summit march 11th was
inclined during the day 30 beneath the horizon and at night hung
vertically down as did some of the still younger leaves it rose up to
its former level on the following morning the fourth and fifth leaves
from the summit stood horizontally during the day and sank down at
night only 38 the sixth leaf did not sensibly alter its position the
sinking movement is due to the downward curvature of the petiole no
part of which exhibits any structure like that of a pulvinus early on
the morning of june 7th a filament was fixed longitudinally to a young
leaf the third from the summit and 2 58 inches in length and its
movements were traced on a vertical glass during 72 h the plant being
illuminated from above through a skylight each day the leaf fell in a
nearly straight line from 7 am to 5 pm after which hour it was so
much inclined downwards that the movement could no longer be traced
and during the latter part of each night or early in the morning the
leaf rose it therefore circumnutated in a very simple manner making a
single large ellipse every 24 h for the ascending and descending
lines did not coincide on each successive morning it stood at a less
height than on the previous one and this was probably due partly to
the increasing age of the leaf and partly to the illumination being
insufficient for although the leaves are very slightly heliotropic
yet according to mr lynchs and our own observations their
inclination during the day is determined by the intensity of the light
on the third day by which time the extent of the descending movement
had much decreased the line traced was plainly much more zigzag than
on any previous day and it appeared as if some of its powers of
movement were thus expended at 10 pm on june 7th when the leaf
depended vertically its movements were observed by a mark being placed
behind it and the end of the attached filament was seen to oscillate
slowly and slightly from side to side as well as upwards and
downwards

and 6 in breadth formed at noon an angle with its tall petiole of
121 and at night stood vertically in a line with it and so had risen
59 the actual distance travelled by the apex as measured by an
orthogonic tracing of another large leaf between 730 am and 10
pm was 10 inches the circumnutation of two young and dwarfed
leaves arising amongst the taller leaves at the base of the plant was
traced on a vertical glass during two days on the first day the apex
of one and on the second day the apex of the other leaf described
between 640 am and 4 pm two ellipses the longer axes of which
were extended in very different directions from the lines representing
the great diurnal sinking and nocturnal rising movement
maranta arundinacea cannaceaethe blades of the leaves which are
furnished with a pulvinus stand horizontally during
the day or between 10 and 20 above the horizon and at night
vertically upwards they therefore rise between 70 and 90 at night
the plant was placed at noon in the dark in the hothouse and on the
following day the movements of the leaves were traced between 840 and
1030 am they rose and then fell greatly till 137 pm but by 3
pm they had again risen a little and continued to rise during the
rest of the afternoon and night on the following morning they stood at
the same level as on the previous day darkness therefore during a
day and a half does not interfere with the periodicity of their
movements on a warm but stormy evening the plant whilst being brought
into the house had its leaves violently shaken and at night not one
went to sleep on the next morning the plant was taken back to the
hothouse and again at night the leaves did not sleep but on the
ensuing night they rose in the usual manner between 70 and 80 this
fact is analogous with what we have observed with climbing plants
namely that much agitation checks for a time their power of
circumnutation but the effect in this instance was much more strongly
marked and prolonged

leaves of this plant sleep by their blades sinking in the evening so
as to stand highly inclined or even quite vertically with their tips
pointing to the ground they are not provided with a pulvinus the
blade of one stood at noon 1 degree beneath the horizon at 420 pm
20 at 6 pm 43 at 720 pm 69 and at 830 pm 68 so it had
now begun to rise at 1015 pm it stood at 65 and on the following
early morning at 11 beneath the horizon the circumnutation of another
young leaf with its petiole only 3 14 inches and the blade 4 inches
in length was traced on a vertical glass during 48 h it was dimly
illuminated through a skylight and this seemed to disturb the proper
periodicity of its movements nevertheless the leaf fell greatly
during both afternoons till either 710 pm or 9 pm when it rose a
little and moved laterally by an early hour on both mornings it had
assumed its diurnal position the wellmarked lateral movement for a
short time in the early part of the night was the only interesting
fact which it presented as this caused the ascending and descending
lines not to coincide in accordance with the general rule with
circumnutating organs the movements of the leaves of this plant are
thus of the most simple kind and the tracing is not worth giving we
have seen that in another genus of the aroideae namely pistia the
leaves
rise so much at night that they may almost be said to sleep
strephium floribundum22 graminethe oval leaves are provided with
a pulvinus and are extended horizontally or declined a little beneath
the horizon during the day those on the upright culms simply rise up
vertically at night so that their tips are directed towards the
zenith fig 164 horizontally extended leaves arising from much
inclined or almost horizontal culms move at night so that their tips
point towards the apex of the culm with one lateral margin directed
towards the zenith and in order to assume this position the leaves
have to twist on their own axes through an angle of nearly 90 thus
the surface of the blade always stands vertically whatever may be the
position of the midrib or of the leaf as a whole

the circumnutation of a young leaf 23 inches in length was traced
during 48 h fig 165 the movement was remarkably simple the leaf
descended from before 640 am until 2 or 250 pm and then rose so
as to stand vertically at about 6 pm descending again late in the
night or in the very early morning
on the second day the descending line zigzagged slightly as usual the
ascending and descending lines did not coincide on another occasion
when the temperature was a little higher viz 2426 c a leaf was
observed 17 times between 850 am and 1216 pm it changed its
course by as much as a rectangle six times in this interval of 3 h 26
m and described two irregular triangles and a half the leaf
therefore on this occasion circumnutated rapidly and in a complex
manner

pm and then rose till 6 pm when it was asleep a vertically
dependent glass filament was now fixed to one of the terminal and inner
leaflets and part of the tracing in fig 167 after 6 pm shows that
it continued to sink making one zigzag until 1040 pm at 645 am
on the following morning the leaf was awaking and the filament
pointed above the vertical glass but by 825 am it occupied the
position shown in the figure the diagram differs greatly in appearance
from most of those previously given and this is due to the leaflet
twisting and moving laterally as it approaches and comes into contact
with
its fellow the movement of another leaflet when asleep was traced
between 6 pm and 1035 pm and it clearly circumnutated for it
continued for two hours to sink then rose and then sank still lower
than it was at 6 pm it may be seen in the preceding figure 167 that
the leaflet when the plant was subjected to a rather low temperature
in the house descended and ascended during the middle of the day in a
somewhat zigzag line but when kept in the hothouse from 9 am to 3
pm at a high but varying temperature viz between 72 and 83 f a
leaflet with the petiole secured circumnutated rapidly for it made
three large vertical ellipses in the course of the six hours according
to brongniart marsilea pubescens sleeps like the present species

summary and concluding remarks on the nyctitropic or sleepmovements of
leavesthat these movements are in some manner of high importance to
the plants which exhibit them few will dispute who have observed how
complex they sometimes are thus with cassia the leaflets which are
horizontal during the day not only bend at night vertically downwards
with the terminal pair directed considerably backwards but they also
rotate on their own axes so that their lower surfaces are turned
outwards the terminal leaflet of melilotus likewise rotates by which
movement one of its lateral edges is directed upwards and at the same
time it moves either to the left or to the right until its upper
surface comes into contact with that of the lateral leaflet on the same
side which has likewise rotated on its own axis with arachis all
four leaflets form together during the night a single vertical packet
and to the effect this the two anterior leaflets have to move upwards
and the two posterior ones forwards besides all twisting on their own
axes in the genus sida the leaves of some species move at night
through an angle of 90 upwards and of others
through the same angle downwards we have seen a similar difference in
the nyctitropic movements of the cotyledons in the genus oxalis in
lupinus again the leaflets move either upwards or downwards and in
some species for instance l luteus those on one side of the
starshaped leaf move up and those on the opposite side move down the
intermediate ones rotating on their axes and by these varied
movements the whole leaf forms at night a vertical star instead of a
horizontal one as during the day some leaves and leaflets besides
moving either upwards or downwards become more or less folded at
night as in bauhinia and in some species of oxalis the positions
indeed which leaves occupy when asleep are almost infinitely
diversified they may point either vertically upwards or downwards or
in the case of leaflets towards the apex or towards the base of the
leaf or in any intermediate position they often rotate at least as
much as 90 on their own axes the leaves which arise from upright and
from horizontal or much inclined branches on the same plant move in
some few cases in a different manner as with porlieria and strephium
the whole appearance of many plants is wonderfully changed at night as
may be seen with oxalis and still more plainly with mimosa a bush of
acacia farnesiana appears at night as if covered with little dangling
bits of string instead of leaves excluding a few genera not seen by
ourselves about which we are in doubt and excluding a few others the
leaflets of which rotate at night and do not rise or sink much there
are 37 genera in which the leaves or leaflets rise often moving at the
same time towards the apex or towards the base of the leaf and 32
genera in which they sink at night
the nyctitropic movements of leaves leaflets and
petioles are effected in two different ways firstly by alternately
increased growth on their opposite sides preceded by increased
turgescence of the cells and secondly by means of a pulvinus or
aggregate of small cells generally destitute of chlorophyll which
become alternately more turgescent on nearly opposite sides and this
turgescence is not followed by growth except during the early age of
the plant a pulvinus seems to be formed as formerly shown by a group
of cells ceasing to grow at a very early age and therefore does not
differ essentially from the surrounding tissues the cotyledons of some
species of trifolium are provided with a pulvinus and others are
destitute of one and so it is with the leaves in the genus sida we
see also in this same genus gradations in the state of the development
of the pulvinus and in nicotiana we have what may probably be
considered as the commencing development of one the nature of the
movement is closely similar whether a pulvinus is absent or present
as is evident from many of the diagrams given in this chapter it
deserves notice that when a pulvinus is present the ascending and
descending lines hardly ever coincide so that ellipses are habitually
described by the leaves thus provided whether they are young or so old
as to have quite ceased growing this fact of ellipses being described
shows that the alternately increased turgescence of the cells does not
occur on exactly opposite sides of the pulvinus any more than the
increased growth which causes the movements of leaves not furnished
with pulvini when a pulvinus is present the nyctitropic movements are
continued for a very much longer period than when such do not exist
this has been amply proved in the case of cotyledons and pfeffer has
given observations to the same effect with respect
to leaves we have seen that a leaf of mimosa pudica continued to move
in the ordinary manner though somewhat more simply until it withered
and died it may be added that some leaflets of trifolium pratense were
pinned open during 10 days and on the first evening after being
released they rose up and slept in the usual manner besides the long
continuance of the movements when effected by the aid of a pulvinus
and this appears to be the final cause of its development a twisting
movement at night as pfeffer has remarked is almost confined to
leaves thus provided
it is a very general rule that the first true leaf though it may
differ somewhat in shape from the leaves on the mature plant yet
sleeps like them and this occurs quite independently of the fact
whether or not the cotyledons themselves sleep or whether they sleep
in the same manner but with phaseolus roxburghii the first unifoliate
leaves rise at night almost sufficiently to be said to sleep whilst
the leaflets of the secondary trifoliate leaves sink vertically at
night on young plants of sida rhombaefolia only a few inches in
height the leaves did not sleep though on rather older plants they
rose up vertically at night on the other hand the leaves on very
young plants of cytisus fragrans slept in a conspicuous manner whilst
on old and vigorous bushes kept in the greenhouse the leaves did not
exhibit any plain nyctitropic movement in the genus lotus the basal
stipulelike leaflets rise up vertically at night and are provided
with pulvini
as already remarked when leaves or leaflets change their position
greatly at night and by complicated movements it can hardly be doubted
that these must be in some manner beneficial to the plant if so we
must extend the same conclusion to a large number of sleeping plants
for the most complicated and the simplest nyctitropic movements are
connected together by the finest gradations but owing to the causes
specified in the beginning of this chapter it is impossible in some
few cases to determine whether or not certain movements should be
called nyctitropic generally the position which the leaves occupy at
night indicates with sufficient clearness that the benefit thus
derived is the protection of their upper surfaces from radiation into
the open sky and in many cases the mutual protection of all the parts
from cold by their being brought into close approximation it should be
remembered that it was proved in the last chapter that leaves
compelled to remain extended horizontally at night suffered much more
from radiation than those which were allowed to assume their normal
vertical position
the fact of the leaves of several plants not sleeping unless they have
been well illuminated during the day made us for a time doubt whether
the protection of their upper surfaces from radiation was in all cases
the final cause of their wellpronounced nyctitropic movements but we
have no reason to suppose that the illumination from the open sky
during even the most clouded day is insufficient for this purpose and
we should bear in mind that leaves which are shaded from being seated
low down on the plant and which sometimes do not sleep are likewise
protected at night from full radiation nevertheless we do not wish to
deny that there may exist cases in which leaves change their position
considerably at night without their deriving any benefit from such
movements
although with sleeping plants the blades almost
always assume at night a vertical or nearly vertical position it is a
point of complete indifference whether the apex or the base or one of
the lateral edges is directed to the zenith it is a rule of wide
generality that whenever there is any difference in the degree of
exposure to radiation between the upper and the lower surfaces of
leaves and leaflets it is the upper which is the least exposed as may
be seen in lotus cytisus trifolium and other genera in several
species of lupinus the leaflets do not and apparently from their
structure cannot place themselves vertically at night and
consequently their upper surfaces though highly inclined are more
exposed than the lower and here we have an exception to our rule but
in other species of this genus the leaflets succeed in placing
themselves vertically this however is effected by a very unusual
movement namely by the leaflets on the opposite sides of the same
leaf moving in opposite directions
it is again a very common rule that when leaflets come into close
contact with one another they do so by their upper surfaces which are
thus best protected in some cases this may be the direct result of
their rising vertically but it is obviously for the protection of the
upper surfaces that the leaflets of cassia rotate in so wonderful a
manner whilst sinking downwards and that the terminal leaflet of
melilotus rotates and moves to one side until it meets the lateral
leaflet on the same side when opposite leaves or leaflets sink
vertically down without any twisting their lower surfaces approach
each other and sometimes come into contact but this is the direct and
inevitable result of their position with many species of oxalis the
lower surfaces of the adjoining leaflets are pressed together and are
thus better protected
than the upper surfaces but this depends merely on each leaflet
becoming folded at night so as to be able to sink vertically downwards
the torsion or rotation of leaves and leaflets which occurs in so many
cases apparently always serves to bring their upper surfaces into
close approximation with one another or with other parts of the plant
for their mutual protection we see this best in such cases as those of
arachis mimosa albida and marsilea in which all the leaflets form
together at night a single vertical packet if with mimosa pudica the
opposite leaflets had merely moved upwards their upper surfaces would
have come into contact and been well protected but as it is they all
successively move towards the apex of the leaf and thus not only their
upper surfaces are protected but the successive pairs become
imbricated and mutually protect one another as well as the petioles
this imbrication of the leaflets of sleeping plants is a common
phenomenon
the nyctitropic movement of the blade is generally effected by the
curvature of the uppermost part of the petiole which has often been
modified into a pulvinus or the whole petiole when short may be thus
modified but the blade itself sometimes curves or moves of which fact
bauhinia offers a striking instance as the two halves rise up and come
into close contact at night or the blade and the upper part of the
petiole may both move moreover the petiole as a whole commonly either
rises or sinks at night this movement is sometimes large thus the
petioles of cassia pubescens stand only a little above the horizon
during the day and at night rise up almost or quite perpendicularly
the petioles of the younger leaves of desmodium gyrans also rise up
vertically at night on the other hand with
amphicarpa the petioles of some leaves sank down as much as 57 at
night with arachis they sank 39 and then stood at right angles to
the stem generally when the rising or sinking of several petioles on
the same plant was measured the amount differed greatly this is
largely determined by the age of the leaf for instance the petiole of
a moderately old leaf of desmodium gyrans rose only 46 whilst the
young ones rose up vertically that of a young leaf of cassia
floribunda rose 41 whilst that of an older leaf rose only 12 it is
a more singular fact that the age of the plant sometimes influences
greatly the amount of movement thus with some young seedlings of a
bauhinia the petioles rose at night 30 and 34 whereas those on these
same plants when grown to a height of 2 or 3 feet hardly moved at
all the position of the leaves on the plant as determined by the
light seems also to influence the amount of movement of the petiole
for no other cause was apparent why the petioles of some leaves of
melilotus officinalis rose as much as 59 and others only 7 and 9 at
night
in the case of many plants the petioles move at night in one direction
and the leaflets in a directly opposite one thus in three genera of
phaseoleae the leaflets moved vertically downwards at night and the
petioles rose in two of them whilst in the third they sank species in
the same genus often differ widely in the movements of their petioles
even on the same plant of lupinus pubescens some of the petioles rose
30 others only 6 and others sank 4 at night the leaflets of
cassia barclayana moved so little at night that they could not be said
to sleep yet the petioles of some young leaves rose as much as 34
these several facts apparently indicate that the movements
of the petioles are not performed for any special purpose though a
conclusion of this kind is generally rash when the leaflets sink
vertically down at night and the petioles rise as often occurs it is
certain that the upward movement of the latter does not aid the
leaflets in placing themselves in their proper position at night for
they have to move through a greater angular space than would otherwise
have been necessary
notwithstanding what has just been said it may be strongly suspected
that in some cases the rising of the petioles when considerable does
beneficially serve the plant by greatly reducing the surface exposed to
radiation at night if the reader will compare the two drawings fig
155 p 371 of cassia pubescens copied from photographs he will see
that the diameter of the plant at night is about onethird of what it
is by day and therefore the surface exposed to radiation is nearly
nine times less a similar conclusion may be deduced from the drawings
fig 149 p 358 of a branch awake and asleep of desmodium gyrans so
it was in a very striking manner with young plants of bauhinia and
with oxalis ortegesii
we are led to an analogous conclusion with respect to the movements of
the secondary petioles of certain pinnate leaves the pinnae of mimosa
pudica converge at night and thus the imbricated and closed leaflets
on each separate pinna are all brought close together into a single
bundle and mutually protect one another with a somewhat smaller
surface exposed to radiation with albizzia lophantha the pinnae close
together in the same manner although the pinnae of acacia farnesiana
do not converge much they sink downwards those of neptunia oleracea
likewise
move downwards as well as backwards towards the base of the leaf
whilst the main petiole rises with schrankia again the pinnae are
depressed at night now in these three latter cases though the pinnae
do not mutually protect one another at night yet after having sunk
down they expose as does a dependent sleeping leaf much less surface
to the zenith and to radiation than if they had remained horizontal
any one who had never observed continuously a sleeping plant would
naturally suppose that the leaves moved only in the evening when going
to sleep and in the morning when awaking but he would be quite
mistaken for we have found no exception to the rule that leaves which
sleep continue to move during the whole twentyfour hours they move
however more quickly when going to sleep and when awaking than at
other times that they are not stationary during the day is shown by
all the diagrams given and by the many more which were traced it is
troublesome to observe the movements of leaves in the middle of the
night but this was done in a few cases and tracings were made during
the early part of the night of the movements in the case of oxalis
amphicarpa two species of erythrina a cassia passiflora euphorbia
and marsilea and the leaves after they had gone to sleep were found
to be in constant movement when however opposite leaflets come into
close contact with one another or with the stem at night they are as
we believe mechanically prevented from moving but this point was not
sufficiently investigated
when the movements of sleeping leaves are traced during twentyfour
hours the ascending and descending lines do not coincide except
occasionally and by accident for a short space so that with many
plants a
single large ellipse is described during each twentyfour hours such
ellipses are generally narrow and vertically directed for the amount
of lateral movement is small that there is some lateral movement is
shown by the ascending and descending lines not coinciding and
occasionally as with desmodium gyrans and thalia dealbata it was
strongly marked in the case of melilotus the ellipses described by the
terminal leaflet during the day are laterally extended instead of
vertically as is usual and this fact evidently stands in relation
with the terminal leaflet moving laterally when it goes to sleep with
the majority of sleeping plants the leaves oscillate more than once up
and down in the twentyfour hours so that frequently two ellipses one
of moderate size and one of very large size which includes the
nocturnal movement are described within the twentyfour hours for
instance a leaf which stands vertically up during the night will sink
in the morning then rise considerably again sink in the afternoon
and in the evening reascend and assume its vertical nocturnal position
it will thus describe in the course of the twentyfour hours two
ellipses of unequal sizes other plants describe within the same time
three four or five ellipses occasionally the longer axes of the
several ellipses extend in different directions of which acacia
farnesiana offered a good instance the following cases will give an
idea of the rate of movement oxalis acetosella completed two ellipses
at the rate of 1 h 25 m for each marsilea quadrifoliata at the rate
of 2 h trifolium subterraneum one in 3 h 30 m and arachis
hypogaea in 4 h 50 m but the number of ellipses described within a
given time depends largely on the state of the plant and on the
conditions to which it is exposed it often happens that a single
ellipse may be described during one
day and two on the next erythrina corallodendron made four ellipses
on the first day of observation and only a single one on the third
apparently owing to having been kept not sufficiently illuminated and
perhaps not warm enough but there seems likewise to be an innate
tendency in different species of the same genus to make a different
number of ellipses in the twentyfour hours the leaflets of trifolium
repens made only one those of t resupinatum two and those of t
subterraneum three in this time again the leaflets of oxalis
plumierii made a single ellipse those of o bupleurifolia two those
of o valdiviana two or three and those of o acetosella at least
five in the twentyfour hours
the line followed by the apex of a leaf or leaflet whilst describing
one or more ellipses during the day is often zigzag either throughout
its whole course or only during the morning or evening robinia offered
an instance of zigzagging confined to the morning and a similar
movement in the evening is shown in the diagram fig 126 given under
sida the amount of the zigzag movement depends largely on the plant
being placed under highly favourable conditions but even under such
favourable conditions if the dots which mark the position of the apex
are made at considerable intervals of time and the dots are then
joined the course pursued will still appear comparatively simple
although the number of the ellipses will be increased but if dots are
made every two or three minutes and these are joined the result often
is that all the lines are strongly zigzag many small loops triangles
and other figures being also formed this fact is shown in two parts of
the diagram fig 150 of the movements of desmodium gyrans strephium
floribundum observed under a high temperature
made several little triangles at the rate of 43 m for each mimosa
pudica similarly observed described three little ellipses in 67 m
and the apex of a leaflet crossed 1500 of an inch in a second or 012
inch in a minute the leaflets of averrhoa made a countless number of
little oscillations when the temperature was high and the sun shining
the zigzag movement may in all cases be considered as an attempt to
form small loops which are drawn out by a prevailing movement in some
one direction the rapid gyrations of the little lateral leaflets of
desmodium belong to the same class of movements somewhat exaggerated
in rapidity and amplitude the jerking movements with a small advance
and still smaller retreat apparently not exactly in the same line of
the hypocotyl of the cabbage and of the leaves of dionaea as seen
under the microscope all probably come under this same head we may
suspect that we here see the energy which is freed during the incessant
chemical changes in progress in the tissues converted into motion
finally it should be noted that leaflets and probably some leaves
whilst describing their ellipses often rotate slightly on their axes
so that the plane of the leaf is directed first to one and then to
another side this was plainly seen to be the case with the large
terminal leaflets of desmodium erythrina and amphicarpa and is
probably common to all leaflets provided with a pulvinus
with respect to the periodicity of the movements of sleeping leaves
pfeffer23 has so clearly shown that this depends on the daily
alternations of light and darkness that nothing farther need be said
on this
head but we may recall the behaviour of mimosa in the north where the
sun does not set and the complete inversion of the daily movements by
artificial light and darkness it has also been shown by us that
although leaves subjected to darkness for a moderately long time
continue to circumnutate yet the periodicity of their movements is
soon greatly disturbed or quite annulled the presence of light or its
absence cannot be supposed to be the direct cause of the movements for
these are wonderfully diversified even with the leaflets of the same
leaf although all have of course been similarly exposed the movements
depend on innate causes and are of an adaptive nature the
alternations of light and darkness merely give notice to the leaves
that the period has arrived for them to move in a certain manner we
may infer from the fact of several plants tropaeolum lupinus etc
not sleeping unless they have been well illuminated during the day
that it is not the actual decrease of light in the evening but the
contrast between the amount at this hour and during the early part of
the day which excites the leaves to modify their ordinary mode of
circumnutation
 23 die periodischen bewegungen der blattorgane 1875 p 30 et
 passim
as the leaves of most plants assume their proper diurnal position in
the morning although light be excluded and as the leaves of some
plants continue to move in the normal manner in darkness during at
least a whole day we may conclude that the periodicity of their
movements is to a certain extent inherited24 the strength of such
inheritance differs
much in different species and seems never to be rigid for plants have
been introduced from all parts of the world into our gardens and
greenhouses and if their movements had been at all strictly fixed in
relation to the alternations of day and night they would have slept in
this country at very different hours which is not the case moreover
it has been observed that sleeping plants in their native homes change
their times of sleep with the changing seasons25
 24 pfeffer denies such inheritance he attributes die period
 bewegungen pp 3056 the periodicity when prolonged for a day or
 two in darkness to nachwirkung or the aftereffects of light and
 darkness but we are unable to follow his train of reasoning there
 does not seem to be any more reason for attributing such movements to
 this cause than for instance the inherited habit of winter and
 summer wheat to grow best at different seasons for this habit is lost
 after a few years like the movements of leaves in darkness after a
 few days no doubt some effect must be produced on the seeds by the
 longcontinued cultivation of the parentplants under different
 climates but no one probably would call this the nachwirkung of the
 climates
 25 pfeffer ibid p 46
we may now turn to the systematic list this contains the names of all
the sleeping plants known to us though the list undoubtedly is very
imperfect it may be premised that as a general rule all the species
in the same genus sleep in nearly the same manner but there are some
exceptions in several large genera including many sleeping species
for instance oxalis some do not sleep one species of melilotus
sleeps like a trifolium and therefore very differently from its
congeners so does one species of cassia in the genus sida the leaves
either rise or fall at night and with lupinus they sleep in three
different methods returning to the list the first point which strikes
us is that there are many more genera amongst the leguminosae and in
almost every one of the leguminous tribes than in all the other
families put together and we are tempted to connect this fact with the
great
mobility of the stems and leaves in this family as shown by the large
number of climbing species which it contains next to the leguminosae
come the malvaceae together with some closely allied families but by
far the most important point in the list is that we meet with sleeping
plants in 28 families in all the great divisions of the phanerogamic
series and in one cryptogam now although it is probable that with
the leguminosae the tendency to sleep may have been inherited from one
or a few progenitors and possibly so in the cohorts of the malvales
and chenopodiales yet it is manifest that the tendency must have been
acquired by the several genera in the other families quite
independently of one another hence the question naturally arises how
has this been possible and the answer we cannot doubt is that leaves
owe their nyctitropic movements to their habit of circumnutatinga
habit common to all plants and everywhere ready for any beneficial
development or modification
it has been shown in the previous chapters that the leaves and
cotyledons of all plants are continually moving up and down generally
to a slight but sometimes to a considerable extent and that they
describe either one or several ellipses in the course of twentyfour
hours they are also so far affected by the alternations of day and
night that they generally or at least often move periodically to a
small extent and here we have a basis for the development of the
greater nyctitropic movements that the movements of leaves and
cotyledons which do not sleep come within the class of circumnutating
movements cannot be doubted for they are closely similar to those of
hypocotyls epicotyls the stems of mature plants and of various other
organs now if we take the simplest
case of a sleeping leaf we see that it makes a single ellipse in the
twentyfour hours which resembles one described by a nonsleeping leaf
in every respect except that it is much larger in both cases the
course pursued is often zigzag as all nonsleeping leaves are
incessantly circumnutating we must conclude that a part at least of
the upward and downward movement of one that sleeps is due to ordinary
circumnutation and it seems altogether gratuitous to rank the
remainder of the movement under a wholly different head with a
multitude of climbing plants the ellipses which they describe have been
greatly increased for another purpose namely catching hold of a
support with these climbing plants the various circumnutating organs
have been so far modified in relation to light that differently from
all ordinary plants they do not bend towards it with sleeping plants
the rate and amplitude of the movements of the leaves have been so far
modified in relation to light that they move in a certain direction
with the waning light of the evening and with the increasing light of
the morning more rapidly and to a greater extent than at other hours
but the leaves and cotyledons of many nonsleeping plants move in a
much more complex manner than in the cases just alluded to for they
describe two three or more ellipses in the course of a day now if a
plant of this kind were converted into one that slept one side of one
of the several ellipses which each leaf daily describes would have to
be greatly increased in length in the evening until the leaf stood
vertically when it would go on circumnutating about the same spot on
the following morning the side of another ellipse would have to be
similarly increased in length so as to bring the leaf back again into
its diurnal position when it would again circumnutate
until the evening if the reader will look for instance at the
diagram fig 142 p 351 representing the nyctitropic movements of
the terminal leaflet of trifolium subterraneum remembering that the
curved broken lines at the top ought to be prolonged much higher up he
will see that the great rise in the evening and the great fall in the
morning together form a large ellipse like one of those described
during the daytime differing only in size or he may look at the
diagram fig 103 p 236 of the 3 ellipses described in the course
of 6 h 35 m by a leaf of lupinus speciosus which is one of the
species in this genus that does not sleep and he will see that by
merely prolonging upwards the line which was already rising late in the
evening and bringing it down again next morning the diagram would
represent the movements of a sleeping plant
with those sleeping plants which describe several ellipses in the
daytime and which travel in a strongly zigzag line often making in
their course minute loops triangles etc if as soon as one of the
ellipses begins in the evening to be greatly increased in size dots
are made every 2 or 3 minutes and these are joined the line then
described is almost strictly rectilinear in strong contrast with the
lines made during the daytime this was observed with desmodium gyrans
and mimosa pudica with this latter plant moreover the pinnae
converge in the evening by a steady movement whereas during the day
they are continually converging and diverging to a slight extent in
all such cases it was scarcely possible to observe the difference in
the movement during the day and evening without being convinced that
in the evening the plant saves the expenditure of force by not moving
laterally and that its whole energy is now expended
in gaining quickly its proper nocturnal position by a direct course in
several other cases for instance when a leaf after describing during
the day one or more fairly regular ellipses zigzags much in the
evening it appears as if energy was being expended so that the great
evening rise or fall might coincide with the period of the day proper
for this movement
the most complex of all the movements performed by sleeping plants is
that when leaves or leaflets after describing in the daytime several
vertically directed ellipses rotate greatly on their axes in the
evening by which twisting movement they occupy a wholly different
position at night to what they do during the day for instance the
terminal leaflets of cassia not only move vertically downwards in the
evening but twist round so that their lower surfaces face outwards
such movements are wholly or almost wholly confined to leaflets
provided with a pulvinus but this torsion is not a new kind of
movement introduced solely for the purpose of sleep for it has been
shown that some leaflets whilst describing their ordinary ellipses
during the daytime rotate slightly causing their blades to face first
to one side and then to another although we can see how the slight
periodical movements of leaves in a vertical plane could be easily
converted into the greater yet simple nyctitropic movements we do not
at present know by what graduated steps the more complex movements
effected by the torsion of the pulvini have been acquired a probable
explanation could be given in each case only after a close
investigation of the movements in all the allied forms
from the facts and considerations now advanced we may conclude that
nyctitropism or the sleep of leaves
and cotyledons is merely a modification of their ordinary
circumnutating movement regulated in its period and amplitude by the
alternations of light and darkness the object gained is the protection
of the upper surfaces of the leaves from radiation at night often
combined with the mutual protection of the several parts by their close
approximation in such cases as those of the leaflets of cassiaof the
terminal leaflets of melilotusof all the leaflets of arachis
marsilea etcwe have ordinary circumnutation modified to the extreme
extent known to us in any of the several great classes of modified
circumnutation on this view of the origin of nyctitropism we can
understand how it is that a few plants widely distributed throughout
the vascular series have been able to acquire the habit of placing the
blades of their leaves vertically at night that is of sleepinga
fact otherwise inexplicable
the leaves of some plants move during the day in a manner which has
improperly been called diurnal sleep for when the sun shines brightly
on them they direct their edges towards it to such cases we shall
recur in the following chapter on heliotropism it has been shown that
the leaflets of one form of porlieria hygrometrica keep closed during
the day as long as the plant is scantily supplied with water in the
same manner as when asleep and this apparently serves to check
evaporation there is only one other analogous case known to us
namely that of certain gramine which fold inwards the sides of their
narrow leaves when these are exposed to the sun and to a dry
atmosphere as described by duvaljouve26 we have also observed the
same phenomenon in elymus arenareus
 26 annal des sc nat bot 1875 tom i pp 326329
there is another movement which since the time of linnus has
generally been called sleep namely that of the petals of the many
flowers which close at night these movements have been ably
investigated by pfeffer who has shown as was first observed by
hofmeister that they are caused or regulated more by temperature than
by the alternations of light and darkness although they cannot fail to
protect the organs of reproduction from radiation at night this does
not seem to be their chief function but rather the protection of the
organs from cold winds and especially from rain during the day the
latter seems probable as kerner27 has shown that a widely different
kind of movement namely the bending down of the upper part of the
peduncle serves in many cases the same end the closure of the flowers
will also exclude nocturnal insects which may be illadapted for their
fertilisation and the welladapted kinds at periods when the
temperature is not favourable for fertilisation whether these
movements of the petals consist as is probable of modified
circumnutation we do not know

embryology of leavesa few facts have been incidentally given in this
chapter on what may be called the embryology of leaves with most
plants the first leaf which is developed after the cotyledons
resembles closely the leaves produced by the mature plant but this is
not always the case the first leaves produced by some species of
drosera for instance by d capensis differ widely in shape from those
borne by the mature plant and resemble closely the leaves of d
rotundifolia as was shown to us by prof williamson of manchester the
first true leaf of
the gorse or ulex is not narrow and spinose like the older leaves on
the other hand with many leguminous plants for instance cassia
acacia lophantha etc the first leaf has essentially the same
character as the older leaves excepting that it bears fewer leaflets
in trifolium the first leaf generally bears only a single leaflet
instead of three and this differs somewhat in shape from the
corresponding leaflet on the older leaves now with trifolium
pannonicum the first true leaf on some seedlings was unifoliate and on
others completely trifoliate and between these two extreme states
there were all sorts of gradations some seedlings bearing a single
leaflet more or less deeply notched on one or both sides and some
bearing a single additional and perfect lateral leaflet here then we
have the rare opportunity of seeing a structure proper to a more
advanced age in the act of gradually encroaching on and replacing an
earlier or embryological condition
the genus melilotus is closely allied to trifolium and the first leaf
bears only a single leaflet which at night rotates on its axis so as
to present one lateral edge to the zenith hence it sleeps like the
terminal leaflet of a mature plant as was observed in 15 species and
wholly unlike the corresponding leaflet of trifolium which simply
bends upwards it is therefore a curious fact that in one of these 15
species viz m taurica and in a lesser degree in two others
leaves arising from young shoots produced on plants which had been cut
down and kept in pots during the winter in the greenhouse slept like
the leaves of a trifolium whilst the leaves on the fullygrown
branches on these same plants afterwards slept normally like those of a
melilotus if young shoots rising from the ground may be considered as
new individuals partaking to a certain extent of the nature of
seedlings then the peculiar manner in which their leaves slept may be
considered
as an embryological habit probably the result of melilotus being
descended from some form which slept like a trifolium this view is
partially supported by the leaves on old and young branches of another
species m messanensis not included in the above 15 species always
sleeping like those of a trifolium
the first true leaf of mimosa albida consists of a simple petiole
often bearing three pairs of leaflets all of which are of nearly equal
size and of the same shape the second leaf differs widely from the
first and resembles that on a mature plant see fig 159 p 379 for
it consists of two pinnae each of which bears two pairs of leaflets
of which the inner basal one is very small but at the base of each
pinna there is a pair of minute points evidently rudiments of
leaflets for they are of unequal sizes like the two succeeding
leaflets these rudiments are in one sense embryological for they
exist only during the youth of the leaf falling off and disappearing
as soon as it is fully grown
with desmodium gyrans the two lateral leaflets are very much smaller
than the corresponding leaflets in most of the species in this large
genus they vary also in position and size one or both are sometimes
absent and they do not sleep like the fullydeveloped leaflets they
may therefore be considered as almost rudimentary and in accordance
with the general principles of embryology they ought to be more
constantly and fully developed on very young than on old plants but
this is not the case for they were quite absent on some young
seedlings and did not appear until from 10 to 20 leaves had been
formed this fact leads to the suspicion that d gyrans is descended
through a unifoliate form of which some exist from a trifoliate
species and that the little lateral leaflets reappear through
reversion however this may be
the interesting fact of the pulvini or organs of movement of these
little leaflets not having been reduced nearly so much as their
bladestaking the large terminal leaflet as the standard of
comparisongives us probably the proximate cause of their extraordinary
power of gyration

injured by intense lightmovements to avoid intense light
sachs first clearly pointed out the important difference between the
action of light in modifying the periodic movements of leaves and in
causing them to bend towards its source1 the latter or heliotropic
movements are determined by the direction of the light whilst periodic
movements are affected by changes in its intensity and not by its
direction the periodicity of the circumnutating movement often
continues for some time in darkness as we have seen in the last
chapter whilst heliotropic bending ceases very quickly when the light
fails nevertheless plants which have ceased through longcontinued
darkness to move periodically if reexposed to the light are still
according to sachs heliotropic
 1 physiologie veg french translation 1868 pp 42 517 etc
apheliotropism or as usually designated negative
heliotropism implies that a plant when unequally illuminated on the
two sides bends from the light instead of as in the last subclass
of cases towards it but apheliotropism is comparatively rare at
least in a wellmarked degree there is a third and large subclass of
cases namely those of transversalheliotropismus of frank which we
will here call diaheliotropism parts of plants under this influence
place themselves more or less transversely to the direction whence the
light proceeds and are thus fully illuminated there is a fourth
subclass as far as the final cause of the movement is concerned for
the leaves of some plants when exposed to an intense and injurious
amount of light direct themselves by rising or sinking or twisting so
as to be less intensely illuminated such movements have sometimes been
called diurnal sleep if thought advisable they might be called
paraheliotropic and this term would correspond with our other terms
it will be shown in the present chapter that all the movements included
in these four subclasses consist of modified circumnutation we do
not pretend to say that if a part of a plant whilst still growing did
not circumnutatethough such a supposition is most improbableit could
not bend towards the light but as a matter of fact heliotropism
seems always to consist of modified circumnutation any kind of
movement in relation to light will obviously be much facilitated by
each part circumnutating or bending successively in all directions so
that an already existing movement has only to be increased in some one
direction and to be lessened or stopped in the other directions in
order that it should become heliotropic apheliotropic etc as the
case may be in the next chapter some observations on the sensitiveness
of plants to light their
rate of bending towards it and the accuracy with which they point
towards its source etc will be given afterwards it will be
shownand this seems to us a point of much interestthat sensitiveness
to light is sometimes confined to a small part of the plant and that
this part when stimulated by light transmits an influence to distant
parts exciting them to bend
heliotropismwhen a plant which is strongly heliotropic and species
differ much in this respect is exposed to a bright lateral light it
bends quickly towards it and the course pursued by the stem is quite
or nearly straight but if the light is much dimmed or occasionally
interrupted or admitted in only a slightly oblique direction the
course pursued is more or less zigzag and as we have seen and shall
again see such zigzag movement results from the elongation or drawing
out of the ellipses loops etc which the plant would have described
if it had been illuminated from above on several occasions we were
much struck with this fact whilst observing the circumnutation of
highly sensitive seedlings which were unintentionally illuminated
rather obliquely or only at successive intervals of time
fig 168 beta vulgaris circumnutation of hypocotyl deflected by the
light being slightly lateral traced on a horizontal glass from 830
am to 530 pm direction of the lighted taper by which it was
illuminated shown by a line joining the first and penultimate dots
figure reduced to onethird of the original scale
for instance two young seedlings of beta vulgaris were placed in the
middle of a room with northeast windows and were kept covered up
except during each observation which lasted for only a minute or two
but the result was that their hypocotyls bowed themselves to the side
whence some light occasionally entered in lines which were
only slightly zigzag although not a single ellipse was even
approximately formed we inferred from the zigzag linesand as it
proved correctlythat their hypocotyls were circumnutating for on the
following day these same seedlings were placed in a completely darkened
room and were observed each time by the aid of a small wax taper held
almost directly above them and their movements were traced on a
horizontal glass above and now their hypocotyls clearly circumnutated
fig 168 and fig 39 formerly given p 52 yet they moved a short
distance towards the side where the taper was held up if we look at
these diagrams and suppose that the taper had been held more on one
side and that the hypocotyls still circumnutating had bent
themselves within the same time much more towards the light long
zigzag lines would obviously have been the result
fig 169 avena sativa heliotropic movement and circumnutation of
sheathlike cotyledon 1 inch in height traced on horizontal glass
from 8 am to 1025 pm oct 16th
again two seedlings of solanum lycopersicum were illuminated from
above but accidentally a little more light entered on one than on any
other side and their hypocotyls became slightly bowed towards the
brighter side they moved in a zigzag line and described in their
course two little triangles as seen in fig 37 p 50 and in another
tracing not given the sheathlike cotyledons of zea mays behaved
under nearly similar circumstances in a nearly similar manner as
described in our first chapter p 64 for they bowed themselves
during the whole day towards one side making however in their course
some conspicuous flexures before we knew how greatly ordinary
circumnutation was modified by a lateral light some seedling oats
with rather old and therefore not highly sensitive cotyledons were
placed in front of a northeast window towards which they bent all day
in a strongly zigzag course on the following day they continued to
bend in the same direction fig 169 but zigzagged much less the
sky however became between 1240 and 235 pm
overcast with extraordinarily dark thunderclouds and it was
interesting to note how plainly the cotyledons circumnutated during
this interval
the foregoing observations are of some value from having been made
when we were not attending to heliotropism and they led us to
experiment on several kinds of seedlings by exposing them to a dim
lateral light so as to observe the gradations between ordinary
circumnutation and heliotropism seedlings in pots were placed in front
of and about a yard from a northeast window on each side and over
the pots black boards were placed in the rear the pots were open to
the diffused light of the room which had a second northeast and a
northwest window by hanging up one or more blinds before the window
where the seedlings stood it was easy to dim the light so that very
little more entered on this side than on the opposite one which
received the diffused light of the room late in the evening the blinds
were successively removed and as the plants had been subjected during
the day to a very obscure light they continued to bend towards the
window later in the evening than would otherwise have occurred most of
the seedlings were selected because they were known to be highly
sensitive to light and some because they were but little sensitive or
had become so from having grown old the movements were traced in the
usual manner on a horizontal glass cover a fine glass filament with
little triangles of paper having been cemented in an upright position
to the hypocotyls whenever the stem or hypocotyl became much bowed
towards the light the latter part of its course had to be traced on a
vertical glass parallel to the window and at right angles to the
horizontal glass cover
fig 170 apios graveolens heliotropic movement of hypocotyl 45 of
inch in height towards a moderately bright lateral light traced on a
horizontal glass from 830 am to 1130 am sept 18th figure
reduced to onethird of original scale
apios graveolensthe hypocotyl bends in a few hours
rectangularly towards a bright lateral light in order to ascertain how
straight a course it would pursue when fairly well illuminated on one
side seedlings were first placed before a southwest window on a
cloudy and rainy morning and the movement of two hypocotyls were
traced for 3 h during which time they became greatly bowed towards
the light one of these tracings is given on p 422 fig 170 and the
course may be seen to be almost straight but the amount of light on
this occasion was superfluous for two seedlings were placed before a
northeast window protected by an ordinary linen and two muslin
blinds yet their hypocotyls moved towards this rather dim light in
only slightly zigzag lines but after 4 pm as the light waned the
lines became distinctly zigzag one of these seedlings moreover
described in the afternoon an ellipse of considerable size with its
longer axis directed towards the window
we now determined that the light should be made dim enough so we began
by exposing several seedlings before a northeast window protected by
one linen blind three muslin blinds and a towel but so little light
entered that a pencil cast no perceptible shadow on a white card and
the hypocotyls did not bend at all towards the window during this
time from 815 to 1050 am the hypocotyls zigzagged or
circumnutated near the same spot as may be seen at a in fig 171 the
towel therefore was removed at 1050 am and replaced by two muslin
blinds and now the light passed through one ordinary linen and four
muslin blinds when a pencil was held upright on a card close to the
seedlings it cast a shadow pointing from the window which could only
just be distinguished yet this very slight excess of light on one side
sufficed to cause the hypocotyls of all the seedlings immediately to
begin bending in zigzag lines towards the window the course of one is
shown at a fig 171 after moving towards the window from 1050 am
to 1248 pm it bent from the window and then returned in a nearly
parallel line that is it almost completed between 1248 and 2 pm a
narrow ellipse late in the evening as the light waned the hypocotyl
ceased to bend towards the window and circumnutated on a small scale
round the same spot during the night it moved considerably backwards
that is became more upright through the action of apogeotropism at
b we have a tracing of the movements of another seedling from the hour
1050 am when the towel was removed and it is in all essential
respects
similar to the previous one in these two cases there could be no doubt
that the ordinary circumnutating movement of the hypocotyl was modified
and rendered heliotropic

reproduced fig 172 if the hypocotyl is exposed to a moderately
strong lateral light it moves quickly towards this side travelling in
a straight or nearly straight line but when the lateral light is
very dim its course is extremely tortuous and evidently consists of
modified circumnutation seedlings were placed before a northeast
window protected by a linen and muslin blind and by a towel the sky
was cloudy and whenever the clouds grew a little lighter an additional
muslin blind was temporarily suspended the light from the window was
thus so much obscured that judging by the unassisted eye the
seedlings appeared to receive more light from the interior of the room
than from the window but this was not really the case as was shown by
a very faint shadow cast by a pencil on a card nevertheless this
extremely small excess of light on one side caused the hypocotyls
which in the morning had stood upright to bend at right angles towards
the window so that in the evening after 423 pm their course had
to be traced on a vertical glass parallel to the window it should be
stated that at 330 pm by which time the sky had become darker the
towel was removed and replaced by an additional muslin blind which
itself was removed at 4 pm the other two
blinds being left suspended in fig 173 the course pursued between
89 am and 710 pm by one of the hypocotyls thus exposed is shown
it may be observed that during the first 16 m the hypocotyl moved
obliquely from the light and this
no doubt was due to its then circumnutating in this direction similar
cases were repeatedly observed and a dim light rarely or never
produced any effect until from a quarter to threequarters of an hour
had elapsed after 515 pm by which time the light had become
obscure the hypocotyl began to circumnutate about the same spot the
contrast between the two figures 172 and 173 would have been more
striking if they had been originally drawn on the same scale and had
been equally reduced but the movements shown in fig 172 were at first
more magnified and have been reduced to only onehalf of the original
scale whereas those in fig 173 were at first less magnified and have
been reduced to a onethird scale a tracing made at the same time with
the last of the movements of a second hypocotyl presented a closely
analogous appearance but it did not bend quite so much towards the
light and it circumnutated rather more plainly

phalaris canariensisthe sheathlike cotyledons of this
monocotyledonous plant were selected for trial because they are very
sensitive to light and circumnutate well as formerly shown see fig
49 p 63 although we felt no doubt about the result some seedlings
were first placed before a southwest window on a moderately bright
morning and the movements of one were traced as is so common it
moved
for the first 45 m in a zigzag line it then felt the full influence
of the light and travelled towards it for the next 2 h 30 m in an
almost straight line the tracing has not been given as it was almost
identical with that of apios under similar circumstances fig 170 by
noon it had bowed itself to its full extent it then circumnutated
about the same spot and described two ellipses by 5 pm it had
retreated considerably from the light through the action of
apogeotropism after some preliminary trials for ascertaining the right
degree of obscurity some seedlings were placed sept 16th before a
northeast window and light was admitted through an ordinary linen and
three muslin blinds a pencil held close by the pot now cast a very
faint shadow on a white card pointing from the window in the evening
at 430 and again at 6 pm some of the blinds were removed in fig
174 we see the course pursued under these circumstances by a rather old
and not very sensitive cotyledon 19 inch in height which became much
bowed but was never rectangularly bent towards the light from 11
am when the sky became rather duller until 630 pm the
zigzagging was conspicuous and evidently consisted of drawnout
ellipses after 630 pm and during the night it retreated in a
crooked line from the window another and younger seedling moved during
the same time much more quickly and to a much greater distance in an
only slightly zigzag line towards the light by 11 am it was bent
almost rectangularly in this direction and now circumnutated about the
same place

tropaeolum majussome very young seedlings bearing only two leaves
and therefore not as yet arrived at the climbing stage of growth were
first tried before a northeast window without any blind the epicotyls
bowed themselves towards the light so rapidly that in little more than
3 h their tips pointed rectangularly towards it the lines traced were
either nearly straight or slightly zigzag and in this latter case we
see that a trace of circumnutation was retained even under the
influence of a moderately bright light twice whilst these epicotyls
were bending towards the window dots were made every 5 or 6 minutes
in order to detect any trace of lateral movement but there was hardly
any and the lines formed by their junction were nearly straight or
only very slightly zigzag as in the other parts of the figures after
the epicotyls had bowed themselves to the full extent towards the
light ellipses of considerable size were described in the usual
manner
after having seen how the epicotyls moved towards a moderately bright
light seedlings were placed at 748 am sept 7th before a
northeast window covered by a towel and shortly afterwards by an
ordinary linen blind but the epicotyls still moved towards the window
at 913 am two additional muslin blinds were suspended so that the
seedlings received very little more light from the window than from the
interior of the room the sky varied in brightness and the seedlings
occasionally received for a short time less light from the window than
from the opposite side as ascertained by the shadow cast and then
one of the blinds was temporarily removed in the evening the blinds
were taken away one by one the course pursued by an epicotyl under
these circumstances is shown in fig 175 during the whole day until
645 pm it plainly bowed itself towards the light and the tip moved
over a considerable space after 645 pm it moved backwards or from
the window till
1040 pm when the last dot was made here then we have a distinct
heliotropic movement effected by means of six elongated figures which
if dots had been made every few minutes would have been more or less
elliptic directed towards the light with the apex of each successive
ellipse nearer to the window than the previous one now if the light
had been only a little brighter the epicotyl would have bowed itself
more to the light as we may safely conclude from the previous trials
there would also have been less lateral movement and the ellipses or
other figures would have been drawn out into a strongly marked zigzag
line with probably one or two small loops still formed if the light
had been much brighter we should have had a slightly zigzag line or
one quite straight for there would have been more movement in the
direction of the light and much less from side to side

sachs states that the older internodes of this tropaeolum are
apheliotropic we therefore placed a plant 11 34 inches high in a
box blackened within but open on one side in front of a northeast
window without any blind a filament was fixed to the third internode
from the summit on one plant and to the fourth internode of another
these internodes were either not old enough or the light was not
sufficiently bright to induce apheliotropism for both plants bent
slowly towards instead of from the window during four days the
course during two days of the firstmentioned internode is given in
fig 176 and we see that it either circumnutated on a small scale or
travelled in a zigzag line towards the light we have thought this case
of feeble heliotropism in one of the older internodes of a plant
which whilst young is so extremely sensitive to light worth giving

cassia torathe cotyledons of this plant are extremely sensitive to
light whilst the hypocotyls are much less sensitive than those of most
other seedlings as we had often observed with surprise it seemed
therefore worth while to trace their movements they were exposed to a
lateral light before a northeast window which was at first covered
merely by a muslin blind but as the sky grew brighter about 11 am
an additional linen blind was suspended after 4 pm one blind and
then the other was removed the seedlings were protected on each side
and above but were open to the diffused light of the room in the rear
upright filaments were fixed to the hypocotyls of two seedlings which
stood vertically in the morning the accompanying figure fig 177
shows the course pursued by one of them during two days but it should
be particularly noticed that during the second day the seedlings were
kept in darkness and they then circumnutated round nearly the same
small space on the first day oct 7th the hypocotyl moved from 8
am to 1223 pm toward the light in a zigzag line then turned
abruptly to the left and afterwards described a small ellipse another
irregular
ellipse was completed between 3 pm and about 530 pm the hypocotyl
still bending towards the light the hypocotyl was straight and upright
in the morning but by 6 pm its upper half was bowed towards the
light so that the chord of the arc thus formed stood at an angle of
20 with the perpendicular after 6 pm its course was reversed
through the action of apogeotropism and it continued to bend from the
window during the night as shown by the broken line on the next day
it was kept in the dark excepting when each observation was made by
the aid of a taper and the course followed from 7 am on the 8th to
745 am on the 9th is here likewise shown the difference between the
two parts of the figure 177 namely that described during the daytime
on the 7th when exposed to a rather dim lateral light and that on the
8th in darkness is striking the difference consists in the lines
during the first day having been drawn out in the direction of the
light the movements of the other seedling traced under the same
circumstances were closely similar
apheliotropismwe succeeded in observing only two cases of
apheliotropism for these are somewhat rare and the movements are
generally so slow that they would have been very troublesome to trace

movements as originally traced little magnified here reduced to
twothirds of the original scale
bignonia capreolatano organ of any plant as far as we have seen
bends away so quickly from the light as do the tendrils of this
bignonia they are also remarkable from circumnutating much less
regularly than most other tendrils often remaining stationary they
depend on apheliotropism for coming into
contact with the trunks of trees2 the stem of a young plant was tied
to a stick at the base of a pair of fine tendrils which projected
almost vertically upwards and it was placed in front of a northeast
window being protected on all other sides from the light the first
dot was made at 645 am and by 735 am both tendrils felt the full
influence of the light for they moved straight away from it until 920
am when they circumnutated for a time still moving but only a
little from the light see fig 178 of the lefthand tendril after 3
pm they again moved rapidly away from the light in zigzag lines by a
late hour in the evening both had moved so far that they pointed in a
direct line from the light during the night they returned a little in
a nearly opposite direction on the following morning they again moved
from the light and converged so that by the evening they had become
interlocked still pointing from the light the righthand tendril
whilst converging zigzagged much more than the one figured both
tracings showed that the apheliotropic movement was a modified form of
circumnutation
 2 the movements and habits of climbing plants 1875 p 97
cyclamen persicumwhilst this plant is in flower the peduncles stand
upright but their uppermost part is hooked so that the flower itself
hangs downwards as soon as the pods begin to swell the peduncles
increase much in length and slowly curve downwards but the short
upper hooked part straightens itself ultimately the pods reach the
ground and if this is covered with moss or dead leaves they bury
themselves we have often seen saucerlike depressions formed by the
pods in damp sand or sawdust and one pod 3 of inch in diameter
buried itself in sawdust for threequarters of its length3 we shall
have occasion hereafter to consider the object gained by this burying
process the peduncles can change the direction of their curvature for
if a pot with plants having their peduncles already bowed downwards
be placed horizontally they slowly bend at right angles to their
former direction towards the centre of the earth we therefore at first
attributed the movement to geotropism but a pot which had lain
horizontally with the pods
all pointing to the ground was reversed being still kept horizontal
so that the pods now pointed directly upwards it was then placed in a
dark cupboard but the pods still pointed upwards after four days and
nights the pot in the same position was next brought back into the
light and after two days there was some bending downwards of the
peduncles and on the fourth day two of them pointed to the centre of
the earth as did the others after an additional day or two another
plant in a pot which had always stood upright was left in the dark
cupboard for six days it bore 3 peduncles and only one became within
this time at all bowed downwards and that doubtfully the weight
therefore of the pods is not the cause of the bending down this pot
was then brought back into the light and after three days the
peduncles were considerably bowed downwards we are thus led to infer
that the downward curvature is due to apheliotropism though more
trials ought to have been made
 3 the peduncles of several other species of cyclamen twist
 themselves into a spire and according to erasmus darwin botanic
 garden canto iii p 126 the pods forcibly penetrate the earth

fig 179 cyclamen persicum downward apheliotropic movement of a
flowerpeduncle greatly magnified about 47 times traced on a
horizontal glass from 1 pm feb 18th to 8 am 21st
in order to observe the nature of this movement a peduncle bearing a
large pod which had reached and rested on the ground was lifted a
little up and secured to a stick a filament was fixed across the pod
with a mark beneath and its
movement greatly magnified was traced on a horizontal glass during 67
h the plant was illuminated during the day from above a copy of the
tracing is given on p 434 fig 179 and there can be no doubt that
the descending movement is one of modified circumnutation but on an
extremely small scale the observation was repeated on another pod
which had partially buried itself in sawdust and which was lifted up a
quarter of an inch above the surface it described three very small
circles in 24 h considering the great length and thinness of the
peduncles and the lightness of the pods we may conclude that they
would not be able to excavate saucerlike depressions in sand or
sawdust or bury themselves in moss etc unless they were aided by
their continued rocking or circumnutating movement
relation between circumnutation and heliotropismany one who will look
at the foregoing diagrams showing the movements of the stems of
various plants towards a lateral and more or less dimmed light will be
forced to admit that ordinary circumnutation and heliotropism graduate
into one another when a plant is exposed to a dim lateral light and
continues during the whole day bending towards it receding late in the
evening the movement unquestionably is one of heliotropism now in
the case of tropaeolum fig 175 the stem or epicotyl obviously
circumnutated during the whole day and yet it continued at the same
time to move heliotropically this latter movement being effected by
the apex of each successive elongated figure or ellipse standing nearer
to the light than the previous one in the case of cassia fig 177
the comparison of the movement of the hypocotyl when exposed to a dim
lateral light and to darkness is very instructive as is that between
the ordinary circumnutating movement of a seedling brassica figs 172
173 or that of phalaris figs 49 174 and their heliotropic
movement towards a window protected by blinds in both these cases
and in many others it was interesting to notice how gradually the
stems began to circumnutate as the light waned in the evening we have
therefore many kinds of gradations from a movement towards the light
which must be considered as one of circumnutation very slightly
modified and still consisting of ellipses or circlesthough a movement
more or less strongly zigzag with loops or ellipses occasionally
formedto a nearly straight or even quite straight heliotropic
course
a plant when exposed to a lateral light though this may be bright
commonly moves at first in a zigzag line or even directly from the
light and this no doubt is due to its circumnutating at the time in a
direction either opposite to the source of the light or more or less
transversely to it as soon however as the direction of the
circumnutating movement nearly coincides with that of the entering
light the plant bends in a straight course towards the light if this
is bright the course appears to be rendered more and more rapid and
rectilinear in accordance with the degree of brightness of the
lightfirstly by the longer axes of the elliptical figures which the
plant continues to describe as long as the light remains very dim
being directed more or less accurately towards its source and by each
successive ellipse being described nearer to the light secondly if
the light is only somewhat dimmed by the acceleration and increase of
the movement towards it and by the retardation or arrestment of that
from the light some lateral movement being still retained for the
light will interfere less with a movement at right angles to its
direction than with one in its own direction4
the result is that the course is rendered more or less zigzag and
unequal in rate lastly when the light is very bright all lateral
movement is lost and the whole energy of the plant is expended in
rendering the circumnutating movement rectilinear and rapid in one
direction alone namely towards the light
 4 in his paper ueber orthotrope und plagiotrope pflanzentheile
 arbeiten des bot inst in wrzburg band ii heft ii 1879 sachs
 has discussed the manner in which geotropism and heliotropism are
 affected by differences in the angles at which the organs of plants
 stand with respect to the direction of the incident force
the common view seems to be that heliotropism is a quite distinct kind
of movement from circumnutation and it may be urged that in the
foregoing diagrams we see heliotropism merely combined with or
superimposed on circumnutation but if so it must be assumed that a
bright lateral light completely stops circumnutation for a plant thus
exposed moves in a straight line towards it without describing any
ellipses or circles if the light be somewhat obscured though amply
sufficient to cause the plant to bend towards it we have more or less
plain evidence of stillcontinued circumnutation it must further be
assumed that it is only a lateral light which has this extraordinary
power of stopping circumnutation for we know that the several plants
above experimented on and all the others which were observed by us
whilst growing continue to circumnutate however bright the light may
be if it comes from above nor should it be forgotten that in the life
of each plant circumnutation precedes heliotropism for hypocotyls
epicotyls and petioles circumnutate before they have broken through
the ground and have ever felt the influence of light
we are therefore fully justified as it seems to us in believing that
whenever light enters laterally it is the
movement of circumnutation which gives rise to or is converted into
heliotropism and apheliotropism on this view we need not assume
against all analogy that a lateral light entirely stops circumnutation
it merely excites the plant to modify its movement for a time in a
beneficial manner the existence of every possible gradation between a
straight course towards a lateral light and a course consisting of a
series of loops or ellipses becomes perfectly intelligible finally
the conversion of circumnutation into heliotropism or apheliotropism
is closely analogous to what takes place with sleeping plants which
during the daytime describe one or more ellipses often moving in
zigzag lines and making little loops for when they begin in the
evening to go to sleep they likewise expend all their energy in
rendering their course rectilinear and rapid in the case of
sleepmovements the exciting or regulating cause is a difference in
the intensity of the light coming from above at different periods of
the twentyfour hours whilst with heliotropic and apheliotropic
movements it is a difference in the intensity of the light on the two
sides of the plant
transversalheliotropismus of frank5 or diaheliotropismthe
cause of leaves placing themselves more or less transversely to the
light with their upper surfaces directed towards it has been of late
the subject of much controversy we do not here refer to the object of
the movement which no doubt is that their upper surfaces may be fully
illuminated but the means by which this position is gained hardly a
better or more simple instance can be given
of diaheliotropism than that offered by many seedlings the cotyledons
of which are extended horizontally when they first burst from their
seedcoats they are in contact and stand in various positions often
vertically upwards they soon diverge and this is effected by
epinasty which as we have seen is a modified form of circumnutation
after they have diverged to their full extent they retain nearly the
same position though brightly illuminated all day long from above
with their lower surfaces close to the ground and thus much shaded
there is therefore a great contrast in the degree of illumination of
their upper and lower surfaces and if they were heliotropic they would
bend quickly upwards it must not however be supposed that such
cotyledons are immovably fixed in a horizontal position when seedlings
are exposed before a window their hypocotyls which are highly
heliotropic bend quickly towards it and the upper surfaces of their
cotyledons still remain exposed at right angles to the light but if
the hypocotyl is secured so that it cannot bend the cotyledons
themselves change their position if the two are placed in the line of
the entering light the one furthest from it rises up and that nearest
to it often sinks down if placed transversely to the light they twist
a little laterally so that in every case they endeavour to place their
upper surfaces at right angles to the light so it notoriously is with
the leaves on plants nailed against a wall or grown in front of a
window a moderate amount of light suffices to induce such movements
all that is necessary is that the light should steadily strike the
plants in an oblique direction with respect to the above twisting
movement of cotyledons frank has given many and much more striking
instances in the case of the leaves on
branches which had been fastened in various positions or turned upside
down

in our observations on the cotyledons of seedling plants we often felt
surprise at their persistent horizontal position during the day and
were convinced before we had read franks essay that some special
explanation was necessary de vries has shown6 that the more or less
horizontal position of leaves is in most cases influenced by epinasty
by their own weight and by apogeotropism a young cotyledon or leaf
after bursting free is brought down into its proper position as
already remarked by epinasty which according to de vries long
continues to act on the midribs and petioles weight can hardly be
influential in the case of cotyledons except in a few cases presently
to be mentioned but must be so with large and thick leaves with
respect to apogeotropism de vries maintains that it generally comes
into play and of this fact we shall presently advance some indirect
evidence but over these and other constant forces we believe that
there is in many cases but we do not say in all a preponderant
tendency in leaves and cotyledons to place themselves more or less
transversely with respect to the light
 6 arbeiten des bot instituts in wrzburg heft ii 1872 pp
 223277
in the cases above alluded to of seedlings exposed to a lateral light
with their hypocotyls secured it is impossible that epinasty weight
and apogeotropism either in opposition or combined can be the cause
of the rising of one cotyledon and of the sinking of the other since
the forces in question act equally on both and since epinasty weight
and apogeotropism all act in a vertical plane they cannot cause the
twisting of the petioles which occurs in seedlings under the
above conditions of illumination all these movements evidently depend
in some manner on the obliquity of the light but cannot be called
heliotropic as this implies bending towards the light whereas the
cotyledon nearest to the light bends in an opposed direction or
downwards and both place themselves as nearly as possible at right
angles to the light the movement therefore deserves a distinct name
as cotyledons and leaves are continually oscillating up and down and
yet retain all day long their proper position with their upper surfaces
directed transversely to the light and if displaced reassume this
position diaheliotropism must be considered as a modified form of
circumnutation this was often evident when the movements of cotyledons
standing in front of a window were traced we see something analogous
in the case of sleeping leaves or cotyledons which after oscillating
up and down during the whole day rise into a vertical position late in
the evening and on the following morning sink down again into their
horizontal or diaheliotropic position in direct opposition to
heliotropism this return into their diurnal position which often
requires an angular movement of 90 is analogous to the movement of
leaves on displaced branches which recover their former positions it
deserves notice that any force such as apogeotropism will act with
different degrees of power7 in the different positions of those
leaves or cotyledons which oscillate largely up and down during the
day and yet they recover their horizontal or diaheliotropic position
 7 see former note in reference to sachs remarks on this subject
we may therefore conclude that diaheliotropic movements cannot be fully
explained by the direct action of light gravitation weight etc any
more
than can the nyctitropic movements of cotyledons and leaves in the
latter case they place themselves so that their upper surfaces may
radiate at night as little as possible into open space with the upper
surfaces of the opposite leaflets often in contact these movements
which are sometimes extremely complex are regulated though not
directly caused by the alternations of light and darkness in the case
of diaheliotropism cotyledons and leaves place themselves so that
their upper surfaces may be exposed to the light and this movement is
regulated though not directly caused by the direction whence the
light proceeds in both cases the movement consists of circumnutation
modified by innate or constitutional causes in the same manner as with
climbing plants the circumnutation of which is increased in amplitude
and rendered more circular or again with very young cotyledons and
leaves which are thus brought down into a horizontal position by
epinasty
we have hitherto referred only to those leaves and cotyledons which
occupy a permanently horizontal position but many stand more or less
obliquely and some few upright the cause of these differences of
position is not known but in accordance with wiesners views
hereafter to be given it is probable that some leaves and cotyledons
would suffer if they were fully illuminated by standing at right
angles to the light
we have seen in the second and fourth chapters that those cotyledons
and leaves which do not alter their positions at night sufficiently to
be said to sleep commonly rise a little in the evening and fall again
on the next morning so that they stand during the night at a rather
higher inclination than during the middle of the day it is incredible
that a rising movement of 2 or 3 or even of 10 or 20 can be of
any service to the plant so as to have been specially acquired it
must be the result of some periodical change in the conditions to which
they are subjected and there can hardly be a doubt that this is the
daily alternations of light and darkness de vries states in the paper
before referred to that most petioles and midribs are apogeotropic8
and apogeotropism would account for the above rising movement which is
common to so many widely distinct species if we suppose it to be
conquered by diaheliotropism during the middle of the day as long as
it is of importance to the plant that its cotyledons and leaves should
be fully exposed to the light the exact hour in the afternoon at which
they begin to bend slightly upwards and the extent of the movement
will depend on their degree of sensitiveness to gravitation and on
their power of resisting its action during the middle of the day as
well as on the amplitude of their ordinary circumnutating movements
and as these qualities differ much in different species we might
expect that the hour in the afternoon at which they begin to rise would
differ much in different species as is the case some other agency
however besides apogeotropism must come into play either directly or
indirectly in this upward movement thus a young bean vicia faba
growing in a small pot was placed in front of a window in a klinostat
and at night the leaves rose a little although
the action of apogeotropism was quite eliminated nevertheless they
did not rise nearly so much at night as when subjected to
apogeotropism is it not possible or even probable that leaves and
cotyledons which have moved upwards in the evening through the action
of apogeotropism during countless generations may inherit a tendency
to this movement we have seen that the hypocotyls of several
leguminous plants have from a remote period inherited a tendency to
arch themselves and we know that the sleepmovements of leaves are to
a certain extent inherited independently of the alternations of light
and darkness
 8 according to frank die nat wagerechte richtung von
 pflanzentheilen 1870 p 46 the rootleaves of many plants kept in
 darkness rise up and even become vertical and so it is in some cases
 with shoots see rauwenhoff archives nerlandaises tom xii p
 32 these movements indicate apogeotropism but when organs have been
 long kept in the dark the amount of water and of mineral matter which
 they contain is so much altered and their regular growth is so much
 disturbed that it is perhaps rash to infer from their movements what
 would occur under normal conditions see godlewski bot zeitung
 feb 14th 1879
in our observations on the circumnutation of those cotyledons and
leaves which do not sleep at night we met with hardly any distinct
cases of their sinking a little in the evening and rising again in the
morningthat is of movements the reverse of those just discussed we
have no doubt that such cases occur inasmuch as the leaves of many
plants sleep by sinking vertically downwards how to account for the
few cases which were observed must be left doubtful the young leaves
of cannabis sativa sink at night between 30 and 40 beneath the
horizon and kraus attributes this to epinasty in conjunction with the
absorption of water whenever epinastic growth is vigorous it might
conquer diaheliotropism in the evening at which time it would be of no
importance to the plant to keep its leaves horizontal the cotyledons
of anoda wrightii of one variety of gossypium and of several species
of ipoma remain horizontal in the evening whilst they are very young
as they grow a little older they curve a little downwards and when
large and heavy sink so much that they come under our definition of
sleep in the case of
the anoda and of some species of ipoma it was proved that the
downward movement did not depend on the weight of the cotyledons but
from the fact of the movement being so much more strongly pronounced
after the cotyledons have grown large and heavy we may suspect that
their weight aboriginally played some part in determining that the
modification of the circumnutating movement should be in a downward
direction
the socalled diurnal sleep of leaves or paraheliotropismthis is
another class of movements dependent on the action of light which
supports to some extent the belief that the movements above described
are only indirectly due to its action we refer to the movements of
leaves and cotyledons which when moderately illuminated are
diaheliotropic but which change their positions and present their
edges to the light when the sun shines brightly on them these
movements have sometimes been called diurnal sleep but they differ
wholly with respect to the object gained from those properly called
nyctitropic and in some cases the position occupied during the day is
the reverse of that during the night
it has long been known9 that when the sun shines brightly on the
leaflets of robinia they rise up and present their edges to the light
whilst their position at night is vertically downwards we have
observed the same movement when the sun shone brightly on the leaflets
of an australian acacia those of amphicarpa monoica turned their
edges to the sun and an analogous movement of the little almost
rudimentary basal leaflets of mimosa albida was on one occasion so
rapid that it could be distinctly seen through a lens the elongated
unifoliate first leaves of phaseolus roxburghii stood at 7 am at 20
above the horizon and no doubt they afterwards sank a little lower at
noon after having been exposed for about 2 h to
a bright sun they stood at 56 above the horizon they were then
protected from the rays of the sun but were left well illuminated from
above and after 30 m they had fallen 40 for they now stood at only
16 above the horizon some young plants of phaseolus hernandesii had
been exposed to the same bright sunlight and their broad unifoliate
first leaves now stood up almost or quite vertically as did many of
the leaflets on the trifoliate secondary leaves but some of the
leaflets had twisted round on their own axes by as much as 90 without
rising so as to present their edges to the sun the leaflets on the
same leaf sometimes behaved in these two different manners but always
with the result of being less intensely illuminated these plants were
then protected from the sun and were looked at after 1 h and now
all the leaves and leaflets had reassumed their ordinary subhorizontal
positions the coppercoloured cotyledons of some seedlings of cassia
mimosoides were horizontal in the morning but after the sun had shone
on them each had risen 45 above the horizon the movement in these
several cases must not be confounded with the sudden closing of the
leaflets of mimosa pudica which may sometimes be noticed when a plant
which has been kept in an obscure place is suddenly exposed to the sun
for in this case the light seems to act as if it were a touch
 9 pfeffer gives the names and dates of several ancient writers in
 his die periodischen bewegungen 1875 p 62
from prof wiesners interesting observations it is probable that the
above movements have been acquired for a special purpose the
chlorophyll in leaves is often injured by too intense a light and
prof wiesner10 believes that it is protected by the most diversified
means such as the presence of hairs colouring matter etc and
amongst other means by the leaves presenting their edges to the sun so
that the blades then receive much less light he experimented on the
young leaflets of robinia by fixing them in such a position that they
could not escape being intensely illuminated whilst others were
allowed to place themselves obliquely and the former began to suffer
from the light in the course of two days
 10 die nturlichen einrichtungen zum schutze des chlorophylls
 etc 1876 pringsheim has recently observed under the microscope the
 destruction of chlorophyll in a few minutes by the action of
 concentrated light from the sun in the presence of oxygen see also
 stahl on the protection of chlorophyll from intense light in bot
 zeitung 1880
in the cases above given the leaflets move either upwards
or twist laterally so as to place their edges in the direction of the
suns light but cohn long ago observed that the leaflets of oxalis
bend downwards when fully exposed to the sun we witnessed a striking
instance of this movement in the very large leaflets of o ortegesii a
similar movement may frequently be observed with the leaflets of
averrhoa bilimbi a member of the oxalid and a leaf is here
represented fig 180 on which the sun had shone a diagram fig 134
was given in the last chapter representing the oscillations by which a
leaflet rapidly descended under these circumstances and the movement
may be seen closely to resemble that fig 133 by which it assumed its
nocturnal position it is an interesting fact in relation to our
present subject that as prof batalin informs us in a letter dated
february 1879 the leaflets of oxalis acetosella may be daily exposed
to the sun during many weeks and they do not suffer if they are
allowed to depress themselves but if this be prevented they lose
their colour and wither in two or three days yet the duration of a
leaf is about two months when subjected only to diffused light and in
this case the leaflets never sink downwards during the day
fig 180 averrhoa bilimbi leaf with leaflets depressed after exposure
to sunshine but the leaflets are sometimes more depressed than is here
shown figure much reduced
as the upward movements of the leaflets of robinia and the downward
movements of those of oxalis have been proved to be highly beneficial
to these plants when subjected to bright sunshine it seems probable
that they have been acquired for the special purpose of avoiding too
intense an illumination as it would have been very troublesome in all
the above cases to
have watched for a fitting opportunity and to have traced the movement
of the leaves whilst they were fully exposed to the sunshine we did
not ascertain whether paraheliotropism always consisted of modified
circumnutation but this certainly was the case with the averrhoa and
probably with the other species as their leaves were continually
circumnutating

remarks and summary of chaptermeans by which circumnutation has been
converted into heliotropism or apheliotropism
no one can look at the plants growing on a bank or on the borders of a
thick wood and doubt that the young stems and leaves place themselves
so that the leaves may be well illuminated they are thus enabled to
decompose carbonic acid but the sheathlike cotyledons of some
gramine for instance those of phalaris are not green and contain
very little starch from which fact we may infer that they decompose
little or no carbonic acid nevertheless they are extremely
heliotropic and this probably serves them in another way namely as a
guide from the buried seeds through fissures in the ground or through
overlying masses of vegetation into the light and air this view
is strengthened by the fact that with phalaris and avena the first true
leaf which is bright green and no doubt decomposes carbonic acid
exhibits hardly a trace of heliotropism the heliotropic movements of
many other seedlings probably aid them in like manner in emerging from
the ground for apogeotropism by itself would blindly guide them
upwards against any overlying obstacle
heliotropism prevails so extensively among the higher plants that
there are extremely few of which some part either the stem
flowerpeduncle petiole or leaf does not bend towards a lateral
light drosera rotundifolia is one of the few plants the leaves of
which exhibit no trace of heliotropism nor could we see any in
dionaea though the plants were not so carefully observed sir j
hooker exposed the pitchers of sarracenia for some time to a lateral
light but they did not bend towards it1 we can understand the
reason why these insectivorous plants should not be heliotropic as
they do not live chiefly by decomposing carbonic acid and it is much
more important to them that their leaves should occupy the best
position for capturing insects than that they should be fully exposed
to the light
 1 according to f kurtz verhandl des bot vereins der provinz
 brandenburg bd xx 1878 the leaves or pitchers of darlingtonia
 californica are strongly apheliotropic we failed to detect this
 movement in a plant which we possessed for a short time
tendrils which consist of leaves or of other organs modified and the
stems of twining plants are as mohl long ago remarked rarely
heliotropic and here again we can see the reason why for if they had
moved towards a lateral light they would have been drawn away from
their supports but some tendrils are apheliotropic for instance those
of bignonia capreolata
and of smilax aspera and the stems of some plants which climb by
rootlets as those of the ivy and tecoma radicans are likewise
apheliotropic and they thus find a support the leaves on the other
hand of most climbing plants are heliotropic but we could detect no
signs of any such movement in those of mutisia clematis
as heliotropism is so widely prevalent and as twining plants are
distributed throughout the whole vascular series the apparent absence
of any tendency in their stems to bend towards the light seemed to us
so remarkable a fact as to deserve further investigation for it
implies that heliotropism can be readily eliminated when twining
plants are exposed to a lateral light their stems go on revolving or
circumnutating about the same spot without any evident deflection
towards the light but we thought that we might detect some trace of
heliotropism by comparing the average rate at which the stems moved to
and from the light during their successive revolutions2 three young
plants about a foot in height of ipoma caerulea and four of i
purpurea growing in separate pots were placed on a bright day before
a northeast window in a room otherwise darkened with the tips of
their revolving stems fronting the window when the tip of each plant
pointed directly from the window and when again towards it the times
were recorded this was continued from 645 am till a little after 2
pm on june 17th after a few observations we concluded that we could
safely estimate the time
taken by each semicircle within a limit of error of at most 5 minutes
although the rate of movement in different parts of the same revolution
varied greatly yet 22 semicircles to the light were completed each on
an average in 7395 minutes and 22 semicircles from the light each in
735 minutes it may therefore be said that they travelled to and
from the light at exactly the same average rate though probably the
accuracy of the result was in part accidental in the evening the stems
were not in the least deflected towards the window nevertheless there
appears to exist a vestige of heliotropism for with 6 out of the 7
plants the first semicircle from the light described in the early
morning after they had been subjected to darkness during the night and
thus probably rendered more sensitive required rather more time and
the first semicircle to the light considerably less time than the
average thus with all 7 plants taken together the mean time of the
first semicircle in the morning from the light was 768 minutes
instead of 735 minutes which is the mean of all the semicircles
during the day from the light and the mean of the first semicircle to
the light was only 631 instead of 7395 minutes which was the mean
of all the semicircles during the day to the light
 2 some erroneous statements are unfortunately given on this subject
 in the movements and habits of climbing plants 1875 pp 28 32
 40 and 53 conclusions were drawn from an insufficient number of
 observations for we did not then know at how unequal a rate the stems
 and tendrils of climbing plants sometimes travel in different parts of
 the same revolution
similar observations were made on wistaria sinensis and the mean of 9
semicircles from the light was 117 minutes and of 7 semicircles to the
light 122 minutes and this difference does not exceed the probable
limit of error during the three days of exposure the shoot did not
become at all bent towards the window before which it stood in this
case the first semicircle from the light in the early morning of each
day required rather less time for its performance than did the first
semicircle to the light and this result
if not accidental appears to indicate that the shoots retain a trace
of an original apheliotropic tendency with lonicera brachypoda the
semicircles from and to the light differed considerably in time for 5
semicircles from the light required on a mean 2024 minutes and 4 to
the light 2295 minutes but the shoot moved very irregularly and
under these circumstances the observations were much too few
it is remarkable that the same part on the same plant may be affected
by light in a widely different manner at different ages and as it
appears at different seasons the hypocotyledonous stems of ipoma
caerulea and purpurea are extremely heliotropic whilst the stems of
older plants only about a foot in height are as we have just seen
almost wholly insensible to light sachs states and we have observed
the same fact that the hypocotyls of the ivy hedera helix are
slightly heliotropic whereas the stems of plants grown to a few inches
in height become so strongly apheliotropic that they bend at right
angles away from the light nevertheless some young plants which had
behaved in this manner early in the summer again became distinctly
heliotropic in the beginning of september and the zigzag courses of
their stems as they slowly curved towards a northeast window were
traced during 10 days the stems of very young plants of tropaeolum
majus are highly heliotropic whilst those of older plants according
to sachs are slightly apheliotropic in all these cases the
heliotropism of the very young stems serves to expose the cotyledons
or when the cotyledons are hypogean the first true leaves fully to the
light and the loss of this power by the older stems or their becoming
apheliotropic is connected with their habit of climbing
most seedling plants are strongly heliotropic and
it is no doubt a great advantage to them in their struggle for life to
expose their cotyledons to the light as quickly and as fully as
possible for the sake of obtaining carbon it has been shown in the
first chapter that the greater number of seedlings circumnutate largely
and rapidly and as heliotropism consists of modified circumnutation
we are tempted to look at the high development of these two powers in
seedlings as intimately connected whether there are any plants which
circumnutate slowly and to a small extent and yet are highly
heliotropic we do not know but there are several and there is
nothing surprising in this fact which circumnutate largely and are not
at all or only slightly heliotropic of such cases drosera
rotundifolia offers an excellent instance the stolons of the
strawberry circumnutate almost like the stems of climbing plants and
they are not at all affected by a moderate light but when exposed late
in the summer to a somewhat brighter light they were slightly
heliotropic in sunlight according to de vries they are
apheliotropic climbing plants circumnutate much more widely than any
other plants yet they are not at all heliotropic
although the stems of most seedling plants are strongly heliotropic
some few are but slightly heliotropic without our being able to assign
any reason this is the case with the hypocotyl of cassia tora and we
were struck with the same fact with some other seedlings for instance
those of reseda odorata with respect to the degree of sensitiveness of
the more sensitive kinds it was shown in the last chapter that
seedlings of several species placed before a northeast window
protected by several blinds and exposed in the rear to the diffused
light of the room moved with unerring certainty towards the window
although
it was impossible to judge excepting by the shadow cast by an upright
pencil on a white card on which side most light entered so that the
excess on one side must have been extremely small
a pot with seedlings of phalaris canariensis which had been raised in
darkness was placed in a completely darkened room at 12 feet from a
very small lamp after 3 h the cotyledons were doubtfully curved
towards the light and after 7 h 40 m from the first exposure they
were all plainly though slightly curved towards the lamp now at
this distance of 12 feet the light was so obscure that we could not
see the seedlings themselves nor read the large roman figures on the
white face of a watch nor see a pencil line on paper but could just
distinguish a line made with indian ink it is a more surprising fact
that no visible shadow was cast by a pencil held upright on a white
card the seedlings therefore were acted on by a difference in the
illumination of their two sides which the human eye could not
distinguish on another occasion even a less degree of light acted for
some cotyledons of phalaris became slightly curved towards the same
lamp at a distance of 20 feet at this distance we could not see a
circular dot 229 mm 09 inch in diameter made with indian ink on
white paper though we could just see a dot 356 mm 14 inch in
diameter yet a dot of the former size appears large when seen in the
light3

 p 52 that the spores of haematococcus moved to a light which only
 just sufficed to allow middlesized type to be read
we next tried how small a beam of light would act as this bears on
light serving as a guide to seedlings whilst they emerge through
fissured or encumbered ground a pot with seedlings of phalaris was
covered
by a tinvessel having on one side a circular hole 123 mm in
diameter ie a little less than the 120th of an inch and the box
was placed in front of a paraffin lamp and on another occasion in front
of a window and both times the seedlings were manifestly bent after a
few hours towards the little hole
a more severe trial was now made little tubes of very thin glass
closed at their upper ends and coated with black varnish were slipped
over the cotyledons of phalaris which had germinated in darkness and
just fitted them narrow stripes of the varnish had been previously
scraped off one side through which alone light could enter and their
dimensions were afterwards measured under the microscope as a control
experiment similar unvarnished and transparent tubes were tried and
they did not prevent the cotyledons bending towards the light two
cotyledons were placed before a southwest window one of which was
illuminated by a stripe in the varnish only 004 inch 01 mm in
breadth and 016 inch 04 mm in length and the other by a stripe
008 inch in breadth and 06 inch in length the seedlings were
examined after an exposure of 7 h 40 m and were found to be
manifestly bowed towards the light some other cotyledons were at the
same time treated similarly excepting that the little stripes were
directed not to the sky but in such a manner that they received only
the diffused light from the room and these cotyledons did not become
at all bowed seven other cotyledons were illuminated through narrow
but comparatively long cleared stripes in the varnishnamely in
breadth between 01 and 026 inch and in length between 15 and 3
inch and these all became bowed to the side by which light entered
through the stripes whether these were directed towards the sky or to
one side of
the room that light passing through a hole only 004 inch in breadth
by 016 in length should induce curvature seems to us a surprising
fact
before we knew how extremely sensitive the cotyledons of phalaris were
to light we endeavoured to trace their circumnutation in darkness by
the aid of a small wax taper held for a minute or two at each
observation in nearly the same position a little on the left side in
front of the vertical glass on which the tracing was made the
seedlings were thus observed seventeen times in the course of the day
at intervals of from half to threequarters of an hour and late in the
evening we were surprised to find that all the 29 cotyledons were
greatly curved and pointed towards the vertical glass a little to the
left where the taper had been held the tracings showed that they had
travelled in zigzag lines thus an exposure to a feeble light for a
very short time at the above specified intervals sufficed to induce
wellmarked heliotropism an analogous case was observed with the
hypocotyls of solanum lycopersicum we at first attributed this result
to the aftereffects of the light on each occasion but since reading
wiesners observations4 which will be referred to in the last
chapter we cannot doubt that an intermittent light is more efficacious
than a continuous one as plants are especially sensitive to any
contrast in its amount
 4 sitz der k akad der wissensch vienna jan 1880 p 12
the cotyledons of phalaris bend much more slowly towards a very obscure
light than towards a bright one thus in the experiments with
seedlings placed in a dark room at 12 feet from a very small lamp they
were just perceptibly and doubtfully curved towards it after 3 h and
only slightly yet certainly after 4 h
after 8 h 40 m the chords of their arcs were deflected from the
perpendicular by an average angle of only 16 had the light been
bright they would have become much more curved in between 1 and 2 h
several trials were made with seedlings placed at various distances
from a small lamp in a dark room but we will give only one trial six
pots were placed at distances of 2 4 8 12 16 and 20 feet from the
lamp before which they were left for 4 h as light decreases in a
geometrical ratio the seedlings in the 2nd pot received 14th those
in the 3rd pot 116th those in the 4th 136th those in the 5th
164th and those in the 6th 1100th of the light received by the
seedlings in the first or nearest pot therefore it might have been
expected that there would have been an immense difference in the degree
of their heliotropic curvature in the several pots and there was a
wellmarked difference between those which stood nearest and furthest
from the lamp but the difference in each successive pair of pots was
extremely small in order to avoid prejudice we asked three persons
who knew nothing about the experiment to arrange the pots in order
according to the degree of curvature of the cotyledons the first
person arranged them in proper order but doubted long between the 12
feet and 16 feet pots yet these two received light in the proportion
of 36 to 64 the second person also arranged them properly but doubted
between the 8 feet and 12 feet pots which received light in the
proportion of 16 to 36 the third person arranged them in wrong order
and doubted about four of the pots this evidence shows conclusively
how little the curvature of the seedlings differed in the successive
pots in comparison with the great difference in the amount of light
which they received and it should be noted that there was no
excess of superfluous light for the cotyledons became but little and
slowly curved even in the nearest pot close to the 6th pot at the
distance of 20 feet from the lamp the light allowed us just to
distinguish a dot 356 mm 14 inch in diameter made with indian ink
on white paper but not a dot 229 mm 09 inch in diameter
the degree of curvature of the cotyledons of phalaris within a given
time depends not merely on the amount of lateral light which they may
then receive but on that which they have previously received from
above and on all sides analogous facts have been given with respect to
the nyctitropic and periodic movements of plants of two pots
containing seedlings of phalaris which had germinated in darkness one
was still kept in the dark and the other was exposed sept 26th to
the light in a greenhouse during a cloudy day and on the following
bright morning on this morning 27th at 1030 am both pots were
placed in a box blackened within and open in front before a
northeast window protected by a linen and muslin blind and by a
towel so that but little light was admitted though the sky was
bright whenever the pots were looked at this was done as quickly as
possible and the cotyledons were then held transversely with respect
to the light so that their curvature could not have been thus
increased or diminished after 50 m the seedlings which had previously
been kept in darkness were perhaps and after 70 m were certainly
curved though very slightly towards the window after 85 m some of
the seedlings which had previously been illuminated were perhaps a
little affected and after 100 m some of the younger ones were
certainly a little curved towards the light at this time ie after
100 m there was a plain difference
in the curvature of the seedlings in the two pots after 2 h 12 m the
chords of the arcs of four of the most strongly curved seedlings in
each pot were measured and the mean angle from the perpendicular of
those which had previously been kept in darkness was 19 and of those
which had previously been illuminated only 7 nor did this difference
diminish during two additional hours as a check the seedlings in both
pots were then placed in complete darkness for two hours in order that
apogeotropism should act on them and those in the one pot which were
little curved became in this time almost completely upright whilst the
more curved ones in the other pot still remained plainly curved
two days afterwards the experiment was repeated with the sole
difference that even less light was admitted through the window as it
was protected by a linen and muslin blind and by two towels the sky
moreover was somewhat less bright the result was the same as before
excepting that everything occurred rather slower the seedlings which
had been previously kept in darkness were not in the least curved after
54 m but were so after 70 m those which had previously been
illuminated were not at all affected until 130 m had elapsed and then
only slightly after 145 m some of the seedlings in this latter pot
were certainly curved towards the light and there was now a plain
difference between the two pots after 3 h 45 m the chords of the
arcs of 3 seedlings in each pot were measured and the mean angle from
the perpendicular was 16 for those in the pot which had previously
been kept in darkness and only 5 for those which had previously been
illuminated
the curvature of the cotyledons of phalaris towards a lateral light is
therefore certainly influenced by the
degree to which they have been previously illuminated we shall
presently see that the influence of light on their bending continues
for a short time after the light has been extinguished these facts as
well as that of the curvature not increasing or decreasing in nearly
the same ratio with that of the amount of light which they receive as
shown in the trials with the plants before the lamp all indicate that
light acts on them as a stimulus in somewhat the same manner as on the
nervous system of animals and not in a direct manner on the cells or
cellwalls which by their contraction or expansion cause the curvature
it has already been incidentally shown how slowly the cotyledons of
phalaris bend towards a very dim light but when they were placed
before a bright paraffin lamp their tips were all curved rectangularly
towards it in 2 h 20 m the hypocotyls of solanum lycopersicum had
bent in the morning at right angles towards a northeast window at 1
pm oct 21st the pot was turned round so that the seedlings now
pointed from the light but by 5 pm they had reversed their curvature
and again pointed to the light they had thus passed through 180 in 4
h having in the morning previously passed through about 90 but the
reversal of the first half of the curvature will have been aided by
apogeotropism similar cases were observed with other seedlings for
instance with those of sinapis alba
we attempted to ascertain in how short a time light acted on the
cotyledons of phalaris but this was difficult on account of their
rapid circumnutating movement moreover they differ much in
sensibility according to age nevertheless some of our observations
are worth giving pots with seedlings were
placed under a microscope provided with an eyepiece micrometer of
which each division equalled 1500th of an inch 0051 mm and they
were at first illuminated by light from a paraffin lamp passing through
a solution of bichromate of potassium which does not induce
heliotropism thus the direction in which the cotyledons were
circumnutating could be observed independently of any action from the
light and they could be made by turning round the pots to
circumnutate transversely to the line in which the light would strike
them as soon as the solution was removed the fact that the direction
of the circumnutating movement might change at any moment and thus the
plant might bend either towards or from the lamp independently of the
action of the light gave an element of uncertainty to the results
after the solution had been removed five seedlings which were
circumnutating transversely to the line of light began to move towards
it in 6 4 7 6 and 9 minutes in one of these cases the apex of
the cotyledon crossed five of the divisions of the micrometer ie
1100th of an inch or 0254 mm towards the light in 3 m of two
seedlings which were moving directly from the light at the time when
the solution was removed one began to move towards it in 13 m and
the other in 15 m this latter seedling was observed for more than an
hour and continued to move towards the light it crossed at one time 5
divisions of the micrometer 0254 mm in 2 m 30 s in all these
cases the movement towards the light was extremely unequal in rate
and the cotyledons often remained almost stationary for some minutes
and two of them retrograded a little another seedling which was
circumnutating transversely to the line of light moved towards it in 4
m after the solution was removed it then remained
almost stationary for 10 m then crossed 5 divisions of the micrometer
in 6 m and then 8 divisions in 11m this unequal rate of movement
interrupted by pauses and at first with occasional retrogressions
accords well with our conclusion that heliotropism consists of modified
circumnutation
in order to observe how long the aftereffects of light lasted a pot
with seedlings of phalaris which had germinated in darkness was
placed at 1040 am before a northeast window being protected on all
other sides from the light and the movement of a cotyledon was traced
on a horizontal glass it circumnutated about the same space for the
first 24 m and during the next 1 h 33 m moved rapidly towards the
light the light was now ie after 1 h 57 m completely excluded
but the cotyledon continued bending in the same direction as before
certainly for more than 15 m probably for about 27 m the doubt arose
from the necessity of not looking at the seedlings often and thus
exposing them though momentarily to the light this same seedling was
now kept in the dark until 218 pm by which time it had reacquired
through apogeotropism its original upright position when it was again
exposed to the light from a clouded sky by 3 pm it had moved a very
short distance towards the light but during the next 45 m travelled
quickly towards it after this exposure of 1 h 27 m to a rather dull
sky the light was again completely excluded but the cotyledon
continued to bend in the same direction as before for 14 m within a
very small limit of error it was then placed in the dark and it now
moved backwards so that after 1 h 7 m it stood close to where it had
started from at 218 pm these observations show that the cotyledons
of phalaris after being exposed to a lateral
light continue to bend in the same direction for between a quarter and
half an hour
in the two experiments just given the cotyledons moved backwards or
from the window shortly after being subjected to darkness and whilst
tracing the circumnutation of various kinds of seedlings exposed to a
lateral light we repeatedly observed that late in the evening as the
light waned they moved from it this fact is shown in some of the
diagrams given in the last chapter we wished therefore to learn
whether this was wholly due to apogeotropism or whether an organ after
bending towards the light tended from any other cause to bend from it
as soon as the light failed accordingly two pots of seedling phalaris
and one pot of seedling brassica were exposed for 8 h before a
paraffin lamp by which time the cotyledons of the former and the
hypocotyls of the latter were bent rectangularly towards the light the
pots were now quickly laid horizontally so that the upper parts of the
cotyledons and of the hypocotyls of 9 seedlings projected vertically
upwards as proved by a plumbline in this position they could not be
acted on by apogeotropism and if they possessed any tendency to
straighten themselves or to bend in opposition to their former
heliotropic curvature this would be exhibited for it would be opposed
at first very slightly by apogeotropism they were kept in the dark for
4 h during which time they were twice looked at but no uniform
bending in opposition to their former heliotropic curvature could be
detected we have said uniform bending because they circumnutated in
their new position and after 2 h were inclined in different
directions between 4 and 11 from the perpendicular their
directions were also changed after two additional hours and again on
the following morning we may
therefore conclude that the bending back of plants from a light when
this becomes obscure or is extinguished is wholly due to
apogeotropism5
 5 it appears from a reference in wiesner die undulirende nutation
 der internodien p 7 that h mller of thurgau found that a stem
 which is bending heliotropically is at the same time striving through
 apogeotropism to raise itself into a vertical position
in our various experiments we were often struck with the accuracy with
which seedlings pointed to a light although of small size to test
this many seedlings of phalaris which had germinated in darkness in a
very narrow box several feet in length were placed in a darkened room
near to and in front of a lamp having a small cylindrical wick the
cotyledons at the two ends and in the central part of the box would
therefore have to bend in widely different directions in order to point
to the light after they had become rectangularly bent a long white
thread was stretched by two persons close over and parallel first to
one and then to another cotyledon and the thread was found in almost
every case actually to intersect the small circular wick of the now
extinguished lamp the deviation from accuracy never exceeded as far
as we could judge a degree or two this extreme accuracy seems at
first surprising but is not really so for an upright cylindrical
stem whatever its position may be with respect to the light would
have exactly half its circumference illuminated and half in shadow and
as the difference in illumination of the two sides is the exciting
cause of heliotropism a cylinder would naturally bend with much
accuracy towards the light the cotyledons however of phalaris are
not cylindrical but oval in section and the longer axis was to the
shorter axis in the one which was measured as 100 to 70
nevertheless no difference could be
detected in the accuracy of their bending whether they stood with
their broad or narrow sides facing the light or in any intermediate
position and so it was with the cotyledons of avena sativa which are
likewise oval in section now a little reflection will show that in
whatever position the cotyledons may stand there will be a line of
greatest illumination exactly fronting the light and on each side of
this line an equal amount of light will be received but if the oval
stands obliquely with respect to the light this will be diffused over
a wider surface on one side of the central line than on the other we
may therefore infer that the same amount of light whether diffused
over a wider surface or concentrated on a smaller surface produces
exactly the same effect for the cotyledons in the long narrow box
stood in all sorts of positions with reference to the light yet all
pointed truly towards it
that the bending of the cotyledons to the light depends on the
illumination of one whole side or on the obscuration of the whole
opposite side and not on a narrow longitudinal zone in the line of the
light being affected was shown by the effects of painting
longitudinally with indian ink one side of five cotyledons of phalaris
these were then placed on a table near to a southwest window and the
painted half was directed either to the right or left the result was
that instead of bending in a direct line towards the window they were
deflected from the window and towards the unpainted side by the
following angles 35 83 31 43 and 39 it should be remarked
that it was hardly possible to paint onehalf accurately or to place
all the seedlings which are oval in section in quite the same position
relatively to the light and this will account for the differences in
the angles five
cotyledons of avena were also painted in the same manner but with
greater care and they were laterally deflected from the line of the
window towards the unpainted side by the following angles 44 44
55 51 and 57 this deflection of the cotyledons from the window is
intelligible for the whole unpainted side must have received some
light whereas the opposite and painted side received none but a
narrow zone on the unpainted side directly in front of the window will
have received most light and all the hinder parts half an oval in
section less and less light in varying degrees and we may conclude
that the angle of deflection is the resultant of the action of the
light over the whole of the unpainted side
it should have been premised that painting with indian ink does not
injure plants at least within several hours and it could injure them
only by stopping respiration to ascertain whether injury was thus soon
caused the upper halves of 8 cotyledons of avena were thickly coated
with transparent matter4 with gum and 4 with gelatine they were
placed in the morning before a window and by the evening they were
normally bowed towards the light although the coatings now consisted
of dry crusts of gum and gelatine moreover if the seedlings which
were painted longitudinally with indian ink had been injured on the
painted side the opposite side would have gone on growing and they
would consequently have become bowed towards the painted side whereas
the curvature was always as we have seen in the opposite direction
or towards the unpainted side which was exposed to the light we
witnessed the effects of injuring longitudinally one side of the
cotyledons of avena and phalaris for before we knew that grease was
highly injurious to them several were painted down one side
with a mixture of oil and lampblack and were then exposed before a
window others similarly treated were afterwards tried in darkness
these cotyledons soon became plainly bowed towards the blackened side
evidently owing to the grease on this side having checked their growth
whilst growth continued on the opposite side but it deserves notice
that the curvature differed from that caused by light which ultimately
becomes abrupt near the ground these seedlings did not afterwards die
but were much injured and grew badly
localised sensitiveness to light and its transmitted effects
phalaris canariensiswhilst observing the accuracy with which the
cotyledons of this plant became bent towards the light of a small lamp
we were impressed with the idea that the uppermost part determined the
direction of the curvature of the lower part when the cotyledons are
exposed to a lateral light the upper part bends first and afterwards
the bending gradually extends down to the base and as we shall
presently see even a little beneath the ground this holds good with
cotyledons from less than 1 inch one was observed to act in this
manner which was only 03 in height to about 5 of an inch in height
but when they have grown to nearly an inch in height the basal part
for a length of 15 to 2 of an inch above the ground ceases to bend
as with young cotyledons the lower part goes on bending after the
upper part has become well arched towards a lateral light the apex
would ultimately point to the ground instead of to the light did not
the upper part reverse its curvature and straighten itself as
soon as the upper convex surface of the boweddown portion received
more light than the lower concave surface the position ultimately
assumed by young and upright cotyledons exposed to light entering
obliquely from above through a window is shown in the accompanying
figure fig 181 and here it may be seen that the whole upper part
has become very nearly straight when the cotyledons were exposed
before a bright lamp standing on the same level with them the upper
part which was at first greatly arched towards the light became
straight and strictly parallel with the surface of the soil in the
pots the basal part being now rectangularly bent all this great
amount of curvature together with the subsequent straightening of the
upper part was often effected in a few hours
fig 181 phalaris canariensis cotyledons after exposure in a box open
on one side in front of a southwest window during 8 h curvature
towards the light accurately traced the short horizontal lines show
the level of the ground
after the uppermost part has become bowed a little to the light its
overhanging weight must tend to increase the curvature of the lower
part but any such effect was shown in several ways to be quite
insignificant when little caps of tinfoil hereafter to be described
were placed on the summits of the cotyledons though this must have
added considerably to their weight the rate or amount of bending was
not thus increased but the best evidence was afforded by placing pots
with seedlings of phalaris before a lamp in such a position that the
cotyledons were horizontally extended and projected at right angles to
the line of light in the course of 5 h they were directed towards
the light with their bases bent at right angles and this abrupt
curvature could not have been aided in the least by the weight of the
upper part which acted at right angles to the plane of curvature
it will be shown that when the upper halves of the cotyledons of
phalaris and avena were enclosed in little pipes of tinfoil or of
blackened glass in which case the upper part was mechanically
prevented from bending the lower and unenclosed part did not bend when
exposed to a lateral light and it occurred to us that this fact might
be due not to the exclusion of the light from the upper part but to
some necessity of the bending gradually travelling down the cotyledons
so that unless the upper part first became bent the lower could not
bend however much it might be stimulated it was necessary for our
purpose to ascertain whether this notion was true and it was proved
false for the lower halves of several cotyledons became bowed to the
light although their upper halves were enclosed in little glass tubes
not blackened which prevented as far as we could judge their
bending nevertheless as the part within the tube might possibly bend
a very little fine rigid rods or flat splinters of thin glass were
cemented with shellac to one side of the upper part of 15 cotyledons
and in six cases they were in addition tied on with threads they were
thus forced to remain quite straight the result was that the lower
halves of all became bowed to the light but generally not in so great
a degree as the corresponding part of the free seedlings in the same
pots and this may perhaps be accounted for by some slight degree of
injury having been caused by a considerable surface having been smeared
with shellac it may be added that when the cotyledons of phalaris and
avena are acted on by apogeotropism it is the upper part which begins
first to bend and when this part was rendered rigid in the manner just
described the upward curvature of the basal part was not thus
prevented
to test our belief that the upper part of the cotyledons of phalaris
when exposed to a lateral light regulates the bending of the lower
part many experiments were tried but most of our first attempts
proved useless from various causes not worth specifying seven
cotyledons had their tips cut off for lengths varying between 1 and
16 of an inch and these when left exposed all day to a lateral
light remained upright in another set of 7 cotyledons the tips were
cut off for a length of only about 05 of an inch 127 mm and these
became bowed towards
a lateral light but not nearly so much as the many other seedlings in
the same pots this latter case shows that cutting off the tips does
not by itself injure the plants so seriously as to prevent
heliotropism but we thought at the time that such injury might follow
when a greater length was cut off as in the first set of experiments
therefore no more trials of this kind were made which we now regret
as we afterwards found that when the tips of three cotyledons were cut
off for a length of 2 inch and of four others for lengths of 14
12 1 and 07 inch and they were extended horizontally the
amputation did not interfere in the least with their bending vertically
upwards through the action of apogeotropism like unmutilated
specimens it is therefore extremely improbable that the amputation of
the tips for lengths of from 1 to 14 inch could from the injury thus
caused have prevented the lower part from bending towards the light
we next tried the effects of covering the upper part of the cotyledons
of phalaris with little caps which were impermeable to light the whole
lower part being left fully exposed before a southwest window or a
bright paraffin lamp some of the caps were made of extremely thin
tinfoil blackened within these had the disadvantage of occasionally
though rarely being too heavy especially when twice folded the basal
edges could be pressed into close contact with the cotyledons though
this again required care to prevent injuring them nevertheless any
injury thus caused could be detected by removing the caps and trying
whether the cotyledons were then sensitive to light other caps were
made of tubes of the thinnest glass which when painted black served
well with the one great disadvantage that the lower ends could not be
closed but tubes were used which fitted the cotyledons almost closely
and black paper was placed on the soil round each to check the upward
reflection of light from the soil such tubes were in one respect far
better than caps of tinfoil as it was possible to cover at the same
time some cotyledons with transparent and others with opaque tubes and
thus our experiments could be controlled it should be kept in mind
that young cotyledons were selected for trial and that these when not
interfered with become bowed down to the ground towards the light
we will begin with the glasstubes the summits of nine cotyledons
differing somewhat in height were enclosed for rather less than half
their lengths in uncoloured or transparent
tubes and these were then exposed before a southwest window on a
bright day for 8 h all of them became strongly curved towards the
light in the same degree as the many other free seedlings in the same
pots so that the glasstubes certainly did not prevent the cotyledons
from bending towards the light nineteen other cotyledons were at the
same time similarly enclosed in tubes thickly painted with indian ink
on five of them the paint to our surprise contracted after exposure
to the sunlight and very narrow cracks were formed through which a
little light entered and these five cases were rejected of the
remaining 14 cotyledons the lower halves of which had been fully
exposed to the light for the whole time 7 continued quite straight and
upright 1 was considerably bowed to the light and 6 were slightly
bowed but with the exposed bases of most of them almost or quite
straight it is possible that some light may have been reflected
upwards from the soil and entered the bases of these 7 tubes as the
sun shone brightly though bits of blackened paper had been placed on
the soil round them nevertheless the 7 cotyledons which were slightly
bowed together with the 7 upright ones presented a most remarkable
contrast in appearance with the many other seedlings in the same pots
to which nothing had been done the blackened tubes were then removed
from 10 of these seedlings and they were now exposed before a lamp for
8 h 9 of them became greatly and 1 moderately curved towards the
light proving that the previous absence of any curvature in the basal
part or the presence of only a slight degree of curvature there was
due to the exclusion of light from the upper part
similar observations were made on 12 younger cotyledons with their
upper halves enclosed within glasstubes coated with black varnish and
with their lower halves fully exposed to bright sunshine in these
younger seedlings the sensitive zone seems to extend rather lower down
as was observed on some other occasions for two became almost as much
curved towards the light as the free seedlings and the remaining ten
were slightly curved although the basal part of several of them which
normally becomes more curved than any other part exhibited hardly a
trace of curvature these 12 seedlings taken together differed greatly
in their degree of curvature from all the many other seedlings in the
same pots
better evidence of the efficiency of the blackened tubes was
incidentally afforded by some experiments hereafter to be given
in which the upper halves of 14 cotyledons were enclosed in tubes from
which an extremely narrow stripe of the black varnish had been scraped
off these cleared stripes were not directed towards the window but
obliquely to one side of the room so that only a very little light
could act on the upper halves of the cotyledons these 14 seedlings
remained during eight hours of exposure before a southwest window on a
hazy day quite upright whereas all the other many free seedlings in
the same pots became greatly bowed towards the light
we will now turn to the trials with caps made of very thin tinfoil
these were placed at different times on the summits of 24 cotyledons
and they extended down for a length of between 15 and 2 of an inch
the seedlings were exposed to a lateral light for periods varying
between 6 h 30 m and 7 h 45 m which sufficed to cause all the
other seedlings in the same pots to become almost rectangularly bent
towards the light they varied in height from only 04 to 115 inch
but the greater number were about 75 inch of the 24 cotyledons with
their summits thus protected 3 became much bent but not in the
direction of the light and as they did not straighten themselves
through apogeotropism during the following night either the caps were
too heavy or the plants themselves were in a weak condition and these
three cases may be excluded there are left for consideration 21
cotyledons of these 17 remained all the time quite upright the other
4 became slightly inclined to the light but not in a degree comparable
with that of the many free seedlings in the same pots as the
glasstubes when unpainted did not prevent the cotyledons from
becoming greatly bowed it cannot be supposed that the caps of very
thin tinfoil did so except through the exclusion of the light to
prove that the plants had not been injured the caps were removed from
6 of the upright seedlings and these were exposed before a paraffin
lamp for the same length of time as before and they now all became
greatly curved towards the light
as caps between 15 and 2 of an inch in depth were thus proved to be
highly efficient in preventing the cotyledons from bending towards the
light 8 other cotyledons were protected with caps between only 06 and
12 in depth of these two remained vertical one was considerably and
five slightly curved towards the light but far less so than the free
seedlings in the same pots
another trial was made in a different manner namely by bandaging with
strips of tinfoil about 2 in breadth the upper part but not the
actual summit of eight moderately young seedlings a little over half
an inch in height the summits and the basal parts were thus left fully
exposed to a lateral light during 8 h an upper intermediate zone
being protected with four of these seedlings the summits were exposed
for a length of 05 inch and in two of them this part became curved
towards the light but the whole lower part remained quite upright
whereas the entire length of the other two seedlings became slightly
curved towards the light the summits of the four other seedlings were
exposed for a length of 04 inch and of these one remained almost
upright whilst the other three became considerably curved towards the
light the many free seedlings in the same pots were all greatly curved
towards the light
from these several sets of experiments including those with the
glasstubes and those when the tips were cut off we may infer that
the exclusion of light from the upper part of the cotyledons of
phalaris prevents the lower part though fully exposed to a lateral
light from becoming curved the summit for a length of 04 or 05 of
an inch though it is itself sensitive and curves towards the light
has only a slight power of causing the lower part to bend nor has the
exclusion of light from the summit for a length of 1 of an inch a
strong influence on the curvature of the lower part on the other hand
an exclusion for a length of between 15 and 2 of an inch or of the
whole upper half plainly prevents the lower and fully illuminated part
from becoming curved in the manner see fig 181 which invariably
occurs when a free cotyledon is exposed to a lateral light with very
young seedlings the sensitive zone seems to extend rather lower down
relatively to their height than in older seedlings we must therefore
conclude that when seedlings are freely exposed to a lateral light some
influence is transmitted from the upper to the lower part causing the
latter to bend
this conclusion is supported by what may be seen to occur on a small
scale especially with young cotyledons without any artificial
exclusion of the light for they bend beneath the earth where no light
can enter seeds of phalaris were covered with a layer onefourth of an
inch in thickness of very fine sand consisting of extremely minute
grains of silex coated with
oxide of iron a layer of this sand moistened to the same degree as
that over the seeds was spread over a glassplate and when the layer
was 05 of an inch in thickness carefully measured no light from a
bright sky could be seen to pass through it unless it was viewed
through a long blackened tube and then a trace of light could be
detected but probably much too little to affect any plant a layer 1
of an inch in thickness was quite impermeable to light as judged by
the eye aided by the tube it may be worth adding that the layer when
dried remained equally impermeable to light this sand yielded to very
slight pressure whilst kept moist and in this state did not contract
or crack in the least in a first trial cotyledons which had grown to
a moderate height were exposed for 8 h before a paraffin lamp and
they became greatly bowed at their bases on the shaded side opposite
to the light welldefined crescentic open furrows were formed which
measured under a microscope with a micrometer were from 02 to 03 of
an inch in breadth and these had evidently been left by the bending of
the buried bases of the cotyledons towards the light on the side of
the light the cotyledons were in close contact with the sand which was
a very little heaped up by removing with a sharp knife the sand on one
side of the cotyledons in the line of the light the bent portion and
the open furrows were found to extend down to a depth of about 1 of an
inch where no light could enter the chords of the short buried arcs
formed in four cases angles of 11 13 15 and 18 with the
perpendicular by the following morning these short bowed portions had
straightened themselves through apogeotropism
in the next trial much younger cotyledons were similarly treated but
were exposed to a rather obscure lateral light after some hours a
bowed cotyledon 3 inch in height had an open furrow on the shaded
side 04 inch in breadth another cotyledon only 13 inch in height
had left a furrow 02 inch in breadth but the most curious case was
that of a cotyledon which had just protruded above the ground and was
only 03 inch in height and this was found to be bowed in the
direction of the light to a depth of 2 of an inch beneath the surface
from what we know of the impermeability of this sand to light the
upper illuminated part in these several cases must have determined the
curvature of the lower buried portions but an apparent cause of doubt
may be suggested as the cotyledons are continually circumnutating
they tend to form a minute
crack or furrow all round their bases which would admit a little light
on all sides but this would not happen when they were illuminated
laterally for we know that they quickly bend towards a lateral light
and they then press so firmly against the sand on the illuminated side
as to furrow it and this would effectually exclude light on this side
any light admitted on the opposite and shaded side where an open
furrow is formed would tend to counteract the curvature towards the
lamp or other source of the light it may be added that the use of
fine moist sand which yields easily to pressure was indispensable in
the above experiments for seedlings raised in common soil not kept
especially damp and exposed for 9 h 30 m to a strong lateral light
did not form an open furrow at their bases on the shaded side and were
not bowed beneath the surface
perhaps the most striking proof of the action of the upper on the lower
part of the cotyledons of phalaris when laterally illuminated was
afforded by the blackened glasstubes before alluded to with very
narrow stripes of the varnish scraped off on one side through which a
little light was admitted the breadth of these stripes or slits varied
between 01 and 02 inch 25 and 51 mm cotyledons with their upper
halves enclosed in such tubes were placed before a southwest window
in such a position that the scraped stripes did not directly face the
window but obliquely to one side the seedlings were left exposed for
8 h before the close of which time the many free seedlings in the
same pots had become greatly bowed towards the window under these
circumstances the whole lower halves of the cotyledons which had
their summits enclosed in the tubes were fully exposed to the light of
the sky whilst their upper halves received exclusively or chiefly
diffused light from the room and this only through a very narrow slit
on one side now if the curvature of the lower part had been
determined by the illumination of this part all the cotyledons
assuredly would have become curved towards the window but this was far
from being the case tubes of the kind just described were placed on
several occasions over the upper halves of 27 cotyledons 14 of them
remained all the time quite vertical so that sufficient diffused light
did not enter through the narrow slits to produce any effect whatever
and they behaved in the same manner as if their upper halves had been
enclosed in completely blackened tubes the lower halves of the 13
other cotyledons became bowed
not directly in the line of the window but obliquely towards it one
pointed at an angle of only 18 but the remaining 12 at angles varying
between 45 and 62 from the line of the window at the commencement of
the experiment pins had been laid on the earth in the direction
towards which the slits in the varnish faced and in this direction
alone a small amount of diffused light entered at the close of the
experiment 7 of the bowed cotyledons pointed exactly in the line of
the pins and 6 of them in a line between that of the pins and that of
the window this intermediate position is intelligible for any light
from the sky which entered obliquely through the slits would be much
more efficient than the diffused light which entered directly through
them after the 8 h exposure the contrast in appearance between these
13 cotyledons and the many other seedlings in the same pots which were
all excepting the above 14 vertical ones greatly bowed in straight
and parallel lines towards the window was extremely remarkable it is
therefore certain that a little weak light striking the upper halves of
the cotyledons of phalaris is far more potent in determining the
direction of the curvature of the lower halves than the full
illumination of the latter during the whole time of exposure
in confirmation of the above results the effect of thickly painting
with indian ink one side of the upper part of three cotyledons of
phalaris for a length of 2 inch from their tips may be worth giving
these were placed so that the unpainted surface was directed not
towards the window but a little to one side and they all became bent
towards the unpainted side and from the line of the window by angles
amounting to 31 35 and 83 the curvature in this direction
extended down to their bases although the whole lower part was fully
exposed to the light from the window
finally although there can be no doubt that the illumination of the
upper part of the cotyledons of phalaris greatly affects the power and
manner of bending of the lower part yet some observations seemed to
render it probable that the simultaneous stimulation of the lower part
by light greatly favours or is almost necessary for its wellmarked
curvature but our experiments were not conclusive owing to the
difficulty of excluding light from the lower halves without
mechanically preventing their curvature
avena sativathe cotyledons of this plant become quickly bowed towards
a lateral light exactly like those of phalaris
experiments similar to the foregoing ones were tried and we will give
the results as briefly as possible they are somewhat less conclusive
than in the case of phalaris and this may possibly be accounted for by
the sensitive zone varying in extension in a species so long
cultivated and variable as the common oat cotyledons a little under
threequarters of an inch in height were selected for trial six had
their summits protected from light by tinfoil caps 25 inch in depth
and two others by caps 3 inch in depth of these 8 cotyledons five
remained upright during 8 hours of exposure although their lower parts
were fully exposed to the light all the time two were very slightly
and one considerably bowed towards it caps only 2 or 22 inch in
depth were placed over 4 other cotyledons and now only one remained
upright one was slightly and two considerably bowed to the light in
this and the following cases all the free seedlings in the same pots
became greatly bowed to the light
our next trial was made with short lengths of thin and fairly
transparent quills for glasstubes of sufficient diameter to go over
the cotyledons would have been too heavy firstly the summits of 13
cotyledons were enclosed in unpainted quills and of these 11 became
greatly and 2 slightly bowed to the light so that the mere act of
enclosure did not prevent the lower part from becoming bowed secondly
the summits of 11 cotyledons were enclosed in quills 3 inch in length
painted so as to be impermeable to light of these 7 did not become at
all inclined towards the light but 3 of them were slightly bent more
or less transversely with respect to the line of light and these might
perhaps have been altogether excluded one alone was slightly bowed
towards the light painted quills 25 inch in length were placed over
the summits of 4 other cotyledons of these one alone remained
upright a second was slightly bowed and the two others as much bowed
to the light as the free seedlings in the same pots these two latter
cases considering that the caps were 25 in length are inexplicable
lastly the summits of 8 cotyledons were coated with flexible and
highly transparent goldbeaters skin and all became as much bowed to
the light as the free seedlings the summits of 9 other cotyledons were
similarly coated with goldbeaters skin which was then painted to a
depth of between 25 and 3 inch so as to be impermeable to light of
these 5 remained upright and 4 were well bowed to the light almost or
quite as well as
the free seedlings these latter four cases as well as the two in the
last paragraph offer a strong exception to the rule that the
illumination of the upper part determines the curvature of the lower
part nevertheless 5 of these 8 cotyledons remained quite upright
although their lower halves were fully illuminated all the time and it
would almost be a prodigy to find five free seedlings standing
vertically after an exposure for several hours to a lateral light
the cotyledons of avena like those of phalaris when growing in soft
damp fine sand leave an open crescentric furrow on the shaded side
after bending to a lateral light and they become bowed beneath the
surface at a depth to which as we know light cannot penetrate the
arcs of the chords of the buried bowed portions formed in two cases
angles of 20 and 21 with the perpendicular the open furrows on the
shaded side were in four cases 008 016 024 and 024 of an inch
in breadth brassica oleracea common redit will here be shown that
the upper half of the hypocotyl of the cabbage when illuminated by a
lateral light determines the curvature of the lower half it is
necessary to experimentise on young seedlings about half an inch or
rather less in height for when grown to an inch and upwards the basal
part ceases to bend we first tried painting the hypocotyls with indian
ink or cutting off their summits for various lengths but these
experiments are not worth giving though they confirm as far as they
can be trusted the results of the following ones these were made by
folding goldbeaters skin once round the upper halves of young
hypocotyls and painting it thickly with indian ink or with black
grease as a control experiment the same transparent skin left
unpainted was folded round the upper halves of 12 hypocotyls and
these all became greatly curved to the light excepting one which was
only moderately curved twenty other young hypocotyls had the skin
round their upper halves painted whilst their lower halves were left
quite uncovered these seedlings were then exposed generally for
between 7 and 8 h in a box blackened within and open in front either
before a southwest window or a paraffin lamp this exposure was amply
sufficient as was shown by the stronglymarked heliotropism of all the
free seedlings in the same pots nevertheless some were left exposed
to the light for a much longer time of the 20 hypocotyls thus treated
14 remained quite upright and 6 became slightly bowed to the light
but 2 of these latter cases were not really
exceptions for on removing the skin the paint was found imperfect and
was penetrated by many small transparent spaces on the side which faced
the light moreover in two other cases the painted skin did not extend
quite halfway down the hypocotyl although there was a wonderful
contrast in the several pots between these 20 hypocotyls and the other
many free seedlings which were all greatly bowed down to their bases
in the direction of the light some being almost prostrate on the
ground
the most successful trial on any one day included in the above
results is worth describing in detail six young seedlings were
selected the hypocotyls of which were nearly 45 inch excepting one
which was 6 inch in height measured from the bases of their petioles
to the ground their upper halves judged as accurately as could be
done by the eye were folded once round with goldbeaters skin and
this was painted thickly with indian ink they were exposed in an
otherwise darkened room before a bright paraffin lamp which stood on a
level with the two pots containing the seedlings they were first
looked at after an interval of 5 h 10 m and five of the protected
hypocotyls were found quite erect the sixth being very slightly
inclined to the light whereas all the many free seedlings in the same
two pots were greatly bowed to the light they were again examined
after a continuous exposure to the light of 20 h 35m and now the
contrast between the two sets was wonderfully great for the free
seedlings had their hypocotyls extended almost horizontally in the
direction of the light and were curved down to the ground whilst
those with the upper halves protected by the painted skin but with
their lower halves fully exposed to the light still remained quite
upright with the exception of the one which retained the same slight
inclination to the light which it had before this latter seedling was
found to have been rather badly painted for on the side facing the
light the red colour of the hypocotyl could be distinguished through
the paint
we next tried nine older seedlings the hypocotyls of which varied
between 1 and 16 inch in height the goldbeaters skin round their
upper parts was painted with black grease to a depth of only 3 inch
that is from less than a third to a fourth or fifth of their total
heights they were exposed to the light for 7 h 15 m and the result
showed that the whole of the sensitive zone which determines the
curvature of the lower
part was not protected from the action of the light for all 9 became
curved towards it 4 of them very slightly 3 moderately and 2 almost
as much as the unprotected seedlings nevertheless the whole 9 taken
together differed plainly in their degree of curvature from the many
free seedlings and from some which were wrapped in unpainted skin
growing in the same two pots
seeds were covered with about a quarter of an inch of the fine sand
described under phalaris and when the hypocotyls had grown to a height
of between 4 and 55 inch they were exposed during 9 h before a
paraffin lamp their bases being at first closely surrounded by the
damp sand they all became bowed down to the ground so that their
upper parts lay near to and almost parallel to the surface of the soil
on the side of the light their bases were in close contact with the
sand which was here a very little heaped up on the opposite or shaded
side there were open crescentic cracks or furrows rather above 01 of
an inch in width but they were not so sharp and regular as those made
by phalaris and avena and therefore could not be so easily measured
under the microscope the hypocotyls were found when the sand was
removed on one side to be curved to a depth beneath the surface in
three cases of at least 1 inch in a fourth case of 11 and in a
fifth of 15 inch the chords of the arcs of the short buried bowed
portions formed angles of between 11 and 15 with the perpendicular
from what we have seen of the impermeability of this sand to light the
curvature of the hypocotyls certainly extended down to a depth where no
light could enter and the curvature must have been caused by an
influence transmitted from the upper illuminated part
the lower halves of five young hypocotyls were surrounded by unpainted
goldbeaters skin and these after an exposure of 8 h before a
paraffin lamp all became as much bowed to the light as the free
seedlings the lower halves of 10 other young hypocotyls similarly
surrounded with the skin were thickly painted with indian ink their
upper and unprotected halves became well curved to the light but their
lower and protected halves remained vertical in all the cases excepting
one and on this the layer of paint was imperfect this result seems to
prove that the influence transmitted from the upper part is not
sufficient to cause the lower part to bend unless it be at the same
time illuminated but there remains the doubt as in
the case of phalaris whether the skin covered with a rather thick
crust of dry indian ink did not mechanically prevent their curvature
beta vulgarisa few analogous experiments were tried on this plant
which is not very well adapted for the purpose as the basal part of
the hypocotyl after it has grown to above half an inch in height does
not bend much on exposure to a lateral light four hypocotyls were
surrounded close beneath their petioles with strips of thin tinfoil
2 inch in breadth and they remained upright all day before a paraffin
lamp two others were surrounded with strips 15 inch in breadth and
one of these remained upright the other becoming bowed the bandages
in two other cases were only 1 inch in breadth and both of these
hypocotyls became bowed though one only slightly towards the light
the free seedlings in the same pots were all fairly well curved towards
the light and during the following night became nearly upright the
pots were now turned round and placed before a window so that the
opposite sides of the seedlings were exposed to the light towards
which all the unprotected hypocotyls became bent in the course of 7 h
seven out of the 8 seedlings with bandages of tinfoil remained
upright but one which had a bandage only 1 inch in breadth became
curved to the light on another occasion the upper halves of 7
hypocotyls were surrounded with painted goldbeaters skin of these 4
remained upright and 3 became a little curved to the light at the
same time 4 other seedlings surrounded with unpainted skin as well as
the free ones in the same pots all became bowed towards the lamp
before which they had been exposed during 22 hours
radicles of sinapis albathe radicles of some plants are indifferent
as far as curvature is concerned to the action of light whilst others
bend towards and others from it6 whether these movements are of any
service to the plant is very doubtful at least in the case of
subterranean roots they probably result from the radicles being
sensitive to contact moisture and gravitation and as a consequence
to other irritants which are never naturally encountered the radicles
of sinapis alba when immersed in water and exposed to a lateral light
bend from it or are apheliotropic they become bent for a length of
about 4 mm from their tips to ascertain whether this movement
generally occurred 41 radicles which had germinated in damp sawdust
were immersed in water and exposed to a lateral light and they all
with two doubtful exceptions became curved from the light at the same
time the tips of 54 other radicles similarly exposed were just
touched with nitrate of silver they were blackened for a length of
from 05 to 07 mm and probably killed but it should be observed
that this did not check materially if at all the growth of the upper
part for several which were measured increased in the course of only
89 h by 5 to 7 mm in length of the 54 cauterised radicles one case
was doubtful 25 curved themselves from the light in the normal manner
and 28 or more than half were not in the least apheliotropic there
was a considerable difference which we cannot account for in the
results of the experiments tried towards the end of april and in the
middle of september fifteen radicles part of the above 54 were
cauterised at the former period and were exposed to sunshine of which
12 failed to be apheliotropic 2 were still apheliotropic and 1 was
doubtful in september 39 cauterised radicles were exposed to a
northern light being kept at a proper temperature and now 23
continued to be apheliotropic in the normal manner and only 16 failed
to bend from the light looking at the aggregate results at both
periods there can be no doubt that the destruction of the tip for less
than a millimeter in length destroyed in more than half the cases their
power of moving from the light it is probable that if the tips had
been cauterised for the length of a whole millimeter all signs of
apheliotropism would have disappeared it may be suggested that
although the application of caustic does not stop growth yet enough
may be absorbed to destroy the power of movement in the upper part but
this suggestion must be rejected for we have seen and shall again see
that cauterising one side of the tip of various kinds of radicles
actually excites movement the conclusion seems inevitable that
sensitiveness to light resides in the tip of the radicle of sinapis
alba and that the tip when thus stimulated transmits some influence to
the upper part causing it to bend the case in this respect is
parallel with that of the radicles of several plants the tips of which
are sensitive to contact and to other irritants and as will be shown
in the eleventh chapter to gravitation

concluding remarks and summary of chapter
we do not know whether it is a general rule with seedling plants that
the illumination of the upper part determines the curvature of the
lower part but as this occurred in the four species examined by us
belonging to such distinct families as the gramine cruciferae and
chenopodeae it is probably of common occurrence it can hardly fail to
be of service to seedlings by aiding them to find the shortest path
from the buried seed to the light on nearly the same principle that
the eyes of most of the lower crawling animals are seated at the
anterior ends of their bodies it is extremely doubtful whether with
fully developed plants the illumination of one part ever affects the
curvature of another part the summits of 5 young plants of asparagus
officinalis varying in height between 11 and 27 inches and
consisting of several short internodes were covered with caps of
tinfoil from 03 to 035 inch in depth and the lower uncovered parts
became as much curved towards a lateral light as were the free
seedlings in the same pots other seedlings of the same plant had their
summits painted with indian ink with the same negative result pieces
of blackened paper were gummed to the edges and over the blades of some
leaves on young plants of tropaeolum majus and ranunculus ficaria
these were then placed in a box before a window and the petioles of
the protected leaves became curved towards the light as much as those
of the unprotected leaves
the foregoing cases with respect to seedling plants have been fully
described not only because the transmission of any effect from light
is a new physiological fact but because we think it tends to modify
somewhat the current views on heliotropic movements until
lately such movements were believed to result simply from increased
growth on the shaded side at present it is commonly admitted7 that
diminished light increases the turgescence of the cells or the
extensibility of the cellwalls or of both together on the shaded
side and that this is followed by increased growth but pfeffer has
shown that a difference in the turgescence on the two sides of a
pulvinusthat is an aggregate of small cells which have ceased to
grow at an early ageis excited by a difference in the amount of light
received by the two sides and that movement is thus caused without
being followed by increased growth on the more turgescent side8 all
observers apparently believe that light acts directly on the part which
bends but we have seen with the above described seedlings that this is
not the case their lower halves were brightly illuminated for hours
and yet did not bend in the least towards the light though this is the
part which under ordinary circumstances bends the most it is a still
more striking fact that the faint illumination of a narrow stripe on
one side of the upper part of the cotyledons of phalaris determined the
direction of the curvature of the lower part so that this latter part
did not bend towards the bright light by which it had been fully
illuminated
but obliquely towards one side where only a little light entered these
results seem to imply the presence of some matter in the upper part
which is acted on by light and which transmits its effects to the
lower part it has been shown that this transmission is independent of
the bending of the upper sensitive part we have an analogous case of
transmission in drosera for when a gland is irritated the basal and
not the upper or intermediate part of the tentacle bends the flexible
and sensitive filament of dionaea likewise transmits a stimulus
without itself bending as does the stem of mimosa

 pulvini of the leaflets of compound leaves play in placing the
 leaflets in a proper position with respect to the light this holds
 good especially with the leaves of climbing plants which are carried
 into all sorts of positions illadapted for the action of the light
light exerts a powerful influence on most vegetable tissues and there
can be no doubt that it generally tends to check their growth but when
the two sides of a plant are illuminated in a slightly different
degree it does not necessarily follow that the bending towards the
illuminated side is caused by changes in the tissues of the same nature
as those which lead to increased growth in darkness we know at least
that a part may bend from the light and yet its growth may not be
favoured by light this is the case with the radicles of sinapis alba
which are plainly apheliotropic nevertheless they grow quicker in
darkness than in light9 so it is with many arial roots according
to wiesner10 but there are other opposed cases it appears
therefore that light does not determine the growth of apheliotropic
parts in any uniform manner

we should bear in mind that the power of bending to the light is highly
beneficial to most plants there
is therefore no improbability in this power having been specially
acquired in several respects light seems to act on plants in nearly
the same manner as it does on animals by means of the nervous
system11 with seedlings the effect as we have just seen is
transmitted from one part to another an animal may be excited to move
by a very small amount of light and it has been shown that a
difference in the illumination of the two sides of the cotyledons of
phalaris which could not be distinguished by the human eye sufficed
to cause them to bend it has also been shown that there is no close
parallelism between the amount of light which acts on a plant and its
degree of curvature it was indeed hardly possible to perceive any
difference in the curvature of some seedlings of phalaris exposed to a
light which though dim was very much brighter than that to which
others had been exposed the retina after being stimulated by a bright
light feels the effect for some time and phalaris continued to bend
for nearly half an hour towards the side which had been illuminated
the retina cannot perceive a dim light after it has been exposed to a
bright one and plants which had been kept in the daylight during the
previous day and morning did not move so soon towards an obscure
lateral light as did others which had been kept in complete darkness
 11 sachs has made some striking remarks to the same effect with
 respect to the various stimuli which excite movement in plants see
 his paper ueber orthotrope und plagiotrope pflanzentheile arb des
 bot inst in wrzburg 1879 b ii p 282
even if light does act in such a manner on the growing parts of plants
as always to excite in them a tendency to bend towards the more
illuminated sidea supposition contradicted by the foregoing
experiments on seedlings and by all apheliotropic
organsyet the tendency differs greatly in different species and is
variable in degree in the individuals of the same species as may be
seen in almost any pot of seedlings of a long cultivated plant12
there is therefore a basis for the modification of this tendency to
almost any beneficial extent that it has been modified we see in many
cases thus it is of more importance for insectivorous plants to place
their leaves in the best position for catching insects than to turn
their leaves to the light and they have no such power if the stems of
twining plants were to bend towards the light they would often be
drawn away from their supports and as we have seen they do not thus
bend as the stems of most other plants are heliotropic we may feel
almost sure that twining plants which are distributed throughout the
whole vascular series have lost a power that their nonclimbing
progenitors possessed moreover with ipoma and probably all other
twiners the stem of the young plant before it begins to twine is
highly heliotropic evidently in order to expose the cotyledons or the
first true leaves fully to the light with the ivy the stems of
seedlings are moderately heliotropic whilst those of the same plants
when grown a little older
are apheliotropic some tendrils which consist of modified
leavesorgans in all ordinary cases strongly diaheliotropichave been
rendered apheliotropic and their tips crawl into any dark crevice
 12 strasburger has shown in his interesting work wirkung des
 lichtesauf schwrmsporen 1878 that the movement of the
 swarmspores of various lowly organised plants to a lateral light is
 influenced by their stage of development by the temperature to which
 they are subjected by the degree of illumination under which they
 have been raised and by other unknown causes so that the
 swarmspores of the same species may move across the field of the
 microscope either to or from the light some individuals moreover
 appear to be indifferent to the light and those of different species
 behave very differently the brighter the light the straighter is
 their course they exhibit also for a short time the aftereffects of
 light in all these respects they resemble the higher plants see

 bewegungserscheinungen der schwrmsporen verh d physmed
 geselsshalft in wrzburg b xii 1878
even in the case of ordinary heliotropic movements it is hardly
credible that they result directly from the action of the light
without any special adaptation we may illustrate what we mean by the
hygroscopic movements of plants if the tissues on one side of an organ
permit of rapid evaporation they will dry quickly and contract
causing the part to bend to this side now the wonderfully complex
movements of the pollinia of orchis pyramidalis by which they clasp
the proboscis of a moth and afterwards change their position for the
sake of depositing the pollenmasses on the double stigmaor again the
twisting movements by which certain seeds bury themselves in the
ground13follow from the manner of drying of the parts in question
yet no one will suppose that these results have been gained without
special adaptation similarly we are led to believe in adaptation when
we see the hypocotyl of a seedling which contains chlorophyll bending
to the light for although it thus receives less light being now
shaded by its own cotyledons it places themthe more important
organsin the best position to be fully illuminated the hypocotyl may
therefore be said to sacrifice itself for the good of the cotyledons
or rather of the whole plant but if it be prevented from bending as
must sometimes occur with seedlings springing up in an entangled mass
of vegetation the cotyledons themselves bend so as to face the light
the one farthest off rising
up and that nearest to the light sinking down or both twisting
laterally14 we may also suspect that the extreme sensitiveness to
light of the upper part of the sheathlike cotyledons of the gramine
and their power of transmitting its effects to the lower part are
specialised arrangements for finding the shortest path to the light
with plants growing on a bank or thrown prostrate by the wind the
manner in which the leaves move even rotating on their own axes so
that their upper surfaces may be again directed to the light is a
striking phenomenon such facts are rendered more striking when we
remember that too intense a light injures the chlorophyll and that the
leaflets of several leguminosae when thus exposed bend upwards and
present their edges to the sun thus escaping injury on the other
hand the leaflets of averrhoa and oxalis when similarly exposed bend
downwards

 to leaves die undulirende nutation der internodien p 6 extracted
 from b lxxvii 1878 sitb der k akad der wissensch wien
it was shown in the last chapter that heliotropism is a modified form
of circumnutation and as every growing part of every plant
circumnutates more or less we can understand how it is that the power
of bending to the light has been acquired by such a multitude of plants
throughout the vegetable kingdom the manner in which a circumnutating
movementthat is one consisting of a succession of irregular ellipses
or loopsis gradually converted into a rectilinear course towards the
light has been already explained first we have a succession of
ellipses with their longer axes directed towards the light each of
which
is described nearer and nearer to its source then the loops are drawn
out into a strongly pronounced zigzag line with here and there a small
loop still formed at the same time that the movement towards the light
is increased in extent and accelerated that in the opposite direction
is lessened and retarded and at last stopped the zigzag movement to
either side is likewise gradually lessened so that finally the course
becomes rectilinear thus under the stimulus of a fairly bright light
there is no useless expenditure of force
as with plants every character is more or less variable there seems to
be no great difficulty in believing that their circumnutating movements
may have been increased or modified in any beneficial manner by the
preservation of varying individuals the inheritance of habitual
movements is a necessary contingent for this process of selection or
the survival of the fittest and we have seen good reason to believe
that habitual movements are inherited by plants in the case of twining
species the circumnutating movements have been increased in amplitude
and rendered more circular the stimulus being here an internal or
innate one with sleeping plants the movements have been increased in
amplitude and often changed in direction and here the stimulus is the
alternation of light and darkness aided however by inheritance in
the case of heliotropism the stimulus is the unequal illumination of
the two sides of the plant and this determines as in the foregoing
cases the modification of the circumnutating movement in such a manner
that the organ bends to the light a plant which has been rendered
heliotropic by the above means might readily lose this tendency
judging from the cases already given as soon as it became useless or
injurious a species which has ceased to be heliotropic might also be
rendered apheliotropic by the preservation of the individuals which
tended to circumnutate though the cause of this and most other
variations is unknown in a direction more or less opposed to that
whence the light proceeded in like manner a plant might be rendered
diaheliotropic

our object in the present chapter is to show that geotropism
apogeotropism and diageotropism are modified forms of circumnutation
extremely fine filaments of glass bearing two minute triangles of
paper were fixed to the summits of young stems frequently to the
hypocotyls of seedlings to flowerpeduncles radicles etc and the
movements of the parts were then traced in the manner already described
on vertical and horizontal glassplates it should be remembered that
as the stems or other parts become more and more oblique with respect
to the glasses the figures traced on them necessarily become more and
more magnified the plants were protected from light excepting whilst
each observation was being made and then the light which was always a
dim one was allowed to enter so as to interfere as little as possible
with the movement in progress and we did not detect any evidence of
such interference
when observing the gradations between
circumnutation and heliotropism we had the great advantage of being
able to lessen the light but with geotropism analogous experiments
were of course impossible we could however observe the movements of
stems placed at first only a little from the perpendicular in which
case geotropism did not act with nearly so much power as when the
stems were horizontal and at right angles to the force plants also
were selected which were but feebly geotropic or apogeotropic or had
become so from having grown rather old another plan was to place the
stems at first so that they pointed 30 or 40 beneath the horizon and
then apogeotropism had a great amount of work to do before the stem was
rendered upright and in this case ordinary circumnutation was often
not wholly obliterated another plan was to observe in the evening
plants which during the day had become greatly curved heliotropically
for their stems under the gradually waning light very slowly became
upright through the action of apogeotropism and in this case modified
circumnutation was sometimes well displayed
apogeotropismplants were selected for observation almost by chance
excepting that they were taken from widely different families if the
stem of a plant which is even moderately sensitive to apogeotropism be
placed horizontally the upper growing part bends quickly upwards so
as to become perpendicular and the line traced by joining the dots
successively made on a glassplate is generally almost straight for
instance a young cytisus fragrans 12 inches in height was placed so
that the stem projected 10 beneath the horizon and its course was
traced during 72 h at first it bent a very little downwards fig
182 owing no doubt to the weight of the stem as this occurred with
most of the other plants observed though as they were of course
circumnutating the short downward lines were often oblique after
threequarters of an hour the stem began to curve upwards quickly
during the first two hours but much more slowly during the afternoon
and night
and on the following day during the second night it fell a little and
circumnutated during the following day but it also moved a short
distance to the right which was caused by a little light having been
accidentally admitted on this side the stem was now inclined 60 above
the horizon and had therefore risen 70 with time allowed it would
probably have become upright and no doubt would have continued
circumnutating the sole remarkable feature in the figure here given is
the straightness of the course pursued the stem however did not move
upwards at an equable rate and it sometimes stood almost or quite
still such periods probably represent attempts to circumnutate in a
direction opposite to apogeotropism
fig 182 cytisus fragrans apogeotropic movement of stem from 10
beneath to 60 above horizon traced on vertical glass from 830 am
march 12th to 1030 pm 13th the subsequent circumnutating movement
is likewise shown up to 645 am on the 15th nocturnal course
represented as usual by a broken line movement not greatly
magnified and tracing reduced to twothirds of original scale
the herbaceous stem of a verbena melindres  laid horizontally rose
in 7 h so much that it could no longer be observed on the vertical
glass which stood in front of the plant the long line which was traced
was almost absolutely straight after the 7 h it still continued to
rise but now circumnutated slightly on the following day it stood
upright and circumnutated regularly as shown in fig 82 given in the
fourth chapter the stems of several other plants which were highly
sensitive to apogeotropism rose up in almost straight lines and
then suddenly began to circumnutate a partially etiolated and somewhat
old hypocotyl of a seedling cabbage 2 34 inches in height was so
sensitive that when placed at an angle of only 23 from the
perpendicular it became vertical in 33 minutes as it could not have
been strongly acted upon by apogeotropism in the above slightly
inclined position we expected that it would have circumnutated or at
least have moved in a zigzag course accordingly dots were made every
3 minutes but when these were joined the line was nearly straight
after this hypocotyl had become upright it still moved onwards for half
an hour in the same general direction but in a zigzag manner during
the succeeding 9 h it circumnutated regularly and described 3 large
ellipses in this case apogeotropism although acting at a very
unfavourable angle quite overcame the ordinary circumnutating
movement
fig 183 beta vulgaris apogeotropic movement of hypocotyl from 19
beneath horizon to a vertical position with subsequent circumnutation
traced on a vertical and on a horizontal glassplate from 828 am
sept 28th to 840 am 29th figure reduced to onethird of original
scale
the hypocotyls of beta vulgaris are highly sensitive to apogeotropism
one was placed so as to project 19 beneath the horizon it fell at
first a very little see fig 183 no doubt owing to its weight but
as it was circumnutating the line was
oblique during the next 3 h 8 m it rose in a nearly straight line
passing through an angle of 109 and then at 123 pm stood
upright it continued for 55 m to move in the same general direction
beyond the perpendicular but in a zigzag course it returned also in a
zigzag line and then circumnutated regularly describing three large
ellipses during the remainder of the day it should be observed that
the ellipses in this figure are exaggerated in size relatively to the
length of the upward straight line owing to the position of the
vertical and horizontal glassplates another and somewhat old
hypocotyl was placed so as to stand at only 31 from the perpendicular
in which position apogeotropism acted on it with little force and its
course accordingly was slightly zigzag
the sheathlike cotyledons of phalaris canariensis are extremely
sensitive to apogeotropism one was placed so as to project 40 beneath
the horizon although it was rather old and 13 inch in height it
became vertical in 4 h 30 m having passed through an angle of 130
in a nearly straight line it then suddenly began to circumnutate in
the ordinary manner the cotyledons of this plant after the first leaf
has begun to protrude are but slightly apogeotropic though they still
continue to circumnutate one at this stage of development was placed
horizontally and did not become upright even after 13 h and its
course was slightly zigzag so again a rather old hypocotyl of cassia
tora 1 14 inch in height required 28 h to become upright and its
course was distinctly zigzag whilst younger hypocotyls moved much more
quickly and in a nearly straight line
when a horizontally placed stem or other organ rises in a zigzag line
we may infer from the many cases given in our previous chapters that
we have a modified form of circumnutation but when the course is
straight there is no evidence of circumnutation and any one might
maintain that this latter movement had been replaced by one of a wholly
distinct kind this view seems the more probable when as sometimes
occurred with the hypocotyls of brassica and beta the stems of
cucurbita and the cotyledons of phalaris the part in question after
bending up in a straight course suddenly begins to circumnutate to the
full extent and in the usual manner a fairly good instance of a sudden
change of this kindthat is from a nearly straight upward movement to
one of circumnutationis shown in fig 183 but more striking instances
were occasionally observed with beta brassica and phalaris
we will now describe a few cases in which it may be
seen how gradually circumnutation becomes changed into apogeotropism
under circumstances to be specified in each instance
rubus idus hybrida young plant 11 inches in height growing in a
pot was placed horizontally and the upward movement was traced during
nearly 70 h but the plant though growing vigorously was not highly
sensitive to apogeotropism or it was not capable of quick movement
for during the above time it rose only 67 we may see in the diagram
fig 184 that during the first day of 12 h it rose in a nearly
straight line when placed horizontally it was evidently
circumnutating for it rose at first a little notwithstanding the
weight of the stem and then sank down so that it did not start on its
permanently upward course until 1 h 25 m had elapsed on the second
day by which time it had risen considerably and when apogeotropism
acted on it with somewhat less power its course during 15 h was
clearly zigzag and the rate of the upward movement was not equable
during the third day also of 15 h when apogeotropism acted on it
with still less power the stem plainly circumnutated for it moved
during this day 3 times up and 3 times down 4 times to the left and 4
to the right but the course was so complex that it could hardly be
traced on the glass we can however see that the successively formed
irregular ellipses rose higher and higher apogeotropism continued to
act on the fourth morning as the stem was still rising though it now
stood only 23 from the perpendicular in this diagram the several
stages may be followed by which an almost rectilinear upward
apogeotropic course first becomes zigzag and then changes into a
circumnutating movement with most of the successively formed
irregular ellipses directed upwards
fig 184 rubus idus hybrid apogeotropic movement of stem traced on
a vertical glass during 3 days and 3 nights from 1040 am march 18th
to 8 am 21st figure reduced to onehalf of the original scale
lilium auratuma plant 23 inches in height was placed
horizontally and the upper part of the stem rose 58 in 46 h in the
manner shown in the accompanying diagram fig 185 we here see that
during the whole of the second day of 15 h the stem plainly
circumnutated whilst bending upwards through apogeotropism it had
still to rise considerably for when the last dot in the figure was
made it stood 32 from an upright position
fig 185 lilium auratum apogeotropic movement of stem traced on a
vertical glass during 2 days and 2 nights from 1040 am march 18th
to 8 am 20th figure reduced to onehalf of the original scale
phalaris canariensisa cotyledon of this plant 13 inch in height
has already been described as rising in 4 h 30 m from 40 beneath the
horizon into a vertical position passing through an angle of 130 in a
nearly straight line and then abruptly beginning to circumnutate
another somewhat old cotyledon of the same height but from which a
true leaf had not yet protruded was similarly placed at 40 beneath
the horizon for the first 4 h it rose in a nearly straight course
fig 186 so that by 110 pm it was highly inclined and now
apogeotropism acted on it with much less power than before and it
began to zigzag at 415 pm ie in 7 h from the commencement it
stood vertically and afterwards continued to circumnutate in the usual
manner about the same spot here then we have a graduated change from a
straight upward apogeotropic course into circumnutation instead of an
abrupt change as in the former case
avena sativathe sheathlike cotyledons whilst young are strongly
apogeotropic and some which were placed at 45 beneath the horizon
rose 90 in 7 or 8 h in lines almost absolutely straight an oldish
cotyledon from which the first leaf began to
protrude whilst the following observations were being made was placed
at 10 beneath the horizon and it rose only 59 in 24h it behaved
rather differently from any other plant observed by us for during the
first 4 h it rose in a line not far from straight during the next 6
h it circumnutated that is it descended and again ascended in a
strongly marked zigzag course it then resumed its upward movement in a
moderately straight line and with time allowed no doubt would have
become upright in this case after the first 4 h ordinary
circumnutation almost completely conquered for a time apogeotropism
fig 186 phalaris canariensis apogeotropic movement of cotyledon
traced on a vertical and horizontal glass from 910 am sept 19th to
9 am 20th figure here reduced to onefifth of original scale
brassica oleraceathe hypocotyls of several young seedlings placed
horizontally rose up vertically in the course of 6 or 7 h in nearly
straight lines a seedling which had grown in darkness to a height of 2
14 inches and was therefore rather old and not highly sensitive was
placed so that the hypocotyl projected at between 30 and 40 beneath
the horizon the upper part alone became curved
upwards and rose during the first 3 h 10 m in a nearly straight line
fig 187 but it was not possible to trace the upward movement on the
vertical glass for the first 1 h 10 m so that the nearly straight
line in the diagram ought to have been much longer during the next 11
h the hypocotyl circumnutated describing irregular figures each of
which rose a little above the one previously formed during the night
and following early morning it continued to rise in a zigzag course so
that apogeotropism was still acting at the close of our observations
after 23 h represented by the highest dot in the diagram the
hypocotyl was still 32 from the perpendicular there can be little
doubt that it would ultimately have become upright by describing an
additional number of irregular ellipses one above the other
fig 187 brassica oleracea apogeotropic movement of hypocotyl traced
on vertical glass from 920 am sept 12th to 830 am 13th the
upper part of the figure is more magnified than the lower part if the
whole course had been traced the straight upright line would have been
much longer figure here reduced to onethird of the original scale
apogeotropism retarded by heliotropismwhen the stem of any plant
bends during the day towards a lateral light the movement is opposed
by apogeotropism but as the light gradually wanes in the evening the
latter power slowly gains the upper hand and draws the stem back into
a vertical position here then we have a good opportunity for observing
how apogeotropism acts when very nearly balanced by an opposing force
for instance the plumule of tropaeolum majus see former fig 175
moved towards the dim evening light in a slightly zigzag line until
645 pm it then returned on its course until
1040 pm during which time it zigzagged and described an ellipse of
considerable size the hypocotyl of brassica oleracea see former fig
173 moved in a straight line to the light until 515 pm and then
from the light making in its backward course a great rectangular bend
and then returned for a short distance towards the former source of the
light no observations were made after 710 pm but during the night
it recovered its vertical position a hypocotyl of cassia tora moved in
the evening in a somewhat zigzag line towards the failing light until 6
pm and was now bowed 20 from the perpendicular it then returned on
its course making before 1030 pm four great nearly rectangular
bends and almost completing an ellipse several other analogous cases
were casually observed and in all of them the apogeotropic movement
could be seen to consist of modified circumnutation
apogeotropic movements effected by the aid of joints or
pulvinimovements of this kind are well known to occur in the
gramine and are effected by means of the thickened bases of their
sheathing leaves the stem within being in this part thinner than
elsewhere1 according to the analogy of all other pulvini such
joints ought to continue circumnutating for a long period after the
adjoining parts have ceased to grow we therefore wished to ascertain
whether this was the case with the gramine for if so the upward
curvature of their stems when extended horizontally or laid prostrate
would be explained in accordance with our viewnamely that
apogeotropism results from modified circumnutation after these joints
have curved upwards they are fixed in their new position by increased
growth along their lower sides
 1 this structure has been recently described by de vries in an
 interesting article ueber die aufrichtung des gelagerten getreides
 in landwirthschaftliche jahrbcher 1880 p 473
lolium perennea young stem 7 inches in height consisting of 3
internodes with the flowerhead not yet protruded was selected for
observation a long and very thin glass filament was cemented
horizontally to the stem close above the second joint 3 inches above
the ground this joint was subsequently proved to be in an active
condition as its lower side swelled much through the action of
apogeotropism in the manner described by de vries after the haulm had
been fastened down for 24 h in a horizontal position the pot was
so placed that the end of the filament stood beneath the 2inch object
glass of a microscope with an eyepiece micrometer each division of
which equalled 1500 of an inch the end of the filament was repeatedly
observed during 6 h and was seen to be in constant movement and it
crossed 5 divisions of the micrometer 1100 inch in 2 h occasionally
it moved forwards by jerks some of which were 11000 inch in length
and then slowly retreated a little afterwards again jerking forwards
these oscillations were exactly like those described under brassica and
dionaea but they occurred only occasionally we may therefore conclude
that this moderately old joint was continually circumnutating on a
small scale
alopecurus pratensisa young plant 11 inches in height with the
flowerhead protruded but with the florets not yet expanded had a
glass filament fixed close above the second joint at a height of only
2 inches above the ground the basal internode 2 inches in length was
cemented to a stick to prevent any possibility of its circumnutating
the extremity of the filament which projected about 50 above the
horizon was often observed during 24 h in the same manner as in the
last case whenever looked at it was always in movement and it
crossed 30 divisions of the micrometer 350 inch in 3 h but it
sometimes moved at a quicker rate for at one time it crossed 5
divisions in 1 h the pot had to be moved occasionally as the end of
the filament travelled beyond the field of vision but as far as we
could judge it followed during the daytime a semicircular course and
it certainly travelled in two different directions at right angles to
one another it sometimes oscillated in the same manner as in the last
species some of the jerks forwards being as much as 11000 of an inch
we may therefore conclude that the joints in this and the last species
of grass long continue to circumnutate so that this movement would be
ready to be converted into an apogeotropic movement whenever the stem
was placed in an inclined or horizontal position
movements of the flowerpeduncles of oxalis carnosa due to
apogeotropism and other forcesthe movements of the main peduncle and
of the three or four subpeduncles which each main peduncle of this
plant bears are extremely complex and are determined by several
distinct causes whilst the flowers are expanded both kinds of
peduncles circumnutate about the same spot as we have seen fig 91
in the fourth chapter but soon after the flowers have begun to wither
the
subpeduncles bend downwards and this is due to epinasty for on two
occasions when pots were laid horizontally the subpeduncles assumed
the same position relatively to the main peduncle as would have been
the case if they had remained upright that is each of them formed
with it an angle of about 40 if they had been acted on by geotropism
or apheliotropism for the plant was illuminated from above they
would have directed themselves to the centre of the earth a main
peduncle was secured to a stick in an upright position and one of the
upright subpeduncles which had been observed circumnutating whilst the
flower was expanded continued to do so for at least 24 h after it had
withered it then began to bend downwards and after 36 h pointed a
little beneath the horizon a new figure was now begun a fig 188
and the subpeduncle was traced descending in a zigzag line from 720
pm on the 19th to 9 am on the 22nd it now pointed almost
perpendicularly downwards and the glass filament had to be removed and
fastened transversely across the base of the young capsule we expected
that the subpeduncle would have been motionless in its new position
but it continued slowly to swing like a pendulum from side to side
that is in a plane at right angles to that in which it had descended
this circumnutating movement was observed from 9 am on 22nd to 9 am
24th as shown at b in the diagram we were not able to observe this
particular subpeduncle any longer but it would certainly have gone on
circumnutating until the capsule was nearly ripe which requires only a
short time and it would then have moved upwards
the upward movement c fig 188 is effected in part by the whole
subpeduncle rising in the same manner as it had previously descended
through epinastynamely at the joint where united to the main
peduncle as this upward movement occurred with plants kept in the dark
and in whatever position the main peduncle was fastened it could not
have been caused by heliotropism or apogeotropism but by hyponasty
besides this movement at the joint there is another of a very
different kind for the subpeduncle becomes upwardly bent in the
middle part if the subpeduncle happens at the time to be inclined
much downwards the upward curvature is so great that the whole forms a
hook the upper end bearing the capsule thus always places itself
upright and as this occurs in darkness and in whatever position the
main peduncle may have been secured
the upward curvature cannot be due to heliotropism or hyponasty but to
apogeotropism
fig 188 oxalis carnosa movements of flowerpeduncle traced on a
vertical glass a epinastic downward movement b circumnutation
whilst depending vertically c subsequent upward movement due to
apogeotropism and hyponasty combined
in order to trace this upward movement a filament was fixed to a
subpeduncle bearing a capsule nearly ripe which was beginning to bend
upwards by the two means just described its course was traced see c
fig 188 during 53 h by which time it had become nearly upright the
course is seen to be strongly zigzag together with some little loops
we may therefore conclude that the movement consists of modified
circumnutation
the several species of oxalis probably profit in the following manner
by their subpeduncles first bending downwards and then upwards they
are known to scatter their seeds by the bursting of the capsule the
walls of which are so extremely thin like silver paper that they
would easily be permeated by rain but as soon as the petals wither
the sepals rise up and enclose the young capsule forming a perfect
roof over it as soon as the subpeduncle has bent itself downwards by
its subsequent upward movement the capsule stands when ripe at a
greater height above the ground by twice the length of the
subpeduncle than it did when dependent and is thus able to scatter
its seeds to a greater distance the sepals which enclose the ovarium
whilst it is young present an additional adaptation by expanding
widely when the seeds are ripe so as not to interfere with their
dispersal in the case of oxalis acetosella the capsules are said
sometimes to bury themselves under loose leaves or moss on the ground
but this cannot occur with those of o carnosa as the woody stem is
too high
oxalis acetosellathe peduncles are furnished with a joint in the
middle so that the lower part answers to the main peduncle
and the upper part to one of the subpeduncles of o carnosa the upper
part bends downwards after the flower has begun to wither and the
whole peduncle then forms a hook that this bending is due to epinasty
we may infer from the case of o carnosa when the pod is nearly ripe
the upper part straightens itself and becomes erect and this is due to
hyponasty or apogeotropism or both combined and not to heliotropism
for it occurred in darkness the short hooked part of the peduncle of
a cleistogamic flower bearing a pod nearly ripe was observed in the
dark during three days the apex of the pod at first pointed
perpendicularly down but in the course of three days rose 90 so that
it now projected horizontally the course during the two latter days is
shown in fig 189 and it may be seen how greatly the peduncle whilst
rising circumnutated the lines of chief movement were at right angles
to the plane of the originally hooked part the tracing was not
continued any longer but after two additional days the peduncle with
its capsule had become straight and stood upright

figure here reduced to onehalf of the original scale
concluding remarks on apogeotropismwhen apogeotropism is rendered by
any means feeble it acts as shown in the several foregoing cases by
increasing the always present circumnutating movement in a direction
opposed to gravity and by diminishing that in the direction of
gravity as well as that to either side the upward movement thus
becomes unequal in rate and is sometimes interrupted by stationary
periods whenever irregular ellipses or loops are still formed their
longer axes are almost always directed in the line of gravity in an
analogous manner as occurred with heliotropic movements in reference to
the light as apogeotropism acts more and more energetically ellipses
or loops cease to be formed and the course becomes at first strongly
and then less and less zigzag and finally rectilinear from this
gradation in the nature of the movement and more especially from all
growing parts which alone except when pulvini are present are acted
on by apogeotropism
continually circumnutating we may conclude that even a rectilinear
course is merely an extremely modified form of circumnutation it is
remarkable that a stem or other organ which is highly sensitive to
apogeotropism and which has bowed itself rapidly upwards in a straight
line is often carried beyond the vertical as if by momentum it then
bends a little backwards to a point round which it finally
circumnutates two instances of this were observed with the hypocotyls
of beta vulgaris one of which is shown in fig 183 and two other
instances with the hypocotyls of brassica this momentumlike movement
probably results from the accumulated effects of apogeotropism for the
sake of observing how long such aftereffects lasted a pot with
seedlings of beta was laid on its side in the dark and the hypocotyls
in 3 h 15 m became highly inclined the pot still in the dark was
then placed upright and the movements of the two hypocotyls were
traced one continued to bend in its former direction now in
opposition to apogeotropism for about 37 m perhaps for 48 m but
after 61 m it moved in an opposite direction the other hypocotyl
continued to move in its former course after being placed upright for
at least 37 m
different species and different parts of the same species are acted on
by apogeotropism in very different degrees young seedlings most of
which circumnutate quickly and largely bend upwards and become
vertical in much less time than do any older plants observed by us but
whether this is due to their greater sensitiveness to apogeotropism or
merely to their greater flexibility we do not know a hypocotyl of beta
traversed an angle of 109 in 3 h 8 m and a cotyledon of phalaris an
angle of 130 in 4 h 30 m on the other hand the stem of a herbaceous
verbena rose 90 in about 24 h that of rubus 67 in 70 h that of
cytisus 70 in 72 h that of a young american oak only 37 in 72 h
the stem of a young cyperus alternifolius rose only 11 in 96 h the
bending being confined to near its base though the sheathlike
cotyledons of phalaris are so extremely sensitive to apogeotropism the
first true leaves which protrude from them exhibited only a trace of
this action two fronds of a fern nephrodium molle both of them young
and one with the tip still inwardly curled were kept in a horizontal
position for 46 h and during this time they rose so little that it
was doubtful whether there was any true apogeotropic movement
the most curious case known to us of a difference in sensitiveness to
gravitation and consequently of movement in different parts of the
same organ is that offered by the petioles of the cotyledons of ipoma
leptophylla the basal part for a short length where united to the
undeveloped hypocotyl and radicle is strongly geotropic whilst the
whole upper part is strongly apogeotropic but a portion near the
blades of the cotyledons is after a time acted on by epinasty and
curves downwards for the sake of emerging in the form of an arch from
the ground it subsequently straightens itself and is then again acted
on by apogeotropism
a branch of cucurbita ovifera placed horizontally moved upwards
during 7 h in a straight line until it stood at 40 above the
horizon it then began to circumnutate as if owing to its trailing
nature it had no tendency to rise any higher another upright branch
was secured to a stick close to the base of a tendril and the pot was
then laid horizontally in the dark in this position the tendril
circumnutated and made
several large ellipses during 14 h as it likewise did on the
following day but during this whole time it was not in the least
affected by apogeotropism on the other hand when branches of another
cucurbitaceous plant echinocytis lobata were fixed in the dark so
that the tendrils depended beneath the horizon these began immediately
to bend upwards and whilst thus moving they ceased to circumnutate in
any plain manner but as soon as they had become horizontal they
recommenced to revolve conspicuously2 the tendrils of passiflora
gracilis are likewise apogeotropic two branches were tied down so that
their tendrils pointed many degrees beneath the horizon one was
observed for 8 h during which time it rose describing two circles
one above the other the other tendril rose in a moderately straight
line during the first 4 h making however one small loop in its
course it then stood at about 45 above the horizon where it
circumnutated during the remaining 8 h of observation

 1875 p 131
a part or organ which whilst young is extremely sensitive to
apogeotropism ceases to be so as it grows old and it is remarkable as
showing the independence of this sensitiveness and of the
circumnutating movement that the latter sometimes continues for a time
after all power of bending from the centre of the earth has been lost
thus a seedling orange bearing only 3 young leaves with a rather stiff
stem did not curve in the least upwards during 24 h whilst extended
horizontally yet it circumnutated all the time over a small space the
hypocotyl of a young seedling of cassia tora similarly placed became
vertical in 12 h that of an older seedling 1 14 inch in height
became so in 28 h and that of another still older one 1 inch in
height remained horizontal during two days but distinctly
circumnutated during this whole time
when the cotyledons of phalaris or avena are laid horizontally the
uppermost part first bends upwards and then the lower part
consequently after the lower part has become much curved upwards the
upper part is compelled to curve backwards in an opposite direction in
order to straighten itself and to stand vertically and this subsequent
straightening process is likewise due to apogeotropism the upper part
of 8 young cotyledons of phalaris were made rigid by being cemented to
thin glass rods so that this part could not bend in the least
nevertheless the basal part was not prevented from curving upward a
stem or other organ which bends upwards through apogeotropism exerts
considerable force its own weight which has of course to be lifted
was sufficient in almost every instance to cause the part at first to
bend a little downwards but the downward course was often rendered
oblique by the simultaneous circumnutating movement the cotyledons of
avena placed horizontally besides lifting their own weight were able
to furrow the soft sand above them so as to leave little crescentic
open spaces on the lower sides of their bases and this is a remarkable
proof of the force exerted
as the tips of the cotyledons of phalaris and avena bend upwards
through the action of apogeotropism before the basal part and as these
same tips when excited by a lateral light transmit some influence to
the lower part causing it to bend we thought that the same rule might
hold good with apogeotropism consequently the tips of 7 cotyledons of
phalaris were
cut off for a length in three cases of 2 inch and in the four other
cases of 14 12 1 and 07 inch but these cotyledons after being
extended horizontally bowed themselves upwards as effectually as the
unmutilated specimens in the same pots showing that sensitiveness to
gravitation is not confined to their tips
geotropism
this movement is directly the reverse of apogeotropism many organs
bend downwards through epinasty or apheliotropism or from their own
weight but we have met with very few cases of a downward movement in
subarial organs due to geotropism we shall however give one good
instance in the following section in the case of trifolium
subterraneum and probably in that of arachis hypogaea
on the other hand all roots which penetrate the ground including the
modified rootlike petioles of megarrhiza and ipoma leptophylla are
guided in their downward course by geotropism and so are many arial
roots whilst others as those of the ivy appear to be indifferent to
its action in our first chapter the movements of the radicles of
several seedlings were described we may there see fig 1 how a
radicle of the cabbage when pointing vertically upwards so as to be
very little acted on by geotropism circumnutated and how another
fig 2 which was at first placed in an inclined position bowed itself
downwards in a zigzag line sometimes remaining stationary for a time
two other radicles of the cabbage travelled downwards in almost
rectilinear courses a radicle of the bean placed upright fig 20
made a great sweep and zigzagged but as it sank downwards and was more
strongly acted on by geotropism it moved in an
almost straight course a radicle of cucurbita directed upwards fig
26 also zigzagged at first and described small loops it then moved
in a straight line nearly the same result was observed with the
radicles of zea mays but the best evidence of the intimate connection
between circumnutation and geotropism was afforded by the radicles of
phaseolus vicia and quercus and in a less degree by those of zea and
sculus see figs 18 19 21 41 and 52 for when these were
compelled to grow and slide down highly inclined surfaces of smoked
glass they left distinctly serpentine tracks
the burying of seedcapsules trifolium subterraneumthe flowerheads
of this plant are remarkable from producing only 3 or 4 perfect
flowers which are situated exteriorly all the other many flowers
abort and are modified into rigid points with a bundle of vessels
running up their centres after a time 5 long elastic clawlike
projections which represent the divisions of the calyx are developed
on their summits as soon as the perfect flowers wither they bend
downwards supposing the peduncle to stand upright and they then
closely surround its upper part this movement is due to epinasty as
is likewise the case with the flowers of t repens the imperfect
central flowers ultimately follow one after the other the same
course whilst the perfect flowers are thus bending down the whole
peduncle curves downwards and increases much in length until the
flowerhead reaches the ground vaucher3 says that when the plant is
so placed that the heads cannot soon reach the ground the peduncles
grow to the extraordinary length of from 6 to 9 inches in whatever
position the branches may be placed the upper part of the peduncle at
first bends vertically upwards through heliotropism but as soon as the
flowers begin to wither the downward curvature of the whole peduncle
commences as this latter movement occurred in complete darkness and
with peduncles arising from upright and from dependent branches it
cannot be due to apheliotropism or to epinasty but must be attributed
to geotropism nineteen
upright flowerheads arising from branches in all sorts of positions
on plants growing in a warm greenhouse were marked with thread and
after 24 h six of them were vertically dependent these therefore had
travelled through 180 in this time ten were extended
subhorizontally and these had moved through about 90 three very
young peduncles had as yet moved only a little downwards but after an
additional 24 h were greatly inclined
 3 hist phys des plantes deurope tom ii 1841 p 106
at the time when the flowerheads reach the ground the younger
imperfect flowers in the centre are still pressed closely together and
form a conical projection whereas the perfect and imperfect flowers on
the outside are upturned and closely surround the peduncle they are
thus adapted to offer as little resistance as the case admits of in
penetrating the ground though the diameter of the flowerhead is still
considerable the means by which this penetration is effected will
presently be described the flowerheads are able to bury themselves in
common garden mould and easily in sand or in fine sifted cinders
packed rather closely the depth to which they penetrated measured
from the surface to the base of the head was between 14 and  inch
but in one case rather above 06 inch with a plant kept in the house
a head partly buried itself in sand in 6 h after 3 days only the tips
of the reflexed calyces were visible and after 6 days the whole had
disappeared but with plants growing out of doors we believe from
casual observations that they bury themselves in a much shorter time
after the heads have buried themselves the central aborted flowers
increase considerably in length and rigidity and become bleached they
gradually curve one after the other upwards or towards the peduncle
in the same manner as did the perfect flowers at first in thus moving
the long claws on their summits carry with them some earth hence a
flowerhead which has been buried for a sufficient time forms a rather
large ball consisting of the aborted flowers separated from one
another by earth and surrounding the little pods the product of the
perfect flowers which lie close round the upper part of the peduncle
the calyces of the perfect and imperfect flowers are clothed with
simple and multicellular hairs which have the power of absorption for
when placed in a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia 2 gr to 1 oz
of water their protoplasmic contents immediately became aggregated and
afterwards displayed the usual slow movements this clover generally
grows in dry soil but whether the power of absorption by the hairs on
the buried flowerheads is of any importance to them we do not know
only a few of the flowerheads which from their position are not able
to reach the ground and bury themselves yield seeds whereas the
buried ones never failed as far as we observed to produce as many
seeds as there had been perfect flowers
we will now consider the movements of the peduncle whilst curving down
to the ground we have seen in chap iv fig 92 p 225 that an
upright young flowerhead circumnutated conspicuously and that this
movement continued after the peduncle had begun to bend downwards the
same peduncle was observed when inclined at an angle of 19 above the
horizon and it circumnutated during two days another
which was already curved 36 beneath the horizon was observed from 11
am july 22nd to the 27th by which latter date it had become
vertically dependent its course during the first 12 h is shown in
fig 190 and its position on the three succeeding mornings until the
25th when it was nearly vertical during the first day the peduncle
clearly circumnutated for it moved 4 times down and 3 times up and on
each succeeding day as it sank downwards the same movement continued
but was only occasionally observed and was less strongly marked it
should be stated that these peduncles were observed under a double
skylight in the house and that they generally moved downwards very
much more slowly than those on plants growing out of doors or in the
greenhouse
fig 190 trifolium subterraneum downward movement of peduncle from
19 beneath the horizon to a nearly vertically dependent position

flowerhead
fig 192 trifolium subterraneum movement of same peduncle with
flowerhead completely buried beneath the sand traced from 8 am to
715 pm on july 29th
the movement of another vertically dependent peduncle with the
flowerhead standing half an inch above the ground was traced and
again when it first touched the ground in both cases irregular
ellipses were described every 4 or 5 h a peduncle on a plant which had
been brought into the house moved from an upright into a vertically
dependent position in a single day and here the course during the
first 12 h was nearly straight but with a few wellmarked zigzags
which betrayed the essential nature of the movement lastly the
circumnutation of a peduncle was traced during 51 h whilst in the act
of burying itself obliquely in a little heap of sand after it had
buried itself to such a depth that the tips of the sepals were alone
visible the above figure fig 191 was traced during 25 h when the
flowerhead had completely disappeared beneath the sand another
tracing was made during 11 h 45 m fig 192 and here again we see
that the peduncle was circumnutating
any one who will observe a flowerhead burying itself will be
convinced that the rocking movement due to the continued
circumnutation of the peduncle plays an important part in the act
considering that the flowerheads are very light that the peduncles
are long thin and flexible and that they arise from flexible
branches it is incredible that an object as blunt as one of these
flowerheads could penetrate the ground by means of the growing force
of the peduncle unless it were aided by the rocking movement after a
flowerhead has penetrated the ground to a small depth another and
efficient agency comes into play the central rigid aborted flowers
each terminating in five long claws curve up towards the peduncle and
in doing so can hardly fail to drag the head down to a greater depth
aided as this action is by the circumnutating movement which continues
after the flowerhead has completely buried itself the aborted flowers
thus act something like the hands of the mole which force the earth
backwards and the body forwards
it is well known that the seedcapsules of various widely distinct
plants either bury themselves in the ground or are produced from
imperfect flowers developed beneath the surface besides the present
case two other wellmarked instances will be immediately given it is
probable that one chief good thus gained is the protection of the seeds
from animals which prey on them in the case of t subterraneum the
seeds are not only concealed by being buried but are likewise
protected by being closely surrounded by the rigid aborted flowers we
may the more confidently infer that protection is here aimed at
because the seeds of several species in this same genus are protected
in other ways4 namely by the swelling and closure of the calyx or
by the persistence and bending down of the standardpetal etc but the
most curious instance is that of t globosum in which the upper
flowers are sterile as in t subterraneum but are here developed into
large brushes of hairs which envelop and protect the seedbearing
flowers nevertheless in all these cases the capsules with their
seeds may profit as mr t thiselton dyer has remarked5 by their
being kept somewhat damp and the advantage of such dampness perhaps
throws light on the presence of the absorbent hairs on the buried
flowerheads of t subterraneum according to mr bentham as quoted by
mr dyer
the prostrate habit of helianthemum prostratum brings the capsules in
contact with the surface of the ground postpones their maturity and
so favours the seeds attaining a larger size the capsules of cyclamen
and of oxalis acetosella are only occasionally buried and this only
beneath dead leaves or moss if it be an advantage to a plant that its
capsules should be kept damp and cool by being laid on the ground we
have in these latter cases the first step from which the power of
penetrating the ground with the aid of the always present movement of
circumnutation might afterwards have been gained

arachis hypogoeathe flowers which bury themselves rise from stiff
branches a few inches above the ground and stand upright after they
have fallen off the gynophore that is the part which supports the
ovarium grows to a great length even to 3 or 4 inches and bends
perpendicularly downwards it resembles closely a peduncle but has a
smooth and pointed apex which contains the ovules and is at first not
in the least enlarged the apex after reaching the ground penetrates
it in one case observed by us to a depth of 1 inch and in another to
07 inch it there becomes developed into a large pod flowers which
are seated too high on the plant for the gynophore to reach the ground
are said6 never to produce pods
 6 gard chronicle 1857 p 566
the movement of a young gynophore rather under an inch in length and
vertically dependent was traced during 46 h by means of a glass
filament with sights fixed transversely a little above the apex it
plainly circumnutated fig 193 whilst increasing in length and
growing downwards it was then raised up so as to be extended almost
horizontally and the terminal part curved itself downwards following
a nearly straight course during 12 h but with one attempt to
circumnutate as shown in fig 194 after 24 h it had become nearly
vertical whether the exciting cause of the downward movement is
geotropism or apheliotropism was not ascertained but probably it is
not apheliotropism as all the gynophores grew straight down towards
the ground whilst the light in the hothouse entered from one side as
well as from above another and older gynophore the apex of which had
nearly reached the ground was observed during 3 days in the same
manner as the firstmentioned short one and it was found to be always
circumnutating during the first 34 h it described a figure which
represented four ellipses lastly a long gynophore the apex of which
had buried itself to the depth of about half an inch was pulled up and
extended horizontally it quickly began to curve downwards in a zigzag
line but on the following day the
terminal bleached portion was a little shrivelled as the gynophores
are rigid and arise from stiff branches and as they terminate in sharp
smooth points it is probable that they could penetrate the ground by
the mere force of growth but this action must be aided by the
circumnutating movement for fine sand kept moist was pressed close
round the apex of a gynophore which had reached the ground and after a
few hours it was surrounded by a narrow open crack after three weeks
this gynophore was uncovered and the apex was found at a depth of
rather above half an inch developed into a small white oval pod

amphicarpoea monoicathis plant produces long thin shoots which twine
round a support and of course circumnutate early in the summer shorter
shoots are produced from the lower parts of the plant which grow
perpendicularly downwards and penetrate the ground one of these
terminating in a minute bud was observed to bury itself in sand to a
depth of 02 inch in 24 h it was lifted up and fixed in an inclined
position about 25 beneath the horizon being feebly illuminated from
above in this position it described two vertical ellipses in 24 h
but on the following day when brought into the house it circumnutated
only a very little round the same spot other branches were seen to
penetrate the ground and were afterwards found running like roots
beneath the surface for a length of nearly two inches and they had
grown thick one of these after thus running had emerged into the
air how far circumnutation aids these delicate branches in entering
the ground we do not know but the reflexed hairs with which they are
clothed will assist in the work this plant produces pods in the air
and others beneath the ground which differ greatly in appearance asa
gray says7 that it is the imperfect flowers on the creeping branches
near the base of the plant which produce the subterranean pods these
flowers therefore must bury themselves like those of arachis but it
may be suspected that the branches which were seen by us to penetrate
the ground also produce subterranean flowers and pods

diageotropism
besides geotropism and apogeotropism there is according to frank an
allied form of movement
namely transversegeotropism or diageotropism as we may call it
for the sake of matching our other terms under the influence of
gravitation certain parts are excited to place themselves more or less
transversely to the line of its action8 we made no observations on
this subject and will here only remark that the position of the
secondary radicles of various plants which extend horizontally or are
a little inclined downwards would probably be considered by frank as
due to transversegeotropism as it has been shown in chap i that the
secondary radicles of cucurbita made serpentine tracks on a smoked
glassplate they clearly circumnutated and there can hardly be a
doubt that this holds good with other secondary radicles it seems
therefore highly probable that they place themselves in their
diageotropic position by means of modified circumnutation
 8 elfving has lately described arbeiten des bot instituts in
 wrzburg b ii 1880 p 489 an excellent instance of such
 movements in the rhizomes of certain plants
finally we may conclude that the three kinds of movement which have
now been described and which are excited by gravitation consist of
modified circumnutation different parts or organs on the same plant
and the same part in different species are thus excited to act in a
widely different manner we can see no reason why the attraction of
gravity should directly modify the state of turgescence and subsequent
growth of one part on the upper side and of another part on the lower
side we are therefore led to infer that both geotropic apogeotropic
and diageotropic movements the purpose of which we can generally
understand
have been acquired for the advantage of the plant by the modification
of the everpresent movement of circumnutation this however implies
that gravitation produces some effect on the young tissues sufficient
to serve as a guide to the plant

ciesielski states1 that when the roots of pisum lens and vicia were
extended horizontally with their tips cut off they were not acted on
by geotropism but some days afterwards when a new rootcap and
vegetative point had been formed they bent themselves perpendicularly
downwards he further states that if the tips are cut off after the
roots have been left extended horizontally for some little time but
before they have begun to bend downwards they may be placed in any
position and yet will bend as if still acted on by geotropism and
this shows that some influence had been already transmitted to the
bending part from the tip before it was amputated sachs repeated these
experiments he cut off a length of between 05 and 1 mm measured
from the apex of the
vegetative point of the tips of the radicles of the bean vicia faba
and placed them horizontally or vertically in damp air earth and
water with the result that they became bowed in all sorts of
directions2 he therefore disbelieved in ciesielskis conclusions
but as we have seen with several plants that the tip of the radicle is
sensitive to contact and to other irritants and that it transmits some
influence to the upper growing part causing it to bend there seemed to
us to be no a priori improbability in ciesielskis statements we
therefore determined to repeat his experiments and to try others on
several species by different methods

vicia fabaradicles of this plant were extended horizontally either
over water or with their lower surfaces just touching it their tips
had previously been cut off in a direction as accurately transverse as
could be done to different lengths measured from the apex of the
rootcap and which will be specified in each case light was always
excluded we had previously tried hundreds of unmutilated radicles
under similar circumstances and found that every one that was healthy
became plainly geotropic in under 12 h in the case of four radicles
which had their tips cut off for a length of 15 mm new root caps and
new vegetative points were reformed after an interval of 3 days 20 h
and these when placed horizontally were acted on by geotropism on some
other occasions this regeneration of the tips and reacquired
sensitiveness occurred within a somewhat shorter time therefore
radicles having their tips amputated should be observed in from 12 to
48 h after the operation
four radicles were extended horizontally with their lower surfaces
touching the water and with their tips cut off for a length of only
05 mm after 23 h three of them were still horizontal after 47 h
one of the three became fairly geotropic and after 70 h the other two
showed a trace of this action the fourth radicle was vertically
geotropic after 23 h but by an
accident the rootcap alone and not the vegetative point was found to
have been amputated so that this case formed no real exception and
might have been excluded
five radicles were extended horizontally like the last and had their
tips cut off for a length of 1 mm after 2223 h four of them were
still horizontal and one was slightly geotropic after 48 h the
latter had become vertical a second was also somewhat geotropic two
remained approximately horizontal and the last or fifth had grown in a
disordered manner for it was inclined upwards at an angle of 65 above
the horizon
fourteen radicles were extended horizontally at a little height over
the water with their tips cut off for a length of 15 mm after 12 h
all were horizontal whilst five control or standard specimens in the
same jar were all bent greatly downwards after 24 h several of the
amputated radicles remained horizontal but some showed a trace of
geotropism and one was plainly geotropic for it was inclined at 40
beneath the horizon
seven horizontally extended radicles from which the tips had been cut
off for the unusual length of 2 mm unfortunately were not looked at
until 35 h had elapsed three were still horizontal but to our
surprise four were more or less plainly geotropic
the radicles in the foregoing cases were measured before their tips
were amputated and in the course of 24 h they had all increased
greatly in length but the measurements are not worth giving it is of
more importance that sachs found that the rate of growth of the
different parts of radicles with amputated tips was the same as with
unmutilated ones altogether twentynine radicles were operated on in
the manner above described and of these only a few showed any
geotropic curvature within 24 h whereas radicles with unmutilated
tips always became as already stated much bent down in less than half
of this time the part of the radicle which bends most lies at the
distance of from 3 to 6 mm from the tip and as the bending part
continues to grow after the operation there does not seem any reason
why it should not have been acted on by geotropism unless its
curvature depended on some influence transmitted from the tip and we
have clear evidence of such transmission in ciesielskis experiments
which we repeated and extended in the following manner
beans were embedded in friable peat with the hilum downwards and after
their radicles had grown perpendicularly down for a length of from  to
1 inch sixteen were selected which
were perfectly straight and these were placed horizontally on the
peat being covered by a thin layer of it they were thus left for an
average period of 1 h 37 m the tips were then cut off transversely
for a length of 15 mm and immediately afterwards they were embedded
vertically in the peat in this position geotropism would not tend to
induce any curvature but if some influence had already been
transmitted from the tip to the part which bends most we might expect
that this part would become curved in the direction in which geotropism
had previously acted for it should be noted that these radicles being
now destitute of their sensitive tips would not be prevented by
geotropism from curving in any direction the result was that of the
sixteen vertically embedded radicles four continued for several days
to grow straight downwards whilst twelve became more or less bowed
laterally in two of the twelve a trace of curvature was perceptible
in 3 h 30 m counting from the time when they had first been laid
horizontally and all twelve were plainly bowed in 6 h and still more
plainly in 9 h in every one of them the curvature was directed towards
the side which had been downwards whilst the radicles remained
horizontal the curvature extended for a length of from 5 to in one
instance 8 mm measured from the cutoff end of the twelve bowed
radicles five became permanently bent into a right angle the other
seven were at first much less bent and their curvature generally
decreased after 24 h but did not wholly disappear this decrease of
curvature would naturally follow if an exposure of only 1 h 37 m to
geotropism served to modify the turgescence of the cells but not
their subsequent growth to the full extent the five radicles which
were rectangularly bent became fixed in this position and they
continued to grow out horizontally in the peat for a length of about 1
inch during from 4 to 6 days by this time new tips had been formed
and it should be remarked that this regeneration occurred slower in the
peat than in water owing perhaps to the radicles being often looked at
and thus disturbed after the tips had been regenerated geotropism was
able to act on them so that they now became bowed vertically
downwards an accurate drawing fig 195 is given on the opposite page
of one of these five radicles reduced to half the natural size
we next tried whether a shorter exposure to geotropism would suffice to
produce an aftereffect seven radicles were extended horizontally for
an hour instead of 1 h 37 m as in the
former trial and after their tips 15 mm in length had been
amputated they were placed vertically in damp peat of these three
were not in the least affected and continued for days to grow straight
downwards four showed after 8 h 30 m a mere trace of curvature in
the direction in which they had been acted on by geotropism and in
this respect they differed much from those which had been exposed for 1
h 37 m for many of the latter were plainly curved in 6 h the
curvature of one of these four radicles almost disappeared after 24 h
in the second the curvature increased during two days and then
decreased the third radicle became permanently bent so that its
terminal part made an angle of about 45 with its original vertical
direction the fourth radicle became horizontal these two latter
radicles continued during two more days to grow in the peat in the same
directions that is at an angle of 45 beneath the horizon and
horizontally by the fourth morning new tips had been reformed and
now geotropism was able to act on them again and they became bent
perpendicularly downwards exactly as in the case of the five radicles
described in the last paragraph and as is shown in fig 195 here
given

lastly five other radicles were similarly treated but were exposed to
geotropism during only 45 m after 8 h 30 m only one was doubtfully
affected after 24 h two were just perceptibly curved towards the side
which had been acted on by geotropism after 48 h the one first
mentioned had a radius of curvature of 60 mm that this curvature was
due to the action of geotropism during the horizontal position of the
radicle was shown after 4 days when a new tip had been reformed for
it then grew perpendicularly downwards we learn from this
case that when the tips are amputated after an exposure to geotropism
of only 45 m though a slight influence is sometimes transmitted to
the adjoining part of the radicle yet this seldom suffices and then
only slowly to induce even moderately wellpronounced curvature
in the previously given experiments on 29 horizontally extended
radicles with their tips amputated only one grew irregularly in any
marked manner and this became bowed upwards at an angle of 65 in
ciesielskis experiments the radicles could not have grown very
irregularly for if they had done so he could not have spoken
confidently of the obliteration of all geotropic action it is
therefore remarkable that sachs who experimented on many radicles with
their tips amputated found extremely disordered growth to be the usual
result as horizontally extended radicles with amputated tips are
sometimes acted on slightly by geotropism within a short time and are
often acted on plainly after one or two days we thought that this
influence might possibly prevent disordered growth though it was not
able to induce immediate curvature therefore 13 radicles of which 6
had their tips amputated transversely for a length of 15 mm and the
other 7 for a length of only 05 mm were suspended vertically in damp
air in which position they would not be affected by geotropism but
they exhibited no great irregularity of growth whilst observed during
4 to 6 days we next thought that if care were not taken in cutting off
the tips transversely one side of the stump might be irritated more
than the other either at first or subsequently during the regeneration
of the tip and that this might cause the radicle to bend to one side
it has also been shown in chapter iii that if a thin slice be cut off
one side of the tip of the radicle this causes the radicle to bend
from the sliced side accordingly 30 radicles with tips amputated for
a length of 15 mm were allowed to grow perpendicularly downwards
into water twenty of them were amputated at an angle of 20 with a
line transverse to their longitudinal axes and such stumps appeared
only moderately oblique the remaining ten radicles were amputated at
an angle of about 45 under these circumstances no less than 19 out of
the 30 became much distorted in the course of 2 or 3 days eleven other
radicles were similarly treated excepting that only 1 mm including
in this and all other cases the rootcap was amputated and of these
only one grew much and two others slightly
distorted so that this amount of oblique amputation was not
sufficient out of the above 30 radicles only one or two showed in the
first 24 h any distortion but this became plain in the 19 cases on
the second day and still more conspicuous at the close of the third
day by which time new tips had been partially or completely
regenerated when therefore a new tip is reformed on an oblique stump
it probably is developed sooner on one side than on the other and this
in some manner excites the adjoining part to bend to one side hence it
seems probable that sachs unintentionally amputated the radicles on
which he experimented not strictly in a transverse direction
this explanation of the occasional irregular growth of radicles with
amputated tips is supported by the results of cauterising their tips
for often a greater length on one side than on the other was
unavoidably injured or killed it should be remarked that in the
following trials the tips were first dried with blottingpaper and
then slightly rubbed with a dry stick of nitrate of silver or lunar
caustic a few touches with the caustic suffice to kill the rootcap
and some of the upper layers of cells of the vegetative point
twentyseven radicles some young and very short others of moderate
length were suspended vertically over water after being thus
cauterised of these some entered the water immediately and others on
the second day the same number of uncauterised radicles of the same
age were observed as controls after an interval of three or four days
the contrast in appearance between the cauterised and control specimens
was wonderfully great the controls had grown straight downwards with
the exception of the normal curvature which we have called sachs
curvature of the 27 cauterised radicles 15 had become extremely
distorted 6 of them grew upwards and formed hoops so that their tips
sometimes came into contact with the bean above 5 grew out
rectangularly to one side only a few of the remaining 12 were quite
straight and some of these towards the close of our observations
became hooked at their extreme lower ends radicles extended
horizontally instead of vertically with their tips cauterised also
sometimes grew distorted but not so commonly as far as we could
judge as those suspended vertically for this occurred with only 5 out
of 19 radicles thus treated
instead of cutting off the tips as in the first set of experiments we
next tried the effects of touching horizontally extended radicles with
caustic in the manner just described but
some preliminary remarks must first be made it may be objected that
the caustic would injure the radicles and prevent them from bending
but ample evidence was given in chapter iii that touching the tips of
vertically suspended radicles with caustic on one side does not stop
their bending on the contrary it causes them to bend from the touched
side we also tried touching both the upper and the lower sides of the
tips of some radicles of the bean extended horizontally in damp
friable earth the tips of three were touched with caustic on their
upper sides and this would aid their geotropic bending the tips of
three were touched on their lower sides which would tend to counteract
the bending downwards and three were left as controls after 24 h an
independent observer was asked to pick out of the nine radicles the
two which were most and the two which were least bent he selected as
the latter two of those which had been touched on their lower sides
and as the most bent two of those which had been touched on the upper
side hereafter analogous and more striking experiments with pisum
sativum and cucurbita ovifera will be given we may therefore safely
conclude that the mere application of caustic to the tip does not
prevent the radicles from bending
in the following experiments the tips of young horizontally extended
radicles were just touched with a stick of dry caustic and this was
held transversely so that the tip might be cauterised all round as
symmetrically as possible the radicles were then suspended in a closed
vessel over water kept rather cool viz 5559 f this was done
because we had found that the tips were more sensitive to contact under
a low than under a high temperature and we thought that the same rule
might apply to geotropism in one exceptional trial nine radicles
which were rather too old for they had grown to a length of from 3 to
5 cm were extended horizontally in damp friable earth after their
tips had been cauterised and were kept at too high a temperature viz
of 68 f or 20 c the result in consequence was not so striking as
in the subsequent cases for although when after 9 h 40 m six of them
were examined these did not exhibit any geotropic bending yet after
24 h when all nine were examined only two remained horizontal two
exhibited a trace of geotropism and five were slightly or moderately
geotropic yet not comparable in degree with the control specimens
marks had been made on seven of these cauterised radicles at 10 mm
from the tips which includes
the whole growing portion and after the 24 h this part had a mean
length of 37 mm so that it had increased to more than 3 times its
original length but it should be remembered that these beans had been
exposed to a rather high temperature
nineteen young radicles with cauterised tips were extended at different
times horizontally over water in every trial an equal number of
control specimens were observed in the first trial the tips of three
radicles were lightly touched with the caustic for 6 or 7 seconds
which was a longer application than usual after 23 h 30 m temp
5556 f these three radicles a b c fig 196 were still
horizontal whilst the three control specimens had become within 8 h
slightly geotropic and strongly so d e f in 23 h 30 m a dot had
been made on all six radicles at 10 mm from their tips when first
placed horizontally after the 23 h 30 m this terminal part
originally 10 mm in length had increased in the cauterised specimens
to a mean length of 173 mm and to 157 mm in the control radicles
as shown in the figures by the unbroken transverse line the dotted
line being at 10 mm from the apex the control or uncauterised
radicles therefore had actually grown less
than the cauterised but this no doubt was accidental for radicles of
different ages grow at different rates and the growth of different
individuals is likewise affected by unknown causes the state of the
tips of these three radicles which had been cauterised for a rather
longer time than usual was as follows the blackened apex or the part
which had been actually touched by the caustic was succeeded by a
yellowish zone due probably to the absorption of some of the caustic
in a both zones together were 11 mm in length and 14 mm in
diameter at the base of the yellowish zone in b the length of both
was only 07 mm and the diameter 07 mm in c the length was 08
mm and the diameter 12 mm
fig 196 vicia faba state of radicles which had been extended
horizontally for 23 h 30 m a b c tips touched with caustic d e
f tips uncauterised lengths of radicles reduced to onehalf scale
but by an accident the beans themselves not reduced in the same degree
three other radicles the tips of which had been touched with caustic
curing 2 or 3 seconds remained temp 5859 f horizontal for 23
h the control radicles having of course become geotropic within
this time the terminal growing part 10 mm in length of the
cauterised radicles had increased in this interval to a mean length of
245 mm and of the controls to a mean of 26 mm a section of one of
the cauterised tips showed that the blackened part was 05 mm in
length of which 02 mm extended into the vegetative point and a
faint discoloration could be detected even to 16 mm from the apex of
the rootcap
in another lot of six radicles temp 5557 f the three control
specimens were plainly geotropic in 8 h and after 24 h the mean
length of their terminal part had increased from 10 mm to 21 mm when
the caustic was applied to the three cauterised specimens it was held
quite motionless during 5 seconds and the result was that the black
marks were extremely minute therefore caustic was again applied
after 8 h during which time no geotropic action had occurred when
the specimens were reexamined after an additional interval of 15 h
one was horizontal and the other two showed to our surprise a trace
of geotropism which in one of them soon afterwards became strongly
marked but in this latter specimen the discoloured tip was only 23
mm in length the growing part of these three radicles increased in 24
h from 10 mm to an average of 165 mm
it would be superfluous to describe in detail the behaviour of the 10
remaining cauterised radicles the corresponding control specimens all
became geotropic in 8 h of the cauterised 6 were first looked at
after 8 h and one alone showed a trace
of geotropism 4 were first looked at after 14 h and one alone of
these was slightly geotropic after 2324h 5 of the 10 were still
horizontal 4 slightly and 1 decidedly geotropic after 48 h some of
them became strongly geotropic the cauterised radicles increased
greatly in length but the measurements are not worth giving
as five of the lastmentioned cauterised radicles had become in 24 h
somewhat geotropic these together with three which were still
horizontal had their positions reversed so that their tips were now a
little upturned and they were again touched with caustic after 24 h
they showed no trace of geotropism whereas the eight corresponding
control specimens which had likewise been reversed in which position
the tips of several pointed to the zenith all became geotropic some
having passed in the 24 h through an angle of 180 others through
about 135 and others through only 90 the eight radicles which had
been twice cauterised were observed for an additional day ie for 48
h after being reversed and they still showed no signs of geotropism
nevertheless they continued to grow rapidly four were measured 24 h
after being reversed and they had in this time increased in length
between 8 and 11 mm the other four were measured 48 h after being
reversed and these had increased by 20 18 23 and 28 mm
in coming to a conclusion with respect to the effects of cauterising
the tips of these radicles we should bear in mind firstly that
horizontally extended control radicles were always acted on by
geotropism and became somewhat bowed downwards in 8 or 9 h secondly
that the chief seat of the curvature lies at a distance of from 3 to 6
mm from the tip thirdly that the tip was discoloured by the caustic
rarely for more than 1 mm in length fourthly that the greater number
of the cauterised radicles although subjected to the full influence of
geotropism during the whole time remained horizontal for 24 h and
some for twice as long and that those which did become bowed were so
only in a slight degree fifthly that the cauterised radicles
continued to grow almost and sometimes quite as well as the uninjured
ones along the part which bends most and lastly that a touch on the
tip with caustic if on one side far from preventing curvature
actually induces it bearing all these facts in mind we must infer
that under normal conditions the geotropic curvature of the root is due
to an influence transmitted from the apex to the adjoining part where
the bending
takes place and that when the tip of the root is cauterised it is
unable to originate the stimulus necessary to produce geotropic
curvature
as we had observed that grease was highly injurious to some plants we
determined to try its effects on radicles when the cotyledons of
phalaris and avena were covered with grease along one side the growth
of this side was quite stopped or greatly checked and as the opposite
side continued to grow the cotyledons thus treated became bowed
towards the greased side this same matter quickly killed the delicate
hypocotyls and young leaves of certain plants the grease which we
employed was made by mixing lampblack and olive oil to such a
consistence that it could be laid on in a thick layer the tips of five
radicles of the bean were coated with it for a length of 3 mm and to
our surprise this part increased in length in 23 h to 71 mm the
thick layer of grease being curiously drawn out it thus could not have
checked much if at all the growth of the terminal part of the
radicle with respect to geotropism the tips of seven horizontally
extended radicles were coated for a length of 2 mm and after 24 h no
clear difference could be perceived between their downward curvature
and that of an equal number of control specimens the tips of 33 other
radicles were coated on different occasions for a length of 3 mm and
they were compared with the controls after 8 h 24 h and 48 h on
one occasion after 24 h there was very little difference in
curvature between the greased and control specimens but generally the
difference was unmistakable those with greased tips being considerably
less curved downwards the whole growing part the greased tips
included of six of these radicles was measured and was found to have
increased in 23 h from 10 mm to a mean length of 177 mm whilst the
corresponding part of the controls had increased to 208 mm it appears
therefore that although the tip itself when greased continues to
grow yet the growth of the whole radicle is somewhat checked and that
the geotropic curvature of the upper part which was free from grease
was in most cases considerably lessened
pisum sativumfive radicles extended horizontally over water had
their tips lightly touched two or three times with dry caustic these
tips were measured in two cases and found to be blackened for a length
of only half a millimeter five other radicles were left as controls
the part which is most bowed through geotropism lies at a distance of
several millimeters from
the apex after 24 h and again after 32 h from the commencement
four of the cauterised radicles were still horizontal but one was
plainly geotropic being inclined at 45 beneath the horizon the five
controls were somewhat geotropic after 7 h 20 m and after 24 h were
all strongly geotropic being inclined at the following angles beneath
the horizon viz 59 60 65 57 and 43 the length of the
radicles was not measured in either set but it was manifest that the
cauterised radicles had grown greatly
the following case proves that the action of the caustic by itself does
not prevent the curvature of the radicle ten radicles were extended
horizontally on and beneath a layer of damp friable peatearth and
before being extended their tips were touched with dry caustic on the
upper side ten other radicles similarly placed were touched on the
lower side and this would tend to make them bend from the cauterised
side and therefore as now placed upwards or in opposition to
geotropism lastly ten uncauterised radicles were extended
horizontally as controls after 24 h all the latter were geotropic
and the ten with their tips cauterised on the upper side were equally
geotropic and we believe that they became curved downwards before the
controls the ten which had been cauterised on the lower side presented
a widely different appearance no 1 however was perpendicularly
geotropic but this was no real exception for on examination under the
microscope there was no vestige of a coloured mark on the tip and it
was evident that by a mistake it had not been touched with the caustic
no 2 was plainly geotropic being inclined at about 45 beneath the
horizon no 3 was slightly and no 4 only just perceptibly geotropic
nos 5 and 6 were strictly horizontal and the four remaining ones were
bowed upwards in opposition to geotropism in these four cases the
radius of the upward curvatures according to sachs cyclometer was 5
mm 10 mm 30 mm and 70 mm this curvature was distinct long before
the 24 h had elapsed namely after 8 h 45 m from the time when the
lower sides of the tips were touched with the caustic
phaseolus multifloruseight radicles serving as controls were
extended horizontally some in damp friable peat and some in damp air
they all became temp 2021 c plainly geotropic in 8 h 30 m for
they then stood at an average angle of 63 beneath the horizon a
rather greater length of the radicle is bowed downwards by geotropism
than in the case of vicia faba
that is to say rather more than 6 mm as measured from the apex of the
rootcap nine other radicles were similarly extended three in damp
peat and six in damp air and dry caustic was held transversely to
their tips during 4 or 5 seconds three of their tips were afterwards
examined in 1 a length of 068 mm was discoloured of which the
basal 0136 mm was yellow the apical part being black in 2 the
discoloration was 065 mm in length of which the basal 004 mm was
yellow in 3 the discoloration was 06 mm in length of which the
basal 013 mm was yellow therefore less than 1 mm was affected by
the caustic but this sufficed almost wholly to prevent geotropic
action for after 24 h one alone of the nine cauterised radicles
became slightly geotropic being now inclined at 10 beneath the
horizon the eight others remained horizontal though one was curved a
little laterally
the terminal part 10 mm in length of the six cauterised radicles in
the damp air had more than doubled in length in the 24 h for this
part was now on an average 207 mm long the increase in length within
the same time was greater in the control specimens for the terminal
part had grown on an average from 10 mm to 266 mm but as the
cauterised radicles had more than doubled their length in the 24 h it
is manifest that they had not been seriously injured by the caustic we
may here add that when experimenting on the effects of touching one
side of the tip with caustic too much was applied at first and the
whole tip but we believe not more than 1 mm in length of six
horizontally extended radicles was killed and these continued for two
or three days to grow out horizontally
many trials were made by coating the tips of horizontally extended
radicles with the before described thick grease the geotropic
curvature of 12 radicles which were thus coated for a length of 2 mm
was delayed during the first 8 or 9 h but after 24 h was nearly as
great as that of the control specimens the tips of nine radicles were
coated for a length of 3 mm and after 7 h 10 m these stood at an
average angle of 30 beneath the horizon whilst the controls stood at
an average of 54 after 24 h the two lots differed but little in
their degree of curvature in some other trials however there was a
fairly wellmarked difference after 24 h between those with greased
tips and the controls the terminal part of eight control specimens
increased in 24 h from 10 mm to a mean length of
243 mm whilst the mean increase of those with greased tips was 207
mm the grease therefore slightly checked the growth of the terminal
part but this part was not much injured for several radicles which
had been greased for a length of 2 mm continued to grow during seven
days and were then only a little shorter than the controls the
appearance presented by these radicles after the seven days was very
curious for the black grease had been drawn out into the finest
longitudinal striae with dots and reticulations which covered their
surfaces for a length of from 26 to 44 mm or of 1 to 17 inch we may
therefore conclude that grease on the tips of the radicles of this
phaseolus somewhat delays and lessens the geotropic curvature of the
part which ought to bend most
gossypium herbaceumthe radicles of this plant bend through the
action of geotropism for a length of about 6 mm five radicles placed
horizontally in damp air had their tips touched with caustic and the
discoloration extended for a length of from 23 to 1 mm they showed
after 7 h 45 m and again after 23 h not a trace of geotropism yet
the terminal portion 9 mm in length had increased on an average to
159 mm six control radicles after 7 h 45 m were all plainly
geotropic two of them being vertically dependent and after 23 h all
were vertical or nearly so
cucurbita oviferaa large number of trials proved almost useless from
the three following causes firstly the tips of radicles which have
grown somewhat old are only feebly geotropic if kept in damp air nor
did we succeed well in our experiments until the germinating seeds
were placed in peat and kept at a rather high temperature secondly
the hypocotyls of the seeds which were pinned to the lids of the jars
gradually became arched and as the cotyledons were fixed the
movement of the hypocotyl affected the position of the radicle and
caused confusion thirdly the point of the radicle is so fine that it
is difficult not to cauterise it either too much or too little but we
managed generally to overcome this latter difficulty as the following
experiments show which are given to prove that a touch with caustic on
one side of the tip does not prevent the upper part of the radicle from
bending ten radicles were laid horizontally beneath and on damp
friable peat and their tips were touched with caustic on the upper
side after 8 h all were plainly geotropic three of them
rectangularly after 19 h
all were strongly geotropic most of them pointing perpendicularly
downwards ten other radicles similarly placed had their tips touched
with caustic on the lower side after 8 h three were slightly
geotropic but not nearly so much so as the least geotropic of the
foregoing specimens four remained horizontal and three were curved
upwards in opposition to geotropism after 19 h the three which were
slightly geotropic had become strongly so of the four horizontal
radicles one alone showed a trace of geotropism of the three
upcurved radicles one retained this curvature and the other two had
become horizontal
the radicles of this plant as already remarked do not succeed well in
damp air but the result of one trial may be briefly given nine young
radicles between 3 and 5 inch in length with their tips cauterised
and blackened for a length never exceeding  mm together with eight
control specimens were extended horizontally in damp air after an
interval of only 4 h 10 m all the controls were slightly geotropic
whilst not one of the cauterised specimens exhibited a trace of this
action after 8 h 35 m there was the same difference between the two
sets but rather more strongly marked by this time both sets had
increased greatly in length the controls however never became much
more curved downwards and after 24 h there was no great difference
between the two sets in their degree of curvature
eight young radicles of nearly equal length average 36 inch were
placed beneath and on peatearth and were exposed to a temp of
7576 f their tips had been touched transversely with caustic and
five of them were blackened for a length of about 05 mm whilst the
other three were only just visibly discoloured in the same box there
were 15 control radicles mostly about 36 inch in length but some
rather longer and older and therefore less sensitive after 5 h the
15 control radicles were all more or less geotropic after 9 h eight
of them were bent down beneath the horizon at various angles between
45 and 90 the remaining seven being only slightly geotropic after
25 h all were rectangularly geotropic the state of the eight
cauterised radicles after the same intervals of time was as follows
after 5 h one alone was slightly geotropic and this was one with the
tip only a very little discoloured after 9 h the one just mentioned
was rectangularly geotropic and two others were slightly so and these
were the three which had been scarcely
affected by the caustic the other five were still strictly horizontal
after 24 h 40 m the three with only slightly discoloured tips were
bent down rectangularly the other five were not in the least affected
but several of them had grown rather tortuously though still in a
horizontal plane the eight cauterised radicles which had at first a
mean length of 36 inch after 9 h had increased to a mean length of
79 inch and after 24 h 40 m to the extraordinary mean length of 2
inches there was no plain difference in length between the five well
cauterised radicles which remained horizontal and the three with
slightly cauterised tips which had become abruptly bent down a few of
the control radicles were measured after 25 h and they were on an
average only a little longer than the cauterised viz 219 inches we
thus see that killing the extreme tip of the radicle of this plant for
a length of about 05 mm though it stops the geotropic bending of the
upper part hardly interferes with the growth of the whole radicle
in the same box with the 15 control specimens the rapid geotropic
bending and growth of which have just been described there were six
radicles about 6 inch in length extended horizontally from which
the tips had been cut off in a transverse direction for a length of
barely 1 mm these radicles were examined after 9 h and again after 24
h 40 m and they all remained horizontal they had not become nearly
so tortuous as those above described which had been cauterised the
radicles with their tips cut off had grown in the 24 h 40 m as much
judging by the eye as the cauterised specimens
zea maysthe tips of several radicles extended horizontally in damp
air were dried with blottingpaper and then touched in the first trial
during 2 or 3 seconds with dry caustic but this was too long a
contact for the tips were blackened for a length of rather above 1 mm
they showed no signs of geotropism after an interval of 9 h and were
then thrown away in a second trial the tips of three radicles were
touched for a shorter time and were blackened for a length of from 05
to 075 mm they all remained horizontal for 4 h but after 8 h 30
m one of them in which the blackened tip was only 05 mm in length
was inclined at 21 beneath the horizon six control radicles all
became slightly geotropic in 4 h and strongly so after 8 h 30 m
with the chief seat of curvature generally between 6 or 7 mm from the
apex in the cauterised specimens the terminal growing part 10 mm in
length increased during
the 8 h 30 m to a mean length of 13 mm and in the controls to 143
mm
in a third trial the tips of five radicles exposed to a temp of
7071 were touched with the caustic only once and very slightly
they were afterwards examined under the microscope and the part which
was in any way discoloured was on an average 76 mm in length after 4
h 10 m none were bent after 5 h 45 m and again after 23 h 30 m
they still remained horizontal excepting one which was now inclined
20 beneath the horizon the terminal part 10 mm in length had
increased greatly in length during the 23 h 30 m viz to an average
of 26 mm four control radicles became slightly geotropic after the 4
h 10 m and plainly so after the 5 h 45 m their mean length after
the 23 h 30 m had increased from 10 mm to 31 mm therefore a slight
cauterisation of the tip checks slightly the growth of the whole
radicle and manifestly stops the bending of that part which ought to
bend most under the influence of geotropism and which still continues
to increase greatly in length
concluding remarksabundant evidence has now been given showing that
with various plants the tip of the radicle is alone sensitive to
geotropism and that when thus excited it causes the adjoining parts
to bend the exact length of the sensitive part seems to be somewhat
variable depending in part on the age of the radicle but the
destruction of a length of from less than 1 to 15 mm about 120th of
an inch in the several species observed generally sufficed to
prevent any part of the radicle from bending within 24 h or even for
a longer period the fact of the tip alone being sensitive is so
remarkable a fact that we will here give a brief summary of the
foregoing experiments the tips were cut off 29 horizontally extended
radicles of vicia faba and with a few exceptions they did not become
geotropic in 22 or 23 h whilst unmutilated radicles were always bowed
downwards in 8 or 9 h it should be borne in mind that the mere act of
cutting
off the tip of a horizontally extended radicle does not prevent the
adjoining parts from bending if the tip has been previously exposed
for an hour or two to the influence of geotropism the tip after
amputation is sometimes completely regenerated in three days and it is
possible that it may be able to transmit an impulse to the adjoining
parts before its complete regeneration the tips of six radicles of
cucurbita ovifera were amputated like those of vicia faba and these
radicles showed no signs of geotropism in 24 h whereas the control
specimens were slightly affected in 5 h and strongly in 9 h
with plants belonging to six genera the tips of the radicles were
touched transversely with dry caustic and the injury thus caused
rarely extended for a greater length than 1 mm and sometimes to a
less distance as judged by even the faintest discoloration we thought
that this would be a better method of destroying the vegetative point
than cutting it off for we knew from many previous experiments and
from some given in the present chapter that a touch with caustic on
one side of the apex far from preventing the adjoining part from
bending caused it to bend in all the following cases radicles with
uncauterised tips were observed at the same time and under similar
circumstances and they became in almost every instance plainly bowed
downwards in onehalf or onethird of the time during which the
cauterised specimens were observed with vicia faba 19 radicles were
cauterised 12 remained horizontal during 2324 h 6 became slightly
and 1 strongly geotropic eight of these radicles were afterwards
reversed and again touched with caustic and none of them became
geotropic in 24 h whilst the reversed control specimens became
strongly bowed downwards within this time
with pisum sativum five radicles had their tips touched with caustic
and after 32 h four were still horizontal the control specimens were
slightly geotropic in 7 h 20 m and strongly so in 24 h the tips of
9 other radicles of this plant were touched only on the lower side and
6 of them remained horizontal for 24 h or were upturned in opposition
to geotropism 2 were slightly and 1 plainly geotropic with phaseolus
multiflorus 15 radicles were cauterised and 8 remained horizontal for
24 h whereas all the controls were plainly geotropic in 8 h 30 m of
5 cauterised radicles of gossypium herbaceum 4 remained horizontal for
23 h and 1 became slightly geotropic 6 control radicles were
distinctly geotropic in 7 h 45 m five radicles of cucurbita ovifera
remained horizontal in peatearth during 25 h and 9 remained so in
damp air during 8 h whilst the controls became slightly geotropic in
4 h 10 m the tips of 10 radicals of this plant were touched on their
lower sides and 6 of them remained horizontal or were upturned after
19 h 1 being slightly and 3 strongly geotropic
lastly the tips of several radicles of vicia faba and phaseolus
multiflorus were thickly coated with grease for a length of 3 mm this
matter which is highly injurious to most plants did not kill or stop
the growth of the tips and only slightly lessened the rate of growth
of the whole radicle but it generally delayed a little the geotropic
bending of the upper part
the several foregoing cases would tell us nothing if the tip itself
was the part which became most bent but we know that it is a part
distant from the tip by some millimeters which grows quickest and
which under the influence of geotropism bends most we have no reason
to suppose that this part is injured by the death or injury of the tip
and it is certain
that after the tip has been destroyed this part goes on growing at such
a rate that its length was often doubled in a day we have also seen
that the destruction of the tip does not prevent the adjoining part
from bending if this part has already received some influence from the
tip as with horizontally extended radicles of which the tip has been
cut off or destroyed the part which ought to bend most remains
motionless for many hours or days although exposed at right angles to
the full influence of geotropism we must conclude that the tip alone
is sensitive to this power and transmits some influence or stimulus to
the adjoining parts causing them to bend we have direct evidence of
such transmission for when a radicle was left extended horizontally
for an hour or an hour and a half by which time the supposed influence
will have travelled a little distance from the tip and the tip was
then cut off the radicle afterwards became bent although placed
perpendicularly the terminal portions of several radicles thus treated
continued for some time to grow in the direction of their
newlyacquired curvature for as they were destitute of tips they were
no longer acted on by geotropism but after three or four days when new
vegetative points were formed the radicles were again acted on by
geotropism and now they curved themselves perpendicularly downwards
to see anything of the above kind in the animal kingdom we should have
to suppose than an animal whilst lying down determined to rise up in
some particular direction and that after its head had been cut off an
impulse continued to travel very slowly along the nerves to the proper
muscles so that after several hours the headless animal rose up in the
predetermined direction
as the tip of the radicle has been found to be the
part which is sensitive to geotropism in the members of such distinct
families as the leguminosae malvaceae cucurbitace and gramine we
may infer that this character is common to the roots of most seedling
plants whilst a root is penetrating the ground the tip must travel
first and we can see the advantage of its being sensitive to
geotropism as it has to determine the course of the whole root
whenever the tip is deflected by any subterranean obstacle it will
also be an advantage that a considerable length of the root should be
able to bend more especially as the tip itself grows slowly and bends
but little so that the proper downward course may be soon recovered
but it appears at first sight immaterial whether this were effected by
the whole growing part being sensitive to geotropism or by an
influence transmitted exclusively from the tip we should however
remember that it is the tip which is sensitive to the contact of hard
objects causing the radicle to bend away from them thus guiding it
along the lines of least resistance in the soil it is again the tip
which is alone sensitive at least in some cases to moisture causing
the radicle to bend towards its source these two kinds of
sensitiveness conquer for a time the sensitiveness to geotropism
which however ultimately prevails therefore the three kinds of
sensitiveness must often come into antagonism first one prevailing
and then another and it would be an advantage perhaps a necessity
for the interweighing and reconciling of these three kinds of
sensitiveness that they should be all localised in the same group of
cells which have to transmit the command to the adjoining parts of the
radicle causing it to bend to or from the source of irritation
finally the fact of the tip alone being sensitive to
the attraction of gravity has an important bearing on the theory of
geotropism authors seem generally to look at the bending of a radicle
towards the centre of the earth as the direct result of gravitation
which is believed to modify the growth of the upper or lower surfaces
in such a manner as to induce curvature in the proper direction but we
now know that it is the tip alone which is acted on and that this part
transmits some influence to the adjoining parts causing them to curve
downwards gravity does not appear to act in a more direct manner on a
radicle than it does on any lowly organised animal which moves away
when it feels some weight or pressure

it may be useful to the reader if we briefly sum up the chief
conclusions which as far as we can judge have been fairly well
established by the observations given in this volume all the parts or
organs in every plant whilst they continue to grow and some parts
which are provided with pulvini after they have ceased to grow are
continually circumnutating this movement commences even before the
young seedling has broken through the ground the nature of the
movement and its causes as far as ascertained have been briefly
described in the introduction why every part of a plant whilst it is
growing and in some cases after growth has ceased should have its
cells rendered more turgescent and its cellwalls more extensile first
on one side and then on another thus inducing circumnutation is not
known it would appear as if the changes in the cells required periods
of rest
in some cases as with the hypocotyls of brassica the leaves of
dionaea and the joints of the gramine the circumnutating movement
when viewed under the microscope is seen to consist of innumerable
small oscillations the part under observation suddenly jerks forwards
for a length of 002 to 001 of an inch and then slowly retreats for a
part of this distance after a few seconds it again jerks forwards but
with many intermissions the retreating movement apparently is due to
the elasticity of the resisting tissues how far this oscillatory
movement is general we do not know as not many circumnutating plants
were observed by us under the microscope but no such movement could be
detected in the case of drosera with a 2inch objectglass which we
used the phenomenon is a remarkable one the whole hypocotyl of a
cabbage or the whole leaf of a dionaea could not jerk forwards unless a
very large number of cells on one side were simultaneously affected
are we to suppose that these cells steadily become more and more
turgescent on one side until the part suddenly yields and bends
inducing what may be called a microscopically minute earthquake in the
plant or do the cells on one side suddenly become turgescent in an
intermittent manner each forward movement thus caused being opposed by
the elasticity of the tissues
circumnutation is of paramount importance in the life of every plant
for it is through its modification that many highly beneficial or
necessary movements have been acquired when light strikes one side of
a plant or light changes into darkness or when gravitation acts on a
displaced part the plant is enabled in some unknown manner to increase
the always varying turgescence of the cells on one side so that the
ordinary circumnutating movement is
modified and the part bends either to or from the exciting cause or
it may occupy a new position as in the socalled sleep of leaves the
influence which modifies circumnutation may be transmitted from one
part to another innate or constitutional changes independently of any
external agency often modify the circumnutating movements at
particular periods of the life of the plant as circumnutation is
universally present we can understand how it is that movements of the
same kind have been developed in the most distinct members of the
vegetable series but it must not be supposed that all the movements of
plants arise from modified circumnutation for as we shall presently
see there is reason to believe that this is not the case
having made these few preliminary remarks we will in imagination take
a germinating seed and consider the part which the various movements
play in the lifehistory of the plant the first change is the
protrusion of the radicle which begins at once to circumnutate this
movement is immediately modified by the attraction of gravity and
rendered geotropic the radicle therefore supposing the seed to be
lying on the surface quickly bends downwards following a more or less
spiral course as was seen on the smoked glassplates sensitiveness to
gravitation resides in the tip and it is the tip which transmits some
influence to the adjoining parts causing them to bend as soon as the
tip protected by the rootcap reaches the ground it penetrates the
surface if this be soft or friable and the act of penetration is
apparently aided by the rocking or circumnutating movement of the whole
end of the radicle if the surface is compact and cannot easily be
penetrated then
the seed itself unless it be a heavy one is displaced or lifted up by
the continued growth and elongation of the radicle but in a state of
nature seeds often get covered with earth or other matter or fall into
crevices etc and thus a point of resistance is afforded and the tip
can more easily penetrate the ground but even with seeds lying loose
on the surface there is another aid a multitude of excessively fine
hairs are emitted from the upper part of the radicle and these attach
themselves firmly to stones or other objects lying on the surface and
can do so even to glass and thus the upper part is held down whilst
the tip presses against and penetrates the ground the attachment of
the roothairs is effected by the liquefaction of the outer surface of
the cellulose walls and by the subsequent setting hard of the
liquefied matter this curious process probably takes place not for
the sake of the attachment of the radicles to superficial objects but
in order that the hairs may be brought into the closest contact with
the particles in the soil by which means they can absorb the layer of
water surrounding them together with any dissolved matter
after the tip has penetrated the ground to a little depth the
increasing thickness of the radicle together with the roothairs hold
it securely in its place and now the force exerted by the longitudinal
growth of the radicle drives the tip deeper into the ground this
force combined with that due to transverse growth gives to the
radicle the power of a wedge even a growing root of moderate size
such as that of a seedling bean can displace a weight of some pounds
it is not probable that the tip when buried in compact earth can
actually circumnutate and thus aid its downward passage but the
circumnutating movement will facilitate the tip entering any lateral
or oblique fissure in the earth or a burrow made by an earthworm or
larva and it is certain that roots often run down the old burrows of
worms the tip however in endeavouring to circumnutate will
continually press against the earth on all sides and this can hardly
fail to be of the highest importance to the plant for we have seen
that when little bits of cardlike paper and of very thin paper were
cemented on opposite sides of the tip the whole growing part of the
radicle was excited to bend away from the side bearing the card or more
resisting substance towards the side bearing the thin paper we may
therefore feel almost sure that when the tip encounters a stone or
other obstacle in the ground or even earth more compact on one side
than the other the root will bend away as much as it can from the
obstacle or the more resisting earth and will thus follow with
unerring skill a line of least resistance
the tip is more sensitive to prolonged contact with an object than to
gravitation when this acts obliquely on the radicle and sometimes even
when it acts in the most favourable direction at right angles to the
radicle the tip was excited by an attached bead of shellac weighing
less than 1200th of a grain 033 mg it is therefore more sensitive
than the most delicate tendril namely that of passiflora gracilis
which was barely acted on by a bit of wire weighing 150th of a grain
but this degree of sensitiveness is as nothing compared with that of
the glands of drosera for these are excited by particles weighing only
178740 of a grain the sensitiveness of the tip cannot be accounted
for by its being covered by a thinner layer of tissue than the other
parts for it is protected by the relatively thick rootcap it is
remarkable that although the radicle bends away when one side of the
tip is slightly touched
with caustic yet if the side be much cauterised the injury is too
great and the power of transmitting some influence to the adjoining
parts causing them to bend is lost other analogous cases are known to
occur
after a radicle has been deflected by some obstacle geotropism directs
the tip again to grow perpendicularly downwards but geotropism is a
feeble power and here as sachs has shown another interesting
adaptive movement comes into play for radicles at a distance of a few
millimeters from the tip are sensitive to prolonged contact in such a
manner that they bend towards the touching object instead of from it
as occurs when an object touches one side of the tip moreover the
curvature thus caused is abrupt the pressed part alone bending even
slight pressure suffices such as a bit of card cemented to one side
therefore a radicle as it passes over the edge of any obstacle in the
ground will through the action of geotropism press against it and
this pressure will cause the radicle to endeavour to bend abruptly over
the edge it will thus recover as quickly as possible its normal
downward course
radicles are also sensitive to air which contains more moisture on one
side than the other and they bend towards its source it is therefore
probable that they are in like manner sensitive to dampness in the
soil it was ascertained in several cases that this sensitiveness
resides in the tip which transmits an influence causing the adjoining
upper part to bend in opposition to geotropism towards the moist
object we may therefore infer that roots will be deflected from their
downward course towards any source of moisture in the soil
again most or all radicles are slightly sensitive to light and
according to wiesner generally bend a little
from it whether this can be of any service to them is very doubtful
but with seeds germinating on the surface it will slightly aid
geotropism in directing the radicles to the ground1 we ascertained
in one instance that such sensitiveness resided in the tip and caused
the adjoining parts to bend from the light the subarial roots
observed by wiesner were all apheliotropic and this no doubt is of
use in bringing them into contact with trunks of trees or surfaces of
rock as is their habit
 1 dr karl richter who has especially attended to this subject k
 akad der wissenschaften in wien 1879 p 149 states that
 apheliotropism does not aid radicles in penetrating the ground
we thus see that with seedling plants the tip of the radicle is endowed
with diverse kinds of sensitiveness and that the tip directs the
adjoining growing parts to bend to or from the exciting cause
according to the needs of the plant the sides of the radicle are also
sensitive to contact but in a widely different manner gravitation
though a less powerful cause of movement than the other above specified
stimuli is ever present so that it ultimately prevails and determines
the downward growth of the root
the primary radicle emits secondary ones which project
subhorizontally and these were observed in one case to circumnutate
their tips are also sensitive to contact and they are thus excited to
bend away from any touching object so that they resemble in these
respects as far as they were observed the primary radicles if
displaced they resume as sachs has shown their original
subhorizontal position and this apparently is due to diageotropism
the secondary radicles emit tertiary ones but these in the case of
the bean are not affected by gravitation consequently they protrude
in all directions thus the general
arrangement of the three orders of roots is excellently adapted for
searching the whole soil for nutriment
sachs has shown that if the tip of the primary radicle is cut off and
the tip will occasionally be gnawed off with seedlings in a state of
nature one of the secondary radicles grows perpendicularly downwards
in a manner which is analogous to the upward growth of a lateral shoot
after the amputation of the leading shoot we have seen with radicles
of the bean that if the primary radicle is merely compressed instead of
being cut off so that an excess of sap is directed into the secondary
radicles their natural condition is disturbed and they grow downwards
other analogous facts have been given as anything which disturbs the
constitution is apt to lead to reversion that is to the resumption of
a former character it appears probable that when secondary radicles
grow downwards or lateral shoots upwards they revert to the primary
manner of growth proper to radicles and shoots
with dicotyledonous seeds after the protrusion of the radicle the
hypocotyl breaks through the seedcoats but if the cotyledons are
hypogean it is the epicotyl which breaks forth these organs are at
first invariably arched with the upper part bent back parallel to the
lower and they retain this form until they have risen above the
ground in some cases however it is the petioles of the cotyledons or
of the first true leaves which break through the seedcoats as well as
the ground before any part of the stem protrudes and then the
petioles are almost invariably arched we have met with only one
exception and that only a partial one namely with the petioles of
the two first leaves of acanthus candelabrum with delphinium nudicaule
the petioles of the two cotyledons are
completely confluent and they break through the ground as an arch
afterwards the petioles of the successively formed early leaves are
arched and they are thus enabled to break through the base of the
confluent petioles of the cotyledons in the case of megarrhiza it is
the plumule which breaks as an arch through the tube formed by the
confluence of the cotyledonpetioles with mature plants the
flowerstems and the leaves of some few species and the rachis of
several ferns as they emerge separately from the ground are likewise
arched
the fact of so many different organs in plants of many kinds breaking
through the ground under the form of an arch shows that this must be
in some manner highly important to them according to haberlandt the
tender growing apex is thus saved from abrasion and this is probably
the true explanation but as both legs of the arch grow their power of
breaking through the ground will be much increased as long as the tip
remains within the seedcoats and has a point of support in the case
of monocotyledons the plumule or cotyledon is rarely arched as far as
we have seen but this is the case with the leaflike cotyledon of the
onion and the crown of the arch is here strengthened by a special
protuberance in the gramine the summit of the straight sheathlike
cotyledon is developed into a hard sharp crest which evidently serves
for breaking through the earth with dicotyledons the arching of the
epicotyl or hypocotyl often appears as if it merely resulted from the
manner in which the parts are packed within the seed but it is
doubtful whether this is the whole of the truth in any case and it
certainly was not so in several cases in which the arching was seen to
commence after the parts had wholly
escaped from the seedcoats as the arching occurred in whatever
position the seeds were placed it is no doubt due to temporarily
increased growth of the nature of epinasty or hyponasty along one side
of the part
as this habit of the hypocotyl to arch itself appears to be universal
it is probably of very ancient origin it is therefore not surprising
that it should be inherited at least to some extent by plants having
hypogean cotyledons in which the hypocotyl is only slightly developed
and never protrudes above the ground and in which the arching is of
course now quite useless this tendency explains as we have seen the
curvature of the hypocotyl and the consequent movement of the radicle
which was first observed by sachs and which we have often had to refer
to as sachs curvature
the several foregoing arched organs are continually circumnutating or
endeavouring to circumnutate even before they break through the
ground as soon as any part of the arch protrudes from the seedcoats
it is acted upon by apogeotropism and both the legs bend upwards as
quickly as the surrounding earth will permit until the arch stands
vertically by continued growth it then forcibly breaks through the
ground but as it is continually striving to circumnutate this will aid
its emergence in some slight degree for we know that a circumnutating
hypocotyl can push away damp sand on all sides as soon as the faintest
ray of light reaches a seedling heliotropism will guide it through any
crack in the soil or through an entangled mass of overlying
vegetation for apogeotropism by itself can direct the seedling only
blindly upwards hence probably it is that sensitiveness to light
resides in the tip of the cotyledons of the gramine and in
the upper part of the hypocotyls of at least some plants
as the arch grows upwards the cotyledons are dragged out of the ground
the seedcoats are either left behind buried or are retained for a
time still enclosing the cotyledons these are afterwards cast off
merely by the swelling of the cotyledons but with most of the
cucurbitace there is a curious special contrivance for bursting the
seedcoats whilst beneath the ground namely a peg at the base of the
hypocotyl projecting at right angles which holds down the lower half
of the seedcoats whilst the growth of the arched part of the
hypocotyl lifts up the upper half and thus splits them in twain a
somewhat analogous structure occurs in mimosa pudica and some other
plants before the cotyledons are fully expanded and have diverged the
hypocotyl generally straightens itself by increased growth along the
concave side thus reversing the process which caused the arching
ultimately not a trace of the former curvature is left except in the
case of the leaflike cotyledons of the onion
the cotyledons can now assume the function of leaves and decompose
carbonic acid they also yield up to other parts of the plant the
nutriment which they often contain when they contain a large stock of
nutriment they generally remain buried beneath the ground owing to the
small development of the hypocotyl and thus they have a better chance
of escaping destruction by animals from unknown causes nutriment is
sometimes stored in the hypocotyl or in the radicle and then one of
the cotyledons or both become rudimentary of which several instances
have been given it is probable that the extraordinary manner of
germination of megarrhiza californica
ipoma leptophylla and pandurata and of quercus virens is
connected with the burying of the tuberlike roots which at an early
age are stocked with nutriment for in these plants it is the petioles
of the cotyledons which first protrude from the seeds and they are
then merely tipped with a minute radicle and hypocotyl these petioles
bend down geotropically like a root and penetrate the ground so that
the true root which afterwards becomes greatly enlarged is buried at
some little depth beneath the surface gradations of structure are
always interesting and asa gray informs us that with ipoma jalappa
which likewise forms huge tubers the hypocotyl is still of
considerable length and the petioles of the cotyledons are only
moderately elongated but in addition to the advantage gained by the
concealment of the nutritious matter stored within the tubers the
plumule at least in the case of megarrhiza is protected from the
frosts of winter by being buried
with many dicotyledonous seedlings as has lately been described by de
vries the contraction of the parenchyma of the upper part of the
radicle drags the hypocotyl downwards into the earth sometimes it is
said until even the cotyledons are buried the hypocotyl itself of
some species contracts in a like manner it is believed that this
burying process serves to protect the seedlings against the frosts of
winter
our imaginary seedling is now mature as a seedling for its hypocotyl
is straight and its cotyledons are fully expanded in this state the
upper part of the hypocotyl and the cotyledons continue for some time
to circumnutate generally to a wide extent relatively to the size of
the parts and at a rapid rate but seedlings profit by this power of
movement only when it is modified especially by the action of light
and
gravitation for they are thus enabled to move more rapidly and to a
greater extent than can most mature plants seedlings are subjected to
a severe struggle for life and it appears to be highly important to
them that they should adapt themselves as quickly and as perfectly as
possible to their conditions hence also it is that they are so
extremely sensitive to light and gravitation the cotyledons of some
few species are sensitive to a touch but it is probable that this is
only an indirect result of the foregoing kinds of sensitiveness for
there is no reason to believe that they profit by moving when touched
our seedling now throws up a stem bearing leaves and often branches
all of which whilst young are continually circumnutating if we look
for instance at a great acacia tree we may feel assured that every
one of the innumerable growing shoots is constantly describing small
ellipses as is each petiole subpetiole and leaflet the latter as
well as ordinary leaves generally move up and down in nearly the same
vertical plane so that they describe very narrow ellipses the
flowerpeduncles are likewise continually circumnutating if we could
look beneath the ground and our eyes had the power of a microscope we
should see the tip of each rootlet endeavouring to sweep small ellipses
or circles as far as the pressure of the surrounding earth permitted
all this astonishing amount of movement has been going on year after
year since the time when as a seedling the tree first emerged from
the ground
stems are sometimes developed into long runners or stolons these
circumnutate in a conspicuous manner and are thus aided in passing
between and over surrounding obstacles but whether the circumnutating
movement has been increased for this special purpose is doubtful
we have now to consider circumnutation in a modified form as the
source of several great classes of movement the modification may be
determined by innate causes or by external agencies under the first
head we see leaves which when first unfolded stand in a vertical
position and gradually bend downwards as they grow older we see
flowerpeduncles bending down after the flower has withered and others
rising up or again stems with their tips at first bowed downwards so
as to be hooked afterwards straightening themselves and many other
such cases these changes of position which are due to epinasty or
hyponasty occur at certain periods of the life of the plant and are
independent of any external agency they are effected not by a
continuous upward or downward movement but by a succession of small
ellipses or by zigzag linesthat is by a circumnutating movement
which is preponderant in some one direction
again climbing plants whilst young circumnutate in the ordinary
manner but as soon as the stem has grown to a certain height which is
different for different species it elongates rapidly and now the
amplitude of the circumnutating movement is immensely increased
evidently to favour the stem catching hold of a support the stem also
circumnutates rather more equally to all sides than in the case of
nonclimbing plants this is conspicuously the case with those tendrils
which consist of modified leaves as these sweep wide circles whilst
ordinary leaves usually circumnutate nearly in the same vertical plane
flowerpeduncles when converted into tendrils have their circumnutating
movement in like manner greatly increased
we now come to our second group of
circumnutating movementsthose modified through external agencies the
socalled sleep or nyctitropic movements of leaves are determined by
the daily alternations of light and darkness it is not the darkness
which excites them to move but the difference in the amount of light
which they receive during the day and night for with several species
if the leaves have not been brightly illuminated during the day they
do not sleep at night they inherit however some tendency to move at
the proper periods independently of any change in the amount of light
the movements are in some cases extraordinarily complex but as a full
summary has been given in the chapter devoted to this subject we will
here say but little on this head leaves and cotyledons assume their
nocturnal position by two means by the aid of pulvini and without such
aid in the former case the movement continues as long as the leaf or
cotyledon remains in full health whilst in the latter case it
continues only whilst the part is growing cotyledons appear to sleep
in a larger proportional number of species than do leaves in some
species the leaves sleep and not the cotyledons in others the
cotyledons and not the leaves or both may sleep and yet assume widely
different positions at night
although the nyctitropic movements of leaves and cotyledons are
wonderfully diversified and sometimes differ much in the species of
the same genus yet the blade is always placed in such a position at
night that its upper surface is exposed as little as possible to full
radiation we cannot doubt that this is the object gained by these
movements and it has been proved that leaves exposed to a clear sky
with their blades compelled to remain horizontal suffered much more
from the cold than others which were allowed to assume
their proper vertical position some curious facts have been given
under this head showing that horizontally extended leaves suffered
more at night when the air which is not cooled by radiation was
prevented from freely circulating beneath their lower surfaces and so
it was when the leaves were allowed to go to sleep on branches which
had been rendered motionless in some species the petioles rise up
greatly at night and the pinnae close together the whole plant is
thus rendered more compact and a much smaller surface is exposed to
radiation
that the various nyctitropic movements of leaves result from modified
circumnutation has we think been clearly shown in the simplest cases
a leaf describes a single large ellipse during the 24 h and the
movement is so arranged that the blade stands vertically during the
night and reassumes its former position on the following morning the
course pursued differs from ordinary circumnutation only in its greater
amplitude and in its greater rapidity late in the evening and early on
the following morning unless this movement is admitted to be one of
circumnutation such leaves do not circumnutate at all and this would
be a monstrous anomaly in other cases leaves and cotyledons describe
several vertical ellipses during the 24 h and in the evening one of
them is increased greatly in amplitude until the blade stands
vertically either upwards or downwards in this position it continues
to circumnutate until the following morning when it reassumes its
former position these movements when a pulvinus is present are often
complicated by the rotation of the leaf or leaflet and such rotation
on a small scale occurs during ordinary circumnutation the many
diagrams showing the movements of sleeping and nonsleeping leaves and
cotyledons should be compared and it will be seen that they are
essentially alike ordinary circumnutation is converted into a
nyctitropic movement firstly by an increase in its amplitude but not
to so great a degree as in the case of climbing plants and secondly by
its being rendered periodic in relation to the alternations of day and
night but there is frequently a distinct trace of periodicity in the
circumnutating movements of nonsleeping leaves and cotyledons the
fact that nyctitropic movements occur in species distributed in many
families throughout the whole vascular series is intelligible if they
result from the modification of the universally present movement of
circumnutation otherwise the fact is inexplicable
in the seventh chapter we have given the case of a porlieria the
leaflets of which remained closed all day as if asleep when the plant
was kept dry apparently for the sake of checking evaporation
something of the same kind occurs with certain gramine at the close
of this same chapter a few observations were appended on what may be
called the embryology of leaves the leaves produced by young shoots on
cutdown plants of melilotus taurica slept like those of a trifolium
whilst the leaves on the older branches on the same plants slept in a
very different manner proper to the genus and from the reasons
assigned we are tempted to look at this case as one of reversion to a
former nyctitropic habit so again with desmodium gyrans the absence
of small lateral leaflets on very young plants makes us suspect that
the immediate progenitor of this species did not possess lateral
leaflets and that their appearance in an almost rudimentary condition
at a somewhat more advanced age is the result of reversion to a
trifoliate predecessor however this may be the rapid circumnutating
or
gyrating movements of the little lateral leaflets seem to be due
proximately to the pulvinus or organ of movement not having been
reduced nearly so much as the blade during the successive
modifications through which the species has passed
we now come to the highly important class of movements due to the
action of a lateral light when stems leaves or other organs are
placed so that one side is illuminated more brightly than the other
they bend towards the light this heliotropic movement manifestly
results from the modification of ordinary circumnutation and every
gradation between the two movements could be followed when the light
was dim and only a very little brighter on one side than on the other
the movement consisted of a succession of ellipses directed towards
the light each of which approached nearer to its source than the
previous one when the difference in the light on the two sides was
somewhat greater the ellipses were drawn out into a stronglymarked
zigzag line and when much greater the course became rectilinear we
have reason to believe that changes in the turgescence of the cells is
the proximate cause of the movement of circumnutation and it appears
that when a plant is unequally illuminated on the two sides the always
changing turgescence is augmented along one side and is weakened or
quite arrested along the other sides increased turgescence is commonly
followed by increased growth so that a plant which has bent itself
towards the light during the day would be fixed in this position were
it not for apogeotropism acting during the night but parts provided
with pulvini bend as pfeffer has shown towards the light and here
growth does not come into play any more than in the ordinary
circumnutating movements of pulvini
heliotropism prevails widely throughout the vegetable kingdom but
whenever from the changed habits of life of any plant such movements
become injurious or useless the tendency is easily eliminated as we
see with climbing and insectivorous plants
apheliotropic movements are comparatively rare in a wellmarked degree
excepting with subarial roots in the two cases investigated by us
the movement certainly consisted of modified circumnutation
the position which leaves and cotyledons occupy during the day namely
more or less transversely to the direction of the light is due
according to frank to what we call diaheliotropism as all leaves and
cotyledons are continually circumnutating there can hardly be a doubt
that diaheliotropism results from modified circumnutation from the
fact of leaves and cotyledons frequently rising a little in the
evening it appears as if diaheliotropism had to conquer during the
middle of the day a widely prevalent tendency to apogeotropism
lastly the leaflets and cotyledons of some plants are known to be
injured by too much light and when the sun shines brightly on them
they move upwards or downwards or twist laterally so that they direct
their edges towards the light and thus they escape being injured
these paraheliotropic movements certainly consisted in one case of
modified circumnutation and so it probably is in all cases for the
leaves of all the species described circumnutate in a conspicuous
manner this movement has hitherto been observed only with leaflets
provided with pulvini in which the increased turgescence on opposite
sides is not followed by growth and we can understand why this should
be so as the movement is required only for a temporary purpose it
would manifestly be
disadvantageous for the leaf to be fixed by growth in its inclined
position for it has to assume its former horizontal position as soon
as possible after the sun has ceased shining too brightly on it
the extreme sensitiveness of certain seedlings to light as shown in
our ninth chapter is highly remarkable the cotyledons of phalaris
became curved towards a distant lamp which emitted so little light
that a pencil held vertically close to the plants did not cast any
shadow which the eye could perceive on a white card these cotyledons
therefore were affected by a difference in the amount of light on
their two sides which the eye could not distinguish the degree of
their curvature within a given time towards a lateral light did not
correspond at all strictly with the amount of light which they
received the light not being at any time in excess they continued for
nearly half an hour to bend towards a lateral light after it had been
extinguished they bend with remarkable precision towards it and this
depends on the illumination of one whole side or on the obscuration of
the whole opposite side the difference in the amount of light which
plants at any time receive in comparison with what they have shortly
before received seems in all cases to be the chief exciting cause of
those movements which are influenced by light thus seedlings brought
out of darkness bend towards a dim lateral light sooner than others
which had previously been exposed to daylight we have seen several
analogous cases with the nyctitropic movements of leaves a striking
instance was observed in the case of the periodic movements of the
cotyledons of a cassia in the morning a pot was placed in an obscure
part of a room and all the cotyledons rose up closed another pot had
stood in the sunlight and
the cotyledons of course remained expanded both pots were now placed
close together in the middle of the room and the cotyledons which had
been exposed to the sun immediately began to close while the others
opened so that the cotyledons in the two pots moved in exactly
opposite directions whilst exposed to the same degree of light
we found that if seedlings kept in a dark place were laterally
illuminated by a small wax taper for only two or three minutes at
intervals of about threequarters of an hour they all became bowed to
the point where the taper had been held we felt much surprised at this
fact and until we had read wiesners observations we attributed it to
the aftereffects of the light but he has shown that the same degree
of curvature in a plant may be induced in the course of an hour by
several interrupted illuminations lasting altogether for 20 m as by a
continuous illumination of 60 m we believe that this case as well as
our own may be explained by the excitement from light being due not so
much to its actual amount as to the difference in amount from that
previously received and in our case there were repeated alternations
from complete darkness to light in this and in several of the above
specified respects light seems to act on the tissues of plants almost
in the same manner as it does on the nervous system of animals there
is a much more striking analogy of the same kind in the sensitiveness
to light being localised in the tips of the cotyledons of phalaris and
avena and in the upper part of the hypocotyls of brassica and beta
and in the transmission of some influence from these upper to the lower
parts causing the latter to bend towards the light this influence is
also
transmitted beneath the soil to a depth where no light enters it
follows from this localisation that the lower parts of the cotyledons
of phalaris etc which normally become more bent towards a lateral
light than the upper parts may be brightly illuminated during many
hours and will not bend in the least if all light be excluded from
the tip it is an interesting experiment to place caps over the tips of
the cotyledons of phalaris and to allow a very little light to enter
through minute orifices on one side of the caps for the lower part of
the cotyledons will then bend to this side and not to the side which
has been brightly illuminated during the whole time in the case of the
radicles of sinapis alba sensitiveness to light also resides in the
tip which when laterally illuminated causes the adjoining part of
the root to bend apheliotropically
gravitation excites plants to bend away from the centre of the earth
or towards it or to place themselves in a transverse position with
respect to it although it is impossible to modify in any direct manner
the attraction of gravity yet its influence could be moderated
indirectly in the several ways described in the tenth chapter and
under such circumstances the same kind of evidence as that given in the
chapter on heliotropism showed in the plainest manner that
apogeotropic and geotropic and probably diageotropic movements are
all modified forms of circumnutation
different parts of the same plant and different species are affected by
gravitation in widely different degrees and manners some plants and
organs exhibit hardly a trace of its action young seedlings which as
we know circumnutate rapidly are eminently sensitive and we have
seen the hypocotyl of beta bending
upwards through 109 in 3 h 8 m the aftereffects of apogeotropism
last for above half an hour and horizontallylaid hypocotyls are
sometimes thus carried temporarily beyond an upright position the
benefits derived from geotropism apogeotropism and diageotropism are
generally so manifest that they need not be specified with the
flowerpeduncles of oxalis epinasty causes them to bend down so that
the ripening pods may be protected by the calyx from the rain
afterwards they are carried upwards by apogeotropism in combination
with hyponasty and are thus enabled to scatter their seeds over a
wider space the capsules and flowerheads of some plants are bowed
downwards through geotropism and they then bury themselves in the
earth for the protection and slow maturation of the seeds this burying
process is much facilitated by the rocking movement due to
circumnutation
in the case of the radicles of several probably of all seedling
plants sensitiveness to gravitation is confined to the tip which
transmits an influence to the adjoining upper part causing it to bend
towards the centre of the earth that there is transmission of this
kind was proved in an interesting manner when horizontally extended
radicles of the bean were exposed to the attraction of gravity for 1 or
1 h and their tips were then amputated within this time no trace of
curvature was exhibited and the radicles were now placed pointing
vertically downwards but an influence had already been transmitted
from the tip to the adjoining part for it soon became bent to one
side in the same manner as would have occurred had the radicle
remained horizontal and been still acted on by geotropism radicles
thus treated continued to grow out horizontally for two or three days
until a new tip was
reformed and this was then acted on by geotropism and the radicle
became curved perpendicularly downwards
it has now been shown that the following important classes of movement
all arise from modified circumnutation which is omnipresent whilst
growth lasts and after growth has ceased whenever pulvini are
present these classes of movement consist of those due to epinasty and
hyponastythose proper to climbing plants commonly called revolving
nutationthe nyctitropic or sleep movements of leaves and
cotyledonsand the two immense classes of movement excited by light
and gravitation when we speak of modified circumnutation we mean that
light or the alternations of light and darkness gravitation slight
pressure or other irritants and certain innate or constitutional
states of the plant do not directly cause the movement they merely
lead to a temporary increase or diminution of those spontaneous changes
in the turgescence of the cells which are already in progress in what
manner light gravitation etc act on the cells is not known and we
will here only remark that if any stimulus affected the cells in such
a manner as to cause some slight tendency in the affected part to bend
in a beneficial manner this tendency might easily be increased through
the preservation of the more sensitive individuals but if such bending
were injurious the tendency would be eliminated unless it was
overpoweringly strong for we know how commonly all characters in all
organisms vary nor can we see any reason to doubt that after the
complete elimination of a tendency to bend in some one direction under
a certain stimulus the power to bend in a directly
opposite direction might gradually be acquired through natural
selection2
 2 see the remarks in franks die wagerechte richtung von
 pflanzentheilen 1870 pp 90 91 etc on natural selection in
 connection with geotropism heliotropism etc
although so many movements have arisen through modified circumnutation
there are others which appear to have had a quite independent origin
but they do not form such large and important classes when a leaf of a
mimosa is touched it suddenly assumes the same position as when asleep
but brucke has shown that this movement results from a different state
of turgescence in the cells from that which occurs during sleep and as
sleepmovements are certainly due to modified circumnutation those
from a touch can hardly be thus due the back of a leaf of drosera
rotundifolia was cemented to the summit of a stick driven into the
ground so that it could not move in the least and a tentacle was
observed during many hours under the microscope but it exhibited no
circumnutating movement yet after being momentarily touched with a bit
of raw meat its basal part began to curve in 23 seconds this curving
movement therefore could not have resulted from modified
circumnutation but when a small object such as a fragment of a
bristle was placed on one side of the tip of a radicle which we know
is continually circumnutating the induced curvature was so similar to
the movement caused by geotropism that we can hardly doubt that it is
due to modified circumnutation a flower of a mahonia was cemented to a
stick and the stamens exhibited no signs of circumnutation under the
microscope yet when they were lightly touched they suddenly moved
towards the pistil lastly the curling of the extremity of a tendril
when
touched seems to be independent of its revolving or circumnutating
movement this is best shown by the part which is the most sensitive to
contact circumnutating much less than the lower parts or apparently
not at all3
 3 for the evidence on this head see the movements and habits of
 climbing plants 1875 pp 173 174
although in these cases we have no reason to believe that the movement
depends on modified circumnutation as with the several classes of
movement described in this volume yet the difference between the two
sets of cases may not be so great as it at first appears in the one
set an irritant causes an increase or diminution in the turgescence of
the cells which are already in a state of change whilst in the other
set the irritant first starts a similar change in their state of
turgescence why a touch slight pressure or any other irritant such
as electricity heat or the absorption of animal matter should modify
the turgescence of the affected cells in such a manner as to cause
movement we do not know but a touch acts in this manner so often and
on such widely distinct plants that the tendency seems to be a very
general one and if beneficial it might be increased to any extent in
other cases a touch produces a very different effect as with nitella
in which the protoplasm may be seen to recede from the walls of the
cell in lactuca in which a milky fluid exudes and in the tendrils of
certain vitaceae cucurbitace and bignoniaceae in which slight
pressure causes a cellular outgrowth
finally it is impossible not to be struck with the resemblance between
the foregoing movements of plants and many of the actions performed
unconsciously by the lower animals4 with plants an
astonishingly small stimulus suffices and even with allied plants one
may be highly sensitive to the slightest continued pressure and
another highly sensitive to a slight momentary touch the habit of
moving at certain periods is inherited both by plants and animals and
several other points of similitude have been specified but the most
striking resemblance is the localisation of their sensitiveness and
the transmission of an influence from the excited part to another which
consequently moves yet plants do not of course possess nerves or a
central nervous system and we may infer that with animals such
structures serve only for the more perfect transmission of impressions
and for the more complete intercommunication of the several parts

we believe that there is no structure in plants more wonderful as far
as its functions are concerned than the tip of the radicle if the tip
be lightly pressed or burnt or cut it transmits an influence to the
upper adjoining part causing it to bend away from the affected side
and what is more surprising the tip can distinguish between a
slightly harder and softer object by which it is simultaneously
pressed on opposite sides if however the radicle is pressed by a
similar object a little above the tip the pressed part does not
transmit any influence to the more distant parts but bends abruptly
towards the object if the tip perceives the air to be moister on one
side than on the other it likewise transmits an influence to the upper
adjoining part which bends towards the source of moisture when the
tip is excited by light though
in the case of radicles this was ascertained in only a single instance
the adjoining part bends from the light but when excited by
gravitation the same part bends towards the centre of gravity in
almost every case we can clearly perceive the final purpose or
advantage of the several movements two or perhaps more of the
exciting causes often act simultaneously on the tip and one conquers
the other no doubt in accordance with its importance for the life of
the plant the course pursued by the radicle in penetrating the ground
must be determined by the tip hence it has acquired such diverse kinds
of sensitiveness it is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of
the radicle thus endowed and having the power of directing the
movements of the adjoining parts acts like the brain of one of the
lower animals the brain being seated within the anterior end of the
body receiving impressions from the senseorgans and directing the
several movements
