ion
by plato
translated by benjamin jowett
introduction
the ion is the shortest or nearly the shortest of all the writings
which bear the name of plato and is not authenticated by any early
external testimony the grace and beauty of this little work supply the
only and perhaps a sufficient proof of its genuineness the plan is
simple the dramatic interest consists entirely in the contrast
between the irony of socrates and the transparent vanity and childlike
enthusiasm of the rhapsode ion the theme of the dialogue may possibly
have been suggested by the passage of xenophons memorabilia in which
the rhapsodists are described by euthydemus as very precise about the
exact words of homer but very idiotic themselves compare aristotle
met
ion the rhapsode has just come to athens he has been exhibiting in
epidaurus at the festival of asclepius and is intending to exhibit
at the festival of the panathenaea socrates admires and envies the
rhapsodes art for he is always well dressed and in good companyin
the company of good poets and of homer who is the prince of them in
the course of conversation the admission is elicited from ion that his
skill is restricted to homer and that he knows nothing of inferior
poets such as hesiod and archilochushe brightens up and is wide
awake when homer is being recited but is apt to go to sleep at the
recitations of any other poet and yet surely he who knows the
superior ought to know the inferior alsohe who can judge of the good
speaker is able to judge of the bad and poetry is a whole and he
who judges of poetry by rules of art ought to be able to judge of
all poetry this is confirmed by the analogy of sculpture painting
fluteplaying and the other arts the argument is at last brought home
to the mind of ion who asks how this contradiction is to be solved the
solution given by socrates is as follows
the rhapsode is not guided by rules of art but is an inspired person
who derives a mysterious power from the poet and the poet in like
manner is inspired by the god the poets and their interpreters may be
compared to a chain of magnetic rings suspended from one another and
from a magnet the magnet is the muse and the ring which immediately
follows is the poet himself from him are suspended other poets there
is also a chain of rhapsodes and actors who also hang from the muses
but are let down at the side and the last ring of all is the spectator
the poet is the inspired interpreter of the god and this is the reason
why some poets like homer are restricted to a single theme or
like tynnichus are famous for a single poem and the rhapsode is
the inspired interpreter of the poet and for a similar reason some
rhapsodes like ion are the interpreters of single poets
ion is delighted at the notion of being inspired and acknowledges that
he is beside himself when he is performinghis eyes rain tears and his
hair stands on end socrates is of opinion that a man must be mad who
behaves in this way at a festival when he is surrounded by his friends
and there is nothing to trouble him ion is confident that socrates
would never think him mad if he could only hear his embellishments
of homer socrates asks whether he can speak well about everything
in homer yes indeed he can what about things of which he has no
knowledge ion answers that he can interpret anything in homer but
rejoins socrates when homer speaks of the arts as for example of
chariotdriving or of medicine or of prophecy or of navigationwill
he or will the charioteer or physician or prophet or pilot be the
better judge ion is compelled to admit that every man will judge of
his own particular art better than the rhapsode he still maintains
however that he understands the art of the general as well as any one
then why in this city of athens in which men of merit are always being
sought after is he not at once appointed a general ion replies that
he is a foreigner and the athenians and spartans will not appoint a
foreigner to be their general no that is not the real reason there
are many examples to the contrary but ion has long been playing tricks
with the argument like proteus he transforms himself into a variety of
shapes and is at last about to run away in the disguise of a general
would he rather be regarded as inspired or dishonest ion who has no
suspicion of the irony of socrates eagerly embraces the alternative of
inspiration
the ion like the other earlier platonic dialogues is a mixture of jest
and earnest in which no definite result is obtained but some socratic
or platonic truths are allowed dimly to appear
the elements of a true theory of poetry are contained in the notion
that the poet is inspired genius is often said to be unconscious or
spontaneous or a gift of nature that genius is akin to madness is a
popular aphorism of modern times the greatest strength is observed to
have an element of limitation sense or passion are too much for
the dry light of intelligence which mingles with them and becomes
discoloured by them imagination is often at war with reason and fact
the concentration of the mind on a single object or on a single aspect
of human nature overpowers the orderly perception of the whole yet the
feelings too bring truths home to the minds of many who in the way of
reason would be incapable of understanding them reflections of this
kind may have been passing before platos mind when he describes the
poet as inspired or when as in the apology he speaks of poets as the
worst critics of their own writingsanybody taken at random from the
crowd is a better interpreter of them than they are of themselves they
are sacred persons winged and holy things who have a touch of madness
in their composition phaedr and should be treated with every sort
of respect republic but not allowed to live in a wellordered state
like the statesmen in the meno they have a divine instinct but they
are narrow and confused they do not attain to the clearness of ideas
or to the knowledge of poetry or of any other art as a whole
in the protagoras the ancient poets are recognized by protagoras himself
as the original sophists and this family resemblance may be traced in
the ion the rhapsode belongs to the realm of imitation and of opinion
he professes to have all knowledge which is derived by him from homer
just as the sophist professes to have all wisdom which is contained
in his art of rhetoric even more than the sophist he is incapable of
appreciating the commonest logical distinctions he cannot explain the
nature of his own art his great memory contrasts with his inability
to follow the steps of the argument and in his highest moments of
inspiration he has an eye to his own gains
the old quarrel between philosophy and poetry which in the republic
leads to their final separation is already working in the mind of
plato and is embodied by him in the contrast between socrates and ion
yet here as in the republic socrates shows a sympathy with the poetic
nature also the manner in which ion is affected by his own recitations
affords a lively illustration of the power which in the republic
socrates attributes to dramatic performances over the mind of the
performer his allusion to his embellishments of homer in which
he declares himself to have surpassed metrodorus of lampsacus and
stesimbrotus of thasos seems to show that like them he belonged to
the allegorical school of interpreters the circumstance that nothing
more is known of him may be adduced in confirmation of the argument that
this truly platonic little work is not a forgery of later times
ion
persons of the dialogue socrates ion
socrates welcome ion are you from your native city of ephesus
ion no socrates but from epidaurus where i attended the festival of
asclepius
socrates and do the epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the
festival
ion o yes and of all sorts of musical performers
socrates and were you one of the competitorsand did you succeed
ion i obtained the first prize of all socrates
socrates well done and i hope that you will do the same for us at the
panathenaea
ion and i will please heaven
socrates i often envy the profession of a rhapsode ion for you have
always to wear fine clothes and to look as beautiful as you can is a
part of your art then again you are obliged to be continually in the
company of many good poets and especially of homer who is the best
and most divine of them and to understand him and not merely learn
his words by rote is a thing greatly to be envied and no man can be
a rhapsode who does not understand the meaning of the poet for the
rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of the poet to his hearers but
how can he interpret him well unless he knows what he means all this is
greatly to be envied
ion very true socrates interpretation has certainly been the most
laborious part of my art and i believe myself able to speak about
homer better than any man and that neither metrodorus of lampsacus nor
stesimbrotus of thasos nor glaucon nor any one else who ever was had
as good ideas about homer as i have or as many
socrates i am glad to hear you say so ion i see that you will not
refuse to acquaint me with them
ion certainly socrates and you really ought to hear how exquisitely i
render homer i think that the homeridae should give me a golden crown
socrates i shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments
of him at some other time but just now i should like to ask you a
question does your art extend to hesiod and archilochus or to homer
only
ion to homer only he is in himself quite enough
socrates are there any things about which homer and hesiod agree
ion yes in my opinion there are a good many
socrates and can you interpret better what homer says or what hesiod
says about these matters in which they agree
ion i can interpret them equally well socrates where they agree
socrates but what about matters in which they do not agreefor
example about divination of which both homer and hesiod have something
to say
ion very true
socrates would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what
these two poets say about divination not only when they agree but when
they disagree
ion a prophet
socrates and if you were a prophet would you not be able to interpret
them when they disagree as well as when they agree
ion clearly
socrates but how did you come to have this skill about homer only and
not about hesiod or the other poets does not homer speak of the same
themes which all other poets handle is not war his great argument and
does he not speak of human society and of intercourse of men good and
bad skilled and unskilled and of the gods conversing with one another
and with mankind and about what happens in heaven and in the world
below and the generations of gods and heroes are not these the themes
of which homer sings
ion very true socrates
socrates and do not the other poets sing of the same
ion yes socrates but not in the same way as homer
socrates what in a worse way
ion yes in a far worse
socrates and homer in a better way
ion he is incomparably better
socrates and yet surely my dear friend ion in a discussion about
arithmetic where many people are speaking and one speaks better than
the rest there is somebody who can judge which of them is the good
speaker
ion yes
socrates and he who judges of the good will be the same as he who
judges of the bad speakers
ion the same
socrates and he will be the arithmetician
ion yes
socrates well and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food when
many persons are speaking and one speaks better than the rest will
he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from him who
recognizes the worse or the same
ion clearly the same
socrates and who is he and what is his name
ion the physician
socrates and speaking generally in all discussions in which the
subject is the same and many men are speaking will not he who knows the
good know the bad speaker also for if he does not know the bad neither
will he know the good when the same topic is being discussed
ion true
socrates is not the same person skilful in both
ion yes
socrates and you say that homer and the other poets such as hesiod and
archilochus speak of the same things although not in the same way but
the one speaks well and the other not so well
ion yes and i am right in saying so
socrates and if you knew the good speaker you would also know the
inferior speakers to be inferior
ion that is true
socrates then my dear friend can i be mistaken in saying that ion
is equally skilled in homer and in other poets since he himself
acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those who
speak of the same things and that almost all poets do speak of the same
things
ion why then socrates do i lose attention and go to sleep and have
absolutely no ideas of the least value when any one speaks of any
other poet but when homer is mentioned i wake up at once and am all
attention and have plenty to say
socrates the reason my friend is obvious no one can fail to see that
you speak of homer without any art or knowledge if you were able to
speak of him by rules of art you would have been able to speak of all
other poets for poetry is a whole
ion yes
socrates and when any one acquires any other art as a whole the same
may be said of them would you like me to explain my meaning ion
ion yes indeed socrates i very much wish that you would for i love
to hear you wise men talk
socrates o that we were wise ion and that you could truly call us so
but you rhapsodes and actors and the poets whose verses you sing are
wise whereas i am a common man who only speak the truth for consider
what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this which i have saida
thing which any man might say that when a man has acquired a knowledge
of a whole art the enquiry into good and bad is one and the same let
us consider this matter is not the art of painting a whole
ion yes
socrates and there are and have been many painters good and bad
ion yes
socrates and did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing
out the excellences and defects of polygnotus the son of aglaophon but
incapable of criticizing other painters and when the work of any other
painter was produced went to sleep and was at a loss and had no ideas
but when he had to give his opinion about polygnotus or whoever the
painter might be and about him only woke up and was attentive and had
plenty to say
ion no indeed i have never known such a person
socrates or did you ever know of any one in sculpture who was skilful
in expounding the merits of daedalus the son of metion or of epeius
the son of panopeus or of theodorus the samian or of any individual
sculptor but when the works of sculptors in general were produced was
at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say
ion no indeed no more than the other
socrates and if i am not mistaken you never met with any one among
fluteplayers or harpplayers or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who
was able to discourse of olympus or thamyras or orpheus or phemius the
rhapsode of ithaca but was at a loss when he came to speak of ion of
ephesus and had no notion of his merits or defects
ion i cannot deny what you say socrates nevertheless i am conscious
in my own self and the world agrees with me in thinking that i do speak
better and have more to say about homer than any other man but i do not
speak equally well about otherstell me the reason of this
socrates i perceive ion and i will proceed to explain to you what i
imagine to be the reason of this the gift which you possess of speaking
excellently about homer is not an art but as i was just saying an
inspiration there is a divinity moving you like that contained in the
stone which euripides calls a magnet but which is commonly known as
the stone of heraclea this stone not only attracts iron rings but also
imparts to them a similar power of attracting other rings and sometimes
you may see a number of pieces of iron and rings suspended from one
another so as to form quite a long chain and all of them derive their
power of suspension from the original stone in like manner the muse
first of all inspires men herself and from these inspired persons a
chain of other persons is suspended who take the inspiration for all
good poets epic as well as lyric compose their beautiful poems not by
art but because they are inspired and possessed and as the corybantian
revellers when they dance are not in their right mind so the lyric
poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their
beautiful strains but when falling under the power of music and metre
they are inspired and possessed like bacchic maidens who draw milk and
honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of dionysus but
not when they are in their right mind and the soul of the lyric poet
does the same as they themselves say for they tell us that they bring
songs from honeyed fountains culling them out of the gardens and dells
of the muses they like the bees winging their way from flower to
flower and this is true for the poet is a light and winged and holy
thing and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired and
is out of his senses and the mind is no longer in him when he has
not attained to this state he is powerless and is unable to utter his
oracles many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the
actions of men but like yourself when speaking about homer they do
not speak of them by any rules of art they are simply inspired to utter
that to which the muse impels them and that only and when inspired
one of them will make dithyrambs another hymns of praise another
choral strains another epic or iambic versesand he who is good at
one is not good at any other kind of verse for not by art does the poet
sing but by power divine had he learned by rules of art he would have
known how to speak not of one theme only but of all and therefore god
takes away the minds of poets and uses them as his ministers as he
also uses diviners and holy prophets in order that we who hear them
may know them to be speaking not of themselves who utter these priceless
words in a state of unconsciousness but that god himself is the
speaker and that through them he is conversing with us and tynnichus
the chalcidian affords a striking instance of what i am saying he wrote
nothing that any one would care to remember but the famous paean which
is in every ones mouth one of the finest poems ever written simply
an invention of the muses as he himself says for in this way the
god would seem to indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these
beautiful poems are not human or the work of man but divine and the
work of god and that the poets are only the interpreters of the gods by
whom they are severally possessed was not this the lesson which the god
intended to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the
best of songs am i not right ion
ion yes indeed socrates i feel that you are for your words touch
my soul and i am persuaded that good poets by a divine inspiration
interpret the things of the gods to us
socrates and you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets
ion there again you are right
socrates then you are the interpreters of interpreters
ion precisely
socrates i wish you would frankly tell me ion what i am going to ask
of you when you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in the
recitation of some striking passage such as the apparition of odysseus
leaping forth on the floor recognized by the suitors and casting his
arrows at his feet or the description of achilles rushing at hector
or the sorrows of andromache hecuba or priamare you in your right
mind are you not carried out of yourself and does not your soul in
an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places of which you are
speaking whether they are in ithaca or in troy or whatever may be the
scene of the poem
ion that proof strikes home to me socrates for i must frankly confess
that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears and when i speak
of horrors my hair stands on end and my heart throbs
socrates well ion and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice
or festival when he is dressed in holiday attire and has golden
crowns upon his head of which nobody has robbed him appears weeping
or panicstricken in the presence of more than twenty thousand friendly
faces when there is no one despoiling or wronging himis he in his
right mind or is he not
ion no indeed socrates i must say that strictly speaking he is not
in his right mind
socrates and are you aware that you produce similar effects on most of
the spectators
ion only too well for i look down upon them from the stage and behold
the various emotions of pity wonder sternness stamped upon their
countenances when i am speaking and i am obliged to give my very best
attention to them for if i make them cry i myself shall laugh and if i
make them laugh i myself shall cry when the time of payment arrives
socrates do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings
which as i am saying receive the power of the original magnet from
one another the rhapsode like yourself and the actor are intermediate
links and the poet himself is the first of them through all these the
god sways the souls of men in any direction which he pleases and makes
one man hang down from another thus there is a vast chain of dancers
and masters and undermasters of choruses who are suspended as if from
the stone at the side of the rings which hang down from the muse and
every poet has some muse from whom he is suspended and by whom he is
said to be possessed which is nearly the same thing for he is taken
hold of and from these first rings which are the poets depend others
some deriving their inspiration from orpheus others from musaeus but
the greater number are possessed and held by homer of whom ion you
are one and are possessed by homer and when any one repeats the words
of another poet you go to sleep and know not what to say but when any
one recites a strain of homer you wake up in a moment and your
soul leaps within you and you have plenty to say for not by art or
knowledge about homer do you say what you say but by divine inspiration
and by possession just as the corybantian revellers too have a quick
perception of that strain only which is appropriated to the god by whom
they are possessed and have plenty of dances and words for that but
take no heed of any other and you ion when the name of homer is
mentioned have plenty to say and have nothing to say of others you
ask why is this the answer is that you praise homer not by art but
by divine inspiration
ion that is good socrates and yet i doubt whether you will ever have
eloquence enough to persuade me that i praise homer only when i am mad
and possessed and if you could hear me speak of him i am sure you would
never think this to be the case
socrates i should like very much to hear you but not until you have
answered a question which i have to ask on what part of homer do you
speak wellnot surely about every part
ion there is no part socrates about which i do not speak well of
that i can assure you
socrates surely not about things in homer of which you have no
knowledge
ion and what is there in homer of which i have no knowledge
socrates why does not homer speak in many passages about arts for
example about driving if i can only remember the lines i will repeat
them
ion i remember and will repeat them
socrates tell me then what nestor says to antilochus his son
where he bids him be careful of the turn at the horserace in honour of
patroclus
ion bend gently he says in the polished chariot to the left of
them and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice and
slacken the rein and when you are at the goal let the left horse draw
near yet so that the nave of the wellwrought wheel may not even seem
to touch the extremity and avoid catching the stone il
socrates enough now ion will the charioteer or the physician be the
better judge of the propriety of these lines
ion the charioteer clearly
socrates and will the reason be that this is his art or will there be
any other reason
ion no that will be the reason
socrates and every art is appointed by god to have knowledge of a
certain work for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not
know by the art of medicine
ion certainly not
socrates nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know
by the art of medicine
ion certainly not
socrates and this is true of all the artsthat which we know with one
art we do not know with the other but let me ask a prior question you
admit that there are differences of arts
ion yes
socrates you would argue as i should that when one art is of one kind
of knowledge and another of another they are different
ion yes
socrates yes surely for if the subject of knowledge were the same
there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were differentif
they both gave the same knowledge for example i know that here are
five fingers and you know the same and if i were to ask whether i
and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of the same art of
arithmetic you would acknowledge that we did
ion yes
socrates tell me then what i was intending to ask youwhether this
holds universally must the same art have the same subject of knowledge
and different arts other subjects of knowledge
ion that is my opinion socrates
socrates then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no
right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art
ion very true
socrates then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were
reciting from homer you or the charioteer
ion the charioteer
socrates why yes because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer
ion yes
socrates and the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the
charioteer
ion yes
socrates and if a different knowledge then a knowledge of different
matters
ion true
socrates you know the passage in which hecamede the concubine of
nestor is described as giving to the wounded machaon a posset as he
says
made with pramnian wine and she grated cheese of goats milk with a
grater of bronze and at his side placed an onion which gives a relish
to drink il
now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of medicine
was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines
ion the art of medicine
socrates and when homer says
and she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet which set in
the horn of ox that ranges in the fields rushes along carrying death
among the ravenous fishes il
will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better able to judge
whether these lines are rightly expressed or not
ion clearly socrates the art of the fisherman
socrates come now suppose that you were to say to me since you
socrates are able to assign different passages in homer to their
corresponding arts i wish that you would tell me what are the passages
of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet and prophetic
art and you will see how readily and truly i shall answer you for
there are many such passages particularly in the odyssee as for
example the passage in which theoclymenus the prophet of the house of
melampus says to the suitors
wretched men what is happening to you your heads and your faces
and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night and the voice of
lamentation bursts forth and your cheeks are wet with tears and the
vestibule is full and the court is full of ghosts descending into the
darkness of erebus and the sun has perished out of heaven and an evil
mist is spread abroad od
and there are many such passages in the iliad also as for example in
the description of the battle near the rampart where he says
as they were eager to pass the ditch there came to them an omen a
soaring eagle holding back the people on the left bore a huge bloody
dragon in his talons still living and panting nor had he yet resigned
the strife for he bent back and smote the bird which carried him on the
breast by the neck and he in pain let him fall from him to the ground
into the midst of the multitude and the eagle with a cry was borne
afar on the wings of the wind il
these are the sort of things which i should say that the prophet ought
to consider and determine
ion and you are quite right socrates in saying so
socrates yes ion and you are right also and as i have selected from
the iliad and odyssee for you passages which describe the office of the
prophet and the physician and the fisherman do you who know homer so
much better than i do ion select for me passages which relate to the
rhapsode and the rhapsodes art and which the rhapsode ought to examine
and judge of better than other men
ion all passages i should say socrates
socrates not all ion surely have you already forgotten what you were
saying a rhapsode ought to have a better memory
ion why what am i forgetting
socrates do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode
to be different from the art of the charioteer
ion yes i remember
socrates and you admitted that being different they would have
different subjects of knowledge
ion yes
socrates then upon your own showing the rhapsode and the art of the
rhapsode will not know everything
ion i should exclude certain things socrates
socrates you mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the
subjects of the other arts as he does not know all of them which of
them will he know
ion he will know what a man and what a woman ought to say and what
a freeman and what a slave ought to say and what a ruler and what a
subject
socrates do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot
what the ruler of a seatossed vessel ought to say
ion no the pilot will know best
socrates or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the
ruler of a sick man ought to say
ion he will not
socrates but he will know what a slave ought to say
ion yes
socrates suppose the slave to be a cowherd the rhapsode will know
better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the
infuriated cows
ion no he will not
socrates but he will know what a spinningwoman ought to say about the
working of wool
ion no
socrates at any rate he will know what a general ought to say when
exhorting his soldiers
ion yes that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be sure to
know
socrates well but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general
ion i am sure that i should know what a general ought to say
socrates why yes ion because you may possibly have a knowledge of
the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode and you may also have
a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre and then you would
know when horses were well or ill managed but suppose i were to ask
you by the help of which art ion do you know whether horses are well
managed by your skill as a horseman or as a performer on the lyrewhat
would you answer
ion i should reply by my skill as a horseman
socrates and if you judged of performers on the lyre you would
admit that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre and not as a
horseman
ion yes
socrates and in judging of the generals art do you judge of it as a
general or a rhapsode
ion to me there appears to be no difference between them
socrates what do you mean do you mean to say that the art of the
rhapsode and of the general is the same
ion yes one and the same
socrates then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general
ion certainly socrates
socrates and he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode
ion no i do not say that
socrates but you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good
general
ion certainly
socrates and you are the best of hellenic rhapsodes
ion far the best socrates
socrates and are you the best general ion
ion to be sure socrates and homer was my master
socrates but then ion what in the name of goodness can be the reason
why you who are the best of generals as well as the best of rhapsodes
in all hellas go about as a rhapsode when you might be a general do
you think that the hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden crown and
do not want a general
ion why socrates the reason is that my countrymen the ephesians
are the servants and soldiers of athens and do not need a general and
you and sparta are not likely to have me for you think that you have
enough generals of your own
socrates my good ion did you never hear of apollodorus of cyzicus
ion who may he be
socrates one who though a foreigner has often been chosen their
general by the athenians and there is phanosthenes of andros and
heraclides of clazomenae whom they have also appointed to the command
of their armies and to other offices although aliens after they had
shown their merit and will they not choose ion the ephesian to be
their general and honour him if he prove himself worthy were not
the ephesians originally athenians and ephesus is no mean city but
indeed ion if you are correct in saying that by art and knowledge you
are able to praise homer you do not deal fairly with me and after
all your professions of knowing many glorious things about homer and
promises that you would exhibit them you are only a deceiver and so
far from exhibiting the art of which you are a master will not even
after my repeated entreaties explain to me the nature of it you have
literally as many forms as proteus and now you go all manner of ways
twisting and turning and like proteus become all manner of people
at once and at last slip away from me in the disguise of a general in
order that you may escape exhibiting your homeric lore and if you have
art then as i was saying in falsifying your promise that you would
exhibit homer you are not dealing fairly with me but if as i believe
you have no art but speak all these beautiful words about homer
unconsciously under his inspiring influence then i acquit you of
