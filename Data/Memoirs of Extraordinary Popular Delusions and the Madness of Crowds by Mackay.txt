preface
in reading the history of nations we find that like individuals
they have their whims and their peculiarities their seasons of
excitement and recklessness when they care not what they do we find
that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object and
go mad in its pursuit that millions of people become simultaneously
impressed with one delusion and run after it till their attention is
caught by some new folly more captivating than the first we see one
nation suddenly seized from its highest to its lowest members with a
fierce desire of military glory another as suddenly becoming crazed
upon a religious scruple and neither of them recovering its senses
until it has shed rivers of blood and sowed a harvest of groans and
tears to be reaped by its posterity at an early age in the annals of
europe its population lost their wits about the sepulchre of jesus
and crowded in frenzied multitudes to the holy land another age went
mad for fear of the devil and offered up hundreds of thousands of
victims to the delusion of witchcraft at another time the many
became crazed on the subject of the philosophers stone and committed
follies till then unheard of in the pursuit it was once thought a
venial offence in very many countries of europe to destroy an enemy
by slow poison persons who would have revolted at the idea of
stabbing a man to the heart drugged his pottage without scruple
ladies of gentle birth and manners caught the contagion of murder
until poisoning under their auspices became quite fashionable some
delusions though notorious to all the world have subsisted for ages
flourishing as widely among civilised and polished nations as among
the early barbarians with whom they originatedthat of duelling for
instance and the belief in omens and divination of the future which
seem to defy the progress of knowledge to eradicate them entirely from
the popular mind money again has often been a cause of the delusion
of multitudes sober nations have all at once become desperate
gamblers and risked almost their existence upon the turn of a piece
of paper to trace the history of the most prominent of these
delusions is the object of the present pages men it has been well
said think in herds it will be seen that they go mad in herds while
they only recover their senses slowly and one by one
some of the subjects introduced may be familiar to the reader but the
author hopes that sufficient novelty of detail will be found even in
these to render them acceptable while they could not be wholly
omitted in justice to the subject of which it was proposed to treat
the memoirs of the southsea madness and the mississippi delusion are
more complete and copious than are to be found elsewhere and the same
may be said of the history of the witch mania which contains an
account of its terrific progress in germany a part of the subject
which has been left comparatively untouched by sir walter scott in his
letters on demonology and witchcraft the most important that
have yet appeared on this fearful but most interesting subject
popular delusions began so early spread so widely and have lasted so
long that instead of two or three volumes fifty would scarcely
suffice to detail their history the present may be considered more of
a miscellany of delusions than a historya chapter only in the great
and awful book of human folly which yet remains to be written and
which porson once jestingly said he would write in five hundred
volumes interspersed are sketches of some lighter mattersamusing
instances of the imitativeness and wrongheadedness of the people
rather than examples of folly and delusion
religious matters have been purposely excluded as incompatible with
the limits prescribed to the present work a mere list of them would
alone be sufficient to occupy a volume

the personal character and career of one man are so intimately connected
with the great scheme of the years 1719 and 1720 that a history of the
mississippi madness can have no fitter introduction than a sketch of the
life of its great author john law historians are divided in opinion as to
whether they should designate him a knave or a madman both epithets were
unsparingly applied to him in his lifetime and while the unhappy
consequences of his projects were still deeply felt posterity however
has found reason to doubt the justice of the accusation and to confess
that john law was neither knave nor madman but one more deceived than
deceiving more sinned against than sinning he was thoroughly acquainted
with the philosophy and true principles of credit he understood the
monetary question better than any man of his day and if his system fell
with a crash so tremendous it was not so much his fault as that of the
people amongst whom he had erected it he did not calculate upon the
avaricious frenzy of a whole nation he did not see that confidence like
mistrust could be increased almost ad infinitum and that hope was as
extravagant as fear how was he to foretell that the french people like
the man in the fable would kill in their frantic eagerness the fine
goose he had brought to lay them so many golden eggs his fate was like
that which may be supposed to have overtaken the first adventurous boatman
who rowed from erie to ontario broad and smooth was the river on which he
embarked rapid and pleasant was his progress and who was to stay him in
his career alas for him the cataract was nigh he saw when it was too
late that the tide which wafted him so joyously along was a tide of
destruction and when he endeavoured to retrace his way he found that the
current was too strong for his weak efforts to stem and that he drew
nearer every instant to the tremendous falls down he went over the sharp
rocks and the waters with him he was dashed to pieces with his bark
but the waters maddened and turned to foam by the rough descent only
boiled and bubbled for a time and then flowed on again as smoothly as
ever just so it was with law and the french people he was the boatman
and they were the waters
john law was born at edinburgh in the year 1671 his father was the
younger son of an ancient family in fife and carried on the business of a
goldsmith and banker he amassed considerable wealth in his trade
sufficient to enable him to gratify the wish so common among his
countrymen of adding a territorial designation to his name he purchased
with this view the estates of lauriston and randleston on the firth of
forth on the borders of west and mid lothian and was thenceforth known
as law of lauriston the subject of our memoir being the eldest son was
received into his fathers countinghouse at the age of fourteen and for
three years laboured hard to acquire an insight into the principles of
banking as then carried on in scotland he had always manifested great
love for the study of numbers and his proficiency in the mathematics was
considered extraordinary in one of his tender years at the age of
seventeen he was tall strong and well made and his face although
deeply scarred with the smallpox was agreeable in its expression and
full of intelligence at this time he began to neglect his business and
becoming vain of his person indulged in considerable extravagance of
attire he was a great favourite with the ladies by whom he was called
beau law while the other sex despising his foppery nicknamed him
jessamy john at the death of his father which happened in 1688 he
withdrew entirely from the desk which had become so irksome and being
possessed of the revenues of the paternal estate of lauriston he
proceeded to london to see the world
he was now very young very vain goodlooking tolerably rich and quite
uncontrolled it is no wonder that on his arrival in the capital he
should launch out into extravagance he soon became a regular frequenter
of the gaminghouses and by pursuing a certain plan based upon some
abstruse calculation of chances he contrived to gain considerable sums
all the gamblers envied him his luck and many made it a point to watch
his play and stake their money on the same chances in affairs of
gallantry he was equally fortunate ladies of the first rank smiled
graciously upon the handsome scotchmanthe young the rich the witty
and the obliging but all these successes only paved the way for reverses
after he had been for nine years exposed to the dangerous attractions of
the gay life he was leading he became an irrecoverable gambler as his
love of play increased in violence it diminished in prudence great
losses were only to be repaired by still greater ventures and one unhappy
day he lost more than he could repay without mortgaging his family estate
to that step he was driven at last at the same time his gallantry brought
him into trouble a love affair or slight flirtation with a lady of the
name of villiers1 exposed him to the resentment of a mr wilson by
whom he was challenged to fight a duel law accepted and had the ill
fortune to shoot his antagonist dead upon the spot he was arrested the
same day and brought to trial for murder by the relatives of mr wilson
he was afterwards found guilty and sentenced to death the sentence was
commuted to a fine upon the ground that the offence only amounted to
manslaughter an appeal being lodged by a brother of the deceased law was
detained in the kings bench whence by some means or other which he
never explained he contrived to escape and an action being instituted
against the sheriffs he was advertised in the gazette and a reward
offered for his apprehension he was described as captain john law a
scotchman aged twentysix a very tall black lean man well shaped
above six feet high with large pockholes in his face big nosed and
speaking broad and loud as this was rather a caricature than a
description of him it has been supposed that it was drawn up with a view
to favour his escape he succeeded in reaching the continent where he
travelled for three years and devoted much of his attention to the
monetary and banking affairs of the countries through which he passed he
stayed a few months in amsterdam and speculated to some extent in the
funds his mornings were devoted to the study of finance and the
principles of trade and his evenings to the gaminghouse it is generally
believed that he returned to edinburgh in the year 1700 it is certain
that he published in that city his proposals and reasons for constituting
a council of trade this pamphlet did not excite much attention
    1 miss elizabeth villiers afterwards countess of orkney
in a short time afterwards he published a project for establishing what he
called a landbank2 the notes issued by which were never to exceed
the value of the entire lands of the state upon ordinary interest or
were to be equal in value to the land with the right to enter into
possession at a certain time the project excited a good deal of
discussion in the scottish parliament and a motion for the establishment
of such a bank was brought forward by a neutral party called the
squadrone whom law had interested in his favour the parliament
ultimately passed a resolution to the effect that to establish any kind
of paper credit so as to force it to pass was an improper expedient for
the nation
    2 the wits of the day called it a sandbank which would
        wreck the vessel of the state
upon the failure of this project and of his efforts to procure a pardon
for the murder of mr wilson law withdrew to the continent and resumed
his old habits of gaming for fourteen years he continued to roam about
in flanders holland germany hungary italy and france he soon became
intimately acquainted with the extent of the trade and resources of each
and daily more confirmed in his opinion that no country could prosper
without a paper currency during the whole of this time he appears to have
chiefly supported himself by successful play at every gamblinghouse of
note in the capitals of europe he was known and appreciated as one better
skilled in the intricacies of chance than any other man of the day it is
stated in the biographie universelle that he was expelled first from
venice and afterwards from genoa by the magistrates who thought him a
visitor too dangerous for the youth of those cities during his residence
in paris he rendered himself obnoxious to dargenson the
lieutenantgeneral of the police by whom he was ordered to quit the
capital this did not take place however before he had made the
acquaintance in the saloons of the duke de vendme the prince de conti
and of the gay duke of orleans the latter of whom was destined afterwards
to exercise so much influence over his fate the duke of orleans was
pleased with the vivacity and good sense of the scottish adventurer while
the latter was no less pleased with the wit and amiability of a prince who
promised to become his patron they were often thrown into each others
society and law seized every opportunity to instil his financial
doctrines into the mind of one whose proximity to the throne pointed him
out as destined at no very distant date to play an important part in the
government
illustration the regent of france
shortly before the death of louis xiv or as some say in 1708 law
proposed a scheme of finance to desmarets the comptroller louis is
reported to have inquired whether the projector were a catholic and on
being answered in the negative to have declined having any thing to do
with him3
    3 this anecdote which is related in the correspondence of
        madame de bavire duchess of orleans and mother of the
        regent is discredited by lord john russell in his history of
        the principal states of europe from the peace of utrecht for
        what reason he does not inform us there is no doubt that law
        proposed his scheme to desmarets and that louis refused to
        hear of it the reason given for the refusal is quite
        consistent with the character of that bigoted and tyrannical
        monarch
it was after this repulse that he visited italy his mind being still
occupied with schemes of finance he proposed to victor amadeus duke of
savoy to establish his landbank in that country the duke replied that
his dominions were too circumscribed for the execution of so great a
project and that he was by far too poor a potentate to be ruined he
advised him however to try the king of france once more for he was
sure if he knew any thing of the french character that the people would
be delighted with a plan not only so new but so plausible
louis xiv died in 1715 and the heir to the throne being an infant only
seven years of age the duke of orleans assumed the reins of government
as regent during his minority law now found himself in a more favourable
position the tide in his affairs had come which taken at the flood was
to waft him on to fortune the regent was his friend already acquainted
with his theory and pretensions and inclined moreover to aid him in any
efforts to restore the wounded credit of france bowed down to the earth
by the extravagance of the long reign of louis xiv
hardly was that monarch laid in his grave ere the popular hatred
suppressed so long burst forth against his memory he who during his
life had been flattered with an excess of adulation to which history
scarcely offers a parallel was now cursed as a tyrant a bigot and a
plunderer his statues were pelted and disfigured his effigies torn down
amid the execrations of the populace and his name rendered synonymous
with selfishness and oppression the glory of his arms was forgotten and
nothing was remembered but his reverses his extravagance and his
cruelty
the finances of the country were in a state of the utmost disorder a
profuse and corrupt monarch whose profuseness and corruption were
imitated by almost every functionary from the highest to the lowest
grade had brought france to the verge of ruin the national debt amounted
to 3000 millions of livres the revenue to 145 millions and the expenses
of government to 142 millions per annum leaving only three millions to
pay the interest upon 3000 millions the first care of the regent was to
discover a remedy for an evil of such magnitude and a council was early
summoned to take the matter into consideration the duke de st simon was
of opinion that nothing could save the country from revolution but a
remedy at once bold and dangerous he advised the regent to convoke the
statesgeneral and declare a national bankruptcy the duke de noailles a
man of accommodating principles an accomplished courtier and totally
averse from giving himself any trouble or annoyance that ingenuity could
escape from opposed the project of st simon with all his influence he
represented the expedient as alike dishonest and ruinous the regent was
of the same opinion and this desperate remedy fell to the ground
the measures ultimately adopted though they promised fair only
aggravated the evil the first and most dishonest measure was of no
advantage to the state a recoinage was ordered by which the currency was
depreciated onefifth those who took a thousand pieces of gold or silver
to the mint received back an amount of coin of the same nominal value but
only fourfifths of the weight of metal by this contrivance the treasury
gained seventytwo millions of livres and all the commercial operations
of the country were disordered a trifling diminution of the taxes
silenced the clamours of the people and for the slight present advantage
the great prospective evil was forgotten
a chamber of justice was next instituted to inquire into the malversations
of the loancontractors and the farmers of the revenues taxcollectors
are never very popular in any country but those of france at this period
deserved all the odium with which they were loaded as soon as these
farmersgeneral with all their hosts of subordinate agents called
malttiers4 were called to account for their misdeeds the most
extravagant joy took possession of the nation the chamber of justice
instituted chiefly for this purpose was endowed with very extensive
powers it was composed of the presidents and councils of the parliament
the judges of the courts of aid and of requests and the officers of the
chamber of account under the general presidence of the minister of
finance informers were encouraged to give evidence against the offenders
by the promise of onefifth part of the fines and confiscations a tenth
of all concealed effects belonging to the guilty was promised to such as
should furnish the means of discovering them
    4 from maltte an oppressive tax
the promulgation of the edict constituting this court caused a degree of
consternation among those principally concerned which can only be
accounted for on the supposition that their peculation had been enormous
but they met with no sympathy the proceedings against them justified
their terror the bastille was soon unable to contain the prisoners that
were sent to it and the gaols all over the country teemed with guilty or
suspected persons an order was issued to all innkeepers and postmasters
to refuse horses to such as endeavoured to seek safety in flight and all
persons were forbidden under heavy fines to harbour them or favour their
evasion some were condemned to the pillory others to the galleys and
the least guilty to fine and imprisonment one only samuel bernard a
rich banker and farmergeneral of a province remote from the capital was
sentenced to death so great had been the illegal profits of this
manlooked upon as the tyrant and oppressor of his districtthat he
offered six millions of livres or 250000l sterling to be allowed to
escape
his bribe was refused and he suffered the penalty of death others
perhaps more guilty were more fortunate confiscation owing to the
concealment of their treasures by the delinquents often produced less
money than a fine the severity of the government relaxed and fines under
the denomination of taxes were indiscriminately levied upon all offenders
but so corrupt was every department of the administration that the country
benefited but little by the sums which thus flowed into the treasury
courtiers and courtiers wives and mistresses came in for the chief share
of the spoils one contractor had been taxed in proportion to his wealth
and guilt at the sum of twelve millions of livres the count  a man
of some weight in the government called upon him and offered to procure a
remission of the fine if he would give him a hundred thousand crowns vous
tes trop tard mon ami replied the financier i have already made a
bargain with your wife for fifty thousand5
    5 this anecdote is related by m de la hode in his life of
        philippe of orleans it would have looked more authentic if
        he had given the names of the dishonest contractor and the
        still more dishonest minister but m de la hodes book is
        liable to the same objection as most of the french memoirs of
        that and of subsequent periods it is sufficient with most of
        them that an anecdote be ben trovato the vero is but
        matter of secondary consideration
about a hundred and eighty millions of livres were levied in this manner
of which eighty were applied in payment of the debts contracted by the
government the remainder found its way into the pockets of the courtiers
madame de maintenon writing on this subject sayswe hear every day of
some new grant of the regent the people murmur very much at this mode of
employing the money taken from the peculators the people who after the
first burst of their resentment is over generally express a sympathy for
the weak were indignant that so much severity should be used to so little
purpose they did not see the justice of robbing one set of rogues to
fatten another in a few months all the more guilty had been brought to
punishment and the chamber of justice looked for victims in humbler walks
of life charges of fraud and extortion were brought against tradesmen of
good character in consequence of the great inducements held out to common
informers they were compelled to lay open their affairs before this
tribunal in order to establish their innocence the voice of complaint
resounded from every side and at the expiration of a year the government
found it advisable to discontinue further proceedings the chamber of
justice was suppressed and a general amnesty granted to all against whom
no charges had yet been preferred
in the midst of this financial confusion law appeared upon the scene no
man felt more deeply than the regent the deplorable state of the country
but no man could be more averse from putting his shoulders manfully to the
wheel he disliked business he signed official documents without proper
examination and trusted to others what he should have undertaken himself
the cares inseparable from his high office were burdensome to him he saw
that something was necessary to be done but he lacked the energy to do
it and had not virtue enough to sacrifice his ease and his pleasures in
the attempt no wonder that with this character he listened favourably
to the mighty projects so easy of execution of the clever adventurer
whom he had formerly known and whose talents he appreciated
when law presented himself at court he was most cordially received he
offered two memorials to the regent in which he set forth the evils that
had befallen france owing to an insufficient currency at different times
depreciated he asserted that a metallic currency unaided by a paper
money was wholly inadequate to the wants of a commercial country and
particularly cited the examples of great britain and holland to shew the
advantages of paper he used many sound arguments on the subject of
credit and proposed as a means of restoring that of france then at so
low an ebb among the nations that he should be allowed to set up a bank
which should have the management of the royal revenues and issue notes
both on that and on landed security he further proposed that this bank
should be administered in the kings name but subject to the control of
commissioners to be named by the statesgeneral
while these memorials were under consideration law translated into french
his essay on money and trade and used every means to extend through the
nation his renown as a financier he soon became talked of the confidants
of the regent spread abroad his praise and every one expected great
things of monsieur lass6
    6 the french pronounced his name in this manner to avoid the
        ungallic sound aw after the failure of his scheme the
        wags said the nation was lasse de lui and proposed that he
        should in future be known by the name of monsieur helas
on the 5th of may 1716 a royal edict was published by which law was
authorised in conjunction with his brother to establish a bank under the
name of law and company the notes of which should be received in payment
of the taxes the capital was fixed at six millions of livres in twelve
thousand shares of five hundred livres each purchasable one fourth in
specie and the remainder in billets dtat it was not thought
expedient to grant him the whole of the privileges prayed for in his
memorials until experience should have shewn their safety and advantage
law was now on the high road to fortune the study of thirty years was
brought to guide him in the management of his bank he made all his notes
payable at sight and in the coin current at the time they were issued
this last was a masterstroke of policy and immediately rendered his
notes more valuable than the precious metals the latter were constantly
liable to depreciation by the unwise tampering of the government a
thousand livres of silver might be worth their nominal value one day and
be reduced onesixth the next but a note of laws bank retained its
original value he publicly declared at the same time that a banker
deserved death if he made issues without having sufficient security to
answer all demands the consequence was that his notes advanced rapidly
in public estimation and were received at one per cent more than specie
it was not long before the trade of the country felt the benefit
languishing commerce began to lift up her head the taxes were paid with
greater regularity and less murmuring and a degree of confidence was
established that could not fail if it continued to become still more
advantageous in the course of a year laws notes rose to fifteen per
cent premium while the billets dtat or notes issued by the
government as security for the debts contracted by the extravagant louis
xiv were at a discount of no less than seventyeight and a half per
cent the comparison was too great in favour of law not to attract the
attention of the whole kingdom and his credit extended itself day by day
branches of his bank were almost simultaneously established at lyons
rochelle tours amiens and orleans
the regent appears to have been utterly astonished at his success and
gradually to have conceived the idea that paper which could so aid a
metallic currency could entirely supersede it upon this fundamental
error he afterwards acted in the mean time law commenced the famous
project which has handed his name down to posterity he proposed to the
regent who could refuse him nothing to establish a company that should
have the exclusive privilege of trading to the great river mississippi and
the province of louisiana on its western bank the country was supposed
to abound in the precious metals and the company supported by the
profits of their exclusive commerce were to be the sole farmers of the
taxes and sole coiners of money letters patent were issued incorporating
the company in august 1717 the capital was divided into two hundred
thousand shares of five hundred livres each the whole of which might be
paid in billets dtat at their nominal value although worth no more
than a hundred and sixty livres in the market
it was now that the frenzy of speculating began to seize upon the nation
laws bank had effected so much good that any promises for the future
which he thought proper to make were readily believed the regent every
day conferred new privileges upon the fortunate projector the bank
obtained the monopoly of the sale of tobacco the sole right of refinage
of gold and silver and was finally erected into the royal bank of france
amid the intoxication of success both law and the regent forgot the maxim
so loudly proclaimed by the former that a banker deserved death who made
issues of paper without the necessary funds to provide for them as soon
as the bank from a private became a public institution the regent
caused a fabrication of notes to the amount of one thousand millions of
livres this was the first departure from sound principles and one for
which law is not justly blameable while the affairs of the bank were
under his control the issues had never exceeded sixty millions whether
law opposed the inordinate increase is not known but as it took place as
soon as the bank was made a royal establishment it is but fair to lay the
blame of the change of system upon the regent
law found that he lived under a despotic government but he was not yet
aware of the pernicious influence which such a government could exercise
upon so delicate a framework as that of credit he discovered it
afterwards to his cost but in the meantime suffered himself to be
impelled by the regent into courses which his own reason must have
disapproved with a weakness most culpable he lent his aid in inundating
the country with paper money which based upon no solid foundation was
sure to fall sooner or later the extraordinary present fortune dazzled
his eyes and prevented him from seeing the evil day that would burst over
his head when once from any cause or other the alarm was sounded the
parliament were from the first jealous of his influence as a foreigner
and had besides their misgivings as to the safety of his projects as
his influence extended their animosity increased daguesseau the
chancellor was unceremoniously dismissed by the regent for his opposition
to the vast increase of paper money and the constant depreciation of the
gold and silver coin of the realm this only served to augment the enmity
of the parliament and when dargenson a man devoted to the interests of
the regent was appointed to the vacant chancellorship and made at the
same time minister of finance they became more violent than ever the
first measure of the new minister caused a further depreciation of the
coin in order to extinguish the billets dtat it was ordered that
persons bringing to the mint four thousand livres in specie and one
thousand livres in billets dtat should receive back coin to the
amount of five thousand livres dargenson plumed himself mightily upon
thus creating five thousand new and smaller livres out of the four
thousand old and larger ones being too ignorant of the true principles of
trade and credit to be aware of the immense injury he was inflicting upon
both
the parliament saw at once the impolicy and danger of such a system and
made repeated remonstrances to the regent the latter refused to entertain
their petitions when the parliament by a bold and very unusual stretch
of authority commanded that no money should be received in payment but
that of the old standard the regent summoned a lit de justice and
annulled the decree the parliament resisted and issued another again
the regent exercised his privilege and annulled it till the parliament
stung to fiercer opposition passed another decree dated august 12th
1718 by which they forbade the bank of law to have any concern either
direct or indirect in the administration of the revenue and prohibited
all foreigners under heavy penalties from interfering either in their
own names or in that of others in the management of the finances of the
state the parliament considered law to be the author of all the evil and
some of the councillors in the virulence of their enmity proposed that
he should be brought to trial and if found guilty be hung at the gates
of the palais de justice
illustration palais royal from the garden
law in great alarm fled to the palais royal and threw himself on the
protection of the regent praying that measures might be taken to reduce
the parliament to obedience the regent had nothing so much at heart both
on that account and because of the disputes that had arisen relative to
the legitimation of the duke of maine and the count of thoulouse the sons
of the late king the parliament was ultimately overawed by the arrest of
their president and two of the councillors who were sent to distant
prisons
thus the first cloud upon laws prospects blew over freed from
apprehension of personal danger he devoted his attention to his famous
mississippi project the shares of which were rapidly rising in spite of
the parliament at the commencement of the year 1719 an edict was
published granting to the mississippi company the exclusive privilege of
trading to the east indies china and the south seas and to all the
possessions of the french east india company established by colbert the
company in consequence of this great increase of their business assumed
as more appropriate the title of company of the indies and created fifty
thousand new shares the prospects now held out by law were most
magnificent he promised a yearly dividend of two hundred livres upon each
share of five hundred which as the shares were paid for in billets
dtat at their nominal value but worth only 100 livres was at the rate
of about 120 per cent profit
illustration laws house rue de quincampoix
the public enthusiasm which had been so long rising could not resist a
vision so splendid at least three hundred thousand applications were made
for the fifty thousand new shares and laws house in the rue de
quincampoix was beset from morning to night by the eager applicants as it
was impossible to satisfy them all it was several weeks before a list of
the fortunate new stockholders could be made out during which time the
public impatience rose to a pitch of frenzy dukes marquises counts
with their duchesses marchionesses and countesses waited in the streets
for hours every day before mr laws door to know the result at last to
avoid the jostling of the plebeian crowd which to the number of
thousands filled the whole thoroughfare they took apartments in the
adjoining houses that they might be continually near the temple whence
the new plutus was diffusing wealth every day the value of the old shares
increased and the fresh applications induced by the golden dreams of the
whole nation became so numerous that it was deemed advisable to create no
less than three hundred thousand new shares at five thousand livres each
in order that the regent might take advantage of the popular enthusiasm to
pay off the national debt for this purpose the sum of fifteen hundred
millions of livres was necessary such was the eagerness of the nation
that thrice the sum would have been subscribed if the government had
authorised it
law was now at the zenith of his prosperity and the people were rapidly
approaching the zenith of their infatuation the highest and the lowest
classes were alike filled with a vision of boundless wealth there was not
a person of note among the aristocracy with the exception of the duke of
st simon and marshal villars who was not engaged in buying or selling
stock people of every age and sex and condition in life speculated in the
rise and fall of the mississippi bonds the rue de quincampoix was the
grand resort of the jobbers and it being a narrow inconvenient street
accidents continually occurred in it from the tremendous pressure of the
crowd houses in it worth in ordinary times a thousand livres of yearly
rent yielded as much as twelve or sixteen thousand a cobbler who had a
stall in it gained about two hundred livres a day by letting it out and
furnishing writing materials to brokers and their clients the story goes
that a hunchbacked man who stood in the street gained considerable sums by
lending his hump as a writingdesk to the eager speculators the great
concourse of persons who assembled to do business brought a still greater
concourse of spectators these again drew all the thieves and immoral
characters of paris to the spot and constant riots and disturbances took
place at nightfall it was often found necessary to send a troop of
soldiers to clear the street
illustration the hunchback
law finding the inconvenience of his residence removed to the place
vendme whither the crowd of agioteurs followed him that spacious
square soon became as thronged as the rue de quincampoix from morning to
night it presented the appearance of a fair booths and tents were erected
for the transaction of business and the sale of refreshments and gamblers
with their roulette tables stationed themselves in the very middle of the
place and reaped a golden or rather a paper harvest from the throng
the boulevards and public gardens were forsaken parties of pleasure took
their walks in preference in the place vendme which became the
fashionable lounge of the idle as well as the general rendezvous of the
busy the noise was so great all day that the chancellor whose court was
situated in the square complained to the regent and the municipality
that he could not hear the advocates law when applied to expressed his
willingness to aid in the removal of the nuisance and for this purpose
entered into a treaty with the prince de carignan for the htel de
soissons which had a garden of several acres in the rear a bargain was
concluded by which law became the purchaser of the hotel at an enormous
price the prince reserving to himself the magnificent gardens as a new
source of profit they contained some fine statues and several fountains
and were altogether laid out with much taste as soon as law was installed
in his new abode an edict was published forbidding all persons to buy or
sell stock any where but in the gardens of the htel de soissons in the
midst among the trees about five hundred small tents and pavilions were
erected for the convenience of the stockjobbers their various colours
the gay ribands and banners which floated from them the busy crowds which
passed continually in and outthe incessant hum of voices the noise the
music and the strange mixture of business and pleasure on the
countenances of the throng all combined to give the place an air of
enchantment that quite enraptured the parisians the prince de carignan
made enormous profits while the delusion lasted each tent was let at the
rate of five hundred livres a month and as there were at least five
hundred of them his monthly revenue from this source alone must have
amounted to 250000 livres or upwards of 10000l sterling
illustration hotel de soissons
the honest old soldier marshal villars was so vexed to see the folly
which had smitten his countrymen that he never could speak with temper on
the subject passing one day through the place vendme in his carriage
the choleric gentleman was so annoyed at the infatuation of the people
that he abruptly ordered his coachman to stop and putting his head out
of the carriage window harangued them for full half an hour on their
disgusting avarice this was not a very wise proceeding on his part
hisses and shouts of laughter resounded from every side and jokes without
number were aimed at him there being at last strong symptoms that
something more tangible was flying through the air in the direction of his
head the marshal was glad to drive on he never again repeated the
experiment
two sober quiet and philosophic men of letters m de la motte and the
abb terrason congratulated each other that they at least were free
from this strange infatuation a few days afterwards as the worthy abb
was coming out of the htel de soissons whither he had gone to buy shares
in the mississippi whom should he see but his friend la motte entering
for the same purpose ha said the abb smiling is that you yes
said la motte pushing past him as fast as he was able and can that be
you the next time the two scholars met they talked of philosophy of
science and of religion but neither had courage for a long time to
breathe one syllable about the mississippi at last when it was
mentioned they agreed that a man ought never to swear against his doing
any one thing and that there was no sort of extravagance of which even a
wise man was not capable
during this time law the new plutus had become all at once the most
important personage of the state the antechambers of the regent were
forsaken by the courtiers peers judges and bishops thronged to the
htel de soissons officers of the army and navy ladies of title and
fashion and every one to whom hereditary rank or public employ gave a
claim to precedence were to be found waiting in his antechambers to beg
for a portion of his india stock law was so pestered that he was unable
to see onetenth part of the applicants and every manoeuvre that
ingenuity could suggest was employed to gain access to him peers whose
dignity would have been outraged if the regent had made them wait half an
hour for an interview were content to wait six hours for the chance of
seeing monsieur law enormous fees were paid to his servants if they
would merely announce their names ladies of rank employed the
blandishments of their smiles for the same object but many of them came
day after day for a fortnight before they could obtain an audience when
law accepted an invitation he was sometimes so surrounded by ladies all
asking to have their names put down in his lists as shareholders in the
new stock that in spite of his wellknown and habitual gallantry he was
obliged to tear himself away par force the most ludicrous stratagems
were employed to have an opportunity of speaking to him one lady who had
striven in vain during several days gave up in despair all attempts to
see him at his own house but ordered her coachman to keep a strict watch
whenever she was out in her carriage and if he saw mr law coming to
drive against a post and upset her the coachman promised obedience and
for three days the lady was driven incessantly through the town praying
inwardly for the opportunity to be overturned at last she espied mr law
and pulling the string called out to the coachman upset us now for
gods sake upset us now the coachman drove against a post the lady
screamed the coach was overturned and law who had seen the accident
hastened to the spot to render assistance the cunning dame was led into
the htel de soissons where she soon thought it advisable to recover from
her fright and after apologising to mr law confessed her stratagem
law smiled and entered the lady in his books as the purchaser of a
quantity of india stock another story is told of a madame de boucha who
knowing that mr law was at dinner at a certain house proceeded thither
in her carriage and gave the alarm of fire the company started from
table and law among the rest but seeing one lady making all haste into
the house towards him while every body else was scampering away he
suspected the trick and ran off in another direction

many other anecdotes are related which even though they may be a little
exaggerated are nevertheless worth preserving as shewing the spirit of
that singular period7 the regent was one day mentioning in the
presence of dargenson the abb dubois and some other persons that he
was desirous of deputing some lady of the rank at least of a duchess to
attend upon his daughter at modena but added he i do not exactly
know where to find one no replied one in affected surprise i can
tell you where to find every duchess in france you have only to go to mr
laws you will see them every one in his antechamber
    7 the curious reader may find an anecdote of the eagerness of
        the french ladies to retain law in their company which will
        make him blush or smile according as he happens to be very
        modest or the reverse it is related in the letters of madame
        charlotte elizabeth de bavire duchess of orleans vol ii
        p 274
m de chirac a celebrated physician had bought stock at an unlucky
period and was very anxious to sell out stock however continued to
fall for two or three days much to his alarm his mind was filled with
the subject when he was suddenly called upon to attend a lady who
imagined herself unwell he arrived was shewn up stairs and felt the
ladys pulse it falls it falls good god it falls continually said
he musingly while the lady looked up in his face all anxiety for his
opinion oh m de chirac said she starting to her feet and ringing
the bell for assistance i am dying i am dying it falls it falls it
falls what falls inquired the doctor in amazement my pulse my
pulse said the lady i must be dying calm your apprehensions my
dear madam said m de chirac i was speaking of the stocks the truth
is i have been a great loser and my mind is so disturbed i hardly know
what i have been saying
the price of shares sometimes rose ten or twenty per cent in the course of
a few hours and many persons in the humbler walks of life who had risen
poor in the morning went to bed in affluence an extensive holder of
stock being taken ill sent his servant to sell two hundred and fifty
shares at eight thousand livres each the price at which they were then
quoted the servant went and on his arrival in the jardin de soissons
found that in the interval the price had risen to ten thousand livres the
difference of two thousand livres on the two hundred and fifty shares
amounting to 500000 livres or 20000l sterling he very coolly
transferred to his own use and giving the remainder to his master set
out the same evening for another country laws coachman in a very short
time made money enough to set up a carriage of his own and requested
permission to leave his service law who esteemed the man begged of him
as a favour that he would endeavour before he went to find a substitute
as good as himself the coachman consented and in the evening brought two
of his former comrades telling mr law to choose between them and he
would take the other cookmaids and footmen were now and then as lucky
and in the fullblown pride of their easilyacquired wealth made the
most ridiculous mistakes preserving the language and manners of their
old with the finery of their new station they afforded continual
subjects for the pity of the sensible the contempt of the sober and the
laughter of every body but the folly and meanness of the higher ranks of
society were still more disgusting one instance alone related by the
duke de st simon will shew the unworthy avarice which infected the whole
of society a man of the name of andr without character or education
had by a series of welltimed speculations in mississippi bonds gained
enormous wealth in an incredibly short space of time as st simon
expresses it he had amassed mountains of gold as he became rich he
grew ashamed of the lowness of his birth and anxious above all things to
be allied to nobility he had a daughter an infant only three years of
age and he opened a negotiation with the aristocratic and needy family of
doyse that this child should upon certain conditions marry a member of
that house the marquis doyse to his shame consented and promised to
marry her himself on her attaining the age of twelve if the father would
pay him down the sum of a hundred thousand crowns and twenty thousand
livres every year until the celebration of the marriage the marquis was
himself in his thirtythird year this scandalous bargain was duly signed
and sealed the stockjobber furthermore agreeing to settle upon his
daughter on the marriageday a fortune of several millions the duke of
brancas the head of the family was present throughout the negotiation
and shared in all the profits st simon who treats the matter with the
levity becoming what he thought so good a joke adds that people did not
spare their animadversions on this beautiful marriage and further
informs us that the project fell to the ground some months afterwards by
the overthrow of law and the ruin of the ambitious monsieur andr it
would appear however that the noble family never had the honesty to
return the hundred thousand crowns
amid events like these which humiliating though they be partake largely
of the ludicrous others occurred of a more serious nature robberies in
the streets were of daily occurrence in consequence of the immense sums
in paper which people carried about with them assassinations were also
frequent one case in particular fixed the attention of the whole of
france not only on account of the enormity of the offence but of the
rank and high connexions of the criminal
illustration
the count dhorn a younger brother of the prince dhorn and related to
the noble families of daremberg de ligne and de montmorency was a
young man of dissipated character extravagant to a degree and
unprincipled as he was extravagant in connexion with two other young men
as reckless as himself named mille a piedmontese captain and one
destampes or lestang a fleming he formed a design to rob a very rich
broker who was known unfortunately for himself to carry great sums
about his person the count pretended a desire to purchase of him a number
of shares in the company of the indies and for that purpose appointed to
meet him in a cabaret or low publichouse in the neighbourhood of the
place vendme the unsuspecting broker was punctual to his appointment so
were the count dhorn and his two associates whom he introduced as his
particular friends after a few moments conversation the count dhorn
suddenly sprang upon his victim and stabbed him three times in the breast
with a poniard the man fell heavily to the ground and while the count
was employed in rifling his portfolio of bonds in the mississippi and
indian schemes to the amount of one hundred thousand crowns mille the
piedmontese stabbed the unfortunate broker again and again to make sure
of his death but the broker did not fall without a struggle and his
cries brought the people of the cabaret to his assistance lestang the
other assassin who had been set to keep watch at a staircase sprang from
a window and escaped but mille and the count dhorn were seized in the
very act
this crime committed in open day and in so public a place as a
cabaret filled paris with consternation the trial of the assassins
commenced on the following day and the evidence being so clear they were
both found guilty and condemned to be broken alive on the wheel the
noble relatives of the count dhorn absolutely blocked up the
antechambers of the regent praying for mercy on the misguided youth and
alleging that he was insane the regent avoided them as long as possible
being determined that in a case so atrocious justice should take its
course but the importunity of these influential suitors was not to be
overcome so silently and they at last forced themselves into the presence
of the regent and prayed him to save their house the shame of a public
execution they hinted that the princes dhorn were allied to the
illustrious family of orleans and added that the regent himself would be
disgraced if a kinsman of his should die by the hands of a common
executioner the regent to his credit was proof against all their
solicitations and replied to their last argument in the words of
corneille
   le crime fait la honte et non pas lchafaud
adding that whatever shame there might be in the punishment he would very
willingly share with the other relatives day after day they renewed their
entreaties but always with the same result at last they thought that if
they could interest the duke de st simon in their favoura man for whom
the regent felt sincere esteemthey might succeed in their object the
duke a thorough aristocrat was as shocked as they were that a noble
assassin should die by the same death as a plebeian felon and represented
to the regent the impolicy of making enemies of so numerous wealthy and
powerful a family he urged too that in germany where the family of
daremberg had large possessions it was the law that no relative of a
person broken on the wheel could succeed to any public office or employ
until a whole generation had passed away for this reason he thought the
punishment of the guilty count might be transmuted into beheading which
was considered all over europe as much less infamous the regent was moved
by this argument and was about to consent when law who felt peculiarly
interested in the fate of the murdered man confirmed him in his former
resolution to let the law take its course
the relatives of dhorn were now reduced to the last extremity the prince
de robec montmorency despairing of other methods found means to
penetrate into the dungeon of the criminal and offering him a cup of
poison implored him to save them from disgrace the count dhorn turned
away his head and refused to take it montmorency pressed him once more
and losing all patience at his continued refusal turned on his heel and
exclaiming die then as thou wilt meanspirited wretch thou art fit
only to perish by the hands of the hangman left him to his fate
dhorn himself petitioned the regent that he might be beheaded but law
who exercised more influence over his mind than any other person with the
exception of the notorious abb dubois his tutor insisted that he could
not in justice succumb to the selfinterested views of the dhorns the
regent had from the first been of the same opinion and within six days
after the commission of their crime dhorn and mille were broken on the
wheel in the place de grve the other assassin lestang was never
apprehended
this prompt and severe justice was highly pleasing to the populace of
paris even m de quincampoix as they called law came in for a share of
their approbation for having induced the regent to shew no favour to a
patrician but the number of robberies and assassinations did not
diminish no sympathy was shewn for rich jobbers when they were plundered
the general laxity of public morals conspicuous enough before was
rendered still more so by its rapid pervasion of the middle classes who
had hitherto remained comparatively pure between the open vices of the
class above and the hidden crimes of the class below them the pernicious
love of gambling diffused itself through society and bore all public and
nearly all private virtue before it
for a time while confidence lasted an impetus was given to trade which
could not fail to be beneficial in paris especially the good results were
felt strangers flocked into the capital from every part bent not only
upon making money but on spending it the duchess of orleans mother of
the regent computes the increase of the population during this time from
the great influx of strangers from all parts of the world at 305000
souls the housekeepers were obliged to make up beds in garrets kitchens
and even stables for the accommodation of lodgers and the town was so
full of carriages and vehicles of every description that they were
obliged in the principal streets to drive at a footpace for fear of
accidents the looms of the country worked with unusual activity to supply
rich laces silks broadcloth and velvets which being paid for in
abundant paper increased in price fourfold provisions shared the
general advance bread meat and vegetables were sold at prices greater
than had ever before been known while the wages of labour rose in exactly
the same proportion the artisan who formerly gained fifteen sous per diem
now gained sixty new houses were built in every direction an illusory
prosperity shone over the land and so dazzled the eyes of the whole
nation that none could see the dark cloud on the horizon announcing the
storm that was too rapidly approaching
law himself the magician whose wand had wrought so surprising a change
shared of course in the general prosperity his wife and daughter were
courted by the highest nobility and their alliance sought by the heirs of
ducal and princely houses he bought two splendid estates in different
parts of france and entered into a negotiation with the family of the
duke de sully for the purchase of the marquisate of rosny his religion
being an obstacle to his advancement the regent promised if he would
publicly conform to the catholic faith to make him comptrollergeneral of
the finances law who had no more real religion than any other professed
gambler readily agreed and was confirmed by the abb de tencin in the
cathedral of melun in presence of a great crowd of spectators8 on
the following day he was elected honorary churchwarden of the parish of
st roch upon which occasion he made it a present of the sum of five
hundred thousand livres his charities always magnificent were not
always so ostentatious he gave away great sums privately and no tale of
real distress ever reached his ears in vain
    8 the following squib was circulated on the occasion
           foin de ton zle sraphique
              malheureux abb de tencin
            depuis que law est catholique
              tout le royaume est capucin
        thus somewhat weakly and paraphrastically rendered by
        justandsond in his translation of the memoirs of louis xv
           tencin a curse on thy seraphic zeal
              which by persuasion hath contrived the means
            to make the scotchman at our altars kneel
              since which we all are poor as capucines
at this time he was by far the most influential person of the state the
duke of orleans had so much confidence in his sagacity and the success of
his plans that he always consulted him upon every matter of moment he
was by no means unduly elevated by his prosperity but remained the same
simple affable sensible man that he had shewn himself in adversity his
gallantry which was always delightful to the fair objects of it was of a
nature so kind so gentlemanly and so respectful that not even a lover
could have taken offence at it if upon any occasion he shewed any
symptoms of haughtiness it was to the cringing nobles who lavished their
adulation upon him till it became fulsome he often took pleasure in
seeing how long he could make them dance attendance upon him for a single
favour to such of his own countrymen as by chance visited paris and
sought an interview with him he was on the contrary all politeness and
attention when archibald campbell earl of islay and afterwards duke of
argyle called upon him in the place vendme he had to pass through an
antechamber crowded with persons of the first distinction all anxious to
see the great financier and have their names put down as first on the
list of some new subscription law himself was quietly sitting in his
library writing a letter to the gardener at his paternal estate of
lauriston about the planting of some cabbages the earl stayed for a
considerable time played a game of piquet with his countryman and left
him charmed with his ease good sense and good breeding

        in wrights england under the house of hanover
among the nobles who by means of the public credulity at this time
gained sums sufficient to repair their ruined fortunes may be mentioned
the names of the dukes de bourbon de guiche de la force10 de
chaulnes and dantin the marechal destres the princes de rohan de
poix and de lon the duke de bourbon son of louis xiv by madame de
montespan was peculiarly fortunate in his speculations in mississippi
paper he rebuilt the royal residence of chantilly in a style of unwonted
magnificence and being passionately fond of horses he erected a range of
stables which were long renowned throughout europe and imported a
hundred and fifty of the finest racers from england to improve the breed
in france he bought a large extent of country in picardy and became
possessed of nearly all the valuable lands lying between the oise and the
somme
    10 the duke de la force gained considerable sums not only by
         jobbing in the stocks but in dealing in porcelain spices
         c it was debated for a length of time in the parliament of
         paris whether he had not in his quality of spicemerchant
         forfeited his rank in the peerage it was decided in the
         negative a caricature of him was made dressed as a
         streetporter carrying a large bale of spices on his back
         with the inscription admirez la force
when fortunes such as these were gained it is no wonder that law should
have been almost worshipped by the mercurial population never was monarch
more flattered than he was all the small poets and littrateurs of the
day poured floods of adulation upon him according to them he was the
saviour of the country the tutelary divinity of france wit was in all
his words goodness in all his looks and wisdom in all his actions so
great a crowd followed his carriage whenever he went abroad that the
regent sent him a troop of horse as his permanent escort to clear the
streets before him
it was remarked at this time that paris had never before been so full of
objects of elegance and luxury statues pictures and tapestries were
imported in great quantities from foreign countries and found a ready
market all those pretty trifles in the way of furniture and ornament
which the french excel in manufacturing were no longer the exclusive
playthings of the aristocracy but were to be found in abundance in the
houses of traders and the middle classes in general jewellery of the most
costly description was brought to paris as the most favourable mart among
the rest the famous diamond bought by the regent and called by his name
and which long adorned the crown of france it was purchased for the sum
of two millions of livres under circumstances which shew that the regent
was not so great a gainer as some of his subjects by the impetus which
trade had received when the diamond was first offered to him he refused
to buy it although he desired above all things to possess it alleging as
his reason that his duty to the country he governed would not allow him
to spend so large a sum of the public money for a mere jewel this valid
and honourable excuse threw all the ladies of the court into alarm and
nothing was heard for some days but expressions of regret that so rare a
gem should be allowed to go out of france no private individual being
rich enough to buy it the regent was continually importuned about it but
all in vain until the duke de st simon who with all his ability was
something of a twaddler undertook the weighty business his entreaties
being seconded by law the goodnatured regent gave his consent leaving
to laws ingenuity to find the means to pay for it the owner took
security for the payment of the sum of two millions of livres within a
stated period receiving in the mean time the interest of five per cent
upon that amount and being allowed besides all the valuable clippings
of the gem st simon in his memoirs relates with no little
complacency his share in this transaction after describing the diamond to
be as large as a greengage of a form nearly round perfectly white and
without flaw and weighing more than five hundred grains he concludes
with a chuckle by telling the world that he takes great credit to
himself for having induced the regent to make so illustrious a purchase
in other words he was proud that he had induced him to sacrifice his
duty and buy a bauble for himself at an extravagant price out of the
public money
thus the system continued to flourish till the commencement of the year
1720 the warnings of the parliament that too great a creation of paper
money would sooner or later bring the country to bankruptcy were
disregarded the regent who knew nothing whatever of the philosophy of
finance thought that a system which had produced such good effects could
never be carried to excess if five hundred millions of paper had been of
such advantage five hundred millions additional would be of still greater
advantage this was the grand error of the regent and which law did not
attempt to dispel the extraordinary avidity of the people kept up the
delusion and the higher the price of indian and mississippi stock the
more billets de banque were issued to keep pace with it the edifice
thus reared might not unaptly be compared to the gorgeous palace erected
by potemkin that princely barbarian of russia to surprise and please his
imperial mistress huge blocks of ice were piled one upon another ionic
pillars of chastest workmanship in ice formed a noble portico and a
dome of the same material shone in the sun which had just strength
enough to gild but not to melt it it glittered afar like a palace of
crystals and diamonds but there came one warm breeze from the south and
the stately building dissolved away till none were able even to gather up
the fragments so with law and his paper system no sooner did the breath
of popular mistrust blow steadily upon it than it fell to ruins and none
could raise it up again
the first slight alarm that was occasioned was early in 1720 the prince
de conti offended that law should have denied him fresh shares in india
stock at his own price sent to his bank to demand payment in specie of
so enormous a quantity of notes that three wagons were required for its
transport law complained to the regent and urged on his attention the
mischief that would be done if such an example found many imitators the
regent was but too well aware of it and sending for the prince de conti
ordered him under penalty of his high displeasure to refund to the bank
twothirds of the specie which he had withdrawn from it the prince was
forced to obey the despotic mandate happily for laws credit de conti
was an unpopular man every body condemned his meanness and cupidity and
agreed that law had been hardly treated it is strange however that so
narrow an escape should not have made both law and the regent more anxious
to restrict their issues others were soon found who imitated from
motives of distrust the example which had been set by de conti in
revenge the more acute stockjobbers imagined justly that prices could not
continue to rise for ever bourdon and la richardire renowned for their
extensive operations in the funds quietly and in small quantities at a
time converted their notes into specie and sent it away to foreign
countries they also bought as much as they could conveniently carry of
plate and expensive jewellery and sent it secretly away to england or to
holland vermalet a jobber who sniffed the coming storm procured gold
and silver coin to the amount of nearly a million of livres which he
packed in a farmers cart and covered over with hay and cowdung he then
disguised himself in the dirty smockfrock or blouse of a peasant and
drove his precious load in safety into belgium from thence he soon found
means to transport it to amsterdam
hitherto no difficulty had been experienced by any class in procuring
specie for their wants but this system could not long be carried on
without causing a scarcity the voice of complaint was heard on every
side and inquiries being instituted the cause was soon discovered the
council debated long on the remedies to be taken and law being called on
for his advice was of opinion that an edict should be published
depreciating the value of coin five per cent below that of paper the
edict was published accordingly but failing of its intended effect was
followed by another in which the depreciation was increased to ten per
cent the payments of the bank were at the same time restricted to one
hundred livres in gold and ten in silver all these measures were
nugatory to restore confidence in the paper though the restriction of
cash payments within limits so extremely narrow kept up the credit of the
bank

notwithstanding every effort to the contrary the precious metals
continued to be conveyed to england and holland the little coin that was
left in the country was carefully treasured or hidden until the scarcity
became so great that the operations of trade could no longer be carried
on in this emergency law hazarded the bold experiment of forbidding the
use of specie altogether in february 1720 an edict was published which
instead of restoring the credit of the paper as was intended destroyed
it irrecoverably and drove the country to the very brink of revolution
by this famous edict it was forbidden to any person whatever to have more
than five hundred livres 20l of coin in his possession under pain of a
heavy fine and confiscation of the sums found it was also forbidden to
buy up jewellery plate and precious stones and informers were
encouraged to make search for offenders by the promise of onehalf the
amount they might discover the whole country sent up a cry of distress at
this unheardof tyranny the most odious persecution daily took place the
privacy of families was violated by the intrusion of informers and their
agents the most virtuous and honest were denounced for the crime of
having been seen with a louis dor in their possession servants
betrayed their masters one citizen became a spy upon his neighbour and
arrests and confiscations so multiplied that the courts found a
difficulty in getting through the immense increase of business thus
occasioned it was sufficient for an informer to say that he suspected any
person of concealing money in his house and immediately a searchwarrant
was granted lord stair the english ambassador said that it was now
impossible to doubt of the sincerity of laws conversion to the catholic
religion he had established the inquisition after having given
abundant evidence of his faith in transubstantiation by turning so much
gold into paper
every epithet that popular hatred could suggest was showered upon the
regent and the unhappy law coin to any amount above five hundred livres
was an illegal tender and nobody would take paper if he could help it no
one knew today what his notes would be worth tomorrow never says
duclos in his secret memoirs of the regency was seen a more
capricious governmentnever was a more frantic tyranny exercised by hands
less firm it is inconceivable to those who were witnesses of the horrors
of those times and who look back upon them now as on a dream that a
sudden revolution did not break outthat law and the regent did not
perish by a tragical death they were both held in horror but the people
confined themselves to complaints a sombre and timid despair a stupid
consternation had seized upon all and mens minds were too vile even to
be capable of a courageous crime it would appear that a one time a
movement of the people was organised seditious writings were posted up
against the walls and were sent in handbills to the houses of the most
conspicuous people one of them given in the mmoires de la rgence
was to the following effectsir and madamthis is to give you notice
that a st bartholomews day will be enacted again on saturday and sunday
if affairs do not alter you are desired not to stir out nor you nor
your servants god preserve you from the flames give notice to your
neighbours dated saturday may 25th 1720 the immense number of spies
with which the city was infested rendered the people mistrustful of one
another and beyond some trifling disturbances made in the evening by an
insignificant group which was soon dispersed the peace of the capital
was not compromised
illustration
the value of shares in the louisiana or mississippi stock had fallen
very rapidly and few indeed were found to believe the tales that had once
been told of the immense wealth of that region a last effort was
therefore tried to restore the public confidence in the mississippi
project for this purpose a general conscription of all the poor wretches
in paris was made by order of government upwards of six thousand of the
very refuse of the population were impressed as if in time of war and
were provided with clothes and tools to be embarked for new orleans to
work in the gold mines alleged to abound there they were paraded day
after day through the streets with their pikes and shovels and then sent
off in small detachments to the outports to be shipped for america
twothirds of them never reached their destination but dispersed
themselves over the country sold their tools for what they could get and
returned to their old course of life in less than three weeks afterwards
onehalf of them were to be found again in paris the manoeuvre however
caused a trifling advance in mississippi stock many persons of
superabundant gullibility believed that operations had begun in earnest in
the new golconda and that gold and silver ingots would again be found in
france
in a constitutional monarchy some surer means would have been found for
the restoration of public credit in england at a subsequent period when
a similar delusion had brought on similar distress how different were the
measures taken to repair the evil but in france unfortunately the
remedy was left to the authors of the mischief the arbitrary will of the
regent which endeavoured to extricate the country only plunged it deeper
into the mire all payments were ordered to be made in paper and between
the 1st of february and the end of may notes were fabricated to the
amount of upwards of 1500 millions of livres or 60000000l sterling
but the alarm once sounded no art could make the people feel the
slightest confidence in paper which was not exchangeable into metal m
lambert the president of the parliament of paris told the regent to his
face that he would rather have a hundred thousand livres in gold or silver
than five millions in the notes of his bank when such was the general
feeling the superabundant issues of paper but increased the evil by
rendering still more enormous the disparity between the amount of specie
and notes in circulation coin which it was the object of the regent to
depreciate rose in value on every fresh attempt to diminish it in
february it was judged advisable that the royal bank should be
incorporated with the company of the indies an edict to that effect was
published and registered by the parliament the state remained the
guarantee for the notes of the bank and no more were to be issued without
an order in council all the profits of the bank since the time it had
been taken out of laws hands and made a national institution were given
over by the regent to the company of the indies this measure had the
effect of raising for a short time the value of the louisiana and other
shares of the company but it failed in placing public credit on any
permanent basis
a council of state was held in the beginning of may at which law
dargenson his colleague in the administration of the finances and all
the ministers were present it was then computed that the total amount of
notes in circulation was 2600 millions of livres while the coin in the
country was not quite equal to half that amount it was evident to the
majority of the council that some plan must be adopted to equalise the
currency some proposed that the notes should be reduced to the value of
the specie while others proposed that the nominal value of the specie
should be raised till it was on an equality with the paper law is said to
have opposed both these projects but failing in suggesting any other it
was agreed that the notes should be depreciated one half on the 21st of
may an edict was accordingly issued by which it was decreed that the
shares of the company of the indies and the notes of the bank should
gradually diminish in value till at the end of a year they should only
pass current for onehalf of their nominal worth the parliament refused
to register the edictthe greatest outcry was excited and the state of
the country became so alarming that as the only means of preserving
tranquillity the council of the regency was obliged to stultify its own
proceedings by publishing within seven days another edict restoring the
notes to their original value
on the same day the 27th of may the bank stopped payment in specie law
and dargenson were both dismissed from the ministry the weak
vacillating and cowardly regent threw the blame of all the mischief upon
law who upon presenting himself at the palais royal was refused
admittance at nightfall however he was sent for and admitted into the
palace by a secret door12 when the regent endeavoured to console him
and made all manner of excuses for the severity with which in public he
had been compelled to treat him so capricious was his conduct that two
days afterwards he took him publicly to the opera where he sat in the
royal box alongside of the regent who treated him with marked
consideration in face of all the people but such was the hatred against
law that the experiment had well nigh proved fatal to him the mob
assailed his carriage with stones just as he was entering his own door
and if the coachman had not made a sudden jerk into the courtyard and
the domestics closed the gate immediately he would in all probability
have been dragged out and torn to pieces on the following day his wife
and daughter were also assailed by the mob as they were returning in their
carriage from the races when the regent was informed of these occurrences
he sent law a strong detachment of swiss guards who were stationed night
and day in the court of his residence the public indignation at last
increased so much that law finding his own house even with this guard
insecure took refuge in the palais royal in the apartments of the
regent
    12 duclos memoires secrets de la rgence
the chancellor daguesseau who had been dismissed in 1718 for his
opposition to the projects of law was now recalled to aid in the
restoration of credit the regent acknowledged too late that he had
treated with unjustifiable harshness and mistrust one of the ablest and
perhaps the sole honest public man of that corrupt period he had retired
ever since his disgrace to his country house at fresnes where in the
midst of severe but delightful philosophic studies he had forgotten the
intrigues of an unworthy court law himself and the chevalier de
conflans a gentleman of the regents household were despatched in a
postchaise with orders to bring the exchancellor to paris along with
them daguesseau consented to render what assistance he could contrary
to the advice of his friends who did not approve that he should accept
any recal to office of which law was the bearer on his arrival in paris
five counsellors of the parliament were admitted to confer with the
commissary of finance and on the 1st of june an order was published
abolishing the law which made it criminal to amass coin to the amount of
more than five hundred livres every one was permitted to have as much
specie as he pleased in order that the banknotes might be withdrawn
twentyfive millions of new notes were created on the security of the
revenues of the city of paris at twoandahalf per cent the banknotes
withdrawn were publicly burned in front of the htel de ville the new
notes were principally of the value of ten livres each and on the 10th of
june the bank was reopened with a sufficiency of silver coin to give in
change for them
illustration daguesseau
these measures were productive of considerable advantage all the
population of paris hastened to the bank to get coin for their small
notes and silver becoming scarce they were paid in copper very few
complained that this was too heavy although poor fellows might be
continually seen toiling and sweating along the streets laden with more
than they could comfortably carry in the shape of change for fifty
livres the crowds around the bank were so great that hardly a day passed
that some one was not pressed to death on the 9th of july the multitude
was so dense and clamorous that the guards stationed at the entrance of
the mazarin gardens closed the gate and refused to admit any more the
crowd became incensed and flung stones through the railings upon the
soldiers the latter incensed in their turn threatened to fire upon the
people  at that instant one of them was hit by a stone and taking up
his piece he fired into the crowd one man fell dead immediately and
another was severely wounded it was every instant expected that a general
attack would have been commenced upon the bank but the gates of the
mazarin gardens being opened to the crowd who saw a whole troop of
soldiers with their bayonets fixed ready to receive them they contented
themselves by giving vent to their indignation in groans and hisses
eight days afterwards the concourse of people was so tremendous that
fifteen persons were squeezed to death at the doors of the bank the
people were so indignant that they took three of the bodies on stretchers
before them and proceeded to the number of seven or eight thousand to
the gardens of the palais royal that they might shew the regent the
misfortunes that he and law had brought upon the country laws coachman
who was sitting at the box of his masters carriage in the courtyard of
the palace happened to have more zeal than discretion and not liking
that the mob should abuse his master he said loud enough to be overheard
by several persons that they were all blackguards and deserved to be
hanged the mob immediately set upon him and thinking that law was in the
carriage broke it to pieces the imprudent coachman narrowly escaped with
his life no further mischief was done a body of troops making their
appearance the crowd quietly dispersed after an assurance had been given
by the regent that the three bodies they had brought to shew him should be
decently buried at his own expense the parliament was sitting at the time
of this uproar and the president took upon himself to go out and see what
was the matter on his return he informed the councillors that laws
carriage had been broken by the mob all the members rose simultaneously
and expressed their joy by a loud shout while one man more zealous in
his hatred than the rest exclaimed and law himself is he torn to
pieces13
    13 the duchess of orleans gives a different version of this
         story but whichever be the true one the manifestation of
         such feeling in a legislative assembly was not very
         creditable she says that the president was so transported
         with joy that he was seized with a rhyming fit and
         returning into the hall exclaimed to the members
            messieurs messieurs bonne nouvelle
             le carrosse de lass est reduit en cannelle
much undoubtedly depended on the credit of the company of the indies
which was answerable for so great a sum to the nation it was therefore
suggested in the council of the ministry that any privileges which could
be granted to enable it to fulfil its engagements would be productive of
the best results with this end in view it was proposed that the
exclusive privilege of all maritime commerce should be secured to it and
an edict to that effect was published but it was unfortunately forgotten
that by such a measure all the merchants of the country would be ruined
the idea of such an immense privilege was generally scouted by the nation
and petition on petition was presented to the parliament that they would
refuse to register the decree they refused accordingly and the regent
remarking that they did nothing but fan the flame of sedition exiled them
to blois at the intercession of daguesseau the place of banishment was
changed to pontoise and thither accordingly the councillors repaired
determined to set the regent at defiance they made every arrangement for
rendering their temporary exile as agreeable as possible the president
gave the most elegant suppers to which he invited all the gayest and
wittiest company of paris every night there was a concert and ball for
the ladies the usually grave and solemn judges and councillors joined in
cards and other diversions leading for several weeks a life of the most
extravagant pleasure for no other purpose than to shew the regent of how
little consequence they deemed their banishment and that when they
willed it they could make pontoise a pleasanter residence than paris
of all the nations in the world the french are the most renowned for
singing over their grievances of that country it has been remarked with
some truth that its whole history may be traced in its songs when law
by the utter failure of his bestlaid plans rendered himself obnoxious
satire of course seized hold upon him and while caricatures of his person
appeared in all the shops the streets resounded with songs in which
neither he nor the regent was spared many of these songs were far from
decent and one of them in particular counselled the application of all
his notes to the most ignoble use to which paper can be applied but the
following preserved in the letters of the duchess of orleans was the
best and the most popular and was to be heard for months in all the
carrefours in paris the application of the chorus is happy enough

among the caricatures that were abundantly published and that shewed as
plainly as graver matters that the nation had awakened to a sense of its
folly was one a facsimile of which is preserved in the mmoires de la
rgence it was thus described by its author the goddess of shares
in her triumphal car driven by the goddess of folly those who are
drawing the car are impersonations of the mississippi with his wooden
leg the south sea the bank of england the company of the west of
senegal and of various assurances lest the car should not roll fast
enough the agents of these companies known by their long foxtails and
their cunning looks turn round the spokes of the wheels upon which are
marked the names of the several stocks and their value sometimes high and
sometimes low according to the turns of the wheel upon the ground are
the merchandise daybooks and ledgers of legitimate commerce crushed
under the chariot of folly behind is an immense crowd of persons of all
ages sexes and conditions clamoring after fortune and fighting with
each other to get a portion of the shares which she distributes so
bountifully among them in the clouds sits a demon blowing bubbles of
soap which are also the objects of the admiration and cupidity of the
crowd who jump upon one anothers backs to reach them ere they burst
right in the pathway of the car and blocking up the passage stands a
large building with three doors through one of which it must pass if it
proceeds farther and all the crowd along with it over the first door are
the words hpital des foux over the second hpital des malades
and over the third hpital des gueux another caricature represented
law sitting in a large cauldron boiling over the flames of popular
madness surrounded by an impetuous multitude who were pouring all their
gold and silver into it and receiving gladly in exchange the bits of
paper which he distributed among them by handfuls
while this excitement lasted law took good care not to expose himself
unguarded in the streets shut up in the apartments of the regent he was
secure from all attack and whenever he ventured abroad it was either
incognito or in one of the royal carriages with a powerful escort an
amusing anecdote is recorded of the detestation in which he was held by
the people and the illtreatment he would have met had he fallen into
their hands a gentleman of the name of boursel was passing in his
carriage down the rue st antoine when his farther progress was stayed by
a hackneycoach that had blocked up the road m boursels servant called
impatiently to the hackneycoachman to get out of the way and on his
refusal struck him a blow on the face a crowd was soon drawn together by
the disturbance and m boursel got out of the carriage to restore order
the hackneycoachman imagining that he had now another assailant
bethought him of an expedient to rid himself of both and called out as
loudly as he was able help help murder murder here are law and his
servant going to kill me help help at this cry the people came out of
their shops armed with sticks and other weapons while the mob gathered
stones to inflict summary vengeance upon the supposed financier happily
for m boursel and his servant the door of the church of the jesuits
stood wide open and seeing the fearful odds against them they rushed
towards it with all speed they reached the altar pursued by the people
and would have been illtreated even there if finding the door open
leading to the sacristy they had not sprang through and closed it after
them the mob were then persuaded to leave the church by the alarmed and
indignant priests and finding m boursels carriage still in the streets
they vented their illwill against it and did it considerable damage
the twentyfive millions secured on the municipal revenues of the city of
paris bearing so low an interest as two and a half per cent were not
very popular among the large holders of mississippi stock the conversion
of the securities was therefore a work of considerable difficulty for
many preferred to retain the falling paper of laws company in the hope
that a favourable turn might take place on the 15th of august with a
view to hasten the conversion an edict was passed declaring that all
notes for sums between one thousand and ten thousand livres should not
pass current except for the purchase of annuities and bank accounts or
for the payment of instalments still due on the shares of the company
in october following another edict was passed depriving these notes of
all value whatever after the month of november next ensuing the
management of the mint the farming of the revenue and all the other
advantages and privileges of the india or mississippi company were taken
from them and they were reduced to a mere private company this was the
deathblow to the whole system which had now got into the hands of its
enemies law had lost all influence in the council of finance and the
company being despoiled of its immunities could no longer hold out the
shadow of a prospect of being able to fulfil its engagements all those
suspected of illegal profits at the time the public delusion was at its
height were sought out and amerced in heavy fines it was previously
ordered that a list of the original proprietors should be made out and
that such persons as still retained their shares should place them in
deposit with the company and that those who had neglected to complete the
shares for which they had put down their names should now purchase them
of the company at the rate of 13500 livres for each share of 500 livres
rather than submit to pay this enormous sum for stock which was actually
at a discount the shareholders packed up all their portable effects and
endeavoured to find a refuge in foreign countries orders were immediately
issued to the authorities at the ports and frontiers to apprehend all
travellers who sought to leave the kingdom and keep them in custody
until it was ascertained whether they had any plate or jewellery with
them or were concerned in the late stockjobbing against such few as
escaped the punishment of death was recorded while the most arbitrary
proceedings were instituted against those who remained
law himself in a moment of despair determined to leave a country where
his life was no longer secure he at first only demanded permission to
retire from paris to one of his countryseatsa permission which the
regent cheerfully granted the latter was much affected at the unhappy
turn affairs had taken but his faith continued unmoved in the truth and
efficacy of laws financial system his eyes were opened to his own
errors and during the few remaining years of his life he constantly
longed for an opportunity of again establishing the system upon a securer
basis at laws last interview with the prince he is reported to have
saidi confess that i have committed many faults i committed them
because i am a man and all men are liable to error but i declare to you
most solemnly that none of them proceeded from wicked or dishonest
motives and that nothing of the kind will be found in the whole course of
my conduct

two or three days after his departure the regent sent him a very kind
letter permitting him to leave the kingdom whenever he pleased and
stating that he had ordered his passports to be made ready he at the same
time offered him any sum of money he might require law respectfully
declined the money and set out for brussels in a postchaise belonging to
madame de prie the mistress of the duke of bourbon escorted by six
horseguards from thence he proceeded to venice where he remained for
some months the object of the greatest curiosity to the people who
believed him to be the possessor of enormous wealth no opinion however
could be more erroneous with more generosity than could have been
expected from a man who during the greatest part of his life had been a
professed gambler he had refused to enrich himself at the expense of a
ruined nation during the height of the popular frenzy for mississippi
stock he had never doubted of the final success of his projects in making
france the richest and most powerful nation of europe he invested all his
gains in the purchase of landed property in francea sure proof of his
own belief in the stability of his schemes he had hoarded no plate or
jewellery and sent no money like the dishonest jobbers to foreign
countries his all with the exception of one diamond worth about five or
six thousand pounds sterling was invested in the french soil and when he
left that country he left it almost a beggar this fact alone ought to
rescue his memory from the charge of knavery so often and so unjustly
brought against him
as soon as his departure was known all his estates and his valuable
library were confiscated among the rest an annuity of 200000 livres
8000l sterling on the lives of his wife and children which had been
purchased for five millions of livres was forfeited notwithstanding that
a special edict drawn up for the purpose in the days of his prosperity
had expressly declared that it should never be confiscated for any cause
whatever great discontent existed among the people that law had been
suffered to escape the mob and the parliament would have been pleased to
have seen him hanged the few who had not suffered by the commercial
revolution rejoiced that the quack had left the country but all those
and they were by far the most numerous class whose fortunes were
implicated regretted that his intimate knowledge of the distress of the
country and of the causes that had led to it had not been rendered more
available in discovering a remedy
at a meeting of the council of finance and the general council of the
regency documents were laid upon the table from which it appeared that
the amount of notes in circulation was 2700 millions the regent was
called upon to explain how it happened that there was a discrepancy
between the dates at which these issues were made and those of the edicts
by which they were authorised he might have safely taken the whole blame
upon himself but he preferred that an absent man should bear a share of
it and he therefore stated that law upon his own authority had issued
1200 millions of notes at different times and that he the regent
seeing that the thing had been irrevocably done had screened law by
antedating the decrees of the council which authorised the augmentation
it would have been more to his credit if he had told the whole truth while
he was about it and acknowledged that it was mainly through his
extravagance and impatience that law had been induced to overstep the
bounds of safe speculation it was also ascertained that the national
debt on the 1st of january 1721 amounted to upwards of 3100 millions of
livres or more than 124000000l sterling the interest upon which was
3196000l a commission or visa was forthwith appointed to examine
into all the securities of the state creditors who were to be divided
into five classes the first four comprising those who had purchased their
securities with real effects and the latter comprising those who could
give no proofs that the transactions they had entered into were real and
bon fide the securities of the latter were ordered to be destroyed
while those of the first four classes were subjected to a most rigid and
jealous scrutiny the result of the labours of the visa was a report
in which they counselled the reduction of the interest upon these
securities to fiftysix millions of livres they justified this advice
by a statement of the various acts of peculation and extortion which they
had discovered and an edict to that effect was accordingly published and
duly registered by the parliaments of the kingdom
illustration dargenson
another tribunal was afterwards established under the title of the
chambre de larsenal which took cognisance of all the malversations
committed in the financial departments of the government during the late
unhappy period a master of requests named falhonet together with the
abb clement and two clerks in their employ had been concerned in divers
acts of peculation to the amount of upwards of a million of livres the
first two were sentenced to be beheaded and the latter to be hanged but
their punishment was afterwards commuted into imprisonment for life in the
bastille numerous other acts of dishonesty were discovered and punished
by fine and imprisonment
dargenson shared with law and the regent the unpopularity which had
alighted upon all those concerned in the mississippi madness he was
dismissed from his post of chancellor to make room for daguesseau but he
retained the title of keeper of the seals and was allowed to attend the
councils whenever he pleased he thought it better however to withdraw
from paris and live for a time a life of seclusion at his countryseat
but he was not formed for retirement and becoming moody and discontented
he aggravated a disease under which he had long laboured and died in less
than a twelvemonth the populace of paris so detested him that they
carried their hatred even to his grave as his funeral procession passed
to the church of st nicholas du chardonneret the buryingplace of his
family it was beset by a riotous mob and his two sons who were
following as chief mourners were obliged to drive as fast as they were
able down a bystreet to escape personal violence
as regards law he for some time entertained a hope that he should be
recalled to france to aid in establishing its credit upon a firmer basis
the death of the regent in 1723 who expired suddenly as he was sitting by
the fireside conversing with his mistress the duchess de phalaris
deprived him of that hope and he was reduced to lead his former life of
gambling he was more than once obliged to pawn his diamond the sole
remnant of his vast wealth but successful play generally enabled him to
redeem it being persecuted by his creditors at rome he proceeded to
copenhagen where he received permission from the english ministry to
reside in his native country his pardon for the murder of mr wilson
having been sent over to him in 1719 he was brought over in the admirals
shipa circumstance which gave occasion for a short debate in the house
of lords earl coningsby complained that a man who had renounced both his
country and his religion should have been treated with such honour and
expressed his belief that his presence in england at a time when the
people were so bewildered by the nefarious practices of the southsea
directors would be attended with no little danger he gave notice of a
motion on the subject but it was allowed to drop no other member of the
house having the slightest participation in his lordships fears law
remained for about four years in england and then proceeded to venice
where he died in 1729 in very embarrassed circumstances the following
epitaph was written at the time

the southsea company was originated by the celebrated harley earl of
oxford in the year 1711 with the view of restoring public credit which
had suffered by the dismissal of the whig ministry and of providing for
the discharge of the army and navy debentures and other parts of the
floating debt amounting to nearly ten millions sterling a company of
merchants at that time without a name took this debt upon themselves
and the government agreed to secure them for a certain period the interest
of six per cent to provide for this interest amounting to 600000l per
annum the duties upon wines vinegar india goods wrought silks
tobacco whalefins and some other articles were rendered permanent the
monopoly of the trade to the south seas was granted and the company
being incorporated by act of parliament assumed the title by which it has
ever since been known the minister took great credit to himself for his
share in this transaction and the scheme was always called by his
flatterers the earl of oxfords masterpiece
illustration harley earl of oxford
even at this early period of its history the most visionary ideas were
formed by the company and the public of the immense riches of the eastern
coast of south america every body had heard of the gold and silver mines
of peru and mexico every one believed them to be inexhaustible and that
it was only necessary to send the manufactures of england to the coast to
be repaid a hundred fold in gold and silver ingots by the natives a
report industriously spread that spain was willing to concede four ports
on the coasts of chili and peru for the purposes of traffic increased the
general confidence and for many years the southsea companys stock was
in high favour
philip v of spain however never had any intention of admitting the
english to a free trade in the ports of spanish america negotiations were
set on foot but their only result was the assiento contract or the
privilege of supplying the colonies with negroes for thirty years and of
sending once a year a vessel limited both as to tonnage and value of
cargo to trade with mexico peru or chili the latter permission was
only granted upon the hard condition that the king of spain should enjoy
onefourth of the profits and a tax of five per cent on the remainder
this was a great disappointment to the earl of oxford and his party who
were reminded much oftener than they found agreeable of the
    parturiunt montes nascitur ridiculus mus
but the public confidence in the southsea company was not shaken the
earl of oxford declared that spain would permit two ships in addition to
the annual ship to carry out merchandise during the first year and a
list was published in which all the ports and harbours of these coasts
were pompously set forth as open to the trade of great britain the first
voyage of the annual ship was not made till the year 1717 and in the
following year the trade was suppressed by the rupture with spain
the kings speech at the opening of the session of 1717 made pointed
allusion to the state of public credit and recommended that proper
measures should be taken to reduce the national debt the two great
monetary corporations the southsea company and the bank of england made
proposals to parliament on the 20th of may ensuing the southsea company
prayed that their capital stock of ten millions might be increased to
twelve by subscription or otherwise and offered to accept five per cent
instead of six upon the whole amount the bank made proposals equally
advantageous the house debated for some time and finally three acts were
passed called the southsea act the bank act and the general fund act
by the first the proposals of the southsea company were accepted and
that body held itself ready to advance the sum of two millions towards
discharging the principal and interest of the debt due by the state for
the four lottery funds of the ninth and tenth years of queen anne by the
second act the bank received a lower rate of interest for the sum of
1775027l 15s due to it by the state and agreed to deliver up to be
cancelled as many exchequer bills as amounted to two millions sterling
and to accept of an annuity of one hundred thousand pounds being after
the rate of five per cent the whole redeemable at one years notice they
were further required to be ready to advance in case of need a sum not
exceeding 2500000l upon the same terms of five per cent interest
redeemable by parliament the general fund act recited the various
deficiencies which were to be made good by the aids derived from the
foregoing sources
the name of the southsea company was thus continually before the public
though their trade with the south american states produced little or no
augmentation of their revenues they continued to flourish as a monetary
corporation their stock was in high request and the directors buoyed up
with success began to think of new means for extending their influence
the mississippi scheme of john law which so dazzled and captivated the
french people inspired them with an idea that they could carry on the
same game in england the anticipated failure of his plans did not divert
them from their intention wise in their own conceit they imagined they
could avoid his faults carry on their schemes for ever and stretch the
cord of credit to its extremest tension without causing it to snap
asunder
it was while laws plan was at its greatest height of popularity while
people were crowding in thousands to the rue quincampoix and ruining
themselves with frantic eagerness that the southsea directors laid
before parliament their famous plan for paying off the national debt
visions of boundless wealth floated before the fascinated eyes of the
people in the two most celebrated countries of europe the english
commenced their career of extravagance somewhat later than the french but
as soon as the delirium seized them they were determined not to be
outdone upon the 22d of january 1720 the house of commons resolved
itself into a committee of the whole house to take into consideration
that part of the kings speech at the opening of the session which related
to the public debts and the proposal of the southsea company towards the
redemption and sinking of the same the proposal set forth at great
length and under several heads the debts of the state amounting to
30981712l which the company were anxious to take upon themselves upon
consideration of five per cent per annum secured to them until midsummer
1727 after which time the whole was to become redeemable at the pleasure
of the legislature and the interest to be reduced to four per cent the
proposal was received with great favour but the bank of england had many
friends in the house of commons who were desirous that that body should
share in the advantages that were likely to accrue on behalf of this
corporation it was represented that they had performed great and eminent
services to the state in the most difficult times and deserved at least
that if any advantage was to be made by public bargains of this nature
they should be preferred before a company that had never done any thing
for the nation the further consideration of the matter was accordingly
postponed for five days in the mean time a plan was drawn up by the
governors of the bank the southsea company afraid that the bank might
offer still more advantageous terms to the government than themselves
reconsidered their former proposal and made some alterations in it which
they hoped would render it more acceptable the principal change was a
stipulation that the government might redeem these debts at the expiration
of four years instead of seven as at first suggested the bank resolved
not to be outbidden in this singular auction and the governors also
reconsidered their first proposal and sent in a new one
thus each corporation having made two proposals the house began to
deliberate mr robert walpole was the chief speaker in favour of the
bank and mr aislabie the chancellor of the exchequer the principal
advocate on behalf of the southsea company it was resolved on the 2d of
february that the proposals of the latter were most advantageous to the
country they were accordingly received and leave was given to bring in a
bill to that effect
exchange alley was in a fever of excitement the companys stock which
had been at a hundred and thirty the previous day gradually rose to three
hundred and continued to rise with the most astonishing rapidity during
the whole time that the bill in its several stages was under discussion
mr walpole was almost the only statesman in the house who spoke out
boldly against it he warned them in eloquent and solemn language of the
evils that would ensue it countenanced he said the dangerous practice
of stockjobbing and would divert the genius of the nation from trade and
industry it would hold out a dangerous lure to decoy the unwary to their
ruin by making them part with the earnings of their labour for a prospect
of imaginary wealth the great principle of the project was an evil of
firstrate magnitude it was to raise artificially the value of the stock
by exciting and keeping up a general infatuation and by promising
dividends out of funds which could never be adequate to the purpose in a
prophetic spirit he added that if the plan succeeded the directors would
become masters of the government form a new and absolute aristocracy in
the kingdom and control the resolutions of the legislature if it failed
which he was convinced it would the result would bring general discontent
and ruin upon the country such would be the delusion that when the evil
day came as come it would the people would start up as from a dream
and ask themselves if these things could have been true all his eloquence
was in vain he was looked upon as a false prophet or compared to the
hoarse raven croaking omens of evil his friends however compared him
to cassandra predicting evils which would only be believed when they came
home to mens hearths and stared them in the face at their own boards
although in former times the house had listened with the utmost
attention to every word that fell from his lips the benches became
deserted when it was known that he would speak on the southsea question
illustration sir robert walpole
the bill was two months in its progress through the house of commons
during this time every exertion was made by the directors and their
friends and more especially by the chairman the noted sir john blunt to
raise the price of the stock the most extravagant rumours were in
circulation treaties between england and spain were spoken of whereby
the latter was to grant a free trade to all her colonies and the rich
produce of the mines of potosilapaz was to be brought to england until
silver should become almost as plentiful as iron for cotton and woollen
goods with which we could supply them in abundance the dwellers in
mexico were to empty their golden mines the company of merchants trading
to the south seas would be the richest the world ever saw and every
hundred pounds invested in it would produce hundreds per annum to the
stockholder at last the stock was raised by these means to near four
hundred but after fluctuating a good deal settled at three hundred and
thirty at which price it remained when the bill passed the commons by a
majority of 172 against 55
in the house of lords the bill was hurried through all its stages with
unexampled rapidity on the 4th of april it was read a first time on the
5th it was read a second time on the 6th it was committed and on the
7th was read a third time and passed
several peers spoke warmly against the scheme but their warnings fell
upon dull cold ears a speculating frenzy had seized them as well as the
plebeians lord north and grey said the bill was unjust in its nature and
might prove fatal in its consequences being calculated to enrich the few
and impoverish the many the duke of wharton followed but as he only
retailed at secondhand the arguments so eloquently stated by walpole in
the lower house he was not listened to with even the same attention that
had been bestowed upon lord north and grey earl cowper followed on the
same side and compared the bill to the famous horse of the siege of troy
like that it was ushered in and received with great pomp and acclamations
of joy but bore within it treachery and destruction the earl of
sunderland endeavoured to answer all objections and on the question being
put there appeared only seventeen peers against and eightythree in
favour of the project the very same day on which it passed the lords it
received the royal assent and became the law of the land
it seemed at that time as if the whole nation had turned stockjobbers
exchange alley was every day blocked up by crowds and cornhill was
impassable for the number of carriages every body came to purchase stock
every fool aspired to be a knave in the words of a ballad published at
the time and sung about the streets16

the inordinate thirst of gain that had afflicted all ranks of society was
not to be slaked even in the south sea other schemes of the most
extravagant kind were started the sharelists were speedily filled up
and an enormous traffic carried on in shares while of course every
means were resorted to to raise them to an artificial value in the market
illustration cornhill 1720
contrary to all expectation southsea stock fell when the bill received
the royal assent on the 7th of april the shares were quoted at three
hundred and ten and on the following day at two hundred and ninety
already the directors had tasted the profits of their scheme and it was
not likely that they should quietly allow the stock to find its natural
level without an effort to raise it immediately their busy emissaries
were set to work every person interested in the success of the project
endeavoured to draw a knot of listeners around him to whom he expatiated
on the treasures of the south american seas exchange alley was crowded
with attentive groups one rumour alone asserted with the utmost
confidence had an immediate effect upon the stock it was said that earl
stanhope had received overtures in france from the spanish government to
exchange gibraltar and port mahon for some places on the coast of peru
for the security and enlargement of the trade in the south seas instead
of one annual ship trading to those ports and allowing the king of spain
twentyfive per cent out of the profits the company might build and
charter as many ships as they pleased and pay no per centage whatever to
any foreign potentate
    visions of ingots danced before their eyes
and stock rose rapidly on the 12th of april five days after the bill had
become law the directors opened their books for a subscription of a
million at the rate of 300l for every 100l capital such was the
concourse of persons of all ranks that this first subscription was found
to amount to above two millions of original stock it was to be paid at
five payments of 60l each for every 100l in a few days the stock
advanced to three hundred and forty and the subscriptions were sold for
double the price of the first payment to raise the stock still higher it
was declared in a general court of directors on the 21st of april that
the midsummer dividend should be ten per cent and that all subscriptions
should be entitled to the same these resolutions answering the end
designed the directors to improve the infatuation of the monied men
opened their books for a second subscription of a million at four hundred
per cent such was the frantic eagerness of people of every class to
speculate in these funds that in the course of a few hours no less than a
million and a half was subscribed at that rate
in the mean time innumerable jointstock companies started up every
where they soon received the name of bubbles the most appropriate that
imagination could devise the populace are often most happy in the
nicknames they employ none could be more apt than that of bubbles some
of them lasted for a week or a fortnight and were no more heard of while
others could not even live out that short span of existence every evening
produced new schemes and every morning new projects the highest of the
aristocracy were as eager in this hot pursuit of gain as the most plodding
jobber in cornhill the prince of wales became governor of one company
and is said to have cleared 40000l by his speculations17 the duke of
bridgewater started a scheme for the improvement of london and
westminster and the duke of chandos another there were nearly a hundred
different projects each more extravagant and deceptive than the other to
use the words of the political state they were set on foot and
promoted by crafty knaves then pursued by multitudes of covetous fools
and at last appeared to be in effect what their vulgar appellation
denoted them to bebubbles and mere cheats it was computed that near
one million and a half sterling was won and lost by these unwarrantable
practices to the impoverishment of many a fool and the enriching of many
a rogue

         craggs and earl stanhope
some of these schemes were plausible enough and had they been undertaken
at a time when the public mind was unexcited might have been pursued with
advantage to all concerned but they were established merely with the view
of raising the shares in the market the projectors took the first
opportunity of a rise to sell out and next morning the scheme was at an
end maitland in his history of london gravely informs us that one of
the projects which received great encouragement was for the establishment
of a company to make deal boards out of sawdust this is no doubt
intended as a joke but there is abundance of evidence to shew that dozens
of schemes hardly a whit more reasonable lived their little day ruining
hundreds ere they fell one of them was for a wheel for perpetual
motioncapital one million another was for encouraging the breed of
horses in england and improving of glebe and church lands and repairing
and rebuilding parsonage and vicarage houses why the clergy who were so
mainly interested in the latter clause should have taken so much interest
in the first is only to be explained on the supposition that the scheme
was projected by a knot of the foxhunting parsons once so common in
england the shares of this company were rapidly subscribed for but the
most absurd and preposterous of all and which shewed more completely
than any other the utter madness of the people was one started by an
unknown adventurer entitled a company for carrying on an undertaking of
great advantage but nobody to know what it is were not the fact stated
by scores of credible witnesses it would be impossible to believe that
any person could have been duped by such a project the man of genius who
essayed this bold and successful inroad upon public credulity merely
stated in his prospectus that the required capital was half a million in
five thousand shares of 100l each deposit 2l per share each
subscriber paying his deposit would be entitled to 100l per annum per
share how this immense profit was to be obtained he did not condescend
to inform them at that time but promised that in a month full particulars
should be duly announced and a call made for the remaining 98l of the
subscription next morning at nine oclock this great man opened an
office in cornhill crowds of people beset his door and when he shut up
at three oclock he found that no less than one thousand shares had been
subscribed for and the deposits paid he was thus in five hours the
winner of 2000l he was philosopher enough to be contented with his
venture and set off the same evening for the continent he was never
heard of again
well might swift exclaim comparing change alley to a gulf in the south
sea
   subscribers here by thousands float
      and jostle one another down
    each paddling in his leaky boat
      and here they fish for gold and drown
    now buried in the depths below
      now mounted up to heaven again
    they reel and stagger to and fro
      at their wits end like drunken men
    meantime secure on garraway cliffs
      a savage race by shipwrecks fed
    lie waiting for the foundered skiffs
      and strip the bodies of the dead
another fraud that was very successful was that of the globe permits
as they were called they were nothing more than square pieces of
playingcards on which was the impression of a seal in wax bearing the
sign of the globe tavern in the neighbourhood of exchange alley with the
inscription of sailcloth permits the possessors enjoyed no other
advantage from them than permission to subscribe at some future time to a
new sailcloth manufactory projected by one who was then known to be a
man of fortune but who was afterwards involved in the peculation and
punishment of the southsea directors these permits sold for as much as
sixty guineas in the alley
persons of distinction of both sexes were deeply engaged in all these
bubbles those of the male sex going to taverns and coffeehouses to meet
their brokers and the ladies resorting for the same purpose to the shops
of milliners and haberdashers but it did not follow that all these people
believed in the feasibility of the schemes to which they subscribed it
was enough for their purpose that their shares would by stockjobbing
arts be soon raised to a premium when they got rid of them with all
expedition to the really credulous so great was the confusion of the
crowd in the alley that shares in the same bubble were known to have been
sold at the same instant ten per cent higher at one end of the alley than
at the other sensible men beheld the extraordinary infatuation of the
people with sorrow and alarm there were some both in and out of
parliament who foresaw clearly the ruin that was impending mr walpole
did not cease his gloomy forebodings his fears were shared by all the
thinking few and impressed most forcibly upon the government on the 11th
of june the day the parliament rose the king published a proclamation
declaring that all these unlawful projects should be deemed public
nuisances and prosecuted accordingly and forbidding any broker under a
penalty of five hundred pounds from buying or selling any shares in them
notwithstanding this proclamation roguish speculators still carried them
on and the deluded people still encouraged them on the 12th of july an
order of the lords justices assembled in privy council was published
dismissing all the petitions that had been presented for patents and
charters and dissolving all the bubble companies the following copy of
their lordships order containing a list of all these nefarious projects
will not be deemed uninteresting at the present time when at periodic
intervals there is but too much tendency in the public mind to indulge in
similar practices

besides these bubbles many others sprang up daily inspite of the
condemnation of the government and the ridicule of the still sane portion
of the public the printshops teemed with caricatures and the newspapers
with epigrams and satires upon the prevalent folly an ingenious
cardmaker published a pack of southsea playingcards which are now
extremely rare each card containing besides the usual figures of a very
small size in one corner a caricature of a bubblecompany with
appropriate verses underneath one of the most famous bubbles was

it is time however to return to the great southsea gulf that swallowed
the fortunes of so many thousands of the avaricious and the credulous on
the 29th of may the stock had risen as high as five hundred and about
twothirds of the government annuitants had exchanged the securities of
the state for those of the southsea company during the whole of the
month of may the stock continued to rise and on the 28th it was quoted at
five hundred and fifty in four days after this it took a prodigious leap
rising suddenly from five hundred and fifty to eight hundred and ninety
it was now the general opinion that the stock could rise no higher and
many persons took that opportunity of selling out with a view of
realising their profits many noblemen and persons in the train of the
king and about to accompany him to hanover were also anxious to sell
out so many sellers and so few buyers appeared in the alley on the 3d
of june that the stock fell at once from eight hundred and ninety to six
hundred and forty the directors were alarmed and gave their agents
orders to buy their efforts succeeded towards evening confidence was
restored and the stock advanced to seven hundred and fifty it continued
at this price with some slight fluctuation until the company closed
their books on the 22d of june
it would be needless and uninteresting to detail the various arts employed
by the directors to keep up the price of stock it will be sufficient to
state that it finally rose to one thousand per cent it was quoted at this
price in the commencement of august the bubble was then fullblown and
began to quiver and shake preparatory to its bursting
many of the government annuitants expressed dissatisfaction against the
directors they accused them of partiality in making out the lists for
shares in each subscription further uneasiness was occasioned by its
being generally known that sir john blunt the chairman and some others
had sold out during the whole of the month of august the stock fell and
on the 2d of september it was quoted at seven hundred only
the state of things now became alarming to prevent if possible the
utter extinction of public confidence in their proceedings the directors
summoned a general court of the whole corporation to meet in merchant
tailors hall on the 8th of september by nine oclock in the morning the
room was filled to suffocation cheapside was blocked up by a crowd unable
to gain admittance and the greatest excitement prevailed the directors
and their friends mustered in great numbers sir john fellowes the
subgovernor was called to the chair he acquainted the assembly with the
cause of their meeting read to them the several resolutions of the court
of directors and gave them an account of their proceedings of the taking
in the redeemable and unredeemable funds and of the subscriptions in
money mr secretary craggs then made a short speech wherein he commended
the conduct of the directors and urged that nothing could more
effectually contribute to the bringing this scheme to perfection than
union among themselves he concluded with a motion for thanking the court
of directors for their prudent and skilful management and for desiring
them to proceed in such manner as they should think most proper for the
interest and advantage of the corporation mr hungerford who had
rendered himself very conspicuous in the house of commons for his zeal in
behalf of the southsea company and who was shrewdly suspected to have
been a considerable gainer by knowing the right time to sell out was very
magniloquent on this occasion he said that he had seen the rise and fall
the decay and resurrection of many communities of this nature but that
in his opinion none had ever performed such wonderful things in so short
a time as the southsea company they had done more than the crown the
pulpit or the bench could do they had reconciled all parties in one
common interest they had laid asleep if not wholly extinguished all the
domestic jars and animosities of the nation by the rise of their stock
monied men had vastly increased their fortunes country gentlemen had seen
the value of their lands doubled and trebled in their hands they had at
the same time done good to the church not a few of the reverend clergy
having got great sums by the project in short they had enriched the
whole nation and he hoped they had not forgotten themselves there was
some hissing at the latter part of this speech which for the extravagance
of its eulogy was not far removed from satire but the directors and their
friends and all the winners in the room applauded vehemently the duke
of portland spoke in a similar strain and expressed his great wonder why
any body should be dissatisfied of course he was a winner by his
speculations and in a condition similar to that of the fat alderman in
joe millers jests who whenever he had eaten a good dinner folded his
hands upon his paunch and expressed his doubts whether there could be a
hungry man in the world

several resolutions were passed at this meeting but they had no effect
upon the public upon the very same evening the stock fell to six hundred
and forty and on the morrow to five hundred and forty day after day it
continued to fall until it was as low as four hundred in a letter dated
september 13th from mr broderick mp to lord chancellor middleton
and published in coxes walpole the former says various are the
conjectures why the southsea directors have suffered the cloud to break
so early i made no doubt but they would do so when they found it to their
advantage they have stretched credit so far beyond what it would bear
that specie proves insufficient to support it their most considerable men
have drawn out securing themselves by the losses of the deluded
thoughtless numbers whose understandings have been overruled by avarice
and the hope of making mountains out of molehills thousands of families
will be reduced to beggary the consternation is inexpressiblethe rage
beyond description and the case altogether so desperate that i do not
see any plan or scheme so much as thought of for averting the blow so
that i cannot pretend to guess what is next to be done ten days
afterwards the stock still falling he writes the company have yet come
to no determination for they are in such a wood that they know not which
way to turn by several gentlemen lately come to town i perceive the very
name of a southseaman grows abominable in every country a great many
goldsmiths are already run off and more will daily i question whether
onethird nay onefourth of them can stand it from the very beginning
i founded my judgment of the whole affair upon the unquestionable maxim
that ten millions which is more than our running cash could not
circulate two hundred millions beyond which our paper credit extended
that therefore whenever that should become doubtful be the cause what
it would our noble state machine must inevitably fall to the ground
on the 12th of september at the earnest solicitation of mr secretary
craggs several conferences were held between the directors of the south
sea and the directors of the bank a report which was circulated that the
latter had agreed to circulate six millions of the southsea companys
bonds caused the stock to rise to six hundred and seventy but in the
afternoon as soon as the report was known to be groundless the stock
fell again to five hundred and eighty the next day to five hundred and
seventy and so gradually to four hundred20

         young craggs of some southsea stock and once supposed
         himself to be master of twenty thousand pounds his friends
         persuaded him to sell his share but he dreamed of dignity
         and splendour and could not hear to obstruct his own
         fortune he was then importuned to sell as much as would
         purchase a hundred a year for life which says fenton

         every day this counsel was rejected the profit and

the ministry were seriously alarmed at the aspect of affairs the
directors could not appear in the streets without being insulted
dangerous riots were every moment apprehended despatches were sent off to
the king at hanover praying his immediate return mr walpole who was
staying at his country seat was sent for that he might employ his known
influence with the directors of the bank of england to induce them to
accept the proposal made by the southsea company for circulating a number
of their bonds
the bank was very unwilling to mix itself up with the affairs of the
company it dreaded being involved in calamities which it could not
relieve and received all overtures with visible reluctance but the
universal voice of the nation called upon it to come to the rescue every
person of note in commercial politics was called in to advise in the
emergency a rough draft of a contract drawn up by mr walpole was
ultimately adopted as the basis of further negotiations and the public
alarm abated a little
on the following day the 20th of september a general court of the
southsea company was held at merchant tailors hall in which resolutions
were carried empowering the directors to agree with the bank of england
or any other persons to circulate the companys bonds or make any other
agreement with the bank which they should think proper one of the
speakers a mr pulteney said it was most surprising to see the
extraordinary panic which had seized upon the people men were running to
and fro in alarm and terror their imaginations filled with some great
calamity the form and dimensions of which nobody knew
   black it stood as night
    fierce as ten furiesterrible as hell
at a general court of the bank of england held two days afterwards the
governor informed them of the several meetings that had been held on the
affairs of the southsea company adding that the directors had not yet
thought fit to come to any decision upon the matter a resolution was then
proposed and carried without a dissentient voice empowering the
directors to agree with those of the south sea to circulate their bonds
to what sum and upon what terms and for what time they might think
proper
thus both parties were at liberty to act as they might judge best for the
public interest books were opened at the bank for a subscription of three
millions for the support of public credit on the usual terms of 15l per
cent deposit 3l per cent premium and 5l per cent interest so great
was the concourse of people in the early part of the morning all eagerly
bringing their money that it was thought the subscription would be filled
that day but before noon the tide turned in spite of all that could be
done to prevent it the southsea companys stock fell rapidly their
bonds were in such discredit that a run commenced upon the most eminent
goldsmiths and bankers some of whom having lent out great sums upon
southsea stock were obliged to shut up their shops and abscond the
swordblade company who had hitherto been the chief cashiers of the
southsea company stopped payment this being looked upon as but the
beginning of evil occasioned a great run upon the bank who were now
obliged to pay out money much faster than they had received it upon the
subscription in the morning the day succeeding was a holiday the 29th of
september and the bank had a little breathing time they bore up against
the storm but their former rivals the southsea company were wrecked
upon it their stock fell to one hundred and fifty and gradually after
various fluctuations to one hundred and thirtyfive
the bank finding they were not able to restore public confidence and
stem the tide of ruin without running the risk of being swept away with
those they intended to save declined to carry out the agreement into
which they had partially entered they were under no obligation whatever
to continue for the socalled bank contract was nothing more than the
rough draught of an agreement in which blanks had been left for several
important particulars and which contained no penalty for their secession
and thus to use the words of the parliamentary history were seen in
the space of eight months the rise progress and fall of that mighty
fabric which being wound up by mysterious springs to a wonderful height
had fixed the eyes and expectations of all europe but whose foundation
being fraud illusion credulity and infatuation fell to the ground as
soon as the artful management of its directors was discovered
in the heyday of its blood during the progress of this dangerous
delusion the manners of the nation became sensibly corrupted the
parliamentary inquiry set on foot to discover the delinquents disclosed
scenes of infamy disgraceful alike to the morals of the offenders and the
intellects of the people among whom they had arisen it is a deeply
interesting study to investigate all the evils that were the result
nations like individuals cannot become desperate gamblers with impunity
punishment is sure to overtake them sooner or later a celebrated
writer21 is quite wrong when he says that such an era as this is the
most unfavourable for a historian that no reader of sentiment and
imagination can be entertained or interested by a detail of transactions
such as these which admit of no warmth no colouring no embellishment a
detail of which only serves to exhibit an inanimate picture of tasteless
vice and mean degeneracy on the contraryand smollett might have
discovered it if he had been in the humourthe subject is capable of
inspiring as much interest as even a novellist can desire is there no
warmth in the despair of a plundered peopleno life and animation in the
picture which might be drawn of the woes of hundreds of impoverished and
ruined families of the wealthy of yesterday become the beggars of today
of the powerful and influential changed into exiles and outcasts and the
voice of selfreproach and imprecation resounding from every corner of the
land is it a dull or uninstructive picture to see a whole people shaking
suddenly off the trammels of reason and running wild after a golden
vision refusing obstinately to believe that it is not real till like a
deluded hind running after an ignis fatuus they are plunged into a
quagmire but in this false spirit has history too often been written the
intrigues of unworthy courtiers to gain the favour of still more unworthy
kings or the records of murderous battles and sieges have been dilated
on and told over and over again with all the eloquence of style and all
the charms of fancy while the circumstances which have most deeply
affected the morals and welfare of the people have been passed over with
but slight notice as dry and dull and capable of neither warmth nor
colouring

during the progress of this famous bubble england presented a singular
spectacle the public mind was in a state of unwholesome fermentation men
were no longer satisfied with the slow but sure profits of cautious
industry the hope of boundless wealth for the morrow made them heedless
and extravagant for today a luxury till then unheardof was
introduced bringing in its train a corresponding laxity of morals the
overbearing insolence of ignorant men who had arisen to sudden wealth by
successful gambling made men of true gentility of mind and manners blush
that gold should have power to raise the unworthy in the scale of society
the haughtiness of some of these cyphering cits as they were termed by
sir richard steele was remembered against them in the day of their
adversity in the parliamentary inquiry many of the directors suffered
more for their insolence than for their peculation one of them who in
the fullblown pride of an ignorant rich man had said that he would feed
his horse upon gold was reduced almost to bread and water for himself
every haughty look every overbearing speech was set down and repaid
them a hundredfold in poverty and humiliation
the state of matters all over the country was so alarming that george i
shortened his intended stay in hanover and returned in all haste to
england he arrived on the 11th of november and parliament was summoned
to meet on the 8th of december in the mean time public meetings were
held in every considerable town of the empire at which petitions were
adopted praying the vengeance of the legislature upon the southsea
directors who by their fraudulent practices had brought the nation to
the brink of ruin nobody seemed to imagine that the nation itself was as
culpable as the southsea company nobody blamed the credulity and avarice
of the peoplethe degrading lust of gain which had swallowed up every
nobler quality in the national character or the infatuation which had
made the multitude run their heads with such frantic eagerness into the
net held out for them by scheming projectors these things were never
mentioned the people were a simple honest hardworking people ruined
by a gang of robbers who were to be hanged drawn and quartered without
mercy
this was the almost unanimous feeling of the country the two houses of
parliament were not more reasonable before the guilt of the southsea
directors was known punishment was the only cry the king in his speech
from the throne expressed his hope that they would remember that all
their prudence temper and resolution were necessary to find out and
apply the proper remedy for their misfortunes in the debate on the answer
to the address several speakers indulged in the most violent invectives
against the directors of the southsea project the lord molesworth was
particularly vehement it had been said by some that there was no law to
punish the directors of the southsea company who were justly looked upon
as the authors of the present misfortunes of the state in his opinion
they ought upon this occasion to follow the example of the ancient romans
who having no law against parricide because their legislators supposed
no son could be so unnaturally wicked as to embrue his hands in his
fathers blood made a law to punish this heinous crime as soon as it was
committed they adjudged the guilty wretch to be sown in a sack and
thrown alive into the tiber he looked upon the contrivers and executors
of the villanous southsea scheme as the parricides of their country and
should be satisfied to see them tied in like manner in sacks and thrown
into the thames other members spoke with as much want of temper and
discretion mr walpole was more moderate he recommended that their first
care should be to restore public credit if the city of london were on
fire all wise men would aid in extinguishing the flames and preventing
the spread of the conflagration before they inquired after the incendiaries
public credit had received a dangerous wound and lay bleeding and they
ought to apply a speedy remedy to it it was time enough to punish the
assassin afterwards on the 9th of december an address in answer to his
majestys speech was agreed upon after an amendment which was carried
without a division that words should be added expressive of the
determination of the house not only to seek a remedy for the national
distresses but to punish the authors of them

the inquiry proceeded rapidly the directors were ordered to lay before
the house a full account of all their proceedings resolutions were passed
to the effect that the calamity was mainly owing to the vile arts of
stockjobbers and that nothing could tend more to the reestablishment of
public credit than a law to prevent this infamous practice mr walpole
then rose and said that as he had previously hinted he had spent some
time upon a scheme for restoring public credit but that the execution of
it depending upon a position which had been laid down as fundamental he
thought it proper before he opened out his scheme to be informed whether
he might rely upon that foundation it was whether the subscription of
public debts and encumbrances money subscriptions and other contracts
made with the southsea company should remain in the present state this
question occasioned an animated debate it was finally agreed by a
majority of 259 against 117 that all these contracts should remain in
their present state unless altered for the relief of the proprietors by a
general court of the southsea company or set aside by due course of law
on the following day mr walpole laid before a committee of the whole
house his scheme for the restoration of public credit which was in
substance to engraft nine millions of southsea stock into the bank of
england and the same sum into the east india company upon certain
conditions the plan was favourably received by the house after some few
objections it was ordered that proposals should be received from the two
great corporations they were both unwilling to lend their aid and the
plan met with a warm but fruitless opposition at the general courts
summoned for the purpose of deliberating upon it they however
ultimately agreed upon the terms on which they would consent to circulate
the southsea bonds and their report being presented to the committee a
bill was brought in under the superintendence of mr walpole and safely
carried through both houses of parliament
a bill was at the same time brought in for restraining the southsea
directors governor subgovernor treasurer cashier and clerks from
leaving the kingdom for a twelvemonth and for discovering their estates
and effects and preventing them from transporting or alienating the same
all the most influential members of the house supported the bill mr
shippen seeing mr secretary craggs in his place and believing the
injurious rumours that were afloat of that ministers conduct in the
southsea business determined to touch him to the quick he said he was
glad to see a british house of commons resuming its pristine vigour and
spirit and acting with so much unanimity for the public good it was
necessary to secure the persons and estates of the southsea directors and
their officers but he added looking fixedly at mr craggs as he
spoke there were other men in high station whom in time he would not
be afraid to name who were no less guilty than the directors mr craggs
arose in great wrath and said that if the innuendo were directed against
him he was ready to give satisfaction to any man who questioned him
either in the house or out of it loud cries of order immediately arose on
every side in the midst of the uproar lord molesworth got up and
expressed his wonder at the boldness of mr craggs in challenging the
whole house of commons he lord molesworth though somewhat old past
sixty would answer mr craggs whatever he had to say in the house and he
trusted there were plenty of young men beside him who would not be afraid
to look mr craggs in the face out of the house the cries of order again
resounded from every side the members arose simultaneously every body
seemed to be vociferating at once the speaker in vain called order the
confusion lasted several minutes during which lord molesworth and mr
craggs were almost the only members who kept their seats at last the
call for mr craggs became so violent that he thought proper to submit to
the universal feeling of the house and explain his unparliamentary
expression he said that by giving satisfaction to the impugners of his
conduct in that house he did not mean that he would fight but that he
would explain his conduct here the matter ended and the house proceeded
to debate in what manner they should conduct their inquiry into the
affairs of the southsea company whether in a grand or a select
committee ultimately a secret committee of thirteen was appointed with
power to send for persons papers and records
the lords were as zealous and as hasty as the commons the bishop of
rochester said the scheme had been like a pestilence the duke of wharton
said the house ought to shew no respect of persons that for his part he
would give up the dearest friend he had if he had been engaged in the
project the nation had been plundered in a most shameful and flagrant
manner and he would go as far as any body in the punishment of the
offenders lord stanhope said that every farthing possessed by the
criminals whether directors or not directors ought to be confiscated to
make good the public losses
during all this time the public excitement was extreme we learn from
coxes walpole that the very name of a southsea director was thought
to be synonymous with every species of fraud and villany petitions from
counties cities and boroughs in all parts of the kingdom were
presented crying for the justice due to an injured nation and the
punishment of the villanous peculators those moderate men who would not
go to extreme lengths even in the punishment of the guilty were accused
of being accomplices were exposed to repeated insults and virulent
invectives and devoted both in anonymous letters and public writings to
the speedy vengeance of an injured people the accusations against mr
aislabie chancellor of the exchequer and mr craggs another member of
the ministry were so loud that the house of lords resolved to proceed at
once into the investigation concerning them it was ordered on the 21st
of january that all brokers concerned in the southsea scheme should lay
before the house an account of the stock or subscriptions bought or sold
by them for any of the officers of the treasury or exchequer or in trust
for any of them since michaelmas 1719 when this account was delivered
it appeared that large quantities of stock had been transferred to the use
of mr aislabie five of the southsea directors including mr edward
gibbon the grandfather of the celebrated historian were ordered into the
custody of the black rod upon a motion made by earl stanhope it was
unanimously resolved that the taking in or giving credit for stock
without a valuable consideration actually paid or sufficiently secured or
the purchasing stock by any director or agent of the southsea company
for the use or benefit of any member of the administration or any member
of either house of parliament during such time as the southsea bill was
yet pending in parliament was a notorious and dangerous corruption
another resolution was passed a few days afterwards to the effect that
several of the directors and officers of the company having in a
clandestine manner sold their own stock to the company had been guilty
of a notorious fraud and breach of trust and had thereby mainly caused
the unhappy turn of affairs that had so much affected public credit mr
aislabie resigned his office as chancellor of the exchequer and absented
himself from parliament until the formal inquiry into his individual
guilt was brought under the consideration of the legislature
in the mean time knight the treasurer of the company and who was
entrusted with all the dangerous secrets of the dishonest directors
packed up his books and documents and made his escape from the country
he embarked in disguise in a small boat on the river and proceeding to a
vessel hired for the purpose was safely conveyed to calais the committee
of secrecy informed the house of the circumstance when it was resolved
unanimously that two addresses should be presented to the king the first
praying that he would issue a proclamation offering a reward for the
apprehension of knight and the second that he would give immediate
orders to stop the ports and to take effectual care of the coasts to
prevent the said knight or any other officers of the southsea company
from escaping out of the kingdom the ink was hardly dry upon these
addresses before they were carried to the king by mr methuen deputed by
the house for that purpose the same evening a royal proclamation was
issued offering a reward of two thousand pounds for the apprehension of
knight the commons ordered the doors of the house to be locked and the
keys to be placed on the table general ross one of the members of the
committee of secrecy acquainted them that they had already discovered a
train of the deepest villany and fraud that hell had ever contrived to
ruin a nation which in due time they would lay before the house in the
mean time in order to a further discovery the committee thought it
highly necessary to secure the persons of some of the directors and
principal southsea officers and to seize their papers a motion to this
effect having been made was carried unanimously sir robert chaplin sir
theodore janssen mr sawbridge and mr f eyles members of the house
and directors of the southsea company were summoned to appear in their
places and answer for their corrupt practices sir theodore janssen and
mr sawbridge answered to their names and endeavoured to exculpate
themselves the house heard them patiently and then ordered them to
withdraw a motion was then made and carried nemine contradicente that
they had been guilty of a notorious breach of trusthad occasioned much
loss to great numbers of his majestys subjects and had highly prejudiced
the public credit it was then ordered that for their offence they
should be expelled the house and taken into the custody of the
sergeantatarms sir robert chaplin and mr eyles attending in their
places four days afterwards were also expelled the house it was resolved
at the same time to address the king to give directions to his ministers
at foreign courts to make application for knight that he might be
delivered up to the english authorities in case he took refuge in any of
their dominions the king at once agreed and messengers were despatched
to all parts of the continent the same night
among the directors taken into custody was sir john blunt the man whom
popular opinion has generally accused of having been the original author
and father of the scheme this man we are informed by pope in his
epistle to allen lord bathurst was a dissenter of a most religious
deportment and professed to be a great believer24 he constantly
declaimed against the luxury and corruption of the age the partiality of
parliaments and the misery of party spirit he was particularly eloquent
against avarice in great and noble persons he was originally a scrivener
and afterwards became not only a director but the most active manager of
the southsea company whether it was during his career in this capacity
that he first began to declaim against the avarice of the great we are
not informed he certainly must have seen enough of it to justify his
severest anathema but if the preacher had himself been free from the vice
he condemned his declamations would have had a better effect he was
brought up in custody to the bar of the house of lords and underwent a
long examination he refused to answer several important questions he
said he had been examined already by a committee of the house of commons
and as he did not remember his answers and might contradict himself he
refused to answer before another tribunal this declaration in itself an
indirect proof of guilt occasioned some commotion in the house he was
again asked peremptorily whether he had ever sold any portion of the stock
to any member of the administration or any member of either house of
parliament to facilitate the passing of the bill he again declined to
answer he was anxious he said to treat the house with all possible
respect but he thought it hard to be compelled to accuse himself after
several ineffectual attempts to refresh his memory he was directed to
withdraw a violent discussion ensued between the friends and opponents of
the ministry it was asserted that the administration were no strangers to
the convenient taciturnity of sir john blunt the duke of wharton made a
reflection upon the earl stanhope which the latter warmly resented he
spoke under great excitement and with such vehemence as to cause a sudden
determination of blood to the head he felt himself so ill that he was
obliged to leave the house and retire to his chamber he was cupped
immediately and also let blood on the following morning but with slight
relief the fatal result was not anticipated towards evening he became
drowsy and turning himself on his face expired the sudden death of this
statesman caused great grief to the nation george i was exceedingly
affected and shut himself up for some hours in his closet inconsolable
for his loss

knight the treasurer of the company was apprehended at tirlemont near
liege by one of the secretaries of mr leathes the british resident at
brussels and lodged in the citadel of antwerp repeated applications were
made to the court of austria to deliver him up but in vain knight threw
himself upon the protection of the states of brabant and demanded to be
tried in that country it was a privilege granted to the states of brabant
by one of the articles of the joyeuse entre that every criminal
apprehended in that country should be tried in that country the states
insisted on their privilege and refused to deliver knight to the british
authorities the latter did not cease their solicitations but in the mean
time knight escaped from the citadel

on the 16th of february the committee of secrecy made their first report
to the house they stated that their inquiry had been attended with
numerous difficulties and embarrassments every one they had examined had
endeavoured as far as in him lay to defeat the ends of justice in some
of the books produced before them false and fictitious entries had been
made in others there were entries of money with blanks for the name of
the stockholders there were frequent erasures and alterations and in
some of the books leaves were torn out they also found that some books of
great importance had been destroyed altogether and that some had been
taken away or secreted at the very entrance into their inquiry they had
observed that the matters referred to them were of great variety and
extent many persons had been entrusted with various parts in the
execution of the law and under colour thereof had acted in an
unwarrantable manner in disposing of the properties of many thousands of
persons amounting to many millions of money they discovered that before
the southsea act was passed there was an entry in the companys books of
the sum of 1259325l upon account of stock stated to have been sold to
the amount of 574500l this stock was all fictitious and had been
disposed of with a view to promote the passing of the bill it was noted
as sold on various days and at various prices from 150 to 325 per cent
being surprised to see so large an account disposed of at a time when the
company were not empowered to increase their capital the committee
determined to investigate most carefully the whole transaction the
governor subgovernor and several directors were brought before them
and examined rigidly they found that at the time these entries were
made the company was not in possession of such a quantity of stock
having in their own right only a small quantity not exceeding thirty
thousand pounds at the utmost pursuing the inquiry they found that this
amount of stock was to be esteemed as taken in or holden by the company
for the benefit of the pretended purchasers although no mutual agreement
was made for its delivery or acceptance at any certain time no money was
paid down nor any deposit or security whatever given to the company by
the supposed purchasers so that if the stock had fallen as might have
been expected had the act not passed they would have sustained no loss
if on the contrary the price of stock advanced as it actually did by
the success of the scheme the difference by the advanced price was to be
made good to them accordingly after the passing of the act the account
of stock was made up and adjusted with mr knight and the pretended
purchasers were paid the difference out of the companys cash this
fictitious stock which had been chiefly at the disposal of sir john
blunt mr gibbon and mr knight was distributed among several members
of the government and their connexions by way of bribe to facilitate the
passing of the bill to the earl of sunderland was assigned 50000l of
this stock to the duchess of kendal 10000l to the countess of platen
10000l to her two nieces 10000l to mr secretary craggs 30000l
to mr charles stanhope one of the secretaries of the treasury
10000l to the swordblade company 50000l it also appeared that mr
stanhope had received the enormous sum of 250000l as the difference in
the price of some stock through the hands of turner caswall and co
but that his name had been partly erased from their books and altered to
stangape aislabie the chancellor of the exchequer had made profits
still more abominable he had an account with the same firm who were also
southsea directors to the amount of 794451l he had besides advised
the company to make their second subscription one million and a half
instead of a million by their own authority and without any warrant the
third subscription had been conducted in a manner as disgraceful mr
aislabies name was down for 70000l mr craggs senior for 659000l
the earl of sunderlands for 160000l and mr stanhope for 47000l this
report was succeeded by six others less important at the end of the
last the committee declared that the absence of knight who had been
principally entrusted prevented them from carrying on their inquiries
the first report was ordered to be printed and taken into consideration
on the next day but one succeeding after a very angry and animated
debate a series of resolutions were agreed to condemnatory of the
conduct of the directors of the members of the parliament and of the
administration concerned with them and declaring that they ought each
and all to make satisfaction out of their own estates for the injury they
had done the public their practices were declared to be corrupt
infamous and dangerous and a bill was ordered to be brought in for the
relief of the unhappy sufferers

mr charles stanhope was the first person brought to account for his share
in these transactions he urged in his defence that for some years past
he had lodged all the money he was possessed of in mr knights hands and
whatever stock mr knight had taken in for him he had paid a valuable
consideration for it as for the stock that had been bought for him by
turner caswall and co he knew nothing about it whatever had been done
in that matter was done without his authority and he could not be
responsible for it turner and co took the latter charge upon themselves
but it was notorious to every unbiassed and unprejudiced person that mr
stanhope was a gainer of the 250000l which lay in the hands of that firm
to his credit he was however acquitted by a majority of three only the
greatest exertions were made to screen him lord stanhope the son of the
earl of chesterfield went round to the wavering members using all the
eloquence he was possessed of to induce them either to vote for the
acquittal or to absent themselves from the house many weakheaded
country gentlemen were led astray by his persuasions and the result was
as already stated the acquittal caused the greatest discontent throughout
the country mobs of a menacing character assembled in different parts of
london fears of riots were generally entertained especially as the
examination of a still greater delinquent was expected by many to have a
similar termination mr aislabie whose high office and deep
responsibilities should have kept him honest even had native principle
been insufficient was very justly regarded as perhaps the greatest
criminal of all his case was entered into on the day succeeding the
acquittal of mr stanhope great excitement prevailed and the lobbies and
avenues of the house were beset by crowds impatient to know the result
the debate lasted the whole day mr aislabie found few friends his guilt
was so apparent and so heinous that nobody had courage to stand up in his
favour it was finally resolved without a dissentient voice that mr
aislabie had encouraged and promoted the destructive execution of the
southsea scheme with a view to his own exorbitant profit and had
combined with the directors in their pernicious practices to the ruin of
the public trade and credit of the kingdom that he should for his
offences be ignominiously expelled from the house of commons and
committed a close prisoner to the tower of london that he should be
restrained from going out of the kingdom for a whole year or till the end
of the next session of parliament and that he should make out a correct
account of all his estate in order that it might be applied to the relief
of those who had suffered by his malpractices
this verdict caused the greatest joy though it was delivered at halfpast
twelve at night it soon spread over the city several persons illuminated
their houses in token of their joy on the following day when mr
aislabie was conveyed to the tower the mob assembled on towerhill with
the intention of hooting and pelting him not succeeding in this they
kindled a large bonfire and danced around it in the exuberance of their
delight several bonfires were made in other places london presented the
appearance of a holiday and people congratulated one another as if they
had just escaped from some great calamity the rage upon the acquittal of
mr stanhope had grown to such a height that none could tell where it
would have ended had mr aislabie met with the like indulgence
to increase the public satisfaction sir george caswall of the firm of
turner caswall and co was expelled from the house on the following
day committed to the tower and ordered to refund the sum of 250000l
illustration earl of sunderland
that part of the report of the committee of secrecy which related to the
earl of sunderland was next taken into consideration every effort was
made to clear his lordship from the imputation as the case against him
rested chiefly on the evidence extorted from sir john blunt great pains
were taken to make it appear that sir johns word was not to be believed
especially in a matter affecting the honour of a peer and privy
councillor all the friends of the ministry rallied around the earl it
being generally reported that a verdict of guilty against him would bring
a tory ministry into power he was eventually acquitted by a majority of
233 against 172 but the country was convinced of his guilt the greatest
indignation was every where expressed and menacing mobs again assembled
in london happily no disturbance took place
this was the day on which mr craggs the elder expired the morrow had
been appointed for the consideration of his case it was very generally
believed that he had poisoned himself it appeared however that grief
for the loss of his son one of the secretaries of the treasury who had
died five weeks previously of the smallpox preyed much on his mind for
this son dearly beloved he had been amassing vast heaps of riches he
had been getting money but not honestly and he for whose sake he had
bartered his honour and sullied his fame was now no more the dread of
further exposure increased his trouble of mind and ultimately brought on
an apoplectic fit in which he expired he left a fortune of a million and
a half which was afterwards confiscated for the benefit of the sufferers
by the unhappy delusion he had been so mainly instrumental in raising
one by one the case of every director of the company was taken into
consideration a sum amounting to two millions and fourteen thousand
pounds was confiscated from their estates towards repairing the mischief
they had done each man being allowed a certain residue in proportion to
his conduct and circumstances with which he might begin the world anew
sir john blunt was only allowed 5000l out of his fortune of upwards of
183000l sir john fellows was allowed 10000l out of 243000l sir
theodore janssen 50000l out of 243000l mr edward gibbon 10000l
out of 106000l sir john lambert 5000l out of 72000l others less
deeply involved were treated with greater liberality gibbon the
historian whose grandfather was the mr edward gibbon so severely
mulcted has given in the memoirs of his life and writings an
interesting account of the proceedings in parliament at this time he owns
that he is not an unprejudiced witness but as all the writers from which
it is possible to extract any notice of the proceedings of these
disastrous years were prejudiced on the other side the statements of the
great historian become of additional value if only on the principle audi
alteram partem his opinion is entitled to consideration in the year
1716 he says my grandfather was elected one of the directors of the
southsea company and his books exhibited the proof that before his
acceptance of that fatal office he had acquired an independent fortune of
60000l but his fortune was overwhelmed in the shipwreck of the year
1720 and the labours of thirty years were blasted in a single day of the
use or abuse of the southsea scheme of the guilt or innocence of my
grandfather and his brother directors i am neither a competent nor a
disinterested judge yet the equity of modern times must condemn the
violent and arbitrary proceedings which would have disgraced the cause of
justice and rendered injustice still more odious no sooner had the
nation awakened from its golden dream than a popular and even a
parliamentary clamour demanded its victims but it was acknowledged on all
sides that the directors however guilty could not be touched by any
known laws of the land the intemperate notions of lord molesworth were
not literally acted on but a bill of pains and penalties was
introduceda retroactive statute to punish the offences which did not
exist at the time they were committed the legislature restrained the
persons of the directors imposed an exorbitant security for their
appearance and marked their character with a previous note of ignominy
they were compelled to deliver upon oath the strict value of their
estates and were disabled from making any transfer or alienation of any
part of their property against a bill of pains and penalties it is the
common right of every subject to be heard by his counsel at the bar they
prayed to be heard their prayer was refused and their oppressors who
required no evidence would listen to no defence it had been at first
proposed that oneeighth of their respective estates should be allowed
for the future support of the directors but it was especially urged that
in the various shades of opulence and guilt such a proportion would be
too light for many and for some might possibly be too heavy the
character and conduct of each man were separately weighed but instead of
the calm solemnity of a judicial inquiry the fortune and honour of
thirtythree englishmen were made the topics of hasty conversation the
sport of a lawless majority and the basest member of the committee by a
malicious word or a silent vote might indulge his general spleen or
personal animosity injury was aggravated by insult and insult was
embittered by pleasantry allowances of 20l or 1s were facetiously
moved a vague report that a director had formerly been concerned in
another project by which some unknown persons had lost their money was
admitted as a proof of his actual guilt one man was ruined because he had
dropped a foolish speech that his horses should feed upon gold another
because he was grown so proud that one day at the treasury he had
refused a civil answer to persons much above him all were condemned
absent and unheard in arbitrary fines and forfeitures which swept away
the greatest part of their substance such bold oppression can scarcely be
shielded by the omnipotence of parliament my grandfather could not expect
to be treated with more lenity than his companions his tory principles
and connexions rendered him obnoxious to the ruling powers his name was
reported in a suspicious secret his wellknown abilities could not plead
the excuse of ignorance or error in the first proceedings against the
southsea directors mr gibbon was one of the first taken into custody
and in the final sentence the measure of his fine proclaimed him eminently
guilty the total estimate which he delivered on oath to the house of
commons amounted to 106543l 5s 6d exclusive of antecedent
settlements two different allowances of 15000l and of 10000l were
moved for mr gibbon but on the question being put it was carried
without a division for the smaller sum on these ruins with the skill and
credit of which parliament had not been able to despoil him my
grandfather at a mature age erected the edifice of a new fortune the
labours of sixteen years were amply rewarded and i have reason to believe
that the second structure was not much inferior to the first

the next consideration of the legislature after the punishment of the
directors was to restore public credit the scheme of walpole had been
found insufficient and had fallen into disrepute a computation was made
of the whole capital stock of the southsea company at the end of the year
1720 it was found to amount to thirtyseven millions eight hundred
thousand pounds of which the stock allotted to all the proprietors only
amounted to twentyfour millions five hundred thousand pounds the
remainder of thirteen millions three hundred thousand pounds belonged to
the company in their corporate capacity and was the profit they had made
by the national delusion upwards of eight millions of this were taken
from the company and divided among the proprietors and subscribers
generally making a dividend of about 33l 6s 8d per cent this was a
great relief it was further ordered that such persons as had borrowed
money from the southsea company upon stock actually transferred and
pledged at the time of borrowing to or for the use of the company should
be free from all demands upon payment of ten per cent of the sums so
borrowed they had lent about eleven millions in this manner at a time
when prices were unnaturally raised and they now received back one
million one hundred thousand when prices had sunk to their ordinary
level
but it was a long time before public credit was thoroughly restored
enterprise like icarus had soared too high and melted the wax of her
wings like icarus she had fallen into a sea and learned while
floundering in its waves that her proper element was the solid ground
she has never since attempted so high a flight
in times of great commercial prosperity there has been a tendency to
overspeculation on several occasions since then the success of one
project generally produces others of a similar kind popular imitativeness
will always in a trading nation seize hold of such successes and drag a
community too anxious for profits into an abyss from which extrication is
difficult bubble companies of a kind similar to those engendered by the
southsea project lived their little day in the famous year of the panic
1825 on that occasion as in 1720 knavery gathered a rich harvest from
cupidity but both suffered when the day of reckoning came the schemes of
the year 1836 threatened at one time results as disastrous but they
were happily averted before it was too late27
    27 the southsea project remained until 1845 the greatest
         example in british history of the infatuation of the people
         for commercial gambling the first edition of these volumes
         was published some time before the outbreak of the great

the tulipomania
    quis furor  civeslucan
the tulipso named it is said from a turkish word signifying a
turbanwas introduced into western europe about the middle of the
sixteenth century conrad gesner who claims the merit of having brought
it into reputelittle dreaming of the commotion it was shortly
afterwards to make in the worldsays that he first saw it in the year
1559 in a garden at augsburg belonging to the learned counsellor
herwart a man very famous in his day for his collection of rare exotics
the bulbs were sent to this gentleman by a friend at constantinople where
the flower had long been a favourite in the course of ten or eleven years
after this period tulips were much sought after by the wealthy
especially in holland and germany rich people at amsterdam sent for the
bulbs direct to constantinople and paid the most extravagant prices for
them the first roots planted in england were brought from vienna in 1600
until the year 1634 the tulip annually increased in reputation until it
was deemed a proof of bad taste in any man of fortune to be without a
collection of them many learned men including pompeius de angelis and
the celebrated lipsius of leyden the author of the treatise de
constantia were passionately fond of tulips the rage for possessing
them soon caught the middle classes of society and merchants and
shopkeepers even of moderate means began to vie with each other in the
rarity of these flowers and the preposterous prices they paid for them a
trader at harlaem was known to pay onehalf of his fortune for a single
root not with the design of selling it again at a profit but to keep in
his own conservatory for the admiration of his acquaintance
one would suppose that there must have been some great virtue in this
flower to have made it so valuable in the eyes of so prudent a people as
the dutch but it has neither the beauty nor the perfume of the
rosehardly the beauty of the sweet sweetpea neither is it as
enduring as either cowley it is true is loud in its praise he says
   the tulip next appeared all over gay
    but wanton full of pride and full of play
    the world cant shew a dye but here has place
    nay by new mixtures she can change her face
    purple and gold are both beneath her care
    the richest needlework she loves to wear
    her only study is to please the eye
    and to outshine the rest in finery
this though not very poetical is the description of a poet beckmann in
his history of inventions paints it with more fidelity and in prose
more pleasing than cowleys poetry he says there are few plants which
acquire through accident weakness or disease so many variegations as
the tulip when uncultivated and in its natural state it is almost of
one colour has large leaves and an extraordinarily long stem when it
has been weakened by cultivation it becomes more agreeable in the eyes of
the florist the petals are then paler smaller and more diversified in
hue and the leaves acquire a softer green colour thus this masterpiece
of culture the more beautiful it turns grows so much the weaker so
that with the greatest skill and most careful attention it can scarcely
be transplanted or even kept alive
many persons grow insensibly attached to that which gives them a great
deal of trouble as a mother often loves her sick and everailing child
better than her more healthy offspring upon the same principle we must
account for the unmerited encomia lavished upon these fragile blossoms in
1634 the rage among the dutch to possess them was so great that the
ordinary industry of the country was neglected and the population even
to its lowest dregs embarked in the tulip trade as the mania increased
prices augmented until in the year 1635 many persons were known to
invest a fortune of 100000 florins in the purchase of forty roots it
then became necessary to sell them by their weight in perits a small
weight less than a grain a tulip of the species called admiral liefken
weighing 400 perits was worth 4400 florins an admiral van der eyck
weighing 446 perits was worth 1260 florins a childer of 106 perits
was worth 1615 florins a viceroy of 400 perits 3000 florins and
most precious of all a semper augustus weighing 200 perits was
thought to be very cheap at 5500 florins the latter was much sought
after and even an inferior bulb might command a price of 2000 florins it
is related that at one time early in 1636 there were only two roots of
this description to be had in all holland and those not of the best one
was in the possession of a dealer in amsterdam and the other in harlaem
so anxious were the speculators to obtain them that one person offered
the feesimple of twelve acres of buildingground for the harlaem tulip
that of amsterdam was bought for 4600 florins a new carriage two grey
horses and a complete suit of harness hunting an industrious author of
that day who wrote a folio volume of one thousand pages upon the
tulipomania has preserved the folio wing list of the various articles
and their value which were delivered for one single root of the rare

people who had been absent from holland and whose chance it was to return
when this folly was at its maximum were sometimes led into awkward
dilemmas by their ignorance there is an amusing instance of the kind
related in blainvilles travels a wealthy merchant who prided himself
not a little on his rare tulips received upon one occasion a very
valuable consignment of merchandise from the levant intelligence of its
arrival was brought him by a sailor who presented himself for that
purpose at the countinghouse among bales of goods of every description
the merchant to reward him for his news munificently made him a present
of a fine red herring for his breakfast the sailor had it appears a
great partiality for onions and seeing a bulb very like an onion lying
upon the counter of this liberal trader and thinking it no doubt very
much out of its place among silks and velvets he slily seized an
opportunity and slipped it into his pocket as a relish for his herring
he got clear off with his prize and proceeded to the quay to eat his
breakfast hardly was his back turned when the merchant missed his
valuable semper augustus worth three thousand florins or about 280l
sterling the whole establishment was instantly in an uproar search was
every where made for the precious root but it was not to be found great
was the merchants distress of mind the search was renewed but again
without success at last some one thought of the sailor
the unhappy merchant sprang into the street at the bare suggestion his
alarmed household followed him the sailor simple soul had not thought
of concealment he was found quietly sitting on a coil of ropes
masticating the last morsel of his onion little did he dream that he
had been eating a breakfast whose cost might have regaled a whole ships
crew for a twelvemonth or as the plundered merchant himself expressed
it might have sumptuously feasted the prince of orange and the whole
court of the stadtholder anthony caused pearls to be dissolved in wine
to drink the health of cleopatra sir richard whittington was as foolishly
magnificent in an entertainment to king henry v and sir thomas gresham
drank a diamond dissolved in wine to the health of queen elizabeth when
she opened the royal exchange but the breakfast of this roguish dutchman
was as splendid as either he had an advantage too over his wasteful
predecessors their gems did not improve the taste or the wholesomeness
of their wine while his tulip was quite delicious with his red
herring the most unfortunate part of the business for him was that he
remained in prison for some months on a charge of felony preferred against
him by the merchant
another story is told of an english traveller which is scarcely less
ludicrous this gentleman an amateur botanist happened to see a
tuliproot lying in the conservatory of a wealthy dutchman being ignorant
of its quality he took out his penknife and peeled off its coats with
the view of making experiments upon it when it was by this means reduced
to half its size he cut it into two equal sections making all the time
many learned remarks on the singular appearances of the unknown bulb
suddenly the owner pounced upon him and with fury in his eyes asked
him if he knew what he had been doing peeling a most extraordinary
onion replied the philosopher hundert tausend duyvel said the
duchman its an admiral van der eyck thank you replied the
traveller taking out his notebook to make a memorandum of the same are
these admirals common in your country death and the devil said the
dutchman seizing the astonished man of science by the collar come
before the syndic and you shall see in spite of his remonstrances the
traveller was led through the streets followed by a mob of persons when
brought into the presence of the magistrate he learned to his
consternation that the root upon which he had been experimentalising was
worth four thousand florins and notwithstanding all he could urge in
extenuation he was lodged in prison until he found securities for the
payment of this sum
the demand for tulips of a rare species increased so much in the year
1636 that regular marts for their sale were established on the stock
exchange of amsterdam in rotterdam harlaem leyden alkmar hoorn and
other towns symptoms of gambling now became for the first time
apparent the stockjobbers ever on the alert for a new speculation
dealt largely in tulips making use of all the means they so well knew how
to employ to cause fluctuations in prices at first as in all these
gambling mania confidence was at its height and every body gained the
tulipjobbers speculated in the rise and fall of the tulip stocks and
made large profits by buying when prices fell and selling out when they
rose many individuals grew suddenly rich a golden bait hung temptingly
out before the people and one after the other they rushed to the
tulipmarts like flies around a honeypot every one imagined that the
passion for tulips would last for ever and that the wealthy from every
part of the world would send to holland and pay whatever prices were
asked for them the riches of europe would be concentrated on the shores
of the zuyder zee and poverty banished from the favoured clime of
holland nobles citizens farmers mechanics seamen footmen
maidservants even chimneysweeps and old clotheswomen dabbled in
tulips people of all grades converted their property into cash and
invested it in flowers houses and lands were offered for sale at
ruinously low prices or assigned in payment of bargains made at the
tulipmart foreigners became smitten with the same frenzy and money
poured into holland from all directions the prices of the necessaries of
life rose again by degrees houses and lands horses and carriages and
luxuries of every sort rose in value with them and for some months
holland seemed the very antechamber of plutus the operations of the trade
became so extensive and so intricate that it was found necessary to draw
up a code of laws for the guidance of the dealers notaries and clerks
were also appointed who devoted themselves exclusively to the interests
of the trade the designation of public notary was hardly known in some
towns that of tulipnotary usurping its place in the smaller towns
where there was no exchange the principal tavern was usually selected as
the showplace where high and low traded in tulips and confirmed their
bargains over sumptuous entertainments these dinners were sometimes
attended by two or three hundred persons and large vases of tulips in
full bloom were placed at regular intervals upon the tables and
sideboards for their gratification during the repast
at last however the more prudent began to see that this folly could not
last for ever rich people no longer bought the flowers to keep them in
their gardens but to sell them again at cent per cent profit it was seen
that somebody must lose fearfully in the end as this conviction spread
prices fell and never rose again confidence was destroyed and a
universal panic seized upon the dealers a had agreed to purchase ten
semper augustines from b at four thousand florins each at six weeks
after the signing of the contract b was ready with the flowers at the
appointed time but the price had fallen to three or four hundred florins
and a refused either to pay the difference or receive the tulips
defaulters were announced day after day in all the towns of holland
hundreds who a few months previously had begun to doubt that there was
such a thing as poverty in the land suddenly found themselves the
possessors of a few bulbs which nobody would buy even though they
offered them at one quarter of the sums they had paid for them the cry of
distress resounded every where and each man accused his neighbour the
few who had contrived to enrich themselves hid their wealth from the
knowledge of their fellowcitizens and invested it in the english or
other funds many who for a brief season had emerged from the humbler
walks of life were cast back into their original obscurity substantial
merchants were reduced almost to beggary and many a representative of a
noble line saw the fortunes of his house ruined beyond redemption
when the first alarm subsided the tulipholders in the several towns held
public meetings to devise what measures were best to be taken to restore
public credit it was generally agreed that deputies should be sent from
all parts to amsterdam to consult with the government upon some remedy
for the evil the government at first refused to interfere but advised
the tulipholders to agree to some plan among themselves several meetings
were held for this purpose but no measure could be devised likely to give
satisfaction to the deluded people or repair even a slight portion of the
mischief that had been done the language of complaint and reproach was in
every bodys mouth and all the meetings were of the most stormy
character at last however after much bickering and illwill it was
agreed at amsterdam by the assembled deputies that all contracts made
in the height of the mania or prior to the month of november 1636 should
be declared null and void and that in those made after that date
purchasers should be freed from their engagements on paying ten per cent
to the vendor this decision gave no satisfaction the vendors who had
their tulips on hand were of course discontented and those who had
pledged themselves to purchase thought themselves hardly treated tulips
which had at one time been worth six thousand florins were now to be
procured for five hundred so that the composition of ten per cent was one
hundred florins more than the actual value actions for breach of contract
were threatened in all the courts of the country but the latter refused
to take cognisance of gambling transactions
the matter was finally referred to the provincial council at the hague
and it was confidently expected that the wisdom of this body would invent
some measure by which credit should be restored expectation was on the
stretch for its decision but it never came the members continued to
deliberate week after week and at last after thinking about it for three
months declared that they could offer no final decision until they had
more information they advised however that in the mean time every
vendor should in the presence of witnesses offer the tulips in natura
to the purchaser for the sums agreed upon if the latter refused to take
them they might be put up for sale by public auction and the original
contractor held responsible for the difference between the actual and the
stipulated price this was exactly the plan recommended by the deputies
and which was already shewn to be of no avail there was no court in
holland which would enforce payment the question was raised in amsterdam
but the judges unanimously refused to interfere on the ground that debts
contracted in gambling were no debts in law
thus the matter rested to find a remedy was beyond the power of the
government those who were unlucky enough to have had stores of tulips on
hand at the time of the sudden reaction were left to bear their ruin as
philosophically as they could those who had made profits were allowed to
keep them but the commerce of the country suffered a severe shock from
which it was many years ere it recovered
the example of the dutch was imitated to some extent in england in the
year 1636 tulips were publicly sold in the exchange of london and the
jobbers exerted themselves to the utmost to raise them to the fictitious
value they had acquired in amsterdam in paris also the jobbers strove to
create a tulipomania in both cities they only partially succeeded
however the force of example brought the flowers into great favour and
amongst a certain class of people tulips have ever since been prized more
highly than any other flowers of the field the dutch are still notorious
for their partiality to them and continue to pay higher prices for them
than any other people as the rich englishman boasts of his fine
racehorses or his old pictures so does the wealthy dutchman vaunt him of
his tulips
in england in our day strange as it may appear a tulip will produce
more money than an oak if one could be found rara in terris and black
as the black swan of juvenal its price would equal that of a dozen acres
of standing corn in scotland towards the close of the seventeenth
century the highest price for tulips according to the authority of a
writer in the supplement to the third edition of the encyclopedia
britannica was ten guineas their value appears to have diminished from
that time till the year 1769 when the two most valuable species in
england were the don quevedo and the valentinier the former of which
was worth two guineas and the latter two guineas and a half these prices
appear to have been the minimum in the year 1800 a common price was
fifteen guineas for a single bulb in 1835 a bulb of the species called
the miss fanny kemble was sold by public auction in london for
seventyfive pounds still more remarkable was the price of a tulip in the
possession of a gardener in the kings road chelseain his catalogues
it was labelled at two hundred guineas

dissatisfaction with his lot seems to be the characteristic of man in all
ages and climates so far however from being an evil as at first might
be supposed it has been the great civiliser of our race and has tended
more than any thing else to raise us above the condition of the brutes
but the same discontent which has been the source of all improvement has
been the parent of no small progeny of follies and absurdities to trace
these latter is our present object vast as the subject appears it is
easily reducible within such limits as will make it comprehensive without
being wearisome and render its study both instructive and amusing
three causes especially have excited the discontent of mankind and by
impelling us to seek for remedies for the irremediable have bewildered us
in a maze of madness and error these are death toil and ignorance of
the futurethe doom of man upon this sphere and for which he shews his
antipathy by his love of life his longing for abundance and his craving
curiosity to pierce the secrets of the days to come the first has led
many to imagine that they might find means to avoid death or failing in
this that they might nevertheless so prolong existence as to reckon it
by centuries instead of units from this sprang the search so long
continued and still pursued for the elixir vit or water of life
which has led thousands to pretend to it and millions to believe in it
from the second sprang the search for the philosophers stone which was
to create plenty by changing all metals into gold and from the third the
false sciences of astrology divination and their divisions of
necromancy chiromancy augury with all their train of signs portents
and omens
in tracing the career of the erring philosophers or the wilful cheats
who have encouraged or preyed upon the credulity of mankind it will
simplify and elucidate the subject if we divide it into three classes
the first comprising alchymists or those in general who have devoted
themselves to the discovering of the philosophers stone and the water of
life the second comprising astrologers necromancers sorcerers
geomancers and all those who pretended to discover futurity and the
third consisting of the dealers in charms amulets philters
universalpanacea mongers touchers for the evil seventh sons of a
seventh son sympathetic powder compounders homoeopathists animal
magnetisers and all the motley tribe of quacks empirics and charlatans
but in narrating the career of such men it will be found that many of
them united several or all of the functions just mentioned that the
alchymist was a fortuneteller or a necromancerthat he pretended to
cure all maladies by touch or charm and to work miracles of every kind
in the dark and early ages of european history this is more especially the
case even as we advance to more recent periods we shall find great
difficulty in separating the characters the alchymist seldom confined
himself strictly to his pretended sciencethe sorcerer and necromancer to
theirs or the medical charlatan to his beginning with alchymy some
confusion of these classes is unavoidable but the ground will clear for
us as we advance
let us not in the pride of our superior knowledge turn with contempt
from the follies of our predecessors the study of the errors into which
great minds have fallen in the pursuit of truth can never be
uninstructive as the man looks back to the days of his childhood and his
youth and recalls to his mind the strange notions and false opinions that
swayed his actions at that time that he may wonder at them so should
society for its edification look back to the opinions which governed the
ages fled he is but a superficial thinker who would despise and refuse to
hear of them merely because they are absurd no man is so wise but that he
may learn some wisdom from his past errors either of thought or action
and no society has made such advances as to be capable of no improvement
from the retrospect of its past folly and credulity and not only is such
a study instructive he who reads for amusement only will find no chapter
in the annals of the human mind more amusing than this it opens out the
whole realm of fictionthe wild the fantastic and the wonderful and
all the immense variety of things that are not and cannot be but that
have been imagined and believed
                                   
for more than a thousand years the art of alchymy captivated many noble
spirits and was believed in by millions its origin is involved in
obscurity some of its devotees have claimed for it an antiquity coeval
with the creation of man himself others again would trace it no further
back than the time of noah vincent de beauvais argues indeed that all
the antediluvians must have possessed a knowledge of alchymy and
particularly cites noah as having been acquainted with the elixir vit
or he could not have lived to so prodigious an age and have begotten
children when upwards of five hundred lenglet du fresnoy in his history
of the hermetic philosophy says most of them pretended that shem or
chem the son of noah was an adept in the art and thought it highly
probable that the words chemistry and alchymy are both derived from
his name others say the art was derived from the egyptians amongst
whom it was first founded by hermes trismegistus moses who is looked
upon as a firstrate alchymist gained his knowledge in egypt but he kept
it all to himself and would not instruct the children of israel in its
mysteries all the writers upon alchymy triumphantly cite the story of the
golden calf in the 32d chapter of exodus to prove that this great
lawgiver was an adept and could make or unmake gold at his pleasure it
is recorded that moses was so wrath with the israelites for their
idolatry that he took the calf which they had made and burned it in the
fire and ground it to powder and strewed it upon the water and made the
children of israel drink of it this say the alchymists he never could
have done had he not been in possession of the philosophers stone by no
other means could he have made the powder of gold float upon the water
but we must leave this knotty point for the consideration of the adepts in
the art if any such there be and come to more modern periods of its
history the jesuit father martini in his historia sinica says it
was practised by the chinese two thousand five hundred years before the
birth of christ but his assertion being unsupported is worth nothing
it would appear however that pretenders to the art of making gold and
silver existed in rome in the first centuries after the christian era and
that when discovered they were liable to punishment as knaves and
impostors at constantinople in the fourth century the transmutation of
metals was very generally believed in and many of the greek ecclesiastics
wrote treatises upon the subject their names are preserved and some
notice of their works given in the third volume of langlet du fresnoys
history of the hermetic philosophy their notion appears to have been
that all metals were composed of two substances the one metallic earth
and the other a red inflammable matter which they called sulphur the
pure union of these substances formed gold but other metals were mixed
with and contaminated by various foreign ingredients the object of the
philosophers stone was to dissolve or neutralise all these ingredients
by which iron lead copper and all metals would be transmuted into the
original gold many learned and clever men wasted their time their
health and their energies in this vain pursuit but for several
centuries it took no great hold upon the imagination of the people the
history of the delusion appears in a manner lost from this time till the
eighth century when it appeared amongst the arabians from this period it
becomes easier to trace its progress a master then appeared who was long
looked upon as the father of the science and whose name is indissolubly
connected with it
geber
of this philosopher who devoted his life to the study of alchymy but few
particulars are known he is thought to have lived in the year 730 his
true name was abou moussah djafar to which was added al sofi or the
wise and he was born at houran in mesopotamia28 some have thought
he was a greek others a spaniard and others a prince of hindostan but
of all the mistakes which have been made respecting him the most
ludicrous was that made by the french translator of sprengers history of
medicine who thought from the sound of his name that he was a german
and rendered it as the donnateur or giver no details of his life are
known but it is asserted that he wrote more than five hundred works upon
the philosophers stone and the water of life he was a great enthusiast
in his art and compared the incredulous to little children shut up in a
narrow room without windows or aperture who because they saw nothing
beyond denied the existence of the great globe itself he thought that a
preparation of gold would cure all maladies not only in man but in the
inferior animals and plants he also imagined that all the metals laboured
under disease with the exception of gold which was the only one in
perfect health he affirmed that the secret of the philosophers stone
had been more than once discovered but that the ancient and wise men who
had hit upon it would never by word or writing communicate it to men
because of their unworthiness and incredulity29 but the life of geber
though spent in the pursuit of this vain chimera was not altogether
useless he stumbled upon discoveries which he did not seek and science
is indebted to him for the first mention of corrosive sublimate the red
oxide of mercury nitric acid and the nitrate of silver30

         richard russell was published in london in 1686 the preface
         is dated eight years previously from the house of the
         alchymist at the star in newmarket in wapping near the
         dock his design in undertaking the translation was as he
         informs us to expose the false pretences of the many
         ignorant pretenders to the science who abounded in his day
    30 article geber biographie universelle
for more than two hundred years after the death of geber the arabian
philosophers devoted themselves to the study of alchymy joining with it
that of astrology of these the most celebrated was
alfarabi
alfarabi flourished at the commencement of the tenth century and enjoyed
the reputation of being one of the most learned men of his age he spent
his life in travelling from country to country that he might gather the
opinions of philosophers upon the great secrets of nature no danger
dismayed him no toil wearied him of the pursuit many sovereigns
endeavoured to retain him at their courts but he refused to rest until he
had discovered the great object of his lifethe art of preserving it for
centuries and of making gold as much as he needed this wandering mode of
life at last proved fatal to him he had been on a visit to mecca not so
much for religious as for philosophical purposes when returning through
syria he stopped at the court of the sultan seifeddoulet who was
renowned as the patron of learning he presented himself in his travelling
attire in the presence of that monarch and his courtiers and without
invitation coolly sat himself down on the sofa beside the prince the
courtiers and wise men were indignant and the sultan who did not know
the intruder was at first inclined to follow their example he turned to
one of his officers and ordered him to eject the presumptuous stranger
from the room but alfarabi without moving dared them to lay hands upon
him and turning himself calmly to the prince remarked that he did not
know who was his guest or he would treat him with honour not with
violence the sultan instead of being still further incensed as many
potentates would have been admired his coolness and requesting him to
sit still closer to him on the sofa entered into a long conversation with
him upon science and divine philosophy all the court were charmed with
the stranger questions for discussion were propounded on all of which he
shewed superior knowledge he convinced every one who ventured to dispute
with him and spoke so eloquently upon the science of alchymy that he was
at once recognised as only second to the great geber himself one of the
doctors present inquired whether a man who knew so many sciences was
acquainted with music alfarabi made no reply but merely requested that a
lute should be brought him the lute was brought and he played such
ravishing and tender melodies that all the court were melted into tears
he then changed his theme and played airs so sprightly that he set the
grave philosophers sultan and all dancing as fast as their legs could
carry them he then sobered them again by a mournful strain and made them
sob and sigh as if brokenhearted the sultan highly delighted with his
powers entreated him to stay offering him every inducement that wealth
power and dignity could supply but the alchymist resolutely refused it
being decreed he said that he should never repose till he had discovered
the philosophers stone he set out accordingly the same evening and was
murdered by some thieves in the deserts of syria his biographers give no
further particulars of his life beyond mentioning that he wrote several
valuable treatises on his art all of which however have been lost his
death happened in the year 954
avicenna
avicenna whose real name was ebn cinna another great alchymist was born
at bokhara in 980 his reputation as a physician and a man skilled in all
sciences was so great that the sultan magdal douleth resolved to try his
powers in the great science of government he was accordingly made grand
vizier of that prince and ruled the state with some advantage but in a
science still more difficult he failed completely he could not rule his
own passions but gave himself up to wine and women and led a life of
shameless debauchery amid the multifarious pursuits of business and
pleasure he nevertheless found time to write seven treatises upon the
philosophers stone which were for many ages looked upon as of great
value by pretenders to the art it is rare that an eminent physician as
avicenna appears to have been abandons himself to sensual gratification
but so completely did he become enthralled in the course of a few years
that he was dismissed from his high office and died shortly afterwards of
premature old age and a complication of maladies brought on by
debauchery his death took place in the year 1036 after his time few
philosophers of any note in arabia are heard of as devoting themselves to
the study of alchymy but it began shortly afterwards to attract greater
attention in europe learned men in france england spain and italy
expressed their belief in the science and many devoted their whole
energies to it in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries especially it was
extensively pursued and some of the brightest names of that age are
connected with it among the most eminent of them are
albertus magnus and thomas aquinas
the first of these philosophers was born in the year 1193 of a noble
family at lawingen in the duchy of neuburg on the danube for the first
thirty years of his life he appeared remarkably dull and stupid and it
was feared by every one that no good could come of him he entered a
dominican monastery at an early age but made so little progress in his
studies that he was more than once upon the point of abandoning them in
despair but he was endowed with extraordinary perseverance as he
advanced to middle age his mind expanded and he learned whatever he
applied himself to with extreme facility so remarkable a change was not
in that age to be accounted for but by a miracle it was asserted and
believed that the holy virgin touched with his great desire to become
learned and famous took pity upon his incapacity and appeared to him in
the cloister where he sat almost despairing and asked him whether he
wished to excel in philosophy or divinity he chose philosophy to the
chagrin of the virgin who reproached him in mild and sorrowful accents
that he had not made a better choice she however granted his request
that he should become the most excellent philosopher of the age but set
this drawback to his pleasure that he should relapse when at the height
of his fame into his former incapacity and stupidity albertus never took
the trouble to contradict the story but prosecuted his studies with such
unremitting zeal that his reputation speedily spread over all europe in
the year 1244 the celebrated thomas aquinas placed himself under his
tuition many extraordinary stories are told of the master and his pupil
while they paid all due attention to other branches of science they never
neglected the pursuit of the philosophers stone and the elixir vit
although they discovered neither it was believed that albert had seized
some portion of the secret of life and found means to animate a brazen
statue upon the formation of which under proper conjunctions of the
planets he had been occupied many years of his life he and thomas
aquinas completed it together endowed it with the faculty of speech and
made it perform the functions of a domestic servant in this capacity it
was exceedingly useful but through some defect in the machinery it
chattered much more than was agreeable to either philosopher various
remedies were tried to cure it of its garrulity but in vain and one day
thomas aquinas was so enraged at the noise it made when he was in the
midst of a mathematical problem that he seized a ponderous hammer and
smashed it to pieces31 he was sorry afterwards for what he had done
and was reproved by his master for giving way to his anger so unbecoming
in a philosopher they made no attempt to reanimate the statue

illustration albertus magnus
such stories as these shew the spirit of the age every great man who
attempted to study the secrets of nature was thought a magician and it is
not to be wondered at that when philosophers themselves pretended to
discover an elixir for conferring immortality or a red stone which was to
create boundless wealth that popular opinion should have enhanced upon
their pretensions and have endowed them with powers still more
miraculous it was believed of albertus magnus that he could even change
the course of the seasons a feat which the many thought less difficult
than the discovery of the grand elixir albertus was desirous of obtaining
a piece of ground on which to build a monastery in the neighbourhood of
cologne the ground belonged to william count of holland and king of the
romans who for some reason or other did not wish to part with it
albertus is reported to have gained it by the following extraordinary
method he invited the prince as he was passing through cologne to a
magnificent entertainment prepared for him and all his court the prince
accepted it and repaired with a lordly retinue to the residence of the
sage it was in the midst of winter the rhine was frozen over and the
cold was so bitter that the knights could not sit on horseback without
running the risk of losing their toes by the frost great therefore was
their surprise on arriving at alberts house to find that the repast was
spread in his garden in which the snow had drifted to the depth of
several feet the earl in high dudgeon remounted his steed but albert at
last prevailed upon him to take his seat at the table he had no sooner
done so than the dark clouds rolled away from the skya warm sun shone
forththe cold north wind veered suddenly round and blew a mild breeze
from the souththe snows melted awaythe ice was unbound upon the
streams and the trees put forth their green leaves and their
fruitflowers sprang up beneath their feet while larks nightingales
blackbirds cuckoos thrushes and every sweet songbird sang hymns from
every tree the earl and his attendants wondered greatly but they ate
their dinner and in recompense for it albert got his piece of ground to
build a convent on he had not however shewn them all his power
immediately that the repast was over he gave the word and dark clouds
obscured the sunthe snow fell in large flakesthe singingbirds fell
deadthe leaves dropped from the trees and the winds blew so cold and
howled so mournfully that the guests wrapped themselves up in their thick
cloaks and retreated into the house to warm themselves at the blazing
fire in alberts kitchen32

thomas aquinas also could work wonders as well as his master it is
related of him that he lodged in a street at cologne where he was much
annoyed by the incessant clatter made by the horses hoofs as they were
led through it daily to exercise by their grooms he had entreated the
latter to select some other spot where they might not disturb a
philosopher but the grooms turned a deaf ear to all his solicitations in
this emergency he had recourse to the aid of magic he constructed a small
horse of bronze upon which he inscribed certain cabalistic characters
and buried it at midnight in the midst of the highway the next morning a
troop of grooms came riding along as usual but the horses as they
arrived at the spot where the magic horse was buried reared and plunged
violentlytheir nostrils distended with terrortheir manes grew erect
and the perspiration ran down their sides in streams in vain the riders
applied the spurin vain they coaxed or threatened the animals would not
pass the spot on the following day their success was no better they were
at length compelled to seek another spot for their exercise and thomas
aquinas was left in peace33

albertus magnus was made bishop of ratisbon in 1259 but he occupied the
see only four years when he resigned on the ground that its duties
occupied too much of the time which he was anxious to devote to
philosophy he died in cologne in 1280 at the advanced age of
eightyseven the dominican writers deny that he ever sought the
philosophers stone but his treatise upon minerals sufficiently proves
that he did
artephius
artephius a name noted in the annals of alchymy was born in the early
part of the twelfth century he wrote two famous treatises the one upon
the philosophers stone and the other on the art of prolonging human
life in the latter he vaunts his great qualifications for instructing
mankind on such a matter as he was at that time in the thousand and
twentyfifth year of his age he had many disciples who believed in his
extreme age and who attempted to prove that he was apollonius of tyana
who lived soon after the advent of jesus christ and the particulars of
whose life and pretended miracles have been so fully described by
philostratus he took good care never to contradict a story which so much
increased the power he was desirous of wielding over his fellowmortals
on all convenient occasions he boasted of it and having an excellent
memory a fertile imagination and a thorough knowledge of all existing
history he was never at a loss for an answer when questioned as to the
personal appearance the manners or the character of the great men of
antiquity he also pretended to have found the philosophers stone and
said that in search of it he had descended to hell and seen the devil
sitting on a throne of gold with a legion of imps and fiends around him
his works on alchymy have been translated into french and were published
in paris in 1609 or 1610
alain de lisle
contemporary with albertus magnus was alain de lisle of flanders who was
named from his great learning the universal doctor he was thought to
possess a knowledge of all the sciences and like artephius to have
discovered the elixir vit he became one of the friars of the abbey of
citeaux and died in 1298 aged about one hundred and ten years it was
said of him that he was at the point of death when in his fiftieth year
but that the fortunate discovery of the elixir enabled him to add sixty
years to his existence he wrote a commentary on the prophecies of merlin
arnold de villeneuve
this philosopher has left a much greater reputation he was born in the
year 1245 and studied medicine with great success in the university of
paris he afterwards travelled for twenty years in italy and germany
where he made acquaintance with pietro dapone a man of a character akin
to his own and addicted to the same pursuits as a physician he was
thought in his own lifetime to be the most able the world had ever seen
like all the learned men of that day he dabbled in astrology and alchymy
and was thought to have made immense quantities of gold from lead and
copper when pietro dapone was arrested in italy and brought to trial as
a sorcerer a similar accusation was made against arnold but he managed
to leave the country in time and escape the fate of his unfortunate
friend he lost some credit by predicting the end of the world but
afterwards regained it the time of his death is not exactly known but it
must have been prior to the year 1311 when pope clement v wrote a
circular letter to all the clergy of europe who lived under his obedience
praying them to use their utmost efforts to discover the famous treatise
of arnold on the practice of medicine the author had promised during
his lifetime to make a present of the work to the holy see but died
without fulfilling it
illustration arnold de villeneuve
in a very curious work by monsieur longeville harcouet entitled the
history of the persons who have lived several centuries and then grown
young again there is a receipt said to have been given by arnold de
villeneuve by means of which any one might prolong his life for a few
hundred years or so in the first place say arnold and monsieur harcouet
the person intending so to prolong his life must rub himself well two or
three times a week with the juice or marrow of cassia molle de la
casse every night upon going to bed he must put upon his heart a
plaster composed of a certain quantity of oriental saffron red
roseleaves sandalwood aloes and amber liquified in oil of roses and
the best white wax in the morning he must take it off and enclose it
carefully in a leaden box till the next night when it must be again
applied if he be of a sanguine temperament he shall take sixteen
chickens if phlegmatic twentyfive and if melancholy thirty which he
shall put into a yard where the air and the water are pure upon these he
is to feed eating one a day but previously the chickens are to be
fattened by a peculiar method which will impregnate their flesh with the
qualities that are to produce longevity in the eater being deprived of
all other nourishment till they are almost dying of hunger they are to be
fed upon broth made of serpents and vinegar which broth is to be
thickened with wheat and bran various ceremonies are to be performed in
the cooking of this mess which those may see in the book of m harcouet
who are at all interested in the matter and the chickens are to be fed
upon it for two months they are then fit for table and are to be washed
down with moderate quantities of good white wine or claret this regimen
is to be followed regularly every seven years and any one may live to be
as old as methuselah it is right to state that m harcouet has but little
authority for attributing this precious composition to arnold of
villeneuve it is not found in the collected works of that philosopher
but was first brought to light by a m poirier at the commencement of the
sixteenth century who asserted that he had discovered it in ms in the
undoubted writing of arnold
pietro dapone
this unlucky sage was born at apone near padua in the year 1250 like
his friend arnold de villeneuve he was an eminent physician and a
pretender to the arts of astrology and alchymy he practised for many
years in paris and made great wealth by killing and curing and telling
fortunes in an evil day for him he returned to his own country with the
reputation of being a magician of the first order it was universally
believed that he had drawn seven evil spirits from the infernal regions
whom he kept enclosed in seven crystal vases until he required their
services when he sent them forth to the ends of the earth to execute his
pleasure one spirit excelled in philosophy a second in alchymy a
third in astrology a fourth in physic a fifth in poetry a sixth in
music and the seventh in painting and whenever pietro wished for
information or instruction in any of these arts he had only to go to his
crystal vase and liberate the presiding spirit immediately all the
secrets of the art were revealed to him and he might if it pleased him
excel homer in poetry apelles in painting or pythagoras himself in
philosophy although he could make gold out of brass it was said of him
that he was very sparing of his powers in that respect and kept himself
constantly supplied with money by other and less creditable means
whenever he disbursed gold he muttered a certain charm known only to
himself and next morning the gold was safe again in his own possession
the trader to whom he gave it might lock it in his strong box and have it
guarded by a troop of soldiers but the charmed metal flew back to its old
master even if it were buried in the earth or thrown into the sea the
dawn of the next morning would behold it in the pockets of pietro few
people in consequence liked to have dealings with such a personage
especially for gold some bolder than the rest thought that his power
did not extend over silver but when they made the experiment they found
themselves mistaken bolts and bars could not restrain it and it
sometimes became invisible in their very hands and was whisked through
the air to the purse of the magician he necessarily acquired a very bad
character and having given utterance to some sentiments regarding
religion which were the very reverse of orthodox he was summoned before
the tribunals of the inquisition to answer for his crimes as a heretic and
a sorcerer he loudly protested his innocence even upon the rack where
he suffered more torture than nature could support he died in prison ere
his trial was concluded but was afterwards found guilty his bones were
ordered to be dug up and publicly burned he was also burned in effigy in
the streets of padua
raymond lulli
illustration raymond lulli
while arnold de villeneuve and pietro dapone flourished in france and
italy a more celebrated adept than either appeared in spain this was
raymond lulli a name which stands in the first rank among the alchymists
unlike many of his predecessors he made no pretensions to astrology or
necromancy but taking geber for his model studied intently the nature
and composition of metals without reference to charms incantations or
any foolish ceremonies it was not however till late in life that he
commenced his study of the art his early and middle age were spent in a
different manner and his whole history is romantic in the extreme he was
born of an illustrious family in majorca in the year 1235 when that
island was taken from the saracens by james i king of aragon in 1230
the father of raymond who was originally of catalonia settled there and
received a considerable appointment from the crown raymond married at an
early age and being fond of pleasure he left the solitudes of his
native isle and passed over with his bride into spain he was made grand
seneschal at the court of king james and led a gay life for several
years faithless to his wife he was always in the pursuit of some new
beauty till his heart was fixed at last by the lovely but unkind ambrosia
de castello this lady like her admirer was married but unlike him
was faithful to her vows and treated all his solicitations with disdain
raymond was so enamoured that repulse only increased his flame he
lingered all night under her windows wrote passionate verses in her
praise neglected his affairs and made himself the butt of all the
courtiers one day while watching under her lattice he by chance caught
sight of her bosom as her neckerchief was blown aside by the wind the
fit of inspiration came over him and he sat down and composed some tender
stanzas upon the subject and sent them to the lady the fair ambrosia had
never before condescended to answer his letters but she replied to this
she told him that she could never listen to his suit that it was
unbecoming in a wise man to fix his thoughts as he had done on any other
than his god and entreated him to devote himself to a religious life and
conquer the unworthy passion which he had suffered to consume him she
however offered if he wished it to shew him the fair bosom which had
so captivated him raymond was delighted he thought the latter part of
this epistle but ill corresponded with the former and that ambrosia in
spite of the good advice she gave him had at last relented and would
make him as happy as he desired he followed her about from place to
place entreating her to fulfil her promise but still ambrosia was cold
and implored him with tears to importune her no longer for that she never
could be his and never would if she were free tomorrow what means
your letter then said the despairing lover i will shew you replied
ambrosia who immediately uncovered her bosom and exposed to the eyes of
her horrorstricken admirer a large cancer which had extended to both
breasts she saw that he was shocked and extending her hand to him she
prayed him once more to lead a religious life and set his heart upon the
creator and not upon the creature he went home an altered man he threw
up on the morrow his valuable appointment at the court separated from
his wife and took a farewell of his children after dividing onehalf of
his ample fortune among them the other half he shared among the poor he
then threw himself at the foot of a crucifix and devoted himself to the
service of god vowing as the most acceptable atonement for his errors
that he would employ the remainder of his days in the task of converting
the mussulmans to the christian religion in his dreams he saw jesus
christ who said to him raymond raymond follow me the vision was
three times repeated and raymond was convinced that it was an intimation
direct from heaven having put his affairs in order he set out on a
pilgrimage to the shrine of st james of compostello and afterwards lived
for ten years in solitude amid the mountains of aranda here he learned
the arabic to qualify himself for his mission of converting the
mahometans he also studied various sciences as taught in the works of
the learned men of the east and first made acquaintance with the writings
of geber which were destined to exercise so much influence over his
future life
at the end of this probation and when he had entered his fortieth year
he emerged from his solitude into more active life with some remains of
his fortune which had accumulated during his retirement he founded a
college for the study of arabic which was approved of by the pope with
many commendations upon his zeal and piety at this time he narrowly
escaped assassination from an arabian youth whom he had taken into his
service raymond had prayed to god in some of his accesses of fanaticism
that he might suffer martyrdom in his holy cause his servant had
overheard him and being as great a fanatic as his master he resolved to
gratify his wish and punish him at the same time for the curses which
he incessantly launched against mahomet and all who believed in him by
stabbing him to the heart he therefore aimed a blow at his master as he
sat one day at table but the instinct of selfpreservation being stronger
than the desire of martyrdom raymond grappled with his antagonist and
overthrew him he scorned to take his life himself but handed him over to
the authorities of the town by whom he was afterwards found dead in his
prison
after this adventure raymond travelled to paris where he resided for some
time and made the acquaintance of arnold de villeneuve from him he
probably received some encouragement to search for the philosophers
stone as he began from that time forth to devote less of his attention to
religious matters and more to the study of alchymy still he never lost
sight of the great object for which he livedthe conversion of the
mahometansand proceeded to rome to communicate personally with pope
john xxi on the best measures to be adopted for that end the pope gave
him encouragement in words but failed to associate any other persons with
him in the enterprise which he meditated raymond therefore set out for
tunis alone and was kindly received by many arabian philosophers who had
heard of his fame as a professor of alchymy if he had stuck to alchymy
while in their country it would have been well for him but he began
cursing mahomet and got himself into trouble while preaching the
doctrines of christianity in the great bazaar of tunis he was arrested
and thrown into prison he was shortly afterwards brought to trial and
sentenced to death some of his philosophic friends interceded hard for
him and he was pardoned upon condition that he left africa immediately
and never again set foot in it if he was found there again no matter
what his object might be or whatever length of time might intervene his
original sentence would be carried into execution raymond was not at all
solicitous of martyrdom when it came to the point whatever he might have
been when there was no danger and he gladly accepted his life upon these
conditions and left tunis with the intention of proceeding to rome he
afterwards changed his plan and established himself at milan where for
a length of time he practised alchymy and some say astrology with great
success
most writers who believed in the secrets of alchymy and who have noticed
the life of raymond lulli assert that while in milan he received
letters from edward king of england inviting him to settle in his states
they add that lulli gladly accepted the invitation and had apartments
assigned for his use in the tower of london where he refined much gold
superintended the coinage of rosenobles and made gold out of iron
quicksilver lead and pewter to the amount of six millions the writers
in the biographie universelle an excellent authority in general deny
that raymond was ever in england and say that in all these stories of
his wondrous powers as an alchymist he has been mistaken for another
raymond a jew of tarragona naud in his apologie says simply that
six millions were given by raymond lulli to king edward to make war
against the turks and other infidels not that he transmuted so much
metal into gold but as he afterwards adds that he advised edward to lay
a tax upon wool which produced that amount to shew that raymond went to
england his admirers quote a work attributed to him de transmutatione
anim metallorum in which he expressly says that he was in england at
the intercession of the king34 the hermetic writers are not agreed
whether it was edward i or edward ii who invited him over but by
fixing the date of his journey in 1312 they make it appear that it was
edward ii edmond dickenson in his work on the quintessences of the
philosophers says that raymond worked in westminster abbey where a
long time after his departure there was found in the cell which he had
occupied a great quantity of golden dust of which the architects made a
great profit in the biographical sketch of john cremer abbot of
westminster given by lenglet it is said that it was chiefly through his
instrumentality that raymond came to england cremer had been himself for
thirty years occupied in the vain search for the philosophers stone when
he accidentally met raymond in italy and endeavoured to induce him to
communicate his grand secret raymond told him that he must find it for
himself as all great alchymists had done before him cremer on his
return to england spoke to king edward in high terms of the wonderful
attainments of the philosopher and a letter of invitation was forthwith
sent him robert constantinus in the nomenclator scriptorum medicorum
published in 1515 says that after a great deal of research he found
that raymond lulli resided for some time in london and that he actually
made gold by means of the philosophers stone in the tower that he had
seen the golden pieces of his coinage which were still named in england
the nobles of raymond or rosenobles lulli himself appears to have
boasted that he made gold for in his wellknown testamentum he states
that he converted no less than fifty thousand pounds weight of
quicksilver lead and pewter into that metal35 it seems highly
probable that the english king believing in the extraordinary powers of
the alchymist invited him to england to make test of them and that he
was employed in refining gold and in coining camden who is not credulous
in matters like these affords his countenance to the story of his coinage
of nobles and there is nothing at all wonderful in the fact of a man
famous for his knowledge of metals being employed in such a capacity
raymond was at this time an old man in his seventyseventh year and
somewhat in his dotage he was willing enough to have it believed that he
had discovered the grand secret and supported the rumour rather than
contradicted it he did not long remain in england but returned to rome
to carry out the projects which were nearer to his heart than the
profession of alchymy he had proposed them to several successive popes
with little or no success the first was a plan for the introduction of
the oriental languages into all the monasteries of europe the second for
the reduction into one of all the military orders that being united
they might move more efficaciously against the saracens and the third
that the sovereign pontiff should forbid the works of averroes to be read
in the schools as being more favourable to mahometanism than to
christianity the pope did not receive the old man with much cordiality
and after remaining for about two years in rome he proceeded once more
to africa alone and unprotected to preach the gospel of jesus he landed
at bona in 1314 and so irritated the mahometans by cursing their prophet
that they stoned him and left him for dead on the seashore he was found
some hours afterwards by a party of genoese merchants who conveyed him on
board their vessel and sailed towards majorca the unfortunate man still
breathed but could not articulate he lingered in this state for some
days and expired just as the vessel arrived within sight of his native
shores his body was conveyed with great pomp to the church of st
eulalia at palma where a public funeral was instituted in his honour
miracles were afterwards said to have been worked at his tomb
    34 vidimus omnia ista dum ad angliam transiimus propter
         intercessionem domini regis edoardi illustrissimi
    35 converti una vice in aurum ad l millia pondo argenti vivi
         plumbi et stannilullii testamentum
thus ended the career of raymond lulli one of the most extraordinary men
of his age and with the exception of his last boast about the six
millions of gold the least inclined to quackery of any of the professors
of alchymy his writings were very numerous and include nearly five
hundred volumes upon grammar rhetoric morals theology politics civil
and canon law physics metaphysics astronomy medicine and chemistry
roger bacon
the powerful delusion of alchymy seized upon a mind still greater than
that of raymond lulli roger bacon firmly believed in the philosophers
stone and spent much of his time in search of it his example helped to
render all the learned men of the time more convinced of its
practicability and more eager in the pursuit he was born at ilchester
in the county of somerset in the year 1214 he studied for some time in
the university of oxford and afterwards in that of paris in which he
received the degree of doctor of divinity returning to england in 1240
he became a monk of the order of st francis he was by far the most
learned man of his age and his acquirements were so much above the
comprehension of his contemporaries that they could only account for them
by supposing that he was indebted for them to the devil voltaire has not
inaptly designated him de lor encrout de toutes les ordures de son
sicle but the crust of superstition that enveloped his powerful mind
though it may have dimmed could not obscure the brightness of his genius
to him and apparently to him only among all the inquiring spirits of the
time were known the properties of the concave and convex lens he also
invented the magic lantern that pretty plaything of modern days which
acquired for him a reputation that embittered his life in a history of
alchymy the name of this great man cannot be omitted although unlike
many others of whom we shall have occasion to speak he only made it
secondary to other pursuits the love of universal knowledge that filled
his mind would not allow him to neglect one branch of science of which
neither he nor the world could yet see the absurdity he made ample amends
for his time lost in this pursuit by his knowledge in physics and his
acquaintance with astronomy the telescope burningglasses and
gunpowder are discoveries which may well carry his fame to the remotest
time and make the world blind to the one spot of follythe diagnosis of
the age in which he lived and the circumstances by which he was
surrounded his treatise on the admirable power of art and nature in the
production of the philosophers stone was translated into french by
girard de tormes and published at lyons in 1557 his mirror of alchymy
was also published in french in the same year and in paris in 1612 with
some additions from the works of raymond lulli a complete list of all the
published treatises upon the subject may be seen in lenglet du fresnoy
pope john xxii
this prelate is said to have been the friend and pupil of arnold de
villeneuve by whom he was instructed in all the secrets of alchymy
tradition asserts of him that he made great quantities of gold and died
as rich as croesus he was born at cahors in the province of guienne in
the year 1244 he was a very eloquent preacher and soon reached high
dignity in the church he wrote a work on the transmutation of metals and
had a famous laboratory at avignon he issued two bulls against the
numerous pretenders to the art who had sprung up in every part of
christendom from which it might be inferred that he was himself free from
the delusion the alchymists claim him however as one of the most
distinguished and successful professors of their art and say that his
bulls were not directed against the real adepts but the false pretenders
they lay particular stress upon these words in his bull spondent quas
non exhibent divitias pauperes alchymist these it is clear they
say relate only to poor alchymists and therefore false ones he died
in the year 1344 leaving in his coffers a sum of eighteen millions of
florins popular belief alleged that he had made and not amassed this
treasure and alchymists complacently cite this as a proof that the
philosophers stone was not such a chimera as the incredulous pretended
they take it for granted that john really left this money and ask by what
possible means he could have accumulated it replying to their own
question they say triumphantly his book shews it was by alchymy the
secrets of which he learned from arnold de villeneuve and raymond lulli
but he was as prudent as all other hermetic philosophers whoever would
read his book to find out his secret would employ all his labour in vain
the pope took good care not to divulge it unluckily for their own
credit all these goldmakers are in the same predicament their great
secret loses its worth most wonderfully in the telling and therefore they
keep it snugly to themselves perhaps they thought that if everybody
could transmute metals gold would be so plentiful that it would be no
longer valuable and that some new art would be requisite to transmute it
back again into steel and iron if so society is much indebted to them
for their forbearance
jean de meung
all classes of men dabbled in the art at this time the last mentioned was
a pope the one of whom we now speak was a poet jean de meung the
celebrated author of the roman de la rose was born in the year 1279 or
1280 and was a great personage at the courts of louis x philip the
long charles iv and philip de valois his famous poem of the roman de
la rose which treats of every subject in vogue at that day necessarily
makes great mention of alchymy jean was a firm believer in the art and
wrote besides his roman two shorter poems the one entitled the
remonstrance of nature to the wandering alchymist and the reply of the
alchymist to nature poetry and alchymy were his delight and priests and
women were his abomination a pleasant story is related of him and the
ladies of the court of charles iv he had written the following libellous
couplet upon the fair sex
   toutes tes serez ou ftes
    de fait ou de volont putains
    et qui trs bien vous chercherait
    toutes putains vous trouverait36
    36 these verses are but a coarser expression of the slanderous
         line of pope that every woman is at heart a rake
this naturally gave great offence and being perceived one day in the
kings antechamber by some ladies who were waiting for an audience they
resolved to punish him to the number of ten or twelve they armed
themselves with canes and rods and surrounding the unlucky poet called
upon the gentlemen present to strip him naked that they might wreak just
vengeance upon him and lash him through the streets of the town some of
the lords present were in no wise loath and promised themselves great
sport from his punishment but jean de meung was unmoved by their threats
and stood up calmly in the midst of them begging them to hear him first
and then if not satisfied they might do as they liked with him silence
being restored he stood upon a chair and entered on his defence he
acknowledged that he was the author of the obnoxious verses but denied
that they bore reference to all womankind he only meant to speak of the
vicious and abandoned whereas those whom he saw around him were patterns
of virtue loveliness and modesty if however any lady present thought
herself aggrieved he would consent to be stripped and she might lash him
till her arms were wearied it is added that by this means jean escaped
his flogging and that the wrath of the fair ones immediately subsided
the gentlemen present were however of opinion that if every lady in the
room whose character corresponded with the verses had taken him at his
word the poet would in all probability have been beaten to death all his
life long he evinced a great animosity towards the priesthood and his
famous poem abounds with passages reflecting upon their avarice cruelty
and immorality at his death he left a large box filled with some weighty
material which he bequeathed to the cordeliers as a peaceoffering for
the abuse he had lavished upon them as his practice of alchymy was well
known it was thought the box was filled with gold and silver and the
cordeliers congratulated each other on their rich acquisition when it
came to be opened they found to their horror that it was filled only with
slates scratched with hieroglyphic and cabalistic characters indignant
at the insult they determined to refuse him christian burial on pretence
that he was a sorcerer he was however honourably buried in paris the
whole court attending his funeral
nicholas flamel
the story of this alchymist as handed down by tradition and enshrined in
the pages of lenglet da fresnoy is not a little marvellous he was born
at pontoise of a poor but respectable family at the end of the
thirteenth or beginning of the fourteenth century having no patrimony
he set out for paris at an early age to try his fortune as a public
scribe he had received a good education was well skilled in the learned
languages and was an excellent penman he soon procured occupation as a
letterwriter and copyist and used to sit at the corner of the rue de
marivaux and practise his calling but he hardly made profit enough to
keep body and soul together to mend his fortunes he tried poetry but
this was a more wretched occupation still as a transcriber he had at
least gained bread and cheese but his rhymes were not worth a crust he
then tried painting with as little success and as a last resource began
to search for the philosophers stone and tell fortunes this was a
happier idea he soon increased in substance and had wherewithal to live
comfortably he therefore took unto himself his wife petronella and began
to save money but continued to all outward appearance as poor and
miserable as before in the course of a few years he became desperately
addicted to the study of alchymy and thought of nothing but the
philosophers stone the elixir of life and the universal alkahest in
the year 1257 he bought by chance an old book for two florins which soon
became his sole study it was written with a steel instrument upon the
bark of trees and contained twentyone or as he himself always expressed
it three times seven leaves the writing was very elegant and in the
latin language each seventh leaf contained a picture and no writing on
the first of these was a serpent swallowing rods on the second a cross
with a serpent crucified and on the third the representation of a
desert in the midst of which was a fountain with serpents crawling from
side to side it purported to be written by no less a personage than
abraham patriarch jew prince philosopher priest levite and
astrologer and invoked curses upon any one who should cast eyes upon it
without being a sacrificer or a scribe nicholas flamel never thought it
extraordinary that abraham should have known latin and was convinced that
the characters on his book had been traced by the hands of that great
patriarch himself he was at first afraid to read it after he became
aware of the curse it contained but he got over that difficulty by
recollecting that although he was not a sacrificer he had practised as a
scribe as he read he was filled with admiration and found that it was a
perfect treatise upon the transmutation of metals all the processes were
clearly explained the vessels the retorts the mixtures and the proper
times and seasons for experiment but as illluck would have it the
possession of the philosophers stone or prime agent in the work was
presupposed this was a difficulty which was not to be got over it was
like telling a starving man how to cook a beefsteak instead of giving
him the money to buy one but nicholas did not despair and set about
studying the hieroglyphics and allegorical representations with which the
book abounded he soon convinced himself that it had been one of the
sacred books of the jews and that it was taken from the temple of
jerusalem on its destruction by titus the process of reasoning by which
he arrived at this conclusion is not stated
from some expression in the treatise he learned that the allegorical
drawings on the fourth and fifth leaves enshrined the secret of the
philosophers stone without which all the fine latin of the directions
was utterly unavailing he invited all the alchymists and learned men of
paris to come and examine them but they all departed as wise as they
came nobody could make any thing either of nicholas or his pictures and
some even went so far as to say that his invaluable book was not worth a
farthing this was not to be borne and nicholas resolved to discover the
great secret by himself without troubling the philosophers he found on
the first page of the fourth leaf the picture of mercury attacked by an
old man resembling saturn or time the latter had an hourglass on his
head and in his hand a scythe with which he aimed a blow at mercurys
feet the reverse of the leaf represented a flower growing on a mountain
top shaken rudely by the wind with a blue stalk red and white blossoms
and leaves of pure gold around it were a great number of dragons and
griffins on the first page of the fifth leaf was a fine garden in the
midst of which was a rosetree in full bloom supported against the trunk
of a gigantic oak at the foot of this there bubbled up a fountain of
milkwhite water which forming a small stream flowed through the
garden and was afterwards lost in the sands on the second page was a
king with a sword in his hand superintending a number of soldiers who
in execution of his orders were killing a great multitude of young
children spurning the prayers and tears of their mothers who tried to
save them from destruction the blood of the children was carefully
collected by another party of soldiers and put into a large vessel in
which two allegorical figures of the sun and moon were bathing themselves
for twentyone years poor nicholas wearied himself with the study of these
pictures but still he could make nothing of them his wife petronella at
last persuaded him to find out some learned rabbi but there was no rabbi
in paris learned enough to be of any service to him the jews met but
small encouragement to fix their abode in france and all the chiefs of
that people were located in spain to spain accordingly nicholas flamel
repaired he left his book in paris for fear perhaps that he might be
robbed of it on the road and telling his neighbours that he was going on
a pilgrimage to the shrine of st james of compostello he trudged on foot
towards madrid in search of a rabbi he was absent two years in that
country and made himself known to a great number of jews descendants of
those who had been expelled from france in the reign of philip augustus
the believers in the philosophers stone give the following account of his
adventures they say that at leon he made the acquaintance of a converted
jew named cauches a very learned physician to whom he explained the
title and nature of his little book the doctor was transported with joy
as soon as he heard it named and immediately resolved to accompany
nicholas to paris that he might have a sight of it the two set out
together the doctor on the way entertaining his companion with the
history of his book which if the genuine book he thought it to be from
the description he had heard of it was in the handwriting of abraham
himself and had been in the possession of personages no less
distinguished than moses joshua solomon and esdras it contained all
the secrets of alchymy and of many other sciences and was the most
valuable book that had ever existed in this world the doctor was himself
no mean adept and nicholas profited greatly by his discourse as in the
garb of poor pilgrims they wended their way to paris convinced of their
power to turn every old shovel in that capital into pure gold but
unfortunately when they reached orleans the doctor was taken dangerously
ill nicholas watched by his bedside and acted the double part of a
physician and nurse to him but he died after a few days lamenting with
his last breath that he had not lived long enough to see the precious
volume nicholas rendered the last honours to his body and with a
sorrowful heart and not one sou in his pocket proceeded home to his
wife petronella he immediately recommenced the study of his pictures but
for two whole years he was as far from understanding them as ever at
last in the third year a glimmer of light stole over his understanding
he recalled some expression of his friend the doctor which had hitherto
escaped his memory and he found that all his previous experiments had
been conducted on a wrong basis he recommenced them now with renewed
energy and at the end of the year had the satisfaction to see all his
toils rewarded on the 13th january 1382 says lenglet he made a
projection on mercury and had some very excellent silver on the 25th
april following he converted a large quantity of mercury into gold and
the great secret was his
nicholas was now about eighty years of age and still a hale and stout old
man his friends say that by a simultaneous discovery of the elixir of
life he found means to keep death at a distance for another quarter of a
century and that he died in 1415 at the age of 116 in this interval he
made immense quantities of gold though to all outward appearance he was
as poor as a mouse at an early period of his changed fortune he had
like a worthy man taken counsel with his old wife petronella as to the
best use he could make of his wealth petronella replied that as
unfortunately they had no children the best thing he could do was to
build hospitals and endow churches nicholas thought so too especially
when he began to find that his elixir could not keep off death and that
the grim foe was making rapid advances upon him he richly endowed the
church of st jacques de la boucherie near the rue de marivaux where he
had all his life resided besides seven others in different parts of the
kingdom he also endowed fourteen hospitals and built three chapels
the fame of his great wealth and his munificent benefactions soon spread
over all the country and he was visited among others by the celebrated
doctors of that day jean gerson jean de courtecuisse and pierre
dailli they found him in his humble apartment meanly clad and eating
porridge out of an earthen vessel and with regard to his secret as
impenetrable as all his predecessors in alchymy his fame reached the ears
of the king charles vi who sent m de cramoisi the master of requests
to find out whether nicholas had indeed discovered the philosophers
stone but m de cramoisi took nothing by his visit all his attempts to
sound the alchymist were unavailing and he returned to his royal master
no wiser than he came it was in this year 1414 that he lost his
faithful petronella he did not long survive her but died in the
following year and was buried with great pomp by the grateful priests of
st jacques de la boucherie
the great wealth of nicholas flamel is undoubted as the records of
several churches and hospitals in france can testify that he practised
alchymy is equally certain as he left behind several works upon the
subject those who knew him well and who were incredulous about the
philosophers stone give a satisfactory solution of the secret of his
wealth they say that he was always a miser and a usurer that his journey
to spain was undertaken with very different motives from those pretended
by the alchymists that in fact he went to collect debts due from jews
in that country to their brethren in paris and that he charged a
commission of fully cent per cent in consideration of the difficulty of
collecting and the dangers of the road that when he possessed thousands
he lived upon almost nothing and was the general moneylender at
enormous profits to all the dissipated young men at the french court
among the works written by nicholas flamel on the subject of alchymy is
the philosophic summary a poem reprinted in 1735 as an appendix to
the third volume of the roman de la rose he also wrote three treatises
upon natural philosophy and an alchymic allegory entitled le dsir
dsir specimens of his writing and a facsimile of the drawings in his
book of abraham may be seen in salmons bibliothque des philosophes
chimiques the writer of the article flamel in the biographie
universelle says that for a hundred years after the death of flamel
many of the adepts believed that he was still alive and that he would
live for upwards of six hundred years the house he formerly occupied at
the corner of the rue de marivaux has been often taken by credulous
speculators and ransacked from top to bottom in the hopes that gold
might be found a report was current in paris not long previous to the
year 1816 that some lodgers had found in the cellars several jars filled
with a darkcoloured ponderous matter upon the strength of the rumour a
believer in all the wondrous tales told of nicholas flamel bought the
house and nearly pulled it to pieces in ransacking the walls and
wainscoting for hidden gold he got nothing for his pains however and
had a heavy bill to pay to restore his dilapidations
george ripley
while alchymy was thus cultivated on the continent of europe it was not
neglected in the isles of britain since the time of roger bacon it had
fascinated the imagination of many ardent men in england in the year 1404
an act of parliament was passed declaring the making of gold and silver to
be felony great alarm was felt at that time lest any alchymist should
succeed in his projects and perhaps bring ruin upon the state by
furnishing boundless wealth to some designing tyrant who would make use
of it to enslave his country this alarm appears to have soon subsided
for in the year 1455 king henry vi by advice of his council and
parliament granted four successive patents and commissions to several
knights citizens of london chemists monks masspriests and others to
find out the philosophers stone and elixir to the great benefit said
the patent of the realm and the enabling of the king to pay all the
debts of the crown in real gold and silver prinn in his aurum regin
observes as a note to this passage that the kings reason for granting
this patent to ecclesiastics was that they were such good artists in
transubstantiating bread and wine in the eucharist and therefore the more
likely to be able to effect the transmutation of baser metals into
better no gold of course was ever made and next year the king
doubting very much of the practicability of the thing took further
advice and appointed a commission of ten learned men and persons of
eminence to judge and certify to him whether the transmutation of metals
were a thing practicable or no it does not appear whether the commission
ever made any report upon the subject
in the succeeding reign an alchymist appeared who pretended to have
discovered the secret this was george ripley the canon of bridlington
in yorkshire he studied for twenty years in the universities of italy
and was a great favourite with pope innocent viii who made him one of
his domestic chaplains and master of the ceremonies in his household
returning to england in 1477 he dedicated to king edward iv his famous
work the compound of alchymy or the twelve gates leading to the
discovery of the philosophers stone these gates he described to be
calcination solution separation conjunction putrefaction congelation
cibation sublimation fermentation exaltation multiplication and
projection to which he might have added botheration the most important
process of all he was very rich and allowed it to be believed that he
could make gold out of iron fuller in his worthies of england says
that an english gentleman of good credit reported that in his travels
abroad he saw a record in the island of malta which declared that ripley
gave yearly to the knights of that island and of rhodes the enormous sum
of one hundred thousand pounds sterling to enable them to carry on the war
against the turks in his old age he became an anchorite near boston and
wrote twentyfive volumes upon the subject of alchymy the most important
of which is the duodecim portarum already mentioned before he died he
seems to have acknowledged that he had misspent his life in this vain
study and requested that all men when they met with any of his books
would burn them or afford them no credit as they had been written merely
from his opinion and not from proof and that subsequent trial had made
manifest to him that they were false and vain37

basil valentine
germany also produced many famous alchymists in the fifteenth century the
chief of whom are basil valentine bernard of trves and the abbot
trithemius basil valentine was born at mayence and was made prior of st
peters at erfurt about the year 1414 it was known during his life
that he diligently sought the philosophers stone and that he had written
some works upon the process of transmutation they were thought for many
years to be lost but were after his death discovered enclosed in the
stonework of one of the pillars in the abbey they were twentyone in
number and are fully set forth in the third volume of lenglets history
of the hermetic philosophy the alchymists asserted that heaven itself
conspired to bring to light these extraordinary works and that the pillar
in which they were enclosed was miraculously shattered by a thunderbolt
and that as soon as the manuscripts were liberated the pillar closed up
again of its own accord
bernard of treves
the life of this philosopher is a remarkable instance of talent and
perseverance misapplied in the search of his chimera nothing could daunt
him repeated disappointment never diminished his hopes and from the age
of fourteen to that of eightyfive he was incessantly employed among the
drugs and furnaces of his laboratory wasting his life with the view of
prolonging it and reducing himself to beggary in the hopes of growing
rich
he was born at either trves or padua in the year 1406 his father is said
by some to have been a physician in the latter city and by others to have
been count of the marches of trves and one of the most wealthy nobles of
his country at all events whether noble or physician he was a rich man
and left his son a magnificent estate at the age of fourteen he first
became enamoured of the science of alchymy and read the arabian authors
in their own language he himself has left a most interesting record of
his labours and wanderings from which the following particulars are
chiefly extracted the first book which fell into his hands was that of
the arabian philosopher rhazes from the reading of which he imagined that
he had discovered the means of augmenting gold a hundredfold for four
years he worked in his laboratory with the book of rhazes continually
before him at the end of that time he found that he had spent no less
than eight hundred crowns upon his experiment and had got nothing but
fire and smoke for his pains he now began to lose confidence in rhazes
and turned to the works of geber he studied him assiduously for two
years and being young rich and credulous was beset by all the
alchymists of the town who kindly assisted him in spending his money he
did not lose his faith in geber or patience with his hungry assistants
until he had lost two thousand crownsa very considerable sum in those
days
among all the crowd of pretended men of science who surrounded him there
was but one as enthusiastic and as disinterested as himself with this
man who was a monk of the order of st francis he contracted an intimate
friendship and spent nearly all his time some obscure treatises of
rupecissa and sacrobosco having fallen into their hands they were
persuaded from reading them that highly rectified spirits of wine was
the universal alkahest or dissolvent which would aid them greatly in the
process of transmutation they rectified the alcohol thirty times till
they made it so strong as to burst the vessels which contained it after
they had worked three years and spent three hundred crowns in the liquor
they discovered that they were on the wrong track they next tried alum
and copperas but the great secret still escaped them they afterwards
imagined that there was a marvellous virtue in all excrement especially
the human and actually employed more than two years in experimentalising
upon it with mercury salt and molten lead again the adepts flocked
around him from far and near to aid him with their counsels he received
them all hospitably and divided his wealth among them so generously and
unhesitatingly that they gave him the name of the good trevisan by
which he is still often mentioned in works that treat on alchymy for
twelve years he led this life making experiments every day upon some new
substance and praying to god night and morning that he might discover the
secret of transmutation
in this interval he lost his friend the monk and was joined by a
magistrate of the city of trves as ardent as himself in the search his
new acquaintance imagined that the ocean was the mother of gold and that
seasalt would change lead or iron into the precious metals bernard
resolved to try and transporting his laboratory to a house on the shores
of the baltic he worked upon salt for more than a year melting it
sublimating it crystallising it and occasionally drinking it for the
sake of other experiments still the strange enthusiast was not wholly
discouraged and his failure in one trial only made him the more anxious
to attempt another
he was now approaching the age of fifty and had as yet seen nothing of
the world he therefore determined to travel through germany italy
france and spain wherever he stopped he made inquiries whether there
were any alchymists in the neighbourhood he invariably sought them out
and if they were poor relieved and if affluent encouraged them at
citeaux he became acquainted with one geoffrey leuvier a monk of that
place who persuaded him that the essence of eggshells was a valuable
ingredient he tried therefore what could be done and was only
prevented from wasting a year or two on the experiment by the opinions of
an attorney at berghem in flanders who said that the great secret
resided in vinegar and copperas he was not convinced of the absurdity of
this idea until he had nearly poisoned himself he resided in france for
about five years when hearing accidentally that one master henry
confessor to the emperor frederic iii had discovered the philosophers
stone he set out for germany to pay him a visit he had as usual
surrounded himself with a set of hungry dependants several of whom
determined to accompany him he had not heart to refuse them and he
arrived at vienna with five of them bernard sent a polite invitation to
the confessor and gave him a sumptuous entertainment at which were
present nearly all the alchymists of vienna master henry frankly
confessed that he had not discovered the philosophers stone but that he
had all his life been employed in searching for it and would so continue
till he found it or died this was a man after bernards own heart and
they vowed with each other an eternal friendship it was resolved at
supper that each alchymist present should contribute a certain sum
towards raising fortytwo marks of gold which in five days it was
confidently asserted by master henry would increase in his furnace
fivefold bernard being the richest man contributed the lions share
ten marks of gold master henry five and the others one or two apiece
except the dependants of bernard who were obliged to borrow their quota
from their patron the grand experiment was duly made the golden marks
were put into a crucible with a quantity of salt copperas aquafortis
eggshells mercury lead and dung the alchymists watched this precious
mess with intense interest expecting that it would agglomerate into one
lump of pure gold at the end of three weeks they gave up the trial upon
some excuse that the crucible was not strong enough or that some
necessary ingredient was wanting whether any thief had put his hands into
the crucible is not known but it is alleged that the gold found therein
at the close of the experiment was worth only sixteen marks instead of
the fortytwo which were put there at the beginning
bernard though he made no gold at vienna made away with a very
considerable quantity he felt the loss so acutely that he vowed to think
no more of the philosophers stone this wise resolution he kept for two
months but he was miserable he was in the condition of the gambler who
cannot resist the fascination of the game while he has a coin remaining
but plays on with the hope of retrieving former losses till hope forsakes
him and he can live no longer he returned once more to his beloved
crucibles and resolved to prosecute his journey in search of a
philosopher who had discovered the secret and would communicate it to so
zealous and persevering an adept as himself from vienna he travelled to
rome and from rome to madrid taking ship at gibraltar he proceeded to
messina from messina to cyprus from cyprus to greece from greece to
constantinople and thence into egypt palestine and persia these
wanderings occupied him about eight years from persia he made his way
back to messina and from thence into france he afterwards passed over
into england still in search of his great chimera and this occupied four
years more of his life he was now growing both old and poor for he was
sixtytwo years of age and had been obliged to sell a great portion of
his patrimony to provide for his expenses his journey to persia had cost
upwards of thirteen thousand crowns about onehalf of which had been
fairly melted in his alldevouring furnaces the other half was lavished
upon the sycophants that he made it his business to search out in every
town he stopped at
on his return to trves he found to his sorrow that if not an actual
beggar he was not much better his relatives looked upon him as a madman
and refused even to see him too proud to ask for favours from any one
and still confident that some day or other he would be the possessor of
unbounded wealth he made up his mind to retire to the island of rhodes
where he might in the mean time hide his poverty from the eyes of the
world here he might have lived unknown and happy but as ill luck would
have it he fell in with a monk as mad as himself upon the subject of
transmutation they were however both so poor that they could not afford
to buy the proper materials to work with they kept up each others
spirits by learned discourses on the hermetic philosophy and in the
reading of all the great authors who had written upon the subject thus
did they nurse their folly as the good wife of tam oshanter did her
wrath to keep it warm after bernard had resided about a year in
rhodes a merchant who knew his family advanced him the sum of eight
thousand florins upon the security of the lastremaining acres of his
formerly large estate once more provided with funds he recommenced his
labours with all the zeal and enthusiasm of a young man for three years
he hardly stepped out of his laboratory he ate there and slept there
and did not even give himself time to wash his hands and clean his beard
so intense was his application it is melancholy to think that such
wonderful perseverance should have been wasted in so vain a pursuit and
that energies so unconquerable should have had no worthier field to strive
in even when he had fumed away his last coin and had nothing left in
prospective to keep his old age from starvation hope never forsook him
he still dreamed of ultimate success and sat down a greyheaded man of
eighty to read over all the authors on the hermetic mysteries from geber
to his own day lest he should have misunderstood some process which it
was not yet too late to recommence the alchymists say that he succeeded
at last and discovered the secret of transmutation in his eightysecond
year they add that he lived three years afterwards to enjoy his wealth
he lived it is true to this great age and made a valuable
discoverymore valuable than gold or gems he learned as he himself
informs us just before he had attained his eightythird year that the
great secret of philosophy was contentment with our lot happy would it
have been for him if he had discovered it sooner and before he became
decrepit a beggar and an exile
he died at rhodes in the year 1490 and all the alchymists of europe sang
elegies over him and sounded his praise as the good trevisan he wrote
several treatises upon his chimera the chief of which are the book of
chemistry the verbum dimissum and an essay de natura ovi
trithemius
the name of this eminent man has become famous in the annals of alchymy
although he did but little to gain so questionable an honour he was born
in the year 1462 at the village of trittheim in the electorate of
trves his father was john heidenberg a vinegrower in easy
circumstances who dying when his son was but seven years old left him
to the care of his mother the latter married again very shortly
afterwards and neglected the poor boy the offspring of her first
marriage at the age of fifteen he did not even know his letters and was
besides half starved and otherwise illtreated by his stepfather but
the love of knowledge germinated in the breast of the unfortunate youth
and he learned to read at the house of a neighbour his fatherinlaw set
him to work in the vineyards and thus occupied all his days but the
nights were his own he often stole out unheeded when all the household
were fast asleep poring over his studies in the fields by the light of
the moon and thus taught himself latin and the rudiments of greek he was
subjected to so much illusage at home in consequence of this love of
study that he determined to leave it demanding the patrimony which his
father had left him he proceeded to trves and assuming the name of
trithemius from that of his native village of trittheim lived there for
some months under the tuition of eminent masters by whom he was prepared
for the university at the age of twenty he took it into his head that he
should like to see his mother once more and he set out on foot from the
distant university for that purpose on his arrival near spannheim late
in the evening of a gloomy winters day it came on to snow so thickly
that he could not proceed onwards to the town he therefore took refuge
for the night in a neighbouring monastery but the storm continued several
days the roads became impassable and the hospitable monks would not hear
of his departure he was so pleased with them and their manner of life
that he suddenly resolved to fix his abode among them and renounce the
world they were no less pleased with him and gladly received him as a
brother in the course of two years although still so young he was
unanimously elected their abbot the financial affairs of the
establishment had been greatly neglected the walls of the building were
falling into ruin and every thing was in disorder trithemius by his
good management and regularity introduced a reform in every branch of
expenditure the monastery was repaired and a yearly surplus instead of
a deficiency rewarded him for his pains he did not like to see the monks
idle or occupied solely between prayers for their business and chess for
their relaxation he therefore set them to work to copy the writings of
eminent authors they laboured so assiduously that in the course of a
few years their library which had contained only about forty volumes
was enriched with several hundred valuable manuscripts comprising many of
the classical latin authors besides the works of the early fathers and
the principal historians and philosophers of more modern date he
retained the dignity of abbot of spannheim for twentyone years when the
monks tired of the severe discipline he maintained revolted against him
and chose another abbot in his place he was afterwards made abbot of st
james in wurzburg where he died in 1516
during his learned leisure at spannheim he wrote several works upon the
occult sciences the chief of which are an essay on geomancy or
divination by means of lines and circles on the ground another upon
sorcery a third upon alchymy and a fourth upon the government of the
world by its presiding angels which was translated into english and
published by the famous william lilly in 1647
it has been alleged by the believers in the possibility of transmutation
that the prosperity of the abbey of spannheim while under his
superintendence was owing more to the philosophers stone than to wise
economy trithemius in common with many other learned men has been
accused of magic and a marvellous story is told of his having raised from
the grave the form of mary of burgundy at the intercession of her widowed
husband the emperor maximilian his work on steganographia or cabalistic
writing was denounced to the count palatine frederic ii as magical and
devilish and it was by him taken from the shelves of his library and
thrown into the fire trithemius is said to be the first writer who makes
mention of the wonderful story of the devil and dr faustus the truth of
which he firmly believed he also recounts the freaks of a spirit named
hudekin by whom he was at times tormented38

the marechal de rays
one of the greatest encouragers of alchymy in the fifteenth century was
gilles de laval lord of rays and a marshal of france his name and deeds
are little known but in the annals of crime and folly they might claim
the highest and worst preeminence fiction has never invented any thing
wilder or more horrible than his career and were not the details but too
well authenticated by legal and other documents which admit no doubt the
lover of romance might easily imagine they were drawn to please him from
the stores of the prolific brain and not from the page of history
he was born about the year 1420 of one of the noblest families of
brittany his father dying when gilles had attained his twentieth year he
came into uncontrolled possession at that early age of a fortune which
the monarchs of france might have envied him he was a near kinsman of the
montmorencys the roncys and the craons possessed fifteen princely
domains and had an annual revenue of about three hundred thousand livres
besides this he was handsome learned and brave he distinguished
himself greatly in the wars of charles vii and was rewarded by that
monarch with the dignity of a marshal of france but he was extravagant
and magnificent in his style of living and accustomed from his earliest
years to the gratification of every wish and passion and this at last
led him from vice to vice and from crime to crime till a blacker name
than his is not to be found in any record of human iniquity
in his castle of champtoc he lived with all the splendour of an eastern
caliph he kept up a troop of two hundred horsemen to accompany him
wherever he went and his excursions for the purposes of hawking and
hunting were the wonder of all the country around so magnificent were the
caparisons of his steeds and the dresses of his retainers day and night
his castle was open all the year round to comers of every degree he made
it a rule to regale even the poorest beggar with wine and hippocrass
every day an ox was roasted whole in his spacious kitchens besides sheep
pigs and poultry sufficient to feed five hundred persons he was equally
magnificent in his devotions his private chapel at champtoc was the most
beautiful in france and far surpassed any of those in the richlyendowed
cathedrals of notre dame in paris of amiens of beauvais or of rouen it
was hung with cloth of gold and rich velvet all the chandeliers were of
pure gold curiously inlaid with silver the great crucifix over the altar
was of solid silver and the chalices and incenseburners were of pure
gold he had besides a fine organ which he caused to be carried from one
castle to another on the shoulders of six men whenever he changed his
residence he kept up a choir of twentyfive young children of both sexes
who were instructed in singing by the first musicians of the day the
master of his chapel he called a bishop who had under him his deans
archdeacons and vicars each receiving great salaries the bishop four
hundred crowns a year and the rest in proportion
he also maintained a whole troop of players including ten dancing girls
and as many balladsingers besides morrisdancers jugglers and
mountebanks of every description the theatre on which they performed was
fitted up without any regard to expense and they played mysteries or
danced the morrisdance every evening for the amusement of himself and
household and such strangers as were sharing his prodigal hospitality
at the age of twentythree he married catherine the wealthy heiress of
the house of touars for whom he refurnished his castle at an expense of a
hundred thousand crowns his marriage was the signal for new extravagance
and he launched out more madly than ever he had done before sending for
fine singers or celebrated dancers from foreign countries to amuse him and
his spouse and instituting tilts and tournaments in his great courtyard
almost every week for all the knights and nobles of the province of
brittany the duke of brittanys court was not half so splendid as that of
the marchal de rays his utter disregard for wealth was so well known
that he was made to pay three times its value for every thing he
purchased his castle was filled with needy parasites and panderers to his
pleasures amongst whom he lavished rewards with an unsparing hand but
the ordinary round of sensual gratification ceased at last to afford him
delight he was observed to be more abstemious in the pleasures of the
table and to neglect the beauteous dancing girls who used formerly to
occupy so much of his attention he was sometimes gloomy and reserved and
there was an unnatural wildness in his eye which gave indications of
incipient madness still his discourse was as reasonable as ever his
urbanity to the guests that flocked from far and near to champtoc
suffered no diminution and learned priests when they conversed with him
thought to themselves that few of the nobles of france were so well
informed as gilles de laval but dark rumours spread gradually over the
country murder and if possible still more atrocious deeds were hinted
at and it was remarked that many young children of both sexes suddenly
disappeared and were never afterwards heard of one or two had been
traced to the castle of champtoc and had never been seen to leave it
but no one dared to accuse openly so powerful a man as the marchal de
rays whenever the subject of the lost children was mentioned in his
presence he manifested the greatest astonishment at the mystery which
involved their fate and indignation against those who might be guilty of
kidnapping them still the world was not wholly deceived his name became
as formidable to young children as that of the devouring ogre in fairy
tales and they were taught to go miles round rather than pass under the
turrets of champtoc
in the course of a few years the reckless extravagance of the marshal
drained him of all his funds and he was obliged to put up some of his
estates for sale the duke of brittany entered into a treaty with him for
the valuable seignory of ingrande but the heirs of gilles implored the
interference of charles vii to stay the sale charles immediately issued
an edict which was confirmed by the provincial parliament of brittany
forbidding him to alienate his paternal estates gilles had no alternative
but to submit he had nothing to support his extravagance but his
allowance as a marshal of france which did not cover the onetenth of his
expenses a man of his habits and character could not retrench his
wasteful expenditure and live reasonably he could not dismiss without a
pang his horsemen his jesters his morrisdancers his choristers and
his parasites or confine his hospitality to those who really needed it
notwithstanding his diminished resources he resolved to live as he had
lived before and turn alchymist that he might make gold out of iron and
be still the wealthiest and most magnificent among the nobles of brittany
in pursuance of this determination he sent to paris italy germany and
spain inviting all the adepts in the science to visit him at champtoc
the messengers he despatched on this mission were two of his most needy
and unprincipled dependants gilles de sill and roger de bricqueville
the latter the obsequious panderer to his most secret and abominable
pleasures he had entrusted with the education of his motherless daughter
a child but five years of age with permission that he might marry her at
the proper time to any person he chose or to himself if he liked it
better this man entered into the new plans of his master with great zeal
and introduced to him one prelati an alchymist of padua and a physician
of poitou who was addicted to the same pursuits
the marshal caused a splendid laboratory to be fitted up for them and the
three commenced the search for the philosophers stone they were soon
afterwards joined by another pretended philosopher named anthony palermo
who aided in their operations for upwards of a year they all fared
sumptuously at the marshals expense draining him of the ready money he
possessed and leading him on from day to day with the hope that they
would succeed in the object of their search from time to time new
aspirants from the remotest parts of europe arrived at his castle and for
months he had upwards of twenty alchymists at work trying to transmute
copper into gold and wasting the gold which was still his own in drugs
and elixirs
but the lord of rays was not a man to abide patiently their lingering
processes pleased with their comfortable quarters they jogged on from
day to day and would have done so for years had they been permitted but
he suddenly dismissed them all with the exception of the italian prelati
and the physician of poitou these he retained to aid him to discover the
secret of the philosophers stone by a bolder method the poitousan had
persuaded him that the devil was the great depository of that and all
other secrets and that he would raise him before gilles who might enter
into any contract he pleased with him gilles expressed his readiness and
promised to give the devil any thing but his soul or do any deed that the
archenemy might impose upon him attended solely by the physician he
proceeded at midnight to a wildlooking place in a neighbouring forest
the physician drew a magic circle around them on the sward and muttered
for half an hour an invocation to the evil spirit to arise at his bidding
and disclose the secrets of alchymy gilles looked on with intense
interest and expected every moment to see the earth open and deliver to
his gaze the great enemy of mankind at last the eyes of the physician
became fixed his hair stood on end and he spoke as if addressing the
fiend but gilles saw nothing except his companion at last the physician
fell down on the sward as if insensible gilles looked calmly on to see
the end after a few minutes the physician arose and asked him if he had
not seen how angry the devil looked gilles replied that he had seen
nothing upon which his companion informed him that beelzebub had appeared
in the form of a wild leopard growled at him savagely and said nothing
and that the reason why the marshal had neither seen nor heard him was
that he hesitated in his own mind as to devoting himself entirely to the
service de rays owned that he had indeed misgivings and inquired what
was to be done to make the devil speak out and unfold his secret the
physician replied that some person must go to spain and africa to collect
certain herbs which only grew in those countries and offered to go
himself if de rays would provide the necessary funds de rays at once
consented and the physician set out on the following day with all the
gold that his dupe could spare him the marshal never saw his face again
but the eager lord of champtoc could not rest gold was necessary for his
pleasures and unless by supernatural aid he had no means of procuring
any further supplies the physician was hardly twenty leagues on his
journey before gilles resolved to make another effort to force the devil
to divulge the art of goldmaking he went out alone for that purpose but
all his conjurations were of no effect beelzebub was obstinate and would
not appear determined to conquer him if he could he unbosomed himself to
the italian alchymist prelati the latter offered to undertake the
business upon condition that de rays did not interfere in the
conjurations and consented besides to furnish him with all the charms and
talismans that might be required he was further to open a vein in his
arm and sign with his blood a contract that he would work the devils
will in all things and offer up to him a sacrifice of the heart lungs
hands eyes and blood of a young child the grasping monomaniac made no
hesitation but agreed at once to the disgusting terms proposed to him on
the following night prelati went out alone and after having been absent
for three or four hours returned to gilles who sat anxiously awaiting
him prelati then informed him that he had seen the devil in the shape of
a handsome youth of twenty he further said that the devil desired to be
called barron in all future invocations and had shewn him a great
number of ingots of pure gold buried under a large oak in the
neighbouring forest all of which and as many more as he desired should
become the property of the marchal de rays if he remained firm and broke
no condition of the contract prelati further shewed him a small casket of
black dust which would turn iron into gold but as the process was very
troublesome he advised that they should be contented with the ingots they
found under the oak tree and which would more than supply all the wants
that the most extravagant imagination could desire they were not
however to attempt to look for the gold till a period of seven times
seven weeks or they would find nothing but slates and stones for their
pains gilles expressed the utmost chagrin and disappointment and at once
said that he could not wait for so long a period if the devil were not
more prompt prelati might tell him that the marchal de rays was not to
be trifled with and would decline all further communication with him
prelati at last persuaded him to wait seven times seven days they then
went at midnight with picks and shovels to dig up the ground under the
oak where they found nothing to reward them but a great quantity of
slates marked with hieroglyphics it was now prelatis turn to be angry
and he loudly swore that the devil was nothing but a liar and a cheat the
marshal joined cordially in the opinion but was easily persuaded by the
cunning italian to make one more trial he promised at the same time that
he would endeavour on the following night to discover the reason why the
devil had broken his word he went out alone accordingly and on his
return informed his patron that he had seen barron who was exceedingly
angry that they had not waited the proper time ere they looked for the
ingots barron had also said that the marchal de rays could hardly
expect any favours from him at a time when he must know that he had been
meditating a pilgrimage to the holy land to make atonement for his sins
the italian had doubtless surmised this from some incautious expression of
his patron for de rays frankly confessed that there were times when sick
of the world and all its pomps and vanities he thought of devoting
himself to the service of god
in this manner the italian lured on from month to month his credulous and
guilty patron extracting from him all the valuables he possessed and
only waiting a favourable opportunity to decamp with his plunder but the
day of retribution was at hand for both young girls and boys continued to
disappear in the most mysterious manner and the rumours against the owner
of champtoc grew so loud and distinct that the church was compelled to
interfere representations were made by the bishop of nantes to the duke
of brittany that it would be a public scandal if the accusations against
the marchal de rays were not inquired into he was arrested accordingly
in his own castle along with his accomplice prelati and thrown into a
dungeon at nantes to await his trial
the judges appointed to try him were the bishop of nantes chancellor of
brittany the vicar of the inquisition in france and the celebrated
pierre lhpital the president of the provincial parliament the offences
laid to his charge were sorcery sodomy and murder gilles on the first
day of his trial conducted himself with the utmost insolence he braved
the judges on the judgmentseat calling them simoniacs and persons of
impure life and said he would rather be hanged by the neck like a dog
without trial than plead either guilty or not guilty before such
contemptible miscreants but his confidence forsook him as the trial
proceeded and he was found guilty on the clearest evidence of all the
crimes laid to his charge it was proved that he took insane pleasure in
stabbing the victims of his lust and in observing the quivering of their
flesh and the fading lustre of their eyes as they expired the confession
of prelati first made the judges acquainted with this horrid madness and
gilles himself confirmed it before his death nearly a hundred children of
the villagers around his two castles of champtoc and machecoue had been
missed within three years the greater part if not all of whom were
immolated to the lust or the cupidity of this monster he imagined that he
thus made the devil his friend and that his recompense would be the
secret of the philosophers stone
gilles and prelati were both condemned to be burned alive at the place of
execution they assumed the air of penitence and religion gilles tenderly
embraced prelati saying farewell friend francis in this world we
shall never meet again but let us place our hopes in god we shall see
each other in paradise out of consideration for his high rank and
connexions the punishment of the marshal was so far mitigated that he
was not burned alive like prelati he was first strangled and then thrown
into the flames his body when half consumed was given over to his
relatives for interment while that of the italian was burned to ashes
and then scattered to the winds39

jacques coeur
this remarkable pretender to the secret of the philosophers stone was
contemporary with the last mentioned he was a great personage at the
court of charles vii and in the events of his reign played a prominent
part from a very humble origin he rose to the highest honours of the
state and amassed enormous wealth by peculation and plunder of the
country which he should have served it was to hide his delinquencies in
this respect and to divert attention from the real source of his riches
that he boasted of having discovered the art of transmuting the inferior
metals into gold and silver
his father was a goldsmith in the city of bourges but so reduced in
circumstances towards the latter years of his life that he was unable to
pay the necessary fees to procure his sons admission into the guild
young jacques became however a workman in the royal mint of bourges in
1428 and behaved himself so well and shewed so much knowledge of
metallurgy that he attained rapid promotion in that establishment he had
also the good fortune to make the acquaintance of the fair agnes sorel by
whom he was patronised and much esteemed jacques had now three things in
his favourability perseverance and the countenance of the kings
mistress many a man succeeds with but one of these to help him forward
and it would have been strange indeed if jacques coeur who had them all
should have languished in obscurity while still a young man he was made
master of the mint in which he had been a journeyman and installed at
the same time into the vacant office of grand treasurer of the royal
household
he possessed an extensive knowledge of finance and turned it wonderfully
to his own advantage as soon as he became entrusted with extensive funds
he speculated in articles of the first necessity and made himself popular
by buying up grain honey wines and other produce till there was a
scarcity when he sold it again at enormous profit strong in the royal
favour he did not hesitate to oppress the poor by continual acts of
forestalling and monopoly as there is no enemy so bitter as the estranged
friend so of all the tyrants and tramplers upon the poor there is none
so fierce and reckless as the upstart that sprang from their ranks the
offensive pride of jacques coeur to his inferiors was the theme of
indignant reproach in his own city and his cringing humility to those
above him was as much an object of contempt to the aristocrats into whose
society he thrust himself but jacques did not care for the former and to
the latter he was blind he continued his career till he became the
richest man in france and so useful to the king that no important
enterprise was set on foot until he had been consulted he was sent in
1446 on an embassy to genoa and in the following year to pope nicholas
v in both these missions he acquitted himself to the satisfaction of his
sovereign and was rewarded with a lucrative appointment in addition to
those which he already held
in the year 1449 the english in normandy deprived of their great
general the duke of bedford broke the truce with the french king and
took possession of a small town belonging to the duke of brittany this
was the signal for the recommencement of a war in which the french
regained possession of nearly the whole province the money for this war
was advanced for the most part by jacques coeur when rouen yielded to
the french and charles made his triumphal entry into that city
accompanied by dunois and his most famous generals jacques was among the
most brilliant of his cortge his chariot and horses vied with those of
the king in the magnificence of their trappings and his enemies said of
him that he publicly boasted that he alone had driven out the english and
that the valour of the troops would have been nothing without his gold
dunois appears also to have been partly of the same opinion without
disparaging the courage of the army he acknowledged the utility of the
able financier by whose means they had been fed and paid and constantly
afforded him his powerful protection
when peace returned jacques again devoted himself to commerce and fitted
up several galleys to trade with the genoese he also bought large estates
in various parts of france the chief of which were the baronies of st
fargeau meneton salone maubranche meaune st gerant de vaux and st
aon de boissy the earldoms or counties of la palisse champignelle
beaumont and villeneuve la gent and the marquisate of toucy he also
procured for his son jean coeur who had chosen the church for his
profession a post no less distinguished than that of archbishop of
bourges
every body said that so much wealth could not have been honestly acquired
and both rich and poor longed for the day that should humble the pride of
the man whom the one class regarded as an upstart and the other as an
oppressor jacques was somewhat alarmed at the rumours that were afloat
respecting him and of dark hints that he had debased the coin of the
realm and forged the kings seal to an important document by which he had
defrauded the state of very considerable sums to silence these rumours
he invited many alchymists from foreign countries to reside with him and
circulated a counter rumour that he had discovered the secret of the
philosophers stone he also built a magnificent house in his native city
over the entrance of which he caused to be sculptured the emblems of that
science some time afterwards he built another no less splendid at
montpellier which he inscribed in a similar manner he also wrote a
treatise upon the hermetic philosophy in which he pretended that he knew
the secret of transmuting metals
illustration house of jacques coeur bourges
but all these attempts to disguise his numerous acts of peculation proved
unavailing and he was arrested in 1452 and brought to trial on several
charges upon one only which the malice of his enemies invented to ruin
him was he acquitted which was that he had been accessory to the death
by poison of his kind patroness agnes sorel upon the others he was
found guilty and sentenced to be banished the kingdom and to pay the
enormous fine of four hundred thousand crowns it was proved that he had
forged the kings seal that in his capacity of master of the mint of
bourges he had debased to a very great extent the gold and silver coin
of the realm and that he had not hesitated to supply the turks with arms
and money to enable them to carry on war against their christian
neighbours for which service he had received the most munificent
recompenses charles vii was deeply grieved at his condemnation and
believed to the last that he was innocent by his means the fine was
reduced within a sum which jacques coeur could pay after remaining for
some time in prison he was liberated and left france with a large sum of
money part of which it was alleged was secretly paid him by charles out
of the produce of his confiscated estates he retired to cyprus where he
died about 1460 the richest and most conspicuous personage of the island
the writers upon alchymy all claim jacques coeur as a member of their
fraternity and treat as false and libellous the more rational explanation
of his wealth which the records of his trial afford pierre borel in his
antiquits gauloises maintains the opinion that jacques was an honest
man and that he made his gold out of lead and copper by means of the
philosophers stone the alchymic adepts in general were of the same
opinion but they found it difficult to persuade even his contemporaries
of the fact posterity is still less likely to believe it
inferior adepts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
many other pretenders to the secrets of the philosophers stone appeared
in every country in europe during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
the possibility of transmutation was so generally admitted that every
chemist was more or less an alchymist germany holland italy spain
poland france and england produced thousands of obscure adepts who
supported themselves in the pursuit of their chimera by the more
profitable resources of astrology and divination the monarchs of europe
were no less persuaded than their subjects of the possibility of
discovering the philosophers stone henry vi and edward iv of england
encouraged alchymy in germany the emperors maximilian rudolph and
frederic ii devoted much of their attention to it and every inferior
potentate within their dominions imitated their example it was a common
practice in germany among the nobles and petty sovereigns to invite an
alchymist to take up his residence among them that they might confine him
in a dungeon till he made gold enough to pay millions for his ransom many
poor wretches suffered perpetual imprisonment in consequence a similar
fate appears to have been intended by edward ii for raymond lulli who
upon the pretence that he was thereby honoured was accommodated with
apartments in the tower of london he found out in time the trick that was
about to be played him and managed to make his escape some of his
biographers say by jumping into the thames and swimming to a vessel that
lay waiting to receive him in the sixteenth century the same system was
pursued as will be shewn more fully in the life of seton the cosmopolite
the following is a catalogue of the chief authors upon alchymy who
flourished during this epoch and whose lives and adventures are either
unknown or are unworthy of more detailed notice john dowston an
englishman lived in 1315 and wrote two treatises on the philosophers
stone richard or as some call him robert also an englishman lived in
1330 and wrote a work entitled correctorium alchymi which was much
esteemed till the time of paracelsus in the same year lived peter of
lombardy who wrote what he called a complete treatise upon the hermetic
science an abridgment of which was afterwards published by lacini a
monk of calabria in 1330 the most famous alchymist of paris was one
odomare whose work de practica magistri was for a long time a
handbook among the brethren of the science john de rupecissa a french
monk of the order of st francis flourished in 1357 and pretended to be
a prophet as well as an alchymist some of his prophecies were so
disagreeable to pope innocent vi that the pontiff determined to put a
stop to them by locking up the prophet in the dungeons of the vatican it
is generally believed that he died there though there is no evidence of
the fact his chief works are the book of light the five essences
the heaven of philosophers and his grand work de confectione
lapidis he was not thought a shining light among the adepts ortholani
was another pretender of whom nothing is known but that he exercised the
arts of alchymy and astrology at paris shortly before the time of
nicholas flamel his work on the practice of alchymy was written in that
city in 1358 isaac of holland wrote it is supposed about this time and
his son also devoted himself to the science nothing worth repeating is
known of their lives boerhaave speaks with commendation of many passages
in their works and paracelsus esteemed them highly the chief are de
triplici ordine elixiris et lapidis theoria printed at berne in 1608
and mineralia opera seu de lapide philosophico printed at middleburg
in 1600 they also wrote eight other works upon the same subject
koffstky a pole wrote an alchymical treatise entitled the tincture of
minerals about the year 1488 in this list of authors a royal name must
not be forgotten charles vi of france one of the most credulous princes
of the day whose court absolutely swarmed with alchymists conjurers
astrologers and quacks of every description made several attempts to
discover the philosophers stone and thought he knew so much about it
that he determined to enlighten the world with a treatise it is called
the royal work of charles vi of france and the treasure of philosophy
it is said to be the original from which nicholas flamel took the idea of
his dsir dsir lenglet du fresnoy says it is very allegorical and
utterly incomprehensible for a more complete list of the hermetic
philosophers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the reader is
referred to the third volume of lenglets history already quoted
                                   
progress of the infatuation during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuriespresent state of the science
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the search for the
philosophers stone was continued by thousands of the enthusiastic and the
credulous but a great change was introduced during this period the
eminent men who devoted themselves to the study totally changed its
aspect and referred to the possession of their wondrous stone and elixir
not only the conversion of the base into the precious metals but the
solution of all the difficulties of other sciences they pretended that by
its means man would be brought into closer communion with his maker that
disease and sorrow would be banished from the world and that the
millions of spiritual beings who walk the earth unseen would be rendered
visible and become the friends companions and instructors of mankind
in the seventeenth century more especially these poetical and fantastic
doctrines excited the notice of europe and from germany where they had
been first disseminated by rosencreutz spread into france and england
and ran away with the sound judgment of many clever but too enthusiastic
searchers for the truth paracelsus dee and many others of less note
were captivated by the grace and beauty of the new mythology which was
arising to adorn the literature of europe most of the alchymists of the
sixteenth century although ignorant of the rosicrucians as a sect were
in some degree tinctured with their fanciful tenets but before we speak
more fully of these poetical visionaries it will be necessary to resume
the history of the hermetic folly and trace the gradual change that stole
over the dreams of the adepts it will be seen that the infatuation
increased rather than diminished as the world grew older
augurello
among the alchymists who were born in the fifteenth and distinguished
themselves in the sixteenth century the first in point of date is john
aurelio augurello he was born at rimini in 1441 and became professor of
the belles lettres at venice and trevisa he was early convinced of the
truth of the hermetic science and used to pray to god that he might be
happy enough to discover the philosophers stone he was continually
surrounded by the paraphernalia of chemistry and expended all his wealth
in the purchase of drugs and metals he was also a poet but of less merit
than pretensions his chrysopeia in which he pretended to teach the art
of making gold he dedicated to pope leo x in the hope that the pontiff
would reward him handsomely for the compliment but the pope was too good
a judge of poetry to be pleased with the worse than mediocrity of his
poem and too good a philosopher to approve of the strange doctrines which
it inculcated he was therefore far from gratified at the dedication it
is said that when augurello applied to him for a reward the pope with
great ceremony and much apparent kindness and cordiality drew an empty
purse from his pocket and presented it to the alchymist saying that
since he was able to make gold the most appropriate present that could be
made him was a purse to put it in this scurvy reward was all that the
poor alchymist ever got either for his poetry or his alchymy he died in a
state of extreme poverty in the eightythird year of his age
cornelius agrippa
this alchymist has left a distinguished reputation  the most
extraordinary tales were told and believed of his powers he could turn
iron into gold by his mere word all the spirits of the air and demons of
the earth were under his command and bound to obey him in everything he
could raise from the dead the forms of the great men of other days and
make them appear in their habit as they lived to the gaze of the
curious who had courage enough to abide their presence
illustration cornelius agrippa
he was born at cologne in 1486 and began at an early age the study of
chemistry and philosophy by some means or other which have never been
very clearly explained he managed to impress his contemporaries with a
great idea of his wonderful attainments at the early age of twenty so
great was his reputation as an alchymist that the principal adepts of
paris wrote to cologne inviting him to settle in france and aid them
with his experience in discovering the philosophers stone honours poured
upon him in thick succession and he was highly esteemed by all the
learned men of his time melancthon speaks of him with respect and
commendation erasmus also bears testimony in his favour and the general
voice of his age proclaimed him a light of literature and an ornament to
philosophy some men by dint of excessive egotism manage to persuade
their contemporaries that they are very great men indeed they publish
their acquirements so loudly in peoples ears and keep up their own
praises so incessantly that the worlds applause is actually taken by
storm such seems to have been the case with agrippa he called himself a
sublime theologian an excellent jurisconsult an able physician a great
philosopher and a successful alchymist the world at last took him at his
word and thought that a man who talked so big must have some merit to
recommend himthat it was indeed a great trumpet which sounded so
obstreperous a blast he was made secretary to the emperor maximilian who
conferred upon him the title of chevalier and gave him the honorary
command of a regiment he afterwards became professor of hebrew and the
belles lettres at the university of dle in france but quarrelling
with the franciscan monks upon some knotty points of divinity he was
obliged to quit the town he took refuge in london where he taught hebrew
and cast nativities for about a year from london he proceeded to pavia
and gave lectures upon the writings real or supposed of hermes
trismegistus and might have lived there in peace and honour had he not
again quarrelled with the clergy by their means his position became so
disagreeable that he was glad to accept an offer made him by the
magistracy of metz to become their syndic and advocategeneral here
again his love of disputation made him enemies the theological wiseacres
of that city asserted that st ann had three husbands in which opinion
they were confirmed by the popular belief of the day agrippa needlessly
ran foul of this opinion or prejudice as he called it and thereby lost
much of his influence another dispute more creditable to his character
occurred soon after and sank him for ever in the estimation of the
metzians humanely taking the part of a young girl who was accused of
witchcraft his enemies asserted that he was himself a sorcerer and
raised such a storm over his head that he was forced to fly the city
after this he became physician to louisa de savoy mother of king francis
i this lady was curious to know the future and required her physician to
cast her nativity agrippa replied that he would not encourage such idle
curiosity the result was he lost her confidence and was forthwith
dismissed if it had been through his belief in the worthlessness of
astrology that he had made his answer we might admire his honest and
fearless independence but when it is known that at the very same time
he was in the constant habit of divination and fortunetelling and that
he was predicting splendid success in all his undertakings to the
constable of bourbon we can only wonder at his thus estranging a powerful
friend through mere petulance and perversity
he was about this time invited both by henry viii of england and
margaret of austria governess of the low countries to fix his residence
in their dominions he chose the service of the latter by whose influence
he was made historiographer to the emperor charles v unfortunately for
agrippa he never had stability enough to remain long in one position and
offended his patrons by his restlessness and presumption after the death
of margaret he was imprisoned at brussels on a charge of sorcery he was
released after a year and quitting the country experienced many
vicissitudes he died in great poverty in 1534 aged fortyeight years
while in the service of margaret of austria he resided principally at
louvain in which city he wrote his famous work on the vanity and
nothingness of human knowledge he also wrote to please his royal
mistress a treatise upon the superiority of the female sex which he
dedicated to her in token of his gratitude for the favours she had heaped
upon him the reputation he left behind him in these provinces was any
thing but favourable a great number of the marvellous tales that are told
of him relate to this period of his life it was said that the gold which
he paid to the traders with whom he dealt always looked remarkably
bright but invariably turned into pieces of slate and stone in the course
of fourandtwenty hours of this spurious gold he was believed to have
made large quantities by the aid of the devil who it would appear from
this had but a very superficial knowledge of alchymy and much less than
the marchal de rays gave him credit for the jesuit delrio in his book
on magic and sorcery relates a still more extraordinary story of him one
day agrippa left his house at louvain and intending to be absent for
some time gave the key of his study to his wife with strict orders that
no one should enter it during his absence the lady herself strange as it
may appear had no curiosity to pry into her husbands secrets and never
once thought of entering the forbidden room but a young student who had
been accommodated with an attic in the philosophers house burned with a
fierce desire to examine the study hoping perchance that he might
purloin some book or implement which would instruct him in the art of
transmuting metals the youth being handsome eloquent and above all
highly complimentary to the charms of the lady she was persuaded without
much difficulty to lend him the key but gave him strict orders not to
remove any thing the student promised implicit obedience and entered
agrippas study the first object that caught his attention was a large
grimoire or book of spells which lay open on the philosophers desk
he sat himself down immediately and began to read at the first word he
uttered he fancied he heard a knock at the door he listened but all was
silent thinking that his imagination had deceived him he read on when
immediately a louder knock was heard which so terrified him that he
started to his feet he tried to say come in but his tongue refused its
office and he could not articulate a sound he fixed his eyes upon the
door which slowly opening disclosed a stranger of majestic form but
scowling features who demanded sternly why he was summoned i did not
summon you said the trembling student you did said the stranger
advancing angrily and the demons are not to be invoked in vain the
student could make no reply and the demon enraged that one of the
uninitiated should have summoned him out of mere presumption seized him
by the throat and strangled him when agrippa returned a few days
afterwards he found his house beset with devils some of them were
sitting on the chimneypots kicking up their legs in the air while
others were playing at leapfrog on the very edge of the parapet his study
was so filled with them that he found it difficult to make his way to his
desk when at last he had elbowed his way through them he found his
book open and the student lying dead upon the floor he saw immediately
how the mischief had been done and dismissing all the inferior imps
asked the principal demon how he could have been so rash as to kill the
young man the demon replied that he had been needlessly invoked by an
insulting youth and could do no less than kill him for his presumption
agrippa reprimanded him severely and ordered him immediately to reanimate
the dead body and walk about with it in the marketplace for the whole of
the afternoon the demon did so the student revived and putting his arm
through that of his unearthly murderer walked very lovingly with him in
sight of all the people at sunset the body fell down again cold and
lifeless as before and was carried by the crowd to the hospital it being
the general opinion that he had expired in a fit of apoplexy his
conductor immediately disappeared when the body was examined marks of
strangulation were found on the neck and prints of the long claws of the
demon on various parts of it these appearances together with a story
which soon obtained currency that the companion of the young man had
vanished in a cloud of flame and smoke opened peoples eyes to the truth
the magistrates of louvain instituted inquiries and the result was that
agrippa was obliged to quit the town
other authors besides delrio relate similar stories of this philosopher
the world in those days was always willing enough to believe in tales of
magic and sorcery and when as in agrippas case the alleged magician
gave himself out for such and claimed credit for the wonders he worked
it is not surprising that the age should have allowed his pretensions it
was dangerous boasting which sometimes led to the stake or the gallows
and therefore was thought to be not without foundation paulus jovius in
his eulogia doctorum virorum says that the devil in the shape of a
large black dog attended agrippa wherever he went thomas nash in his
adventures of jack wilton relates that at the request of lord surrey
erasmus and some other learned men agrippa called up from the grave many
of the great philosophers of antiquity among others tully whom he
caused to redeliver his celebrated oration for roscius he also shewed
lord surrey when in germany an exact resemblance in a glass of his
mistress the fair geraldine she was represented on a couch weeping for
the absence of her lover lord surrey made a note of the exact time at
which he saw this vision and ascertained afterwards that his mistress was
actually so employed at the very minute to thomas lord cromwell agrippa
represented king henry viii hunting in windsor park with the principal
lords of his court and to please the emperor charles v he summoned king
david and king solomon from the tomb
naud in his apology for the great men who have been falsely suspected
of magic takes a great deal of pains to clear agrippa from the
imputations cast upon him by delrio paulus jovius and other such
ignorant and prejudiced scribblers such stories demanded refutation in
the days of naud but they may now be safely left to decay in their own
absurdity that they should have attached however to the memory of a man
who claimed the power of making iron obey him when he told it to become
gold and who wrote such a work as that upon magic which goes by his
name is not at all surprising
paracelsus
this philosopher called by naud the zenith and rising sun of all the
alchymists was born at einsiedeln near zurich in the year 1493 his
true name was hohenheim to which as he himself informs us were prefixed
the baptismal names of aureolus theophrastus bombastes paracelsus the
last of these he chose for his common designation while he was yet a boy
and rendered it before he died one of the most famous in the annals of
his time his father who was a physician educated his son for the same
pursuit the latter was an apt scholar and made great progress by chance
the work of isaac hollandus fell into his hands and from that time he
became smitten with the mania of the philosophers stone all his thoughts
henceforth were devoted to metallurgy and he travelled into sweden that
he might visit the mines of that country and examine the ores while they
yet lay in the bowels of the earth he also visited trithemius at the
monastery of spannheim and obtained instructions from him in the science
of alchymy continuing his travels he proceeded through prussia and
austria into turkey egypt and tartary and thence returning to
constantinople learned as he boasted the art of transmutation and
became possessed of the elixir vit he then established himself as a
physician in his native switzerland at zurich and commenced writing works
upon alchymy and medicine which immediately fixed the attention of
europe their great obscurity was no impediment to their fame for the
less the author was understood the more the demonologists fanatics and
philosophersstone hunters seemed to appreciate him his fame as a
physician kept pace with that which he enjoyed as an alchymist owing to
his having effected some happy cures by means of mercury and opiumdrugs
unceremoniously condemned by his professional brethren in the year 1526
he was chosen professor of physics and natural philosophy in the
university of basle where his lectures attracted vast numbers of
students he denounced the writings of all former physicians as tending to
mislead and publicly burned the works of galen and avicenna as quacks
and impostors he exclaimed in presence of the admiring and
halfbewildered crowd who assembled to witness the ceremony that there
was more knowledge in his shoestrings than in the writings of these
physicians continuing in the same strain he said all the universities
in the world were full of ignorant quacks but that he paracelsus
overflowed with wisdom you will all follow my new system said he with
furious gesticulations avicenna galen rhazis montagnana memyou
will all follow me ye professors of paris montpellier germany cologne
and vienna and all ye that dwell on the rhine and the danubeye that
inhabit the isles of the sea and ye also italians dalmatians
athenians arabians jewsye will all follow my doctrines for i am the
monarch of medicine
illustration paracelsus
but he did not long enjoy the esteem of the good citizens of basle it is
said that he indulged in wine so freely as not unfrequently to be seen in
the streets in a state of intoxication this was ruinous for a physician
and his good fame decreased rapidly his ill fame increased in still
greater proportion especially when he assumed the airs of a sorcerer he
boasted of the legions of spirits at his command and of one especially
which he kept imprisoned in the hilt of his sword wetteras who lived
twentyseven months in his service relates that he often threatened to
invoke a whole army of demons and shew him the great authority which he
could exercise over them he let it be believed that the spirit in his
sword had custody of the elixir of life by means of which he could make
any one live to be as old as the antediluvians he also boasted that he
had a spirit at his command called azoth whom he kept imprisoned in a
jewel and in many of the old portraits he is represented with a jewel
inscribed with the word azoth in his hand
if a sober prophet has little honour in his own country a drunken one has
still less paracelsus found it at last convenient to quit basle and
establish himself at strasbourg the immediate cause of this change of
residence was as follows a citizen lay at the point of death and was
given over by all the physicians of the town as a last resource
paracelsus was called in to whom the sick man promised a magnificent
recompense if by his means he were cured paracelsus gave him two small
pills which the man took and rapidly recovered when he was quite well
paracelsus sent for his fee but the citizen had no great opinion of the
value of a cure which had been so speedily effected he had no notion of
paying a handful of gold for two pills although they had saved his life
and he refused to pay more than the usual fee for a single visit
paracelsus brought an action against him and lost it this result so
exasperated him that he left basle in high dudgeon he resumed his
wandering life and travelled in germany and hungary supporting himself
as he went on the credulity and infatuation of all classes of society he
cast nativitiestold fortunesaided those who had money to throw away
upon the experiment to find the philosophers stoneprescribed remedies
for cows and pigs and aided in the recovery of stolen goods after
residing successively at nuremburg augsburg vienna and mindelheim he
retired in the year 1541 to saltzbourg and died in a state of abject
poverty in the hospital of that town
if this strange charlatan found hundreds of admirers during his life he
found thousands after his death a sect of paracelsists sprang up in
france and germany to perpetuate the extravagant doctrines of their
founder upon all the sciences and upon alchymy in particular the chief
leaders were bodenstein and dorneus the following is a summary of his
doctrine founded upon the supposed existence of the philosophers stone
it is worth preserving from its very absurdity and is altogether
unparalleled in the history of philosophy first of all he maintained
that the contemplation of the perfection of the deity sufficed to procure
all wisdom and knowledge that the bible was the key to the theory of all
diseases and that it was necessary to search into the apocalypse to know
the signification of magic medicine the man who blindly obeyed the will
of god and who succeeded in identifying himself with the celestial
intelligences possessed the philosophers stonehe could cure all
diseases and prolong life to as many centuries as he pleased it being by
the very same means that adam and the antediluvian patriarchs prolonged
theirs life was an emanation from the starsthe sun governed the heart
and the moon the brain jupiter governed the liver saturn the gall
mercury the lungs mars the bile and venus the loins in the stomach of
every human being there dwelt a demon or intelligence that was a sort of
alchymist in his way and mixed in their due proportions in his
crucible the various aliments that were sent into that grand laboratory
the belly40 he was proud of the title of magician and boasted that
he kept up a regular correspondence with galen from hell and that he
often summoned avicenna from the same regions to dispute with him on the
false notions he had promulgated respecting alchymy and especially
regarding potable gold and the elixir of life he imagined that gold could

george agricola
this alchymist was born in the province of misnia in 1494 his real name
was bauer meaning a husbandman which in accordance with the common
fashion of his age he latinised into agricola from his early youth he
delighted in the visions of the hermetic science ere he was sixteen he
longed for the great elixir which was to make him live for seven hundred
years and for the stone which was to procure him wealth to cheer him in
his multiplicity of days he published a small treatise upon the subject
at cologne in 1531 which obtained him the patronage of the celebrated
maurice duke of saxony after practising for some years as a physician at
joachimsthal in bohemia he was employed by maurice as superintendent of
the silver mines of chemnitz he led a happy life among the miners making
various experiments in alchymy while deep in the bowels of the earth he
acquired a great knowledge of metals and gradually got rid of his
extravagant notions about the philosophers stone the miners had no faith
in alchymy and they converted him to their way of thinking not only in
that but in other respects from their legends he became firmly convinced
that the bowels of the earth were inhabited by good and evil spirits and
that firedamp and other explosions sprang from no other causes than the
mischievous propensities of the latter he died in the year 1555 leaving
behind him the reputation of a very able and intelligent man
denis zachaire
autobiography written by a wise man who was once a fool is not only the
most instructive but the most delightful of reading denis zachaire an
alchymist of the sixteenth century has performed this task and left a
record of his folly and infatuation in pursuit of the philosophers stone
which well repays perusal he was born in the year 1510 of an ancient
family in guienne and was early sent to the university of bordeaux under
the care of a tutor to direct his studies unfortunately his tutor was a
searcher for the grand elixir and soon rendered his pupil as mad as
himself upon the subject with this introduction we will allow denis
zachaire to speak for himself and continue his narrative in his own
words i received from home says he the sum of two hundred crowns for
the expenses of myself and master but before the end of the year all our
money went away in the smoke of our furnaces my master at the same time
died of a fever brought on by the parching heat of our laboratory from
which he seldom or never stirred and which was scarcely less hot than the
arsenal of venice his death was the more unfortunate for me as my
parents took the opportunity of reducing my allowance and sending me only
sufficient for my board and lodging instead of the sum i required to
continue my operations in alchymy
to meet this difficulty and get out of leadingstrings i returned home
at the age of twentyfive and mortgaged part of my property for four
hundred crowns this sum was necessary to perform an operation of the
science which had been communicated to me by an italian at toulouse and
who as he said had proved its efficacy i retained this man in my
service that we might see the end of the experiment i then by means of
strong distillations tried to calcinate gold and silver but all my
labour was in vain the weight of the gold i drew out of my furnace was
diminished by onehalf since i put it in and my four hundred crowns were
very soon reduced to two hundred and thirty i gave twenty of these to my
italian in order that he might travel to milan where the author of the
receipt resided and ask him the explanation of some passages which we
thought obscure i remained at toulouse all the winter in the hope of his
return but i might have remained there till this day if i had waited for
him for i never saw his face again
in the succeeding summer there was a great plague which forced me to
quit the town i did not however lose sight of my work i went to
cahors where i remained six months and made the acquaintance of an old
man who was commonly known to the people as the philosopher a name
which in country places is often bestowed upon people whose only merit
is that they are less ignorant than their neighbours i shewed him my
collection of alchymical receipts and asked his opinion upon them he
picked out ten or twelve of them merely saying that they were better than
the others when the plague ceased i returned to toulouse and
recommenced my experiments in search of the stone i worked to such effect
that my four hundred crowns were reduced to one hundred and seventy
that i might continue my work on a safer method i made acquaintance in
1537 with a certain abb who resided in the neighbourhood he was smitten
with the same mania as myself and told me that one of his friends who
had followed to rome in the retinue of the cardinal darmagnac had sent
him from that city a new receipt which could not fail to transmute iron
and copper but which would cost two hundred crowns i provided half this
money and the abb the rest and we began to operate at our joint
expense as we required spirits of wine for our experiment i bought a tun
of excellent vin de gaillac i extracted the spirit and rectified it
several times we took a quantity of this into which we put four marks of
silver and one of gold that had been undergoing the process of calcination
for a month we put this mixture cleverly into a sort of hornshaped
vessel with another to serve as a retort and placed the whole apparatus
upon our furnace to produce congelation this experiment lasted a year
but not to remain idle we amused ourselves with many other less
important operations we drew quite as much profit from these as from our
great work
the whole of the year 1537 passed over without producing any change
whatever in fact we might have waited till doomsday for the congelation
of our spirits of wine however we made a projection with it upon some
heated quicksilver but all was in vain judge of our chagrin especially
of that of the abb who had already boasted to all the monks of his
monastery that they had only to bring the large pump which stood in a
corner of the cloister and he would convert it into gold but this ill
luck did not prevent us from persevering i once more mortgaged my
paternal lands for four hundred crowns the whole of which i determined to
devote to a renewal of my search for the great secret the abb
contributed the same sum and with these eight hundred crowns i proceeded
to paris a city more abounding with alchymists than any other in the
world resolved never to leave it until i had either found the
philosophers stone or spent all my money this journey gave the greatest
offence to all my relations and friends who imagining that i was fitted
to be a great lawyer were anxious that i should establish myself in that
profession for the sake of quietness i pretended at last that such was
my object
after travelling for fifteen days i arrived in paris on the 9th of
january 1539 i remained for a month almost unknown but i had no sooner
begun to frequent the amateurs of the science and visited the shops of
the furnacemakers than i had the acquaintance of more than a hundred
operative alchymists each of whom had a different theory and a different
mode of working some of them preferred cementation others sought the
universal alkahest or dissolvent and some of them boasted the great
efficacy of the essence of emery some of them endeavoured to extract
mercury from other metals to fix it afterwards and in order that each
of us should be thoroughly acquainted with the proceedings of the others
we agreed to meet somewhere every night and report progress we met
sometimes at the house of one and sometimes in the garret of another not
only on week days but on sundays and the great festivals of the church
ah one used to say if i had the means of recommencing this
experiment i should do something yes said another if my crucible
had not cracked i should have succeeded before now while a third
exclaimed with a sigh if i had but had a round copper vessel of
sufficient strength i would have fixed mercury with silver there was
not one among them who had not some excuse for his failure but i was deaf
to all their speeches i did not want to part with my money to any of
them remembering how often i had been the dupe of such promises
a greek at last presented himself and with him i worked a long time
uselessly upon nails made of cinnabar or vermilion i was also acquainted
with a foreign gentleman newly arrived in paris and often accompanied him
to the shops of the goldsmiths to sell pieces of gold and silver the
produce as he said of his experiments i stuck closely to him for a long
time in the hope that he would impart his secret he refused for a long
time but acceded at last on my earnest entreaty and i found that it was
nothing more than an ingenious trick i did not fail to inform my friend
the abb whom i had left at toulouse of all my adventures and sent him
among other matters a relation of the trick by which this gentleman
pretended to turn lead into gold the abb still imagined that i should
succeed at last and advised me to remain another year in paris where i
had made so good a beginning i remained there three years but
notwithstanding all my efforts i had no more success than i had had
elsewhere
i had just got to the end of my money when i received a letter from the
abb telling me to leave every thing and join him immediately at
toulouse i went accordingly and found that he had received letters from
the king of navarre grandfather of henry iv this prince was a great
lover of philosophy full of curiosity and had written to the abb that i
should visit him at pau and that he would give me three or four thousand
crowns if i would communicate the secret i had learned from the foreign
gentleman the abbs ears were so tickled with the four thousand crowns
that he let me have no peace night or day until he had fairly seen me on
the road to pau i arrived at that place in the month of may 1542 i
worked away and succeeded according to the receipt i had obtained when
i had finished to the satisfaction of the king he gave me the reward that
i expected although he was willing enough to do me further service he
was dissuaded from it by the lords of his court even by many of those who
had been most anxious that i should come he sent me then about my
business with many thanks saying that if there was any thing in his
kingdom which he could give mesuch as the produce of confiscations or
the likehe should be most happy i thought i might stay long enough for
these prospective confiscations and never get them at last and i
therefore determined to go back to my friend the abb
i learned that on the road between pau and toulouse there resided a
monk who was very skilful in all matters of natural philosophy on my
return i paid him a visit he pitied me very much and advised me with
much warmth and kindness of expression not to amuse myself any longer
with such experiments as these which were all false and sophistical but
that i should read the good books of the old philosophers where i might
not only find the true matter of the science of alchymy but learn also
the exact order of operations which ought to be followed i very much
approved of this wise advice but before i acted upon it i went back to
my abb of toulouse to give him an account of the eight hundred crowns
which we had had in common and at the same time share with him such
reward as i had received from the king of navarre if he was little
satisfied with the relation of my adventures since our first separation
he appeared still less satisfied when i told him i had formed a resolution
to renounce the search for the philosophers stone the reason was that he
thought me a good artist of our eight hundred crowns there remained but
one hundred and seventysix when i quitted the abb i went to my own
house with the intention of remaining there till i had read all the old
philosophers and of then proceeding to paris
i arrived in paris on the day after all saints of the year 1546 and
devoted another year to the assiduous study of great authors among
others the turba philosophorum of the good trevisan the remonstrance
of nature to the wandering alchymist by jean de meung and several
others of the best books but as i had no right principles i did not
well know what course to follow
at last i left my solitude not to see my former acquaintances the
adepts and operators but to frequent the society of true philosophers
among them i fell into still greater uncertainties being in fact
completely bewildered by the variety of operations which they shewed me
spurred on nevertheless by a sort of frenzy or inspiration i threw
myself into the works of raymond lulli and of arnold de villeneuve the
reading of these and the reflections i made upon them occupied me for
another year when i finally determined on the course i should adopt i
was obliged to wait however until i had mortgaged another very
considerable portion of my patrimony this business was not settled until
the beginning of lent 1549 when i commenced my operations i laid in a
stock of all that was necessary and began to work the day after easter
it was not however without some disquietude and opposition from my
friends who came about me one asking me what i was going to do and
whether i had not already spent money enough upon such follies another
assured me that if i bought so much charcoal i should strengthen the
suspicion already existing that i was a coiner of base money another
advised me to purchase some place in the magistracy as i was already a
doctor of laws my relations spoke in terms still more annoying to me and
even threatened that if i continued to make such a fool of myself they
would send a posse of policeofficers into my house and break all my
furnaces and crucibles into atoms i was wearied almost to death by this
continued persecution but i found comfort in my work and in the progress
of my experiment to which i was very attentive and which went on bravely
from day to day about this time there was a dreadful plague in paris
which interrupted all intercourse between man and man and left me as much
to myself as i could desire i soon had the satisfaction to remark the
progress and succession of the three colours which according to the
philosophers always prognosticate the approaching perfection of the work
i observed them distinctly one after the other and next year being
easter sunday 1550 i made the great trial some common quicksilver
which i put into a small crucible on the fire was in less than an hour
converted into very good gold you may judge how great was my joy but i
took care not to boast of it i returned thanks to god for the favour he
had shewn me and prayed that i might only be permitted to make such use
of it as would redound to his glory
on the following day i went towards toulouse to find the abb in
accordance with a mutual promise that we should communicate our
discoveries to each other on my way i called in to see the sage monk who
had assisted me with his counsels but i had the sorrow to learn that they
were both dead after this i would not return to my own home but retired
to another place to await one of my relations whom i had left in charge
of my estate i gave him orders to sell all that belonged to me as well
movable as immovableto pay my debts with the proceeds and divide all
the rest among those in any way related to me who might stand in need of
it in order that they might enjoy some share of the good fortune which
had befallen me there was a great deal of talk in the neighbourhood about
my precipitate retreat the wisest of my acquaintance imagining that
broken down and ruined by my mad expenses i sold my little remaining
property that i might go and hide my shame in distant countries
my relative already spoken of rejoined me on the 1st of july after
having performed all the business i had entrusted him with we took our
departure together to seek a land of liberty we first retired to
lausanne in switzerland when after remaining there for some time we
resolved to pass the remainder of our days in some of the most celebrated
cities of germany living quietly and without splendour
thus ends the story of denis zachaire as written by himself he has not
been so candid at its conclusion as at its commencement and has left the
world in doubt as to his real motives for pretending that he had
discovered the philosophers stone it seems probable that the sentence he
puts into the mouths of his wisest acquaintances was the true reason of
his retreat that he was in fact reduced to poverty and hid his shame
in foreign countries nothing further is known of his life and his real
name has never yet been discovered he wrote a work on alchymy entitled
the true natural philosophy of metals
dr dee and edward kelly
john dee and edward kelly claim to be mentioned together having been so
long associated in the same pursuits and undergone so many strange
vicissitudes in each others society dee was altogether a wonderful man
and had he lived in an age when folly and superstition were less rife he
would with the same powers which he enjoyed have left behind him a
bright and enduring reputation he was born in london in the year 1527
and very early manifested a love for study at the age of fifteen he was
sent to cambridge and delighted so much in his books that he passed
regularly eighteen hours every day among them of the other six he
devoted four to sleep and two for refreshment such intense application
did not injure his health and could not fail to make him one of the first
scholars of his time unfortunately however he quitted the mathematics
and the pursuits of true philosophy to indulge in the unprofitable
reveries of the occult sciences he studied alchymy astrology and magic
and thereby rendered himself obnoxious to the authorities at cambridge to
avoid persecution he was at last obliged to retire to the university of
louvain the rumours of sorcery that were current respecting him rendering
his longer stay in england not altogether without danger he found at
louvain many kindred spirits who had known cornelius agrippa while he
resided among them and by whom he was constantly entertained with the
wondrous deeds of that great master of the hermetic mysteries from their
conversation he received much encouragement to continue the search for the
philosophers stone which soon began to occupy nearly all his thoughts
illustration dr dee
he did not long remain on the continent but returned to england in 1551
being at that time in the twentyfourth year of his age by the influence
of his friend sir john cheek he was kindly received at the court of king
edward vi and rewarded it is difficult to say for what with a pension
of one hundred crowns he continued for several years to practise in
london as an astrologer casting nativities telling fortunes and
pointing out lucky and unlucky days during the reign of queen mary he got
into trouble being suspected of heresy and charged with attempting
marys life by means of enchantments he was tried for the latter offence
and acquitted but was retained in prison on the former charge and left
to the tender mercies of bishop bonner he had a very narrow escape from
being burned in smithfield but he somehow or other contrived to persuade
that fierce bigot that his orthodoxy was unimpeachable and was set at
liberty in 1555
on the accession of elizabeth a brighter day dawned upon him during her
retirement at woodstock her servants appear to have consulted him as to
the time of marys death which circumstance no doubt first gave rise to
the serious charge for which he was brought to trial they now came to
consult him more openly as to the fortunes of their mistress and robert
dudley the celebrated earl of leicester was sent by command of the queen
herself to know the most auspicious day for her coronation so great was
the favour he enjoyed that some years afterwards elizabeth condescended
to pay him a visit at his house in mortlake to view his museum of
curiosities and when he was ill sent her own physician to attend upon
him
astrology was the means whereby he lived and he continued to practise it
with great assiduity but his heart was in alchymy the philosophers
stone and the elixir of life haunted his daily thoughts and his nightly
dreams the talmudic mysteries which he had also deeply studied
impressed him with the belief that he might hold converse with spirits
and angels and learn from them all the mysteries of the universe holding
the same idea as the then obscure sect of the rosicrucians some of whom
he had perhaps encountered in his travels in germany he imagined that by
means of the philosophers stone he could summon these kindly spirits at
his will by dint of continually brooding upon the subject his
imagination became so diseased that he at last persuaded himself that an
angel appeared to him and promised to be his friend and companion as long
as he lived he relates that one day in november 1582 while he was
engaged in fervent prayer the window of his museum looking towards the
west suddenly glowed with a dazzling light in the midst of which in all
his glory stood the great angel uriel awe and wonder rendered him
speechless but the angel smiling graciously upon him gave him a crystal
of a convex form and told him that whenever he wished to hold converse
with the beings of another sphere he had only to gaze intently upon it
and they would appear in the crystal and unveil to him all the secrets of
futurity41 thus saying the angel disappeared dee found from
experience of the crystal that it was necessary that all the faculties of
the soul should be concentrated upon it otherwise the spirits did not
appear he also found that he could never recollect the conversations he
had with the angels he therefore determined to communicate the secret to
another person who might converse with the spirit while he dee sat in
another part of the room and took down in writing the revelations which
they made
    41 the crystal alluded to appears to have been a black stone
         or piece of polished coal the following account of it is
         given in the supplement to grangers biographical history
         the black stone into which dee used to call his
         spirits was in the collection of the earls of peterborough
         from whence it came to lady elizabeth germaine it was next
         the property of the late duke of argyle and is now mr
         walpoles it appears upon examination to be nothing more
         than a polished piece of cannel coal but this is what butler
         means when he says
            kelly did all his feats upon
             the devils lookingglassa stone
illustration shewstone of dr dee in the british museum
he had at this time in his service as his assistant one edward kelly
who like himself was crazy upon the subject of the philosophers stone
there was this difference however between them that while dee was more
of an enthusiast than an impostor kelly was more of an impostor than an
enthusiast in early life he was a notary and had the misfortune to lose
both his ears for forgery this mutilation degrading enough in any man
was destructive to a philosopher kelly therefore lest his wisdom should
suffer in the worlds opinion wore a black skullcap which fitting
close to his head and descending over both his cheeks not only concealed
his loss but gave him a very solemn and oracular appearance so well did
he keep his secret that even dee with whom he lived so many years
appears never to have discovered it kelly with this character was just
the man to carry on any piece of roguery for his own advantage or to
nurture the delusions of his master for the same purpose no sooner did
dee inform him of the visit he had received from the glorious uriel than
kelly expressed such a fervour of belief that dees heart glowed with
delight he set about consulting his crystal forthwith and on the 2d of
december 1581 the spirits appeared and held a very extraordinary
discourse with kelly which dee took down in writing the curious reader
may see this farrago of nonsense among the harleian mss in the british
museum the later consultations were published in a folio volume in 1659
by dr meric casaubon under the title of a true and faithful relation of
what passed between dr john dee and some spirits tending had it
succeeded to a general alteration of most states and kingdoms in the
world42
    42 lilly the astrologer in his life written by himself
         frequently tells of prophecies delivered by the angels in a
         manner similar to the angels of dr dee he says the
         prophecies were not given vocally by the angels but by
         inspection of the crystal in types and figures or by
         apparition the circular way where at some distance the
         angels appear representing by forms shapes and creatures
         what is demanded it is very rare yea even in our days
         quoth that wiseacre for any operator or master to hear the
         angels speak articulately when they do speak it is like
         the irish much in the throat
the fame of these wondrous colloquies soon spread over the country and
even reached the continent dee at the same time pretended to be in
possession of the elixir vit which he stated he had found among the
ruins of glastonbury abbey in somersetshire people flocked from far and
near to his house at mortlake to have their nativities cast in preference
to visiting astrologers of less renown they also longed to see a man who
according to his own account would never die altogether he carried on a
very profitable trade but spent so much in drugs and metals to work out
some peculiar process of transmutation that he never became rich
about this time there came into england a wealthy polish nobleman named
albert laski count palatine of siradz his object was principally he
said to visit the court of queen elizabeth the fame of whose glory and
magnificence had reached him in distant poland elizabeth received this
flattering stranger with the most splendid hospitality and appointed her
favourite leicester to shew him all that was worth seeing in england he
visited all the curiosities of london and westminster and from thence
proceeded to oxford and cambridge that he might converse with some of the
great scholars whose writings shed lustre upon the land of their birth he
was very much disappointed at not finding dr dee among them and told the
earl of leicester that he would not have gone to oxford if he had known
that dee was not there the earl promised to introduce him to the great
alchymist on their return to london and the pole was satisfied a few
days afterwards the earl and laski being in the antechamber of the queen
awaiting an audience of her majesty dr dee arrived on the same errand
and was introduced to the pole43 an interesting conversation ensued
which ended by the stranger inviting himself to dine with the astrologer
at his house at mortlake dee returned home in some tribulation for he
found he had not money enough without pawning his plate to entertain
count laski and his retinue in a manner becoming their dignity in this
emergency he sent off an express to the earl of leicester stating frankly
the embarrassment he laboured under and praying his good offices in
representing the matter to her majesty elizabeth immediately sent him a
present of twenty pounds
    43 albert laski son of jaroslav was palatine of siradz and
         afterwards of sendomir and chiefly contributed to the
         election of henry of valois the third of france to the
         throne of poland and was one of the delegates who went to
         france in order to announce to the new monarch his elevation
         to the sovereignty of poland after the deposition of henry
         albert laski voted for maximilian of austria in 1583 he
         visited england when queen elizabeth received him with great
         distinction the honours which were shewn him during his
         visit to oxford by the especial command of the queen were
         equal to those rendered to sovereign princes his
         extraordinary prodigality rendered his enormous wealth
         insufficient to defray his expenses and he therefore became
         a zealous adept in alchymy and took from england to poland
         with him two known alchymistscount valerian krasinskis
         historical sketch of the reformation in poland
on the appointed day count laski came attended by a numerous retinue and
expressed such open and warm admiration of the wonderful attainments of
his host that dee turned over in his own mind how he could bind
irretrievably to his interests a man who seemed so well inclined to become
his friend long acquaintance with kelly had imbued him with all the
roguery of that personage and he resolved to make the pole pay dearly for
his dinner he found out before many days that he possessed great estates
in his own country as well as great influence but that an extravagant
disposition had reduced him to temporary embarrassment he also discovered
that he was a firm believer in the philosophers stone and the water of
life he was therefore just the man upon whom an adventurer might fasten
himself kelly thought so too and both of them set to work to weave a
web in the meshes of which they might firmly entangle the rich and
credulous stranger they went very cautiously about it first throwing out
obscure hints of the stone and the elixir and finally of the spirits by
means of whom they could turn over the pages of the book of futurity and
read the awful secrets inscribed therein laski eagerly implored that he
might be admitted to one of their mysterious interviews with uriel and the
angels but they knew human nature too well to accede at once to the
request to the counts entreaties they only replied by hints of the
difficulty or impropriety of summoning the spirits in the presence of a
stranger or of one who might perchance have no other motive than the
gratification of a vain curiosity but they only meant to whet the edge of
his appetite by this delay and would have been sorry indeed if the count
had been discouraged to shew how exclusively the thoughts both of dee and
kelly were fixed upon their dupe at this time it is only necessary to
read the introduction to their first interview with the spirits related
in the volume of dr casaubon the entry made by dee under the date of
the 25th of may 1583 says that when the spirit appeared to them i
john dee and e k edward kelly sat together conversing of that noble
polonian albertus laski his great honour here with us obtained and of
his great liking among all sorts of the people no doubt they were
discussing how they might make the most of the noble polonian and
concocting the fine story with which they afterwards excited his
curiosity and drew him firmly within their toils suddenly says dee
as they were thus employed there seemed to come out of the oratory a
spiritual creature like a pretty girl of seven or nine years of age
attired on her head with her hair rolled up before and hanging down
behind with a gown of silk of changeable red and green and with a
train she seemed to play up and down and seemed to go in and out behind
the books and as she seemed to go between them the books displaced
themselves and made way for her
with such tales as these they lured on the pole from day to day and at
last persuaded him to be a witness of their mysteries whether they played
off any optical delusions upon him or whether by the force of a strong
imagination he deluded himself does not appear but certain it is that
he became a complete tool in their hands and consented to do whatever
they wished him kelly at these interviews placed himself at a certain
distance from the wondrous crystal and gazed intently upon it while dee
took his place in a corner ready to set down the prophecies as they were
uttered by the spirits in this manner they prophesied to the pole that he
should become the fortunate possessor of the philosophers stone that he
should live for centuries and be chosen king of poland in which capacity
he should gain many great victories over the saracens and make his name
illustrious over all the earth for this purpose it was necessary
however that laski should leave england and take them with him together
with their wives and families that he should treat them all sumptuously
and allow them to want for nothing laski at once consented and very
shortly afterwards they were all on the road to poland
it took them upwards of four months to reach the counts estates in the
neighbourhood of cracow in the mean time they led a pleasant life and
spent money with an unsparing hand when once established in the counts
palace they commenced the great hermetic operation of transmuting iron
into gold laski provided them with all necessary materials and aided
them himself with his knowledge of alchymy but somehow or other the
experiment always failed at the very moment it ought to have succeeded
and they were obliged to recommence operations on a grander scale but the
hopes of laski were not easily extinguished already in idea the
possessor of countless millions he was not to be cast down for fear of
present expenses he thus continued from day to day and from month to
month till he was at last obliged to sell a portion of his
deeplymortgaged estates to find aliment for the hungry crucibles of dee
and kelly and the no less hungry stomachs of their wives and families it
was not till ruin stared him in the face that he awoke from his dream of
infatuation too happy even then to find that he had escaped utter
beggary thus restored to his senses his first thought was how to rid
himself of his expensive visitors not wishing to quarrel with them he
proposed that they should proceed to prague well furnished with letters
of recommendation to the emperor rudolph our alchymists too plainly saw
that nothing more was to be made of the almost destitute count laski
without hesitation therefore they accepted the proposal and set out
forthwith to the imperial residence they had no difficulty on their
arrival at prague in obtaining an audience of the emperor they found him
willing enough to believe that such a thing as the philosophers stone
existed and flattered themselves that they had made a favourable
impression upon him but from some cause or otherperhaps the look of
low cunning and quackery upon the face of kellythe emperor conceived no
very high opinion of their abilities he allowed them however to remain
for some months at prague feeding themselves upon the hope that he would
employ them but the more he saw of them the less he liked them and
when the popes nuncio represented to him that he ought not to countenance
such heretic magicians he gave orders that they should quit his dominions
within fourandtwenty hours it was fortunate for them that so little
time was given them for had they remained six hours longer the nuncio
had received orders to procure a perpetual dungeon or the stake for them
not knowing well whither to direct their steps they resolved to return to
cracow where they had still a few friends but by this time the funds
they had drawn from laski were almost exhausted and they were many days
obliged to go dinnerless and supperless they had great difficulty to keep
their poverty a secret from the world but they managed to bear privation
without murmuring from a conviction that if the fact were known it would
militate very much against their pretensions nobody would believe that
they were possessors of the philosophers stone if it were once suspected
that they did not know how to procure bread for their subsistence they
still gained a little by casting nativities and kept starvation at arms
length till a new dupe rich enough for their purposes dropped into
their toils in the shape of a royal personage having procured an
introduction to stephen king of poland they predicted to him that the
emperor rudolph would shortly be assassinated and that the germans would
look to poland for his successor as this prediction was not precise
enough to satisfy the king they tried their crystal again and a spirit
appeared who told them that the new sovereign of germany would be stephen
of poland stephen was credulous enough to believe them and was once
present when kelly held his mystic conversations with the shadows of his
crystal he also appears to have furnished them with money to carry on
their experiments in alchymy but he grew tired at last of their broken
promises and their constant drains upon his pocket and was on the point
of discarding them with disgrace when they met with another dupe to whom
they eagerly transferred their services this was count rosenberg a
nobleman of large estates at trebona in bohemia so comfortable did they
find themselves in the palace of this munificent patron that they
remained nearly four years with him faring sumptuously and having an
almost unlimited command of his money the count was more ambitious than
avaricious he had wealth enough and did not care for the philosophers
stone on account of the gold but of the length of days it would bring
him they had their predictions accordingly all ready framed to suit his
character they prophesied that he should be chosen king of poland and
promised moreover that he should live for five hundred years to enjoy
his dignity provided always that he found them sufficient money to carry
on their experiments
but now while fortune smiled upon them while they revelled in the
rewards of successful villany retributive justice came upon them in a
shape they had not anticipated jealousy and mistrust sprang up between
the two confederates and led to such violent and frequent quarrels that
dee was in constant fear of exposure kelly imagined himself a much
greater personage than dee measuring most likely by the standard of
impudent roguery and was displeased that on all occasions and from all
persons dee received the greater share of honour and consideration he
often threatened to leave dee to shift for himself and the latter who
had degenerated into the mere tool of his more daring associate was
distressed beyond measure at the prospect of his desertion his mind was
so deeply imbued with superstition that he believed the rhapsodies of
kelly to be in a great measure derived from his intercourse with angels
and he knew not where in the whole world to look for a man of depth and
wisdom enough to succeed him as their quarrels every day became more and
more frequent dee wrote letters to queen elizabeth to secure a favourable
reception on his return to england whither he intended to proceed if
kelly forsook him he also sent her a round piece of silver which he
pretended he had made of a portion of brass cut out of a warmingpan he
afterwards sent her the warmingpan also that she might convince herself
that the piece of silver corresponded exactly with the hole which was cut
into the brass while thus preparing for the worst his chief desire was
to remain in bohemia with count rosenberg who treated him well and
reposed much confidence in him neither had kelly any great objection to
remain but a new passion had taken possession of his breast and he was
laying deep schemes to gratify it his own wife was illfavoured and
illnatured dees was comely and agreeable and he longed to make an
exchange of partners without exciting the jealousy or shocking the
morality of dee this was a difficult matter but to a man like kelly who
was as deficient in rectitude and right feeling as he was full of
impudence and ingenuity the difficulty was not insurmountable he had
also deeply studied the character and the foibles of dee and he took his
measures accordingly the next time they consulted the spirits kelly
pretended to be shocked at their language and refused to tell dee what
they had said dee insisted and was informed that they were henceforth to
have their wives in common dee a little startled inquired whether the
spirits might not mean that they were to live in common harmony and
goodwill kelly tried again with apparent reluctance and said the
spirits insisted upon the literal interpretation the poor fanatic dee
resigned himself to their will but it suited kellys purpose to appear
coy a little longer he declared that the spirits must be spirits not of
good but of evil and refused to consult them any more he thereupon took
his departure saying that he would never return
dee thus left to himself was in sore trouble and distress of mind he
knew not on whom to fix as the successor to kelly for consulting the
spirits but at last chose his son arthur a boy of eight years of age he
consecrated him to this service with great ceremony and impressed upon
the childs mind the dignified and awful nature of the duties he was
called upon to perform but the poor boy had neither the imagination the
faith nor the artifice of kelly he looked intently upon the crystal as
he was told but could see nothing and hear nothing at last when his
eyes ached he said he could see a vague indistinct shadow but nothing
more dee was in despair the deception had been carried on so long that
he was never so happy as when he fancied he was holding converse with
superior beings and he cursed the day that had put estrangement between
him and his dear friend kelly this was exactly what kelly had foreseen
and when he thought the doctor had grieved sufficiently for his absence
he returned unexpectedly and entered the room where the little arthur was
in vain endeavouring to distinguish something in the crystal dee in
entering this circumstance in his journal ascribes this sudden return to
a miraculous fortune and a divine fate and goes on to record that
kelly immediately saw the spirits which had remained invisible to little
arthur one of these spirits reiterated the previous command that they
should have their wives in common kelly bowed his head and submitted and
dee in all humility consented to the arrangement
this was the extreme depth of the wretched mans degradation in this
manner they continued to live for three or four months when new quarrels
breaking out they separated once more this time their separation was
final kelly taking the elixir which he had found in glastonbury abbey
proceeded to prague forgetful of the abrupt mode in which he had
previously been expelled from that city almost immediately after his
arrival he was seized by order of the emperor rudolph and thrown into
prison he was released after some months confinement and continued for
five years to lead a vagabond life in germany telling fortunes at one
place and pretending to make gold at another he was a second time thrown
into prison on a charge of heresy and sorcery and he then resolved if
ever he obtained his liberty to return to england he soon discovered
that there was no prospect of this and that his imprisonment was likely
to be for life he twisted his bedclothes into a rope one stormy night
in february 1595 and let himself down from the window of his dungeon
situated at the top of a very high tower being a corpulent man the rope
gave way and he was precipitated to the ground he broke two of his ribs
and both his legs and was otherwise so much injured that he expired a
few days afterwards
dee for a while had more prosperous fortune the warmingpan he had sent
to queen elizabeth was not without effect he was rewarded soon after
kelly had left him with an invitation to return to england his pride
which had been sorely humbled sprang up again to its pristine dimensions
and he set out from bohemia with a train of attendants becoming an
ambassador how he procured the money does not appear unless from the
liberality of the rich bohemian rosenberg or perhaps from his plunder he
travelled with three coaches for himself and family and three wagons to
carry his baggage each coach had four horses and the whole train was
protected by a guard of four and twenty soldiers this statement may be
doubted but it is on the authority of dee himself who made it on oath
before the commissioners appointed by elizabeth to inquire into his
circumstances on his arrival in england he had an audience of the queen
who received him kindly as far as words went and gave orders that he
should not be molested in his pursuits of chemistry and philosophy a man
who boasted of the power to turn baser metals into gold could not
thought elizabeth be in want of money and she therefore gave him no more
substantial marks of her approbation than her countenance and protection
thrown thus unexpectedly upon his own resources dee began in earnest the
search for the philosophers stone he worked incessantly among his
furnaces retorts and crucibles and almost poisoned himself with
deleterious fumes he also consulted his miraculous crystal but the
spirits appeared not to him he tried one bartholomew to supply the place
of the invaluable kelly but he being a man of some little probity and of
no imagination at all the spirits would not hold any communication with
him dee then tried another pretender to philosophy of the name of
hickman but had no better fortune the crystal had lost its power since
the departure of its great high priest from this quarter then dee could
get no information on the stone or elixir of the alchymists and all his
efforts to discover them by other means were not only fruitless but
expensive he was soon reduced to great distress and wrote piteous
letters to the queen praying relief he represented that after he left
england with count laski the mob had pillaged his house at mortlake
accusing him of being a necromancer and a wizard and had broken all his
furniture burned his library consisting of four thousand rare volumes
and destroyed all the philosophical instruments and curiosities in his
museum for this damage he claimed compensation and furthermore stated
that as he had come to england by the queens command she ought to pay
the expenses of his journey elizabeth sent him small sums of money at
various times but dee still continuing his complaints a commission was
appointed to inquire into his circumstances he finally obtained a small
appointment as chancellor of st pauls cathedral which he exchanged in
1595 for the wardenship of the college at manchester he remained in this
capacity till 1602 or 1603 when his strength and intellect beginning to
fail him he was compelled to resign he retired to his old dwelling at
mortlake in a state not far removed from actual want supporting himself
as a common fortuneteller and being often obliged to sell or pawn his
books to procure a dinner james i was often applied to on his behalf
but he refused to do any thing for him it may be said to the discredit of
this king that the only reward he would grant the indefatigable stowe in
his days of old age and want was the royal permission to beg but no one
will blame him for neglecting such a quack as john dee he died in 1608
in the eightyfirst year of his age and was buried at mortlake
the cosmopolite
many disputes have arisen as to the real name of the alchymist who wrote
several works under the above designation the general opinion is that he
was a scotsman named seton and that by a fate very common to alchymists
who boasted too loudly of their powers of transmutation he ended his days
miserably in a dungeon into which he was thrown by a german potentate
until he made a million of gold to pay his ransom by some he has been
confounded with michael sendivog or sendivogius a pole a professor of
the same art who made a great noise in europe at the commencement of the
seventeenth century lenglet du fresnoy who is in general well informed
with respect to the alchymists inclines to the belief that these
personages were distinct and gives the following particulars of the
cosmopolite extracted from george morhoff in his epistola ad
langelottum and other writers
about the year 1600 one jacob haussen a dutch pilot was shipwrecked on
the coast of scotland a gentleman named alexander seton put off in a
boat and saved him from drowning and afterwards entertained him
hospitably for many weeks at his house on the shore haussen saw that he
was addicted to the pursuits of chemistry but no conversation on the
subject passed between them at the time about a year and a half
afterwards haussen being then at home at enkhuysen in holland received
a visit from his former host he endeavoured to repay the kindness that
had been shewn him and so great a friendship arose between them that
seton on his departure offered to make him acquainted with the great
secret of the philosophers stone in his presence the scotsman transmuted
a great quantity of base metal into pure gold and gave it him as a mark
of his esteem seton then took leave of his friend and travelled into
germany at dresden he made no secret of his wonderful powers having it
is said performed transmutation successfully before a great assemblage of
the learned men of that city the circumstance coming to the ears of the
duke or elector of saxony he gave orders for the arrest of the alchymist
he caused him to be imprisoned in a high tower and set a guard of forty
men to watch that he did not escape and that no strangers were admitted
to his presence the unfortunate seton received several visits from the
elector who used every art of persuasion to make him divulge his secret
seton obstinately refused either to communicate his secret or to make any
gold for the tyrant on which he was stretched upon the rack to see if
the argument of torture would render him more tractable the result was
still the same neither hope of reward nor fear of anguish could shake
him for several months he remained in prison subjected alternately to a
sedative and a violent regimen till his health broke and he wasted away
almost to a skeleton
there happened at that time to be in dresden a learned pole named michael
sendivogius who had wasted a good deal of his time and substance in the
unprofitable pursuits of alchymy he was touched with pity for the hard
fate and admiration for the intrepidity of seton and determined if
possible to aid him in escaping from the clutch of his oppressor he
requested the electors permission to see the alchymist and obtained it
with some difficulty he found him in a state of great wretchedness shut
up from the light of day in a noisome dungeon and with no better couch or
fare than those allotted to the worst of criminals seton listened eagerly
to the proposal of escape and promised the generous pole that he would
make him richer than an eastern monarch if by his means he were liberated
sendivogius immediately commenced operations he sold some property which
he possessed near cracow and with the proceeds led a merry life at
dresden he gave the most elegant suppers to which he regularly invited
the officers of the guard and especially those who did duty at the prison
of the alchymist he insinuated himself at last into their confidence and
obtained free ingress to his friend as often as he pleased pretending
that he was using his utmost endeavours to conquer his obstinacy and worm
his secret out of him when their project was ripe a day was fixed upon
for the grand attempt and sendivogius was ready with a postchariot to
convey him with all speed into poland by drugging some wine which he
presented to the guards of the prison he rendered them so drowsy that he
easily found means to scale a wall unobserved with seton and effect his
escape setons wife was in the chariot awaiting him having safely in her
possession a small packet of a black powder which was in fact the
philosophers stone or ingredient for the transmutation of iron and
copper into gold they all arrived in safety at cracow but the frame of
seton was so wasted by torture of body and starvation to say nothing of
the anguish of mind he had endured that he did not long survive he died
in cracow in 1603 or 1604 and was buried under the cathedral church of
that city such is the story related of the author of the various works
which bear the name of the cosmopolite a list of them may be found in the
third volume of the history of the hermetic philosophy
sendivogius
on the death of seton sendivogius married his widow hoping to learn from
her some of the secrets of her deceased lord in the art of transmutation
the ounce of black powder stood him however in better service for the
alchymists say that by its means he converted great quantities of
quicksilver into the purest gold it is also said that he performed this
experiment successfully before the emperor rudolph ii at prague and
that the emperor to commemorate the circumstance caused a marble tablet
to be affixed to the wall of the room in which it was performed bearing
this inscription faciat hoc quispiam alius quod fecit sendivogius
polonus m desnoyers secretary to the princess mary of gonzaga queen
of poland writing from warsaw in 1651 says that he saw this tablet
which existed at that time and was often visited by the curious
the afterlife of sendivogius is related in a latin memoir of him by one
brodowski his steward and is inserted by pierre borel in his treasure
of gaulish antiquities the emperor rudolph according to this authority
was so well pleased with his success that he made him one of his
councillors of state and invited him to fill a station in the royal
household and inhabit the palace but sendivogius loved his liberty and
refused to become a courtier he preferred to reside on his own
patrimonial estate of gravarna where for many years he exercised a
princely hospitality his philosophic powder which his steward says was
red and not black he kept in a little box of gold and with one grain of
it he could make five hundred ducats or a thousand rixdollars he
generally made his projection upon quicksilver when he travelled he gave
this box to his steward who hung it round his neck by a gold chain next
his skin but the greatest part of the powder he used to hide in a secret
place cut into the step of his chariot he thought that if attacked at
any time by robbers they would not search such a place as that when he
anticipated any danger he would dress himself in his valets clothes
and mounting the coachbox put the valet inside he was induced to take
these precautions because it was no secret that he possessed the
philosophers stone and many unprincipled adventurers were on the watch
for an opportunity to plunder him a german prince whose name brodowski
has not thought fit to chronicle served him a scurvy trick which ever
afterwards put him on his guard this prince went on his knees to
sendivogius and entreated him in the most pressing terms to satisfy his
curiosity by converting some quicksilver into gold before him
sendivogius wearied by his importunity consented upon a promise of
inviolable secrecy after his departure the prince called a german
alchymist named muhlenfels who resided in his house and told him all
that had been done muhlenfels entreated that he might have a dozen
mounted horsemen at his command that he might instantly ride after the
philosopher and either rob him of all his powder or force from him the
secret of making it the prince desired nothing better muhlenfels being
provided with twelve men well mounted and armed pursued sendivogius in
hot haste he came up with him at a lonely inn by the roadside just as
he was sitting down to dinner he at first endeavoured to persuade him to
divulge the secret but finding this of no avail he caused his
accomplices to strip the unfortunate sendivogius and tie him naked to one
of the pillars of the house he then took from him his golden box
containing a small quantity of the powder a manuscript book on the
philosophers stone a golden medal with its chain presented to him by
the emperor rudolph and a rich cap ornamented with diamonds of the
value of one hundred thousand rixdollars with this booty he decamped
leaving sendivogius still naked and firmly bound to the pillar his
servants had been treated in a similar manner but the people of the inn
released them all as soon as the robbers were out of sight
sendivogius proceeded to prague and made his complaint to the emperor an
express was instantly sent off to the prince with orders that he should
deliver up muhlenfels and all his plunder the prince fearful of the
emperors wrath caused three large gallows to be erected in his
courtyard on the highest of which he hanged muhlenfels with another
thief on each side of him he thus propitiated the emperor and got rid of
an ugly witness against himself he sent back at the same time the
bejewelled hat the medal and chain and the treatise upon the
philosophers stone which had been stolen from sendivogius as regarded
the powder he said he had not seen it and knew nothing about it
this adventure made sendivogius more prudent he would no longer perform
the process of transmutation before any strangers however highly
recommended he pretended also to be very poor and sometimes lay in bed
for weeks together that people might believe he was suffering from some
dangerous malady and could not therefore by any possibility be the
owner of the philosophers stone he would occasionally coin false money
and pass it off as gold preferring to be esteemed a cheat rather than a
successful alchymist
many other extraordinary tales are told of this personage by his steward
brodowski but they are not worth repeating he died in 1636 aged upwards
of eighty and was buried in his own chapel at gravarna several works
upon alchymy have been published under his name
the rosicrucians
it was during the time of the lastmentioned author that the sect of the
rosicrucians first began to create a sensation in europe the influence
which they exercised upon opinion during their brief career and the
permanent impression which they have left upon european literature claim
for them especial notice before their time alchymy was but a grovelling
delusion and theirs is the merit of having spiritualised and refined it
they also enlarged its sphere and supposed the possession of the
philosophers stone to be not only the means of wealth but of health and
happiness and the instrument by which man could command the services of
superior beings control the elements to his will defy the obstructions
of time and space and acquire the most intimate knowledge of all the
secrets of the universe wild and visionary as they were they were not
without their uses if it were only for having purged the superstitions of
europe of the dark and disgusting forms with which the monks had peopled
it and substituted in their stead a race of mild graceful and
beneficent beings
they are said to have derived their name from christian rosencreutz or
rosecross a german philosopher who travelled in the holy land towards
the close of the fourteenth century while dangerously ill at a place
called damcar he was visited by some learned arabs who claimed him as
their brother in science and unfolded to him by inspiration all the
secrets of his past life both of thought and of action they restored him
to health by means of the philosophers stone and afterwards instructed
him in all their mysteries he returned to europe in 1401 being then only
twentythree years of age and drew a chosen number of his friends around
him whom he initiated into the new science and bound by solemn oaths to
keep it secret for a century he is said to have lived eightythree years
after this period and to have died in 1484
many have denied the existence of such a personage as rosencreutz and
have fixed the origin of this sect at a much later epoch the first
dawning of it they say is to be found in the theories of paracelsus and
the dreams of dr dee who without intending it became the actual
though never the recognised founders of the rosicrucian philosophy it is
now difficult and indeed impossible to determine whether dee and
paracelsus obtained their ideas from the then obscure and unknown
rosicrucians or whether the rosicrucians did but follow and improve upon
them certain it is that their existence was never suspected till the
year 1605 when they began to excite attention in germany no sooner were
their doctrines promulgated than all the visionaries paracelsists and
alchymists flocked around their standard and vaunted rosencreutz as the
new regenerator of the human race michael mayer a celebrated physician
of that day and who had impaired his health and wasted his fortune in
searching for the philosophers stone drew up a report of the tenets and
ordinances of the new fraternity which was published at cologne in the
year 1615 they asserted in the first place that the meditations of
their founders surpassed every thing that had ever been imagined since the
creation of the world without even excepting the revelations of the
deity that they were destined to accomplish the general peace and
regeneration of man before the end of the world arrived that they
possessed all wisdom and piety in a supreme degree that they possessed
all the graces of nature and could distribute them among the rest of
mankind according to their pleasure that they were subject to neither
hunger nor thirst nor disease nor old age nor to any other
inconvenience of nature that they knew by inspiration and at the first
glance every one who was worthy to be admitted into their society that
they had the same knowledge then which they would have possessed if they
had lived from the beginning of the world and had been always acquiring
it that they had a volume in which they could read all that ever was or
ever would be written in other books till the end of time that they could
force to and retain in their service the most powerful spirits and
demons that by the virtue of their songs they could attract pearls and
precious stones from the depths of the sea or the bowels of the earth
that god had covered them with a thick cloud by means of which they could
shelter themselves from the malignity of their enemies and that they
could thus render themselves invisible from all eyes that the first eight
brethren of the rosecross had power to cure all maladies that by
means of the fraternity the triple diadem of the pope would be reduced
into dust that they only admitted two sacraments with the ceremonies of
the primitive church renewed by them that they recognised the fourth
monarchy and the emperor of the romans as their chief and the chief of all
christians that they would provide him with more gold their treasures
being inexhaustible than the king of spain had ever drawn from the golden
regions of eastern and western ind this was their confession of faith
their rules of conduct were six in number and as follow
first that in their travels they should gratuitously cure all diseases
secondly that they should always dress in conformity to the fashion of
the country in which they resided
thirdly that they should once every year meet together in the place
appointed by the fraternity or send in writing an available excuse
fourthly that every brother whenever he felt inclined to die should
choose a person worthy to succeed him
fifthly that the words rosecross should be the marks by which they
should recognise each other
sixthly that their fraternity should be kept secret for six times twenty
years
they asserted that these laws had been found inscribed in a golden book in
the tomb of rosencreutz and that the six times twenty years from his
death expired in 1604 they were consequently called upon from that time
forth to promulgate their doctrine for the welfare of mankind44
    44 the following legend of the tomb of rosencreutz written by
         eustace budgell appears in no 379 of the spectatora
         certain person having occasion to dig somewhat deep in the
         ground where this philosopher lay interred met with a small
         door having a wall on each side of it his curiosity and
         the hope of finding some hidden treasure soon prompted him
         to force open the door he was immediately surprised by a
         sudden blaze of light and discovered a very fair vault at
         the upper end of it was a statue of a man in armour sitting
         by a table and leaning on his left arm he held a truncheon
         in his right hand and had a lamp burning before him the man
         had no sooner set one foot within the vault than the statue
         erecting itself from its leaning posture stood bolt upright
         and upon the fellows advancing another step lifted up the
         truncheon in his right hand the man still ventured a third
         step when the statue with a furious blow broke the lamp
         into a thousand pieces and left his guest in sudden
         darkness upon the report of this adventure the country
         people came with lights to the sepulchre and discovered that
         the statue which was made of brass was nothing more than a
         piece of clockwork that the floor of the vault was all
         loose and underlaid with several springs which upon any
         mans entering naturally produced that which had happened
         rosicreucius say his disciples made use of this method to
         shew the world that he had reinvented the everburning lamps
         of the ancients though he was resolved no one should reap
         any advantage from the discovery
for eight years these enthusiasts made converts in germany but they
excited little or no attention in other parts of europe at last they made
their appearance in paris and threw all the learned all the credulous
and all the lovers of the marvellous into commotion in the beginning of
march 1623 the good folks of that city when they arose one morning were
surprised to find all their walls placarded with the following singular
manifesto
we the deputies of the principal college of the brethren of the
rosecross have taken up our abode visible and invisible in this city
by the grace of the most high towards whom are turned the hearts of the
just we shew and teach without books or signs and speak all sorts of
languages in the countries where we dwell to draw mankind our fellows
from error and from death
for a long time this strange placard was the sole topic of conversation in
all public places some few wondered but the greater number only laughed
at it in the course of a few weeks two books were published which raised
the first alarm respecting this mysterious society whose dwellingplace
no one knew and no members of which had ever been seen the first was
called a history of the frightful compacts entered into between the devil
and the pretended invisibles with their damnable instructions the
deplorable ruin of their disciples and their miserable end the other
was called an examination of the new and unknown cabala of the brethren
of the rosecross who have lately inhabited the city of paris with the
history of their manners the wonders worked by them and many other
particulars
these books sold rapidly every one was anxious to know something of this
dreadful and secret brotherhood the badauds of paris were so alarmed
that they daily expected to see the archenemy walking in propria
persona among them it was said in these volumes that the rosicrucian
society consisted of sixandthirty persons in all who had renounced
their baptism and hope of resurrection that it was not by means of good
angels as they pretended that they worked their prodigies but that it
was the devil who gave them power to transport themselves from one end of
the world to the other with the rapidity of thought to speak all
languages to have their purses always full of money however much they
might spend to be invisible and penetrate into the most secret places
in spite of fastenings of bolts and bars and to be able to tell the past
and future these thirtysix brethren were divided into bands or
companies six of them only had been sent on the mission to paris six to
italy six to spain six to germany four to sweden and two into
switzerland two into flanders two into lorraine and two into franche
comt it was generally believed that the missionaries to france resided
somewhere in the marais du temple that quarter of paris soon acquired a
bad name and people were afraid to take houses in it lest they should be
turned out by the six invisibles of the rosecross it was believed by the
populace and by many others whose education should have taught them
better that persons of a mysterious aspect used to visit the inns and
hotels of paris and eat of the best meats and drink of the best wines
and then suddenly melt away into thin air when the landlord came with the
reckoning that gentle maidens who went to bed alone often awoke in the
night and found men in bed with them of shape more beautiful than the
grecian apollo who immediately became invisible when an alarm was raised
it was also said that many persons found large heaps of gold in their
houses without knowing from whence they came all paris was in alarm no
man thought himself secure of his goods no maiden of her virginity or
wife of her chastity while these rosicrucians were abroad in the midst
of the commotion a second placard was issued to the following effect
if any one desires to see the brethren of the rosecross from curiosity
only he will never communicate with us but if his will really induces
him to inscribe his name in the register of our brotherhood we who can
judge of the thoughts of all men will convince him of the truth of our
promises for this reason we do not publish to the world the place of our
abode thought alone in unison with the sincere will of those who
desire to know us is sufficient to make us known to them and them to
us
though the existence of such a society as that of the rosecross was
problematical it was quite evident that somebody or other was concerned
in the promulgation of these placards which were stuck up on every wall
in paris the police endeavoured in vain to find out the offenders and
their want of success only served to increase the perplexity of the
public the church very soon took up the question and the abb gaultier
a jesuit wrote a book to prove that by their enmity to the pope they
could be no other than disciples of luther sent to promulgate his heresy
their very name he added proved that they were heretics a cross
surmounted by a rose being the heraldic device of the archheretic
luther one garasse said they were a confraternity of drunken impostors
and that their name was derived from the garland of roses in the form of
a cross hung over the tables of taverns in germany as the emblem of
secrecy and from whence was derived the common saying when one man
communicated a secret to another that it was said under the rose
others interpreted the letters frc to mean not brethren of the
rosecross but fratres roris cocti or brothers of boiled dew and
explained this appellation by alleging that they collected large
quantities of morning dew and boiled it in order to extract a very
valuable ingredient in the composition of the philosophers stone and the
water of life
the fraternity thus attacked defended themselves as well as they were
able they denied that they used magic of any kind or that they consulted
the devil they said they were all happy that they had lived more than a
century and expected to live many centuries more and that the intimate
knowledge which they possessed of all nature was communicated to them by
god himself as a reward for their piety and utter devotion to his service
those were in error who derived their name from a cross of roses or
called them drunkards to set the world right on the first point they
reiterated that they derived their name from christian rosencreutz their
founder and to answer the latter charge they repeated that they knew not
what thirst was and had higher pleasures than those of the palate they
did not desire to meddle with the politics or religion of any man or set
of men although they could not help denying the supremacy of the pope
and looking upon him as a tyrant many slanders they said had been
repeated respecting them the most unjust of which was that they indulged
in carnal appetites and under the cloak of their invisibility crept
into the chambers of beautiful maidens they asserted on the contrary
that the first vow they took on entering the society was a vow of
chastity and that any one among them who transgressed in that particular
would immediately lose all the advantages he enjoyed and be exposed once
more to hunger woe disease and death like other men so strongly did
they feel on the subject of chastity that they attributed the fall of
adam solely to his want of this virtue besides defending themselves in
this manner they entered into a further confession of their faith they
discarded for ever all the old tales of sorcery and witchcraft and
communion with the devil they said there were no such horrid unnatural
and disgusting beings as the incubi and succubi and the innumerable
grotesque imps that men had believed in for so many ages man was not
surrounded with enemies like these but with myriads of beautiful and
beneficent beings all anxious to do him service the air was peopled with
sylphs the water with undines or naiads the bowels of the earth with
gnomes and the fire with salamanders all these beings were the friends
of man and desired nothing so much as that men should purge themselves of
all uncleanness and thus be enabled to see and converse with them they
possessed great power and were unrestrained by the barriers of space or
the obstructions of matter but man was in one particular their superior
he had an immortal soul and they had not they might however become
sharers in mans immortality if they could inspire one of that race with
the passion of love towards them hence it was the constant endeavour of
the female spirits to captivate the admiration of men and of the male
gnomes sylphs salamanders and undines to be beloved by a woman the
object of this passion in returning their love imparted a portion of
that celestial fire the soul and from that time forth the beloved became
equal to the lover and both when their allotted course was run entered
together into the mansions of felicity these spirits they said watched
constantly over mankind by night and day dreams omens and presentiments
were all their works and the means by which they gave warning of the
approach of danger but though so well inclined to befriend man for their
own sakes the want of a soul rendered them at times capricious and
revengeful they took offence on slight causes and heaped injuries
instead of benefits on the heads of those who extinguished the light of
reason that was in them by gluttony debauchery and other appetites of
the body
the excitement produced in paris by the placards of the brotherhood and
the attacks of the clergy wore itself away after a few months the stories
circulated about them became at last too absurd even for that age of
absurdity and men began to laugh once more at those invisible gentlemen
and their fantastic doctrines gabriel naud at that conjuncture brought
out his avis  la france sur les frres de la rosecroix in which he
very successfully exposed the folly of the new sect this work though not
well written was well timed it quite extinguished the rosicrucians of
france and after that year little more was heard of them swindlers in
different parts of the country assumed the name at times to cloak their
depredations and now and then one of them was caught and hanged for his
too great ingenuity in enticing pearls and precious stones from the
pockets of other people into his own or for passing off lumps of gilded
brass for pure gold made by the agency of the philosophers stone with
these exceptions oblivion shrouded them
the doctrine was not confined to a sphere so narrow as france alone it
still nourished in germany and drew many converts in england the latter
countries produced two great masters in the persons of jacob bhmen and
robert fluddpretended philosophers of whom it is difficult to say which
was the more absurd and extravagant it would appear that the sect was
divided into two classesthe brothers rose crucis who devoted
themselves to the wonders of this sublunary sphere and the brothers
aure crucis who were wholly occupied in the contemplation of things
divine fludd belonged to the first class and bhmen to the second fludd
may be called the father of the english rosicrucians and as such merits a
conspicuous niche in the temple of folly
he was born in the year 1574 at milgate in kent and was the son of sir
thomas fludd treasurer of war to queen elizabeth he was originally
intended for the army but he was too fond of study and of a disposition
too quiet and retiring to shine in that sphere his father would not
therefore press him to adopt a course of life for which he was unsuited
and encouraged him in the study of medicine for which he early manifested
a partiality at the age of twentyfive he proceeded to the continent and
being fond of the abstruse the marvellous and the incomprehensible he
became an ardent disciple of the school of paracelsus whom he looked upon
as the regenerator not only of medicine but of philosophy he remained
six years in italy france and germany storing his mind with fantastic
notions and seeking the society of enthusiasts and visionaries on his
return to england in 1605 he received the degree of doctor of medicine
from the university of oxford and began to practise as a physician in
london
he soon made himself conspicuous he latinised his name from robert fludd
into robertus  fluctibus and began the promulgation of many strange
doctrines he avowed his belief in the philosophers stone the water of
life and the universal alkahest and maintained that there were but two
principles of all thingswhich were condensation the boreal or
northern virtue and rarefaction the southern or austral virtue a number
of demons he said ruled over the human frame whom he arranged in their
places in a rhomboid every disease had its peculiar demon who produced
it which demon could only be combated by the aid of the demon whose place
was directly opposite to his in the rhomboidal figure of his medical
notions we shall have further occasion to speak in another part of this
book when we consider him in his character as one of the first founders
of the magnetic delusion and its offshoot animal magnetism which has
created so much sensation in our own day
as if the doctrines already mentioned were not wild enough he joined the
rosicrucians as soon as they began to make a sensation in europe and
succeeded in raising himself to high consideration among them the
fraternity having been violently attacked by several german authors and
among others by libavius fludd volunteered a reply and published in
1616 his defence of the rosicrucian philosophy under the title of the
apologia compendiaria fraternitatem de roseacruce suspicionis et infami
maculis aspersam abluens this work immediately procured him great renown
upon the continent and he was henceforth looked upon as one of the
highpriests of the sect of so much importance was he considered that
keppler and gassendi thought it necessary to refute him and the latter
wrote a complete examination of his doctrine mersenne also the friend of
descartes and who had defended that philosopher when accused of having
joined the rosicrucians attacked dr  fluctibus as he preferred to be
called and shewed the absurdity of the brothers of the rosecross in
general and of dr  fluctibus in particular fluctibus wrote a long
reply in which he called mersenne an ignorant calumniator and reiterated
that alchymy was a profitable science and the rosicrucians worthy to be
the regenerators of the world this book was published at frankfort and
was entitled summum bonum quod est magi cabal alchimi fratrum
rosecrucis verorum et adversus mersenium calumniatorem besides this
he wrote several other works upon alchymy a second answer to libavius
upon the rosicrucians and many medical works he died in london in 1637
after his time there was some diminution of the sect in england they
excited but little attention and made no effort to bring themselves into
notice occasionally some obscure and almost incomprehensible work made
its appearance to shew the world that the folly was not extinguished
eugenius philalethes a noted alchymist who has veiled his real name
under this assumed one translated the fame and confession of the
brethren of the rosie cross which was published in london in 1652 a few
years afterwards another enthusiast named john heydon wrote two works
on the subject the one entitled the wise mans crown or the glory of
the rosie cross and the other the holy guide leading the way to unite
art and nature with the rosie crosse uncovered neither of these
attracted much notice a third book was somewhat more successful it was
called a new method of rosicrucian physic by john heydon the servant of
god and the secretary of nature a few extracts will shew the ideas of
the english rosicrucians about this period its author was an attorney
practising to use his own words at westminster hall all term times as
long as he lived and in the vacations devoting himself to alchymical and
rosicrucian meditation in his preface called by him an apologue for an
epilogue he enlightens the public upon the true history and tenets of his
sect moses elias and ezekiel were he says the most ancient masters of
the rosicrucian philosophy those few then existing in england and the
rest of europe were as the eyes and ears of the great king of the
universe seeing and hearing all things seraphically illuminated
companions of the holy company of unbodied souls and immortal angels
turning themselves proteuslike into any shape and having the power of
working miracles the most pious and abstracted brethren could slack the
plague in cities silence the violent winds and tempests calm the rage of
the sea and rivers walk in the air frustrate the malicious aspect of
witches cure all diseases and turn all metals into gold he had known in
his time two famous brethren of the rosie cross named walfourd and
williams who had worked miracles in his sight and taught him many
excellent predictions of astrology and earthquakes i desired one of
these to tell me says he whether my complexion were capable of the
society of my good genius when i see you again said he which was when
he pleased to come to me for i knew not where to go to him i will tell
you when i saw him afterwards he said you should pray to god for a
good and holy man can offer no greater or more acceptable service to god
than the oblation of himselfhis soul he said also that the good genii
were the benign eyes of god running to and fro in the world and with
love and pity beholding the innocent endeavours of harmless and
singlehearted men ever ready to do them good and to help them
heydon held devoutly true that dogma of the rosicrucians which said that
neither eating nor drinking was necessary to men he maintained that any
one might exist in the same manner as that singular people dwelling near
the source of the ganges of whom mention was made in the travels of his
namesake sir christopher heydon who had no mouths and therefore could
not eat but lived by the breath of their nostrils except when they took
a far journey and then they mended their diet with the smell of flowers
he said that in really pure air there was a fine foreign fatness with
which it was sprinkled by the sunbeams and which was quite sufficient for
the nourishment of the generality of mankind those who had enormous
appetites he had no objection to see take animal food since they could
not do without it but he obstinately insisted that there was no necessity
why they should eat it if they put a plaster of nicelycooked meat upon
their epigastrium it would be sufficient for the wants of the most robust
and voracious they would by that means let in no diseases as they did at
the broad and common gate the mouth as any one might see by example of
drink for all the while a man sat in water he was never athirst he had
known he said many rosicrucians who by applying wine in this manner
had fasted for years together in fact quoth heydon we may easily fast
all our life though it be three hundred years without any kind of meat
and so cut off all danger of disease
this sage philosopher further informed his wondering contemporaries that
the chiefs of the doctrine always carried about with them to their place
of meeting their symbol called the rc which was an ebony cross
flourished and decked with roses of gold the cross typifying christs
sufferings upon the cross for our sins and the roses of gold the glory
and beauty of his resurrection this symbol was carried alternately to
mecca mount calvary mount sinai haran and to three other places which
must have been in midair called cascle apamia and chaulateau
virissa caunuch where the rosicrucian brethren met when they pleased
and made resolution of all their actions they always took their pleasures
in one of these places where they resolved all questions of whatsoever
had been done was done or should be done in the world from the
beginning to the end thereof and these he concludes are the men
called rosicrucians
towards the end of the seventeenth century more rational ideas took
possession of the sect which still continued to boast of a few members
they appear to have considered that contentment was the true philosophers
stone and to have abandoned the insane search for a mere phantom of the
imagination addison in the spectator45 gives an account of his
conversation with a rosicrucian from which it may be inferred that the
sect had grown wiser in their deeds though in their talk they were as
foolish as ever i was once says he engaged in discourse with a
rosicrucian about the great secret he talked of the secret as of a spirit
which lived within an emerald and converted every thing that was near it
to the highest perfection that it was capable of it gives a lustre
says he to the sun and water to the diamond it irradiates every metal
and enriches lead with all the properties of gold it heightens smoke into
flame flame into light and light into glory he further added that a
single ray of it dissipates pain and care and melancholy from the person
on whom it falls in short says he its presence naturally changes
every place into a kind of heaven after he had gone on for some time in
this unintelligible cant i found that he jumbled natural and moral ideas
together into the same discourse and that his great secret was nothing
else but content

jacob bhmen
it is now time to speak of jacob bhmen who thought he could discover the
secret of the transmutation of metals in the bible and who invented a
strange heterogeneous doctrine of mingled alchymy and religion and
founded upon it the sect of the aureacrucians he was born at grlitz in
upper lusatia in 1575 and followed till his thirtieth year the
occupation of a shoemaker in this obscurity he remained with the
character of a visionary and a man of unsettled mind until the
promulgation of the rosicrucian philosophy in his part of germany toward
the year 1607 or 1608 from that time he began to neglect his leather and
buried his brain under the rubbish of metaphysics the works of paracelsus
fell into his hands and these with the reveries of the rosicrucians so
completely engrossed his attention that he abandoned his trade
altogether sinking at the same time from a state of comparative
independence into poverty and destitution but he was nothing daunted by
the miseries and privations of the flesh his mind was fixed upon the
beings of another sphere and in thought he was already the new apostle of
the human race in the year 1612 after a meditation of four years he
published his first work entitled aurora or the rising of the sun
embodying the ridiculous notions of paracelsus and worse confounding the
confusion of that writer the philosophers stone might he contended be
discovered by a diligent search of the old and new testaments and more
especially of the apocalypse which alone contained all the secrets of
alchymy he contended that the divine grace operated by the same rules
and followed the same methods that the divine providence observed in the
natural world and that the minds of men were purged from their vices and
corruptions in the very same manner that metals were purified from their
dross namely by fire
besides the sylphs gnomes undines and salamanders he acknowledged
various ranks and orders of demons he pretended to invisibility and
absolute chastity he also said that if it pleased him he could abstain
for years from meat and drink and all the necessities of the body it is
needless however to pursue his follies any further he was reprimanded
for writing this work by the magistrates of grlitz and commanded to
leave the pen alone and stick to his wax that his family might not become
chargeable to the parish he neglected this good advice and continued his
studies burning minerals and purifying metals one day and mystifying the
word of god on the next he afterwards wrote three other works as
sublimely ridiculous as the first the one was entitled metallurgia and
has the slight merit of being the least obscure of his compositions
another was called the temporal mirror of eternity and the last his
theosophy revealed full of allegories and metaphors
                all strange and geason
    devoid of sense and ordinary reason
bhmen died in 1624 leaving behind him a considerable number of admiring
disciples many of them became during the seventeenth century as
distinguished for absurdity as their master amongst whom may be mentioned
gifftheil wendenhagen john jacob zimmermann and abraham frankenberg
their heresy rendered them obnoxious to the church of rome and many of
them suffered long imprisonment and torture for their faith one named
kuhlmann was burned alive at moscow in 1684 on a charge of sorcery
bhmens works were translated into english and published many years
afterwards by an enthusiast named william law
mormius
peter mormius a notorious alchymist and contemporary of bhmen
endeavoured in 1630 to introduce the rosicrucian philosophy into
holland he applied to the statesgeneral to grant him a public audience
that he might explain the tenets of the sect and disclose a plan for
rendering holland the happiest and richest country on the earth by means
of the philosophers stone and the service of the elementary spirits the
statesgeneral wisely resolved to have nothing to do with him he
thereupon determined to shame them by printing his book which he did at
leyden the same year it was entitled the book of the most hidden secrets
of nature and was divided into three parts the first treating of
perpetual motion the second of the transmutation of metals and the
third of the universal medicine he also published some german works
upon the rosicrucian philosophy at frankfort in 1617
poetry and romance are deeply indebted to the rosicrucians for many a
graceful creation the literature of england france and germany contains
hundreds of sweet fictions whose machinery has been borrowed from their
daydreams the delicate ariel of shakspeare stands preeminent among
the number from the same source pope drew the airy tenants of belindas
dressingroom in his charming rape of the lock and la motte fouqu
the beautiful and capricious waternymph undine around whom he has thrown
more grace and loveliness and for whose imaginary woes he has excited
more sympathy than ever were bestowed on a supernatural being sir walter
scott also endowed the white lady of avenel with many of the attributes of
the undines or watersprites german romance and lyrical poetry teem with
allusions to sylphs gnomes undines and salamanders and the french have
not been behind in substituting them in works of fiction for the more
cumbrous mythology of greece and rome the sylphs more especially have
been the favourites of the bards and have become so familiar to the
popular mind as to be in a manner confounded with that other race of
ideal beings the fairies who can boast of an antiquity much more
venerable in the annals of superstition having these obligations to the
rosicrucians no lover of poetry can wish however absurd they were that
such a sect of philosophers had never existed
borri
just at the time that michael mayer was making known to the world the
existence of such a body as the rosicrucians there was born in italy a
man who was afterwards destined to become the most conspicuous member of
the fraternity the alchymic mania never called forth the ingenuity of a
more consummate or more successful impostor than joseph francis borri he
was born in 1616 according to some authorities and in 1627 according to
others at milan where his father the signor branda borri practised as
a physician at the age of sixteen joseph was sent to finish his education
at the jesuits college in rome where he distinguished himself by his
extraordinary memory he learned every thing to which he applied himself
with the utmost ease in the most voluminous works no fact was too minute
for his retention and no study was so abstruse but that he could master
it but any advantages he might have derived from this facility were
neutralised by his ungovernable passions and his love of turmoil and
debauchery he was involved in continual difficulty as well with the
heads of the college as with the police of rome and acquired so bad a
character that years could not remove it by the aid of his friends he
established himself as a physician in rome and also obtained some
situation in the popes household in one of his fits of studiousness he
grew enamoured of alchymy and determined to devote his energies to the
discovery of the philosophers stone of unfortunate propensities he had
quite sufficient besides this to bring him to poverty his pleasures
were as expensive as his studies and both were of a nature to destroy his
health and ruin his fair fame at the age of thirtyseven he found that he
could not live by the practice of medicine and began to look about for
some other employment he became in 1653 private secretary to the
marquis di mirogli the minister of the archduke of innsprck at the court
of rome he continued in this capacity for two years leading however
the same abandoned life as heretofore frequenting the society of
gamesters debauchees and loose women involving himself in disgraceful
street quarrels and alienating the patrons who were desirous to befriend
him
all at once a sudden change was observed in his conduct the abandoned
rake put on the outward sedateness of a philosopher the scoffing sinner
proclaimed that he had forsaken his evil ways and would live thenceforth
a model of virtue to his friends this reformation was as pleasing as it
was unexpected and borri gave obscure hints that it had been brought
about by some miraculous manifestation of a superior power he pretended
that he held converse with beneficent spirits that the secrets of god and
nature were revealed to him and that he had obtained possession of the
philosophers stone like his predecessor jacob bhmen he mixed up
religious questions with his philosophical jargon and took measures for
declaring himself the founder of a new sect this at rome itself and in
the very palace of the pope was a hazardous proceeding and borri just
awoke to a sense of it in time to save himself from the dungeons of the
castle of st angelo he fled to innsprck where he remained about a
year and then returned to his native city of milan
illustration innspruck
the reputation of his great sanctity had gone before him and he found
many persons ready to attach themselves to his fortunes all who were
desirous of entering into the new communion took an oath of poverty and
relinquished their possessions for the general good of the fraternity
borri told them that he had received from the archangel michael a heavenly
sword upon the hilt of which were engraven the names of the seven
celestial intelligences whoever shall refuse said he to enter into
my new sheepfold shall be destroyed by the papal armies of whom god has
predestined me to be the chief to those who follow me all joy shall be
granted i shall soon bring my chemical studies to a happy conclusion by
the discovery of the philosophers stone and by this means we shall all
have as much gold as we desire i am assured of the aid of the angelic
hosts and more especially of the archangel michaels when i began to
walk in the way of the spirit i had a vision of the night and was
assured by an angelic voice that i should become a prophet in sign of it
i saw a palmtree surrounded with all the glory of paradise the angels
come to me whenever i call and reveal to me all the secrets of the
universe the sylphs and elementary spirits obey me and fly to the
uttermost ends of the world to serve me and those whom i delight to
honour by force of continually repeating such stories as these borri
soon found himself at the head of a very considerable number of adherents
as he figures in these pages as an alchymist and not as a religious
sectarian it will be unnecessary to repeat the doctrines which he taught
with regard to some of the dogmas of the church of rome and which exposed
him to the fierce resentment of the papal authority they were to the full
as ridiculous as his philosophical pretensions as the number of his
followers increased he appears to have cherished the idea of becoming one
day a new mahomet and of founding in his native city of milan a
monarchy and religion of which he should be the king and the prophet he
had taken measures in the year 1658 for seizing the guards at all the
gates of that city and formally declaring himself the monarch of the
milanese just as he thought the plan ripe for execution it was
discovered twenty of his followers were arrested and he himself managed
with the utmost difficulty to escape to the neutral territory of
switzerland where the papal displeasure could not reach him
the trial of his followers commenced forthwith and the whole of them were
sentenced to various terms of imprisonment borris trial proceeded in his
absence and lasted for upwards of two years he was condemned to death as
a heretic and sorcerer in 1661 and was burned in effigy in rome by the
common hangman
borri in the mean time lived quietly in switzerland indulging himself
in railing at the inquisition and its proceedings he afterwards went to
strasbourg intending to fix his residence in that town he was received
with great cordiality as a man persecuted for his religious opinions and
withal a great alchymist he found that sphere too narrow for his aspiring
genius and retired in the same year to the more wealthy city of
amsterdam he there hired a magnificent house established an equipage
which eclipsed in brilliancy those of the richest merchants and assumed
the title of excellency where he got the money to live in this expensive
style was long a secret the adepts in alchymy easily explained it after
their fashion sensible people were of opinion that he had come by it in a
less wonderful manner for it was remembered that among his unfortunate
disciples in milan there were many rich men who in conformity with one
of the fundamental rules of the sect had given up all their earthly
wealth into the hands of their founder in whatever manner the money was
obtained borri spent it in holland with an unsparing hand and was looked
up to by the people with no little respect and veneration he performed
several able cures and increased his reputation so much that he was
vaunted as a prodigy he continued diligently the operations of alchymy
and was in daily expectation that he should succeed in turning the
inferior metals into gold this hope never abandoned him even in the
worst extremity of his fortunes and in his prosperity it led him into the
most foolish expenses but he could not long continue to live so
magnificently upon the funds he had brought from italy and the
philosophers stone though it promised all for the wants of the morrow
never brought any thing for the necessities of today he was obliged in a
few months to retrench by giving up his large house his gilded coach and
valuable bloodhorses his liveried domestics and his luxurious
entertainments with this diminution of splendour came a diminution of
renown his cures did not appear so miraculous when he went out on foot
to perform them as they had seemed when his excellency had driven to a
poor mans door in his carriage with six horses he sank from a prodigy
into an ordinary man his great friends shewed him the cold shoulder and
his humble flatterers carried their incense to some other shrine borri
now thought it high time to change his quarters with this view he
borrowed money wherever he could get it and succeeded in obtaining two
hundred thousand florins from a merchant named de meer to aid as he
said in discovering the water of life he also obtained six diamonds of
great value on pretence that he could remove the flaws from them without
diminishing their weight with this booty he stole away secretly by night
and proceeded to hamburgh
on his arrival in that city he found the celebrated christina the
exqueen of sweden he procured an introduction to her and requested her
patronage in his endeavour to discover the philosophers stone she gave
him some encouragement but borri fearing that the merchants of
amsterdam who had connexions in hamburgh might expose his delinquencies
if he remained in the latter city passed over to copenhagen and sought
the protection of frederick iii the king of denmark
this prince was a firm believer in the transmutation of metals being in
want of money he readily listened to the plans of an adventurer who had
both eloquence and ability to recommend him he provided borri with the
means to make experiments and took a great interest in the progress of
his operations he expected every month to possess riches that would buy
peru and when he was disappointed accepted patiently the excuses of
borri who upon every failure was always ready with some plausible
explanation he became in time much attached to him and defended him from
the jealous attacks of his courtiers and the indignation of those who
were grieved to see their monarch the easy dupe of a charlatan borri
endeavoured by every means in his power to find aliment for this good
opinion his knowledge of medicine was useful to him in this respect and
often stood between him and disgrace he lived six years in this manner at
the court of frederick but that monarch dying in 1670 he was left without
a protector
as he had made more enemies than friends in copenhagen and had nothing to
hope from the succeeding sovereign he sought an asylum in another
country he went first to saxony but met so little encouragement and
encountered so much danger from the emissaries of the inquisition that he
did not remain there many months anticipating nothing but persecution in
every country that acknowledged the spiritual authority of the pope he
appears to have taken the resolution to dwell in turkey and turn
mussulman on his arrival at the hungarian frontier on his way to
constantinople he was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the
conspiracy of the counts nadasdi and frangipani which had just been
discovered in vain he protested his innocence and divulged his real name
and profession he was detained in prison and a letter despatched to the
emperor leopold to know what should be done with him the star of his
fortunes was on the decline the letter reached leopold at an unlucky
moment the popes nuncio was closeted with his majesty and he no sooner
heard the name of joseph francis borri than he demanded him as a prisoner
of the holy see the request was complied with and borri closely
manacled was sent under an escort of soldiers to the prison of the
inquisition at rome he was too much of an impostor to be deeply tinged
with fanaticism and was not unwilling to make a public recantation of his
heresies if he could thereby save his life when the proposition was made
to him he accepted it with eagerness his punishment was to be commuted
into the hardly less severe one of perpetual imprisonment but he was too
happy to escape the clutch of the executioner at any price and he made
the amende honorable in face of the assembled multitudes of rome on the
27th of october 1672 he was then transferred to the prisons of the castle
of st angelo where he remained till his death twentythree years
afterwards it is said that towards the close of his life considerable
indulgence was granted him that he was allowed to have a laboratory and
to cheer the solitude of his dungeon by searching for the philosophers
stone queen christina during her residence at rome frequently visited
the old man to converse with him upon chemistry and the doctrines of the
rosicrucians she even obtained permission that he should leave his prison
occasionally for a day or two and reside in her palace she being
responsible for his return to captivity she encouraged him to search for
the great secret of the alchymists and provided him with money for the
purpose it may well be supposed that borri benefited most by this
acquaintance and that christina got nothing but experience it is not
sure that she gained even that for until her dying day she was convinced
of the possibility of finding the philosophers stone and ready to assist
any adventurer either zealous or impudent enough to pretend to it
after borri had been about eleven years in confinement a small volume was
published at cologne entitled the key of the cabinet of the chevalier
joseph francis borri in which are contained many curious letters upon
chemistry and other sciences written by him together with a memoir of
his life this book contained a complete exposition of the rosicrucian
philosophy and afforded materials to the abb de villars for his
interesting count de gabalis which excited so much attention at the
close of the seventeenth century
borri lingered in the prison of st angelo till 1695 when he died in his
eightieth year besides the key of the cabinet written originally in
copenhagen in 1666 for the edification of king frederick iii he
published a work upon alchymy and the secret sciences under the title of
the mission of romulus to the romans
inferior alchymists of the seventeenth century
besides the pretenders to the philosophers stone whose lives have been
already narrated this and the preceding century produced a great number
of writers who inundated literature with their books upon the subject in
fact most of the learned men of that age had some faith in it van
helmont borrichius kircher boerhaave and a score of others though not
professed alchymists were fond of the science and countenanced its
professors helvetius the grandfather of the celebrated philosopher of
the same name asserts that he saw an inferior metal turned into gold by a
stranger at the hague in 1666 he says that sitting one day in his
study a man who was dressed as a respectable burgher of north holland
and very modest and simple in his appearance called upon him with the
intention of dispelling his doubts relative to the philosophers stone he
asked helvetius if he thought he should know that rare gem if he saw it
to which helvetius replied that he certainly should not the burgher
immediately drew from his pocket a small ivory box containing three
pieces of metal of the colour of brimstone and extremely heavy and
assured helvetius that of them he could make as much as twenty tons of
gold helvetius informs us that he examined them very attentively and
seeing that they were very brittle he took the opportunity to scrape off
a small portion with his thumbnail he then returned them to the
stranger with an entreaty that he would perform the process of
transmutation before him the stranger replied that he was not allowed to
do so and went away after his departure helvetius procured a crucible
and a portion of lead into which when in a state of fusion he threw the
stolen grain from the philosophers stone he was disappointed to find
that the grain evaporated altogether leaving the lead in its original
state
some weeks afterwards when he had almost forgotten the subject he
received another visit from the stranger he again entreated him to
explain the processes by which he pretended to transmute lead the
stranger at last consented and informed him that one grain was
sufficient but that it was necessary to envelope it in a ball of wax
before throwing it on the molten metal otherwise its extreme volatility
would cause it to go off in vapour they tried the experiment and
succeeded to their hearts content helvetius repeated the experiment
alone and converted six ounces of lead into very pure gold
the fame of this event spread all over the hague and all the notable
persons of the town flocked to the study of helvetius to convince
themselves of the fact helvetius performed the experiment again in the
presence of the prince of orange and several times afterwards until he
exhausted the whole of the powder he had received from the stranger from
whom it is necessary to state he never received another visit nor did he
ever discover his name or condition in the following year helvetius
published his golden calf46 in which he detailed the above
circumstances
    46 vitulus aureus quem mundus adorat et orat in quo tractatur
         de natur miraculo transmutandi metalla hag 1667
about the same time the celebrated father kircher published his
subterranean world in which he called the alchymists a congregation of
knaves and impostors and their science a delusion he admitted that he
had himself been a diligent labourer in the field and had only come to
this conclusion after mature consideration and repeated fruitless
experiments all the alchymists were in arms immediately to refute this
formidable antagonist one solomon de blauenstein was the first to grapple
with him and attempted to convict him of wilful misrepresentation by
recalling to his memory the transmutations by sendivogius before the
emperor frederick iii and the elector of mayence all performed within a
recent period zwelfer and glauber also entered into the dispute and
attributed the enmity of father kircher to spite and jealousy against
adepts who had been more successful than himself
it was also pretended that gustavus adolphus transmuted a quantity of
quicksilver into pure gold the learned borrichius relates that he saw
coins which had been struck of this gold and lenglet du fresnoy deposes
to the same circumstance in the travels of monconis the story is told
in the following manner a merchant of lubeck who carried on but little
trade but who knew how to change lead into very good gold gave the king
of sweden a lingot which he had made weighing at least one hundred
pounds the king immediately caused it to be coined into ducats and
because he knew positively that its origin was such as had been stated to
him he had his own arms graven upon the one side and emblematical
figures of mercury and venus on the other i continued monconis have one
of these ducats in my possession and was credibly informed that after
the death of the lubeck merchant who had never appeared very rich a sum
of no less than one million seven hundred thousand crowns was found in his
coffers47
    47 voyages de monconis tome ii p 379
such stories as these confidently related by men high in station tended
to keep up the infatuation of the alchymists in every country of europe
it is astonishing to see the number of works which were written upon the
subject during the seventeenth century alone and the number of clever men
who sacrificed themselves to the delusion gabriel de castaigne a monk of
the order of st francis attracted so much notice in the reign of louis
xiii that that monarch secured him in his household and made him his
grand almoner he pretended to find the elixir of life and louis expected
by his means to have enjoyed the crown for a century van helmont also
pretended to have once performed with success the process of transmuting
quicksilver and was in consequence invited by the emperor rudolph ii to
fix his residence at the court of vienna glauber the inventor of the
salts which still bear his name and who practised as a physician at
amsterdam about the middle of the seventeenth century established a
public school in that city for the study of alchymy and gave lectures
himself upon the science john joachim becher of spire acquired great
reputation at the same period and was convinced that much gold might be
made out of flintstones by a peculiar process and the aid of that grand
and incomprehensible substance the philosophers stone he made a
proposition to the emperor leopold of austria to aid him in these
experiments but the hope of success was too remote and the present
expense too great to tempt that monarch and he therefore gave becher
much of his praise but none of his money becher afterwards tried the
statesgeneral of holland with no better success
with regard to the innumerable tricks by which impostors persuaded the
world that they had succeeded in making gold and of which so many stories
were current about this period a very satisfactory report was read by m
geoffroy the elder at the sitting of the royal academy of sciences at
paris on the 15th of april 1722 as it relates principally to the
alchymic cheats of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the following
abridgment of it may not be out of place in this portion of our history
the instances of successful transmutation were so numerous and apparently
so well authenticated that nothing short of so able an exposure as that
of m geoffroy could disabuse the public mind the trick to which they
oftenest had recourse was to use a doublebottomed crucible the under
surface being of iron or copper and the upper one of wax painted to
resemble the same metal between the two they placed as much gold or
silver dust as was necessary for their purpose they then put in their
lead quicksilver or other ingredients and placed their pot upon the
fire of course when the experiment was concluded they never failed to
find a lump of gold at the bottom the same result was produced in many
other ways some of them used a hollow wand filled with gold or silver
dust and stopped at the ends with wax or butter with this they stirred
the boiling metal in their crucibles taking care to accompany the
operation with many ceremonies to divert attention from the real purpose
of the manoeuvre they also drilled holes in lumps of lead into which
they poured molten gold and carefully closed the aperture with the
original metal sometimes they washed a piece of gold with quicksilver
when in this state they found no difficulty in palming it off upon the
uninitiated as an inferior metal and very easily transmuted it into fine
sonorous gold again with the aid of a little aquafortis
others imposed by means of nails half iron and half gold or silver they
pretended that they really transmuted the precious half from iron by
dipping it in a strong alcohol m geoffroy produced several of these
nails to the academy of sciences and shewed how nicely the two parts were
soldered together the golden or silver half was painted black to resemble
iron and the colour immediately disappeared when the nail was dipped into
aquafortis a nail of this description was for a long time in the
cabinet of the grand duke of tuscany such also said m geoffroy was the
knife presented by a monk to queen elizabeth of england the blade of
which was half gold and half steel nothing at one time was more common
than to see coins half gold and half silver which had been operated upon
by alchymists for the same purposes of trickery in fact says m
geoffroy in concluding his long report there is every reason to believe
that all the famous histories which have been handed down to us about the
transmutation of metals into gold or silver by means of the powder of
projection or philosophical elixirs are founded upon some successful
deception of the kind above narrated these pretended philosophers
invariably disappeared after the first or second experiment or their
powders or elixirs have failed to produce their effect either because
attention being excited they have found no opportunity to renew the trick
without being discovered or because they have not had sufficient gold
dust for more than one trial
the disinterestedness of these wouldbe philosophers looked at first
sight extremely imposing instances were not rare in which they
generously abandoned all the profits of their transmutationseven the
honour of the discovery but this apparent disinterestedness was one of
the most cunning of their manoeuvres it served to keep up the popular
expectation it seemed to shew the possibility of discovering the
philosophers stone and provided the means of future advantages which
they were never slow to lay hold ofsuch as entrances into royal
households maintenance at the public expense and gifts from ambitious
potentates too greedy after the gold they so easily promised
it now only remains to trace the progress of the delusion from the
commencement of the eighteenth century until the present day it will be
seen that until a very recent period there were but slight signs of a
return to reason
jean delisle
in the year 1705 there was much talk in france of a blacksmith named
delisle who had discovered the philosophers stone and who went about
the country turning lead into gold he was a native of provence from
which place his fame soon spread to the capital his early life is
involved in obscurity but lenglet du fresnoy has industriously collected
some particulars of his later career which possess considerable interest
he was a man without any education and had been servant in his youth to
an alchymist from whom he learned many of the tricks of the fraternity
the name of his master has never been discovered but it is pretended that
he rendered himself in some manner obnoxious to the government of louis
xiv and was obliged in consequence to take refuge in switzerland
delisle accompanied him as far as savoy and there it is said set upon
him in a solitary mountainpass and murdered and robbed him he then
disguised himself as a pilgrim and returned to france at a lonely inn
by the roadside where he stopped for the night he became acquainted
with a woman named aluys and so sudden a passion was enkindled betwixt
them that she consented to leave all follow him and share his good or
evil fortune wherever he went they lived together for five or six years
in provence without exciting any attention apparently possessed of a
decent independence at last in 1706 it was given out that he was the
possessor of the philosophers stone and people from far and near came
flocking to his residence at the chteau de la palu at sylanez near
barjaumont to witness the wealth he could make out of pumps and
fireshovels the following account of his operations is given in a letter
addressed by m de cerisy the prior of chteauneuf in the diocese of
riez in provence to the vicar of st jacques du hautpas at paris and
dated the 18th of november 1706
i have something to relate to you my dear cousin which will be
interesting to you and your friends the philosophers stone which so
many persons have looked upon as a chimera is at last found it is a man
named delisle of the parish of sylanez and residing within a quarter of
a league of me that has discovered this great secret he turns lead into
gold and iron into silver by merely heating these metals red hot and
pouring upon them in that state some oil and powder he is possessed of so
that it would not be impossible for any man to make a million a day if he
had sufficient of this wondrous mixture some of the pale gold which he
had made in this manner he sent to the jewellers of lyons to have their
opinion on its quality he also sold twenty pounds weight of it to a
merchant of digne named taxis all the jewellers say they never saw such
fine gold in their lives he makes nails part gold part iron and part
silver he promised to give me one of them in a long conversation which i
had with him the other day by order of the bishop of sens who saw his
operations with his own eyes and detailed all the circumstances to me
the baron and baroness de rheinwald shewed me a lingot of gold made out
of pewter before their eyes by m delisle my brotherinlaw sauveur who
has wasted fifty years of his life in this great study brought me the
other day a nail which he had seen changed into gold by delisle and fully
convinced me that all his previous experiments were founded on an
erroneous principle this excellent workman received a short time ago a
very kind letter from the superintendent of the royal household which i
read he offered to use all his influence with the ministers to prevent
any attempts upon his liberty which has twice been attacked by the agents
of government it is believed that the oil he makes use of is gold or
silver reduced to that state he leaves it for a long time exposed to the
rays of the sun he told me that it generally took him six months to make
all his preparations i told him that apparently the king wanted to see
him he replied that he could not exercise his art in every place as a
certain climate and temperature were absolutely necessary to his success
the truth is that this man appears to have no ambition he only keeps two
horses and two menservants besides he loves his liberty has no
politeness and speaks very bad french but his judgment seems to be
solid he was formerly no more than a blacksmith but excelled in that
trade without having been taught it all the great lords and seigneurs
from far and near come to visit him and pay such court to him that it
seems more like idolatry than any thing else happy would france be if
this man would discover his secret to the king to whom the superintendent
has already sent some lingots but the happiness is too great to be hoped
for for i fear that the workman and his secret will expire together
there is no doubt that this discovery will make a great noise in the
kingdom unless the character of the man which i have just depicted to
you prevent it at all events posterity will hear of him
in another letter to the same person dated the 27th of january 1707 m
de cerisy says my dear cousin i spoke to you in my last letter of the
famous alchymist of provence m delisle a good deal of that was only
hearsay but now i am enabled to speak from my own experience i have in
my possession a nail half iron and half silver which i made myself that
great and admirable workman also bestowed a still greater privilege upon
mehe allowed me turn a piece of lead which i had brought with me into
pure gold by means of his wonderful oil and powder all the country have
their eyes upon this gentleman some deny loudly others are incredulous
but those who have seen acknowledge the truth i have read the passport
that has been sent to him from court with orders that he should present
himself at paris early in the spring he told me that he would go
willingly and that it was himself who fixed the spring for his departure
as he wanted to collect his materials in order that immediately on his
introduction to the king he might make an experiment worthy of his
majesty by converting a large quantity of lead into the finest gold i
sincerely hope that he will not allow his secret to die with him but that
he will communicate it to the king as i had the honour to dine with him
on thursday last the 20th of this month being seated at his side i told
him in a whisper that he could if he liked humble all the enemies of
france he did not deny it but began to smile in fact this man is the
miracle of art sometimes he employs the oil and powder mixed sometimes
the powder only but in so small a quantity that when the lingot which i
made was rubbed all over with it it did not shew at all
this softheaded priest was by no means the only person in the
neighbourhood who lost his wits in hopes of the boundless wealth held out
by this clever impostor another priest named de lions a chanter in the
cathedral of grenoble writing on the 30th january 1707 says m
mesnard the curate of montier has written to me stating that there is a
man about thirtyfive years of age named delisle who turns lead and
iron into gold and silver and that this transmutation is so veritable and
so true that the goldsmiths affirm that his gold and silver are the
purest and finest they ever saw for five years this man was looked upon
as a madman or a cheat but the public mind is now disabused with respect
to him he now resides with m de la palu at the chteau of the same
name m de la palu is not very easy in his circumstances and wants money
to portion his daughters who have remained single till middle age no man
being willing to take them without a dowry m delisle has promised to
make them the richest girls in the province before he goes to court
having been sent for by the king he has asked for a little time before
his departure in order that he may collect powder enough to make several
quintals of gold before the eyes of his majesty to whom he intends to
present them the principal matter of his wonderful powder is composed of
simples principally the herbs lunaria major and minor there is a
good deal of the first planted by him in the gardens of la palu and he
gets the other from the mountains that stretch about two leagues from
montier what i tell you now is not a mere story invented for your
diversion m mesnard can bring forward many witnesses to its truth among
others the bishop of sens who saw these surprising operations
performed and m de cerisy whom you know well delisle transmutes his
metals in public he rubs the lead or iron with his powder and puts it
over burning charcoal in a short time it changes colour the lead becomes
yellow and is found to be converted into excellent gold the iron becomes
white and is found to be pure silver delisle is altogether an illiterate
person m de st auban endeavoured to teach him to read and write but he
profited very little by his lessons he is unpolite fantastic and a
dreamer and acts by fits and starts
delisle it would appear was afraid of venturing to paris he knew that
his sleight of hand would be too narrowly watched in the royal presence
and upon some pretence or other he delayed the journey for more than two
years desmarets the minister of finance to louis xiv thinking the
philosopher dreaded foul play twice sent him a safe conduct under the
kings seal but delisle still refused upon this desmarets wrote to the
bishop of sens for his real opinion as to these famous transmutations
the following was the answer of that prelate
    copy of a report addressed to m desmarets comptrollergeneral
     of the finances to his majesty louis xiv by the bishop of sens
     dated march 1709
sira twelvemonth ago or a little more i expressed to you my joy at
hearing of your elevation to the ministry i have now the honour to write
you my opinion of the sieur delisle who has been working at the
transmutation of metals in my diocese i have during the last two years
spoken of him several times to the count de pontchartrain because he
asked me but i have not written to you sir or to m de chamillart
because you neither of you requested my opinion upon the subject now
however that you have given me to understand that you wish to know my
sentiments on the matter i will unfold myself to you in all sincerity
for the interests of the king and the glory of your ministry
there are two things about the sieur delisle which in my opinion should
be examined without prejudice the one relates to his secret the other
to his person that is to say whether his transmutations are real and
whether his conduct has been regular as regards the secret of the
philosophers stone i deemed it impossible for a long time and for more
than three years i was more mistrustful of the pretensions of this sieur
delisle than of any other person during this period i afforded him no
countenance i even aided a person who was highly recommended to me by an
influential family of this province to prosecute delisle for some offence
or other which it was alleged he had committed but this person in his
anger against him having told me that he had himself been several times
the bearer of gold and silver to the goldsmiths of nice aix and avignon
which had been transmuted by delisle from lead and iron i began to waver
a little in my opinions respecting him i afterwards met delisle at the
house of one of my friends to please me the family asked delisle to
operate before me to which he immediately consented i offered him some
iron nails which he changed into silver in the chimneyplace before six
or seven credible witnesses i took the nails thus transmuted and sent
them by my almoner to imbert the jeweller of aix who having subjected
them to the necessary trial returned them to me saying they were very
good silver still however i was not quite satisfied m de
pontchartrain having hinted to me two years previously that i should do
a thing agreeable to his majesty if i examined into this business of
delisle i resolved to do so now i therefore summoned the alchymist to
come to me at castellane he came and i had him escorted by eight or ten
vigilant men to whom i had given notice to watch his hands strictly
before all of us he changed two pieces of lead into gold and silver i
sent them both to m de pontchartrain and he afterwards informed me by a
letter now lying before me that he had shewn them to the most
experienced goldsmiths of paris who unanimously pronounced them to be
gold and silver of the very purest quality and without alloy my former
bad opinion of delisle was now indeed shaken it was much more so when he
performed transmutation five or six times before me at sens and made me
perform it myself before him without his putting his hand to any thing
you have seen sir the letter of my nephew the pre berard of the
oratoire at paris on the experiment that he performed at castellane and
the truth of which i hereby attest another nephew of mine the sieur
bourget who was here three weeks ago performed the same experiment in my
presence and will detail all the circumstances to you personally at
paris a hundred persons in my diocese have been witnesses of these
things i confess to you sir that after the testimony of so many
spectators and so many goldsmiths and after the repeatedly successful
experiments that i saw performed all my prejudices vanished my reason
was convinced by my eyes and the phantoms of impossibility which i had
conjured up were dissipated by the work of my own hands
it now only remains for me to speak to you on the subject of his person
and conduct three suspicions have been excited against him the first
that he was implicated in some criminal proceeding at cisteron and that
he falsified the coin of the realm the second that the king sent him two
safeconducts without effect and the third that he still delays going to
court to operate before the king you may see sir that i do not hide or
avoid any thing as regards the business at cisteron the sieur delisle
has repeatedly assured me that there was nothing against him which could
reasonably draw him within the pale of justice and that he had never
carried on any calling injurious to the kings service it was true that
six or seven years ago he had been to cisteron to gather herbs necessary
for his powder and that he had lodged at the house of one pelouse whom
he thought an honest man pelouse was accused of clipping louisdors and
as he had lodged with him he was suspected of being his accomplice this
mere suspicion without any proof whatever had caused him to be condemned
for contumacy a common case enough with judges who always proceed with
much rigour against those who are absent during my own sojourn at aix it
was well known that a man named andr aluys had spread about reports
injurious to the character of delisle because he hoped thereby to avoid
paying him a sum of forty louis that he owed him but permit me sir to
go further and to add that even if there were wellfounded suspicions
against delisle we should look with some little indulgence on the faults
of a man who possesses a secret so useful to the state as regards the two
safeconducts sent him by the king i think i can answer certainly that it
was through no fault of his that he paid so little attention to them his
year strictly speaking consists only of the four summer months and when
by any means he is prevented from making the proper use of them he loses
a whole year thus the first safeconduct became useless by the irruption
of the duke of savoy in 1707 and the second had hardly been obtained at
the end of june 1708 when the said delisle was insulted by a party of
armed men pretending to act under the authority of the count de grignan
to whom he wrote several letters of complaint without receiving any
answer or promise that his safety would be attended to what i have now
told you sir removes the third objection and is the reason why at the
present time he cannot go to paris to the king in fulfilment of his
promises made two years ago two or even three summers have been lost to
him owing to the continual inquietude he has laboured under he has in
consequence been unable to work and has not collected a sufficient
quantity of his oil and powder or brought what he has got to the
necessary degree of perfection for this reason also he could not give the
sieur de bourget the portion he promised him for your inspection if the
other day he changed some lead into gold with a few grains of his powder
they were assuredly all he had for he told me that such was the fact long
before he knew my nephew was coming even if he had preserved this small
quantity to operate before the king i am sure that on second thoughts
he would never have adventured with so little because the slightest
obstacles in the metals their being too hard or too soft which is only
discovered in operating would have caused him to be looked upon as an
impostor if in case his first powder had proved ineffectual he had not
been possessed of more to renew the experiment and surmount the
difficulty
permit me sir in conclusion to repeat that such an artist as this
should not be driven to the last extremity nor forced to seek an asylum
offered to him in other countries but which he has despised as much from
his own inclinations as from the advice i have given him you risk nothing
in giving him a little time and in hurrying him you may lose a great
deal the genuineness of his gold can no longer be doubted after the
testimony of so many jewellers of aix lyons and paris in its favour as
it is not his fault that the previous safeconducts sent to him have been
of no service it will be necessary to send him another for the success
of which i will be answerable if you will confide the matter to me and
trust to my zeal for the service of his majesty to whom i pray you to
communicate this letter that i may be spared the just reproaches he might
one day heap upon me if he remained ignorant of the facts i have now
written to you assure him if you please that if you send me such a
safeconduct i will oblige the sieur delisle to depose with me such
precious pledges of his fidelity as shall enable me to be responsible
myself to the king these are my sentiments and i submit them to your
superior knowledge and have the honour to remain with much respect c
                                         john bishop of senes
to m desmarets minister of state and comptrollergeneral of the
finances at paris
that delisle was no ordinary impostor but a man of consummate cunning and
address is very evident from this letter the bishop was fairly taken in
by his clever legerdemain and when once his first distrust was conquered
appeared as anxious to deceive himself as even delisle could have wished
his faith was so abundant that he made the case of his protg his own
and would not suffer the breath of suspicion to be directed against him
both louis and his minister appear to have been dazzled by the brilliant
hopes he had excited and a third pass or safeconduct was immediately
sent to the alchymist with a command from the king that he should
forthwith present himself at versailles and make public trial of his oil
and powder but this did not suit the plans of delisle in the provinces
he was regarded as a man of no small importance the servile flattery that
awaited him wherever he went was so grateful to his mind that he could not
willingly relinquish it and run upon certain detection at the court of
the monarch upon one pretext or another he delayed his journey
notwithstanding the earnest solicitations of his good friend the bishop
the latter had given his word to the minister and pledged his honour that
he would induce delisle to go and he began to be alarmed when he found he
could not subdue the obstinacy of that individual for more than two years
he continued to remonstrate with him and was always met by some excuse
that there was not sufficient powder or that it had not been long enough
exposed to the rays of the sun at last his patience was exhausted and
fearful that he might suffer in the royal estimation by longer delay he
wrote to the king for a lettre de cachet in virtue of which the
alchymist was seized at the castle of la palu in the month of june 1711
and carried off to be imprisoned in the bastille
the gendarmes were aware that their prisoner was supposed to be the lucky
possessor of the philosophers stone and on the road they conspired to
rob and murder him one of them pretended to be touched with pity for the
misfortunes of the philosopher and offered to give him an opportunity of
escape whenever he could divert the attention of his companions delisle
was profuse in his thanks little dreaming of the snare that was laid for
him his treacherous friend gave notice of the success of the stratagem so
far and it was agreed that delisle should be allowed to struggle with and
overthrow one of them while the rest were at some distance they were then
to pursue him and shoot him through the heart and after robbing the
corpse of the philosophers stone convey it to paris on a cart and tell
m desmarets that the prisoner had attempted to escape and would have
succeeded if they had not fired after him and shot him through the body
at a convenient place the scheme was executed on a given signal from the
friendly gendarme delisle fled while another gendarme took aim and shot
him through the thigh some peasants arriving at the instant they were
prevented from killing him as they intended and he was transported to
paris maimed and bleeding he was thrown into a dungeon in the bastille
and obstinately tore away the bandages which the surgeons applied to his
wound he never afterwards rose from his bed
the bishop of sens visited him in prison and promised him his liberty if
he would transmute a certain quantity of lead into gold before the king
the unhappy man had no longer the means of carrying on the deception he
had no gold and no doublebottomed crucible or hollow wand to conceal it
in even if he had he would not however confess that he was an
impostor but merely said he did not know how to make the powder of
projection but had received a quantity from an italian philosopher and
had used it all in his various transmutations in provence he lingered for
seven or eight months in the bastille and died from the effects of his
wound in the fortyfirst year of his age
albert aluys
this pretender to the philosophers stone was the son by a former
husband of the woman aluys with whom delisle became acquainted at the
commencement of his career in the cabaret by the roadside and whom he
afterwards married delisle performed the part of a father towards him
and thought he could shew no stronger proof of his regard than by giving
him the necessary instructions to carry on the deception which had raised
himself to such a pitch of greatness the young aluys was an apt scholar
and soon mastered all the jargon of the alchymists he discoursed
learnedly upon projections cimentations sublimations the elixir of
life and the universal alkahest and on the death of delisle gave out
that the secret of that great adept had been communicated to him and to
him only his mother aided in the fraud with the hope they might both
fasten themselves in the true alchymical fashion upon some rich dupe
who would entertain them magnificently while the operation was in
progress the fate of delisle was no inducement for them to stop in
france the provenals it is true entertained as high an opinion as ever
of his skill and were well inclined to believe the tales of the young
adept on whom his mantle had fallen but the dungeons of the bastille were
yawning for their prey and aluys and his mother decamped with all
convenient expedition they travelled about the continent for several
years sponging upon credulous rich men and now and then performing
successful transmutations by the aid of doublebottomed crucibles and the
like in the year 1726 aluys without his mother who appears to have
died in the interval was at vienna where he introduced himself to the
duke de richelieu at that time ambassador from the court of france he
completely deceived this nobleman he turned lead into gold apparently
on several occasions and even made the ambassador himself turn an iron
nail into a silver one the duke afterwards boasted to lenglet du fresnoy
of his achievements as an alchymist and regretted that he had not been
able to discover the secret of the precious powder by which he performed
them
aluys soon found that although he might make a dupe of the duke de
richelieu he could not get any money from him on the contrary the duke
expected all his pokers and fireshovels to be made silver and all his
pewter utensils gold and thought the honour of his acquaintance was
reward sufficient for a roturier who could not want wealth since he
possessed so invaluable a secret aluys seeing that so much was expected
of him bade adieu to his excellency and proceeded to bohemia accompanied
by a pupil and by a young girl who had fallen in love with him in vienna
some noblemen in bohemia received him kindly and entertained him at their
houses for months at a time it was his usual practice to pretend that he
possessed only a few grains of his powder with which he would operate in
any house where he intended to fix his quarters for the season he would
make the proprietor the present of a piece of gold thus transmuted and
promise him millions if he could only be provided with leisure to gather
his lunaria major and minor on their mountaintops and board
lodging and loose cash for himself his wife and his pupil in the
interval
he exhausted in this manner the patience of some dozen of people when
thinking that there was less danger for him in france under the young king
louis xv than under his old and morose predecessor he returned to
provence on his arrival at aix he presented himself before m le bret
the president of the province a gentleman who was much attached to the
pursuits of alchymy and had great hopes of being himself able to find the
philosophers stone m le bret contrary to his expectation received him
very coolly in consequence of some rumours that were spread abroad
respecting him and told him to call upon him on the morrow aluys did not
like the tone of the voice or the expression of the eye of the learned
president as that functionary looked down upon him suspecting that all
was not right he left aix secretly the same evening and proceeded to
marseilles but the police were on the watch for him and he had not been
there fourandtwenty hours before he was arrested on a charge of
coining and thrown into prison
as the proofs against him were too convincing to leave him much hope of an
acquittal he planned an escape from durance it so happened that the
gaoler had a pretty daughter and aluys soon discovered that she was
tenderhearted he endeavoured to gain her in his favour and succeeded
the damsel unaware that he was a married man conceived and encouraged a
passion for him and generously provided him with the means of escape
after he had been nearly a year in prison he succeeded in getting free
leaving the poor girl behind to learn that he was already married and to
lament in solitude that she had given her heart to an ungrateful vagabond
when he left marseilles he had not a shoe to his foot or a decent garment
to his back but was provided with some money and clothes by his wife in a
neighbouring town they then found their way to brussels and by dint of
excessive impudence brought themselves into notice he took a house
fitted up a splendid laboratory and gave out that he knew the secret of
transmutation in vain did m percel the brotherinlaw of lenglet du
fresnoy who resided in that city expose his pretensions and hold him up
to contempt as an ignorant impostor the world believed him not they took
the alchymist at his word and besieged his doors to see and wonder at the
clever legerdemain by which he turned iron nails into gold and silver a
rich greffier paid him a large sum of money that he might be instructed
in the art and aluys gave him several lessons on the most common
principles of chemistry the greffier studied hard for a twelvemonth and
then discovered that his master was a quack he demanded his money back
again but aluys was not inclined to give it him and the affair was
brought before the civil tribunal of the province in the mean time
however the greffier died suddenly poisoned according to the popular
rumour by his debtor to avoid repayment so great an outcry arose in the
city that aluys who may have been innocent of the crime was
nevertheless afraid to remain and brave it he withdrew secretly in the
night and retired to paris here all trace of him is lost he was never
heard of again but lenglet du fresnoy conjectures that he ended his days
in some obscure dungeon into which he was cast for coining or other
malpractices
the count de st germain
this adventurer was of a higher grade than the last and played a
distinguished part at the court of louis xv he pretended to have
discovered the elixir of life by means of which he could make any one
live for centuries and allowed it to believed that his own age was
upwards of two thousand years he entertained many of the opinions of the
rosicrucians boasted of his intercourse with sylphs and salamanders and
of his power of drawing diamonds from the earth and pearls from the sea
by the force of his incantations he did not lay claim to the merit of
having discovered the philosophers stone but devoted so much of his time
to the operations of alchymy that it was very generally believed that if
such a thing as the philosophers stone had ever existed or could be
called into existence he was the man to succeed in finding it
it has never yet been discovered what was his real name or in what
country he was born some believed from the jewish cast of his handsome
countenance that he was the wandering jew others asserted that he was
the issue of an arabian princess and that his father was a salamander
while others more reasonable affirmed him to be the son of a portuguese
jew established at bourdeaux he first carried on his imposture in
germany where he made considerable sums by selling an elixir to arrest
the progress of old age the marchal de belleisle purchased a dose of
it and was so captivated with the wit learning and good manners of the
charlatan and so convinced of the justice of his most preposterous
pretensions that he induced him to fix his residence in paris under the
marshals patronage he first appeared in the gay circles of that capital
every one was delighted with the mysterious stranger who at this period
of his life appears to have been about seventy years of age but did not
look more than fortyfive his easy assurance imposed upon most people
his reading was extensive and his memory extraordinarily tenacious of the
slightest circumstances his pretension to have lived for so many
centuries naturally exposed him to some puzzling questions as to the
appearance life and conversation of the great men of former days but he
was never at a loss for an answer many who questioned him for the purpose
of scoffing at him refrained in perplexity quite bewildered by his
presence of mind his ready replies and his astonishing accuracy on every
point mentioned in history to increase the mystery by which he was
surrounded he permitted no person to know how he lived he dressed in a
style of the greatest magnificence sported valuable diamonds in his hat
on his fingers and in his shoebuckles and sometimes made the most
costly presents to the ladies of the court it was suspected by many that
he was a spy in the pay of the english ministry but there never was a
tittle of evidence to support the charge the king looked upon him with
marked favour was often closeted with him for hours together and would
not suffer any body to speak disparagingly of him voltaire constantly
turned him into ridicule and in one of his letters to the king of
prussia mentions him as un comte pour rire and states that he
pretended to have dined with the holy fathers at the council of trent
in the memoirs of madame du hausset chamberwoman to madame du
pompadour there are some amusing anecdotes of this personage very soon
after his arrival in paris he had the entre of her dressingroom a
favour only granted to the most powerful lords at the court of her royal
lover madame was fond of conversing with him and in her presence he
thought fit to lower his pretensions very considerably but he often
allowed her to believe that he had lived two or three hundred years at
least one day says madame du hausset madame said to him in my
presence what was the personal appearance of francis i he was a king i
should have liked he was indeed very captivating replied st
germain and he proceeded to describe his face and person as that of a
man whom he had accurately observed it is a pity he was too ardent i
could have given him some good advice which would have saved him from all
his misfortunes but he would not have followed it for it seems as if a
fatality attended princes forcing them to shut their ears to the wisest
counsel was his court very brilliant inquired madame du pompadour
very replied the count but those of his grandsons surpassed it in
the time of mary stuart and margaret of valois it was a land of
enchantmenta temple sacred to pleasures of every kind madame said
laughing you seem to have seen all this i have an excellent memory
said he and have read the history of france with great care i sometimes
amuse myself not by making but by letting it be believed that i lived
in old times
but you do not tell us your age said madame du pompadour to him on
another occasion and yet you pretend you are very old the countess de
gergy who was i believe ambassadress at vienna some fifty years ago
says she saw you there exactly the same as you now appear
it is true madame replied st germain i knew madame de gergy many
years ago
but according to her account you must be more than a hundred years
old
that is not impossible said he laughing but it is much more
possible that the good lady is in her dotage
you gave her an elixir surprising for the effects it produced for she
says that during a length of time she only appeared to be eightyfour
the age at which she took it why dont you give it to the king
oh madam he exclaimed the physicians would have me broken on the
wheel were i to think of drugging his majesty
when the world begins to believe extraordinary things of an individual
there is no telling where its extravagance will stop people when once
they have taken the start vie with each other who shall believe most at
this period all paris resounded with the wonderful adventures of the count
de st germain and a company of waggish young men tried the following
experiment upon its credulity a clever mimic who on account of the
amusement he afforded was admitted into good society was taken by them
dressed as the count de st germain into several houses in the rue du
marais he imitated the counts peculiarities admirably and found his
auditors openmouthed to believe any absurdity he chose to utter no
fiction was too monstrous for their alldevouring credulity he spoke of
the saviour of the world in terms of the greatest familiarity said he had
supped with him at the marriage in canaan of galilee where the water was
miraculously turned into wine in fact he said he was an intimate friend
of his and had often warned him to be less romantic and imprudent or he
would finish his career miserably this infamous blasphemy strange to
say found believers and ere three days had elapsed it was currently
reported that st germain was born soon after the deluge and that he
would never die
st germain himself was too much a man of the world to assert any thing so
monstrous but he took no pains to contradict the story in all his
conversations with persons of rank and education he advanced his claims
modestly and as if by mere inadvertency and seldom pretended to a
longevity beyond three hundred years except when he found he was in
company with persons who would believe any thing he often spoke of henry
viii as if he had known him intimately and of the emperor charles v as
if that monarch had delighted in his society he would describe
conversations which took place with such an apparent truthfulness and be
so exceedingly minute and particular as to the dress and appearance of the
individuals and even the weather at the time and the furniture of the
room that three persons out of four were generally inclined to credit
him he had constant applications from rich old women for an elixir to
make them young again and it would appear gained large sums in this
manner to those whom he was pleased to call his friends he said his mode
of living and plan of diet were far superior to any elixir and that any
body might attain a patriarchal age by refraining from drinking at meals
and very sparingly at any other time the baron de gleichen followed this
system and took great quantities of senna leaves expecting to live for
two hundred years he died however at seventythree the duchess de
choiseul was desirous of following the same system but the duke her
husband in much wrath forbade her to follow any system prescribed by a man
who had so equivocal a reputation as m de st germain
madame du hausset says she saw st germain and conversed with him several
times he appeared to her to be about fifty years of age was of the
middle size and had fine expressive features his dress was always
simple but displayed much taste he usually wore diamond rings of great
value and his watch and snuffbox were ornamented with a profusion of
precious stones one day at madame du pompadours apartments where the
principal courtiers were assembled st germain made his appearance in
diamond knee and shoe buckles of so fine a water that madame said she did
not think the king had any equal to them he was entreated to pass into
the antechamber and undo them which he did and brought them to madame
for closer inspection m de gontant who was present said their value
could not be less than two hundred thousand livres or upwards of eight
thousand pounds sterling the baron de gleichen in his memoirs relates
that the count one day shewed him so many diamonds that he thought he saw
before him all the treasures of aladdins lamp and adds that he had had
great experience in precious stones and was convinced that all those
possessed by the count were genuine on another occasion st germain
shewed madame du pompadour a small box containing topazes emeralds and
diamonds worth half a million of livres he affected to despise all this
wealth to make the world more easily believe that he could like the
rosicrucians draw precious stones out of the earth by the magic of his
song he gave away a great number of these jewels to the ladies of the
court and madame du pompadour was so charmed with his generosity that
she gave him a richly enamelled snuffbox as a token of her regard on the
lid of which was beautifully painted a portrait of socrates or some other
greek sage to whom she compared him he was not only lavish to the
mistresses but to the maids madame du hausset says the count came to
see madame du pompadour who was very ill and lay on the sofa he shewed
her diamonds enough to furnish a kings treasury madame sent for me to
see all those beautiful things i looked at them with an air of the utmost
astonishment but i made signs to her that i thought them all false the
count felt for something in a pocketbook about twice as large as a
spectaclecase and at length drew out two or three little paper packets
which he unfolded and exhibited a superb ruby he threw on the table
with a contemptuous air a little cross of green and white stones i
looked at it and said it was not to be despised i then put it on and
admired it greatly the count begged me to accept it i refused he urged
me to take it at length he pressed so warmly that madame seeing it
could not be worth more than a thousand livres made me a sign to accept
it i took the cross much pleased with the counts politeness
how the adventurer obtained his wealth remains a secret he could not have
made it all by the sale of his elixir vit in germany though no doubt
some portion of it was derived from that source voltaire positively says
he was in the pay of foreign governments and in his letter to the king of
prussia dated the 5th of april 1758 says that he was initiated in all
the secrets of choiseul kaunitz and pitt of what use he could be to any
of those ministers and to choiseul especially is a mystery of mysteries
there appears no doubt that he possessed the secret of removing spots from
diamonds and in all probability he gained considerable sums by buying at
inferior prices such as had flaws in them and afterwards disposing of
them at a profit of cent per cent madame du hausset relates the following
anecdote on this particular the king says she ordered a
middlingsized diamond which had a flaw in it to be brought to him
after having it weighed his majesty said to the count the value of this
diamond as it is and with the flaw in it is six thousand livres without
the flaw it would be worth at least ten thousand will you undertake to
make me a gainer of four thousand livres st germain examined it very
attentively and said it is possible it may be done i will bring it
you again in a month at the time appointed the count brought back the
diamond without a spot and gave it to the king it was wrapped in a cloth
of amianthos which he took off the king had it weighed immediately and
found it very little diminished his majesty then sent it to his jeweller
by m de gontant without telling him of any thing that had passed the
jeweller gave nine thousand six hundred livres for it the king however
sent for the diamond back again and said he would keep it as a curiosity
he could not overcome his surprise and said m de st germain must be
worth millions especially if he possessed the secret of making large
diamonds out of small ones the count neither said that he could or could
not but positively asserted that he knew how to make pearls grow and
give them the finest water the king paid him great attention and so did
madame du pompadour m du quesnoy once said that st germain was a quack
but the king reprimanded him in fact his majesty appears infatuated by
him and sometimes talks of him as if his descent were illustrious
st germain had a most amusing vagabond for a servant to whom he would
often appeal for corroboration when relating some wonderful event that
happened centuries before the fellow who was not without ability
generally corroborated him in a most satisfactory manner upon one
occasion his master was telling a party of ladies and gentlemen at
dinner some conversation he had had in palestine with king richard i of
england whom he described as a very particular friend of his signs of
astonishment and incredulity were visible on the faces of the company
upon which st germain very coolly turned to his servant who stood behind
his chair and asked him if he had not spoken truth i really cannot
say replied the man without moving a muscle you forget sir i have
only been five hundred years in your service ah true said his
master i remember now it was a little before your time
occasionally when with men whom he could not so easily dupe he gave
utterance to the contempt with which he could scarcely avoid regarding
such gaping credulity these fools of parisians said he to the baron de
gleichen believe me to be more than five hundred years old and since
they will have it so i confirm them in their idea not but that i really
am much older than i appear
many other stories are related of this strange impostor but enough have
been quoted to shew his character and pretensions it appears that he
endeavoured to find the philosophers stone but never boasted of
possessing it the prince of hesse cassel whom he had known years before
in germany wrote urgent letters to him entreating him to quit paris and
reside with him st germain at last consented nothing further is known
of his career there were no gossipping memoirwriters at the court of
hesse cassel to chronicle his sayings and doings he died at sleswig
under the roof of his friend the prince in the year 1784
cagliostro
this famous charlatan the friend and successor of st germain ran a
career still more extraordinary he was the archquack of his age the
last of the great pretenders to the philosophers stone and the water of
life and during his brief season of prosperity one of the most
conspicuous characters of europe
his real name was joseph balsamo he was born at palermo about the year
1743 of humble parentage he had the misfortune to lose his father during
his infancy and his education was left in consequence to some relatives
of his mother the latter being too poor to afford him any instruction
beyond mere reading and writing he was sent in his fifteenth year to a
monastery to be taught the elements of chemistry and physic but his
temper was so impetuous his indolence so invincible and his vicious
habits so deeply rooted that he made no progress after remaining some
years he left it with the character of an uninformed and dissipated young
man with good natural talents but a bad disposition when he became of
age he abandoned himself to a life of riot and debauchery and entered
himself in fact into that celebrated fraternity known in france and
italy as the knights of industry and in england as the swell mob he
was far from being an idle or unwilling member of the corps the first way
in which he distinguished himself was by forging orders of admission to
the theatres he afterwards robbed his uncle and counterfeited a will
for acts like these he paid frequent compulsory visits to the prisons of
palermo somehow or other he acquired the character of a sorcererof a
man who had failed in discovering the secrets of alchymy and had sold his
soul to the devil for the gold which he was not able to make by means of
transmutation he took no pains to disabuse the popular mind on this
particular but rather encouraged the belief than otherwise he at last
made use of it to cheat a silversmith named marano of about sixty ounces
of gold and was in consequence obliged to leave palermo he persuaded
this man that he could shew him a treasure hidden in a cave for which
service he was to receive the sixty ounces of gold while the silversmith
was to have all the treasure for the mere trouble of digging it up they
went together at midnight to an excavation in the vicinity of palermo
where balsamo drew a magic circle and invoked the devil to shew his
treasures suddenly there appeared half a dozen fellows the accomplices
of the swindler dressed to represent devils with horns on their heads
claws to their fingers and vomiting apparently red and blue flame they
were armed with pitchforks with which they belaboured poor marano till he
was almost dead and robbed him of his sixty ounces of gold and all the
valuables he carried about his person they then made off accompanied by
balsamo leaving the unlucky silversmith to recover or die at his leisure
nature chose the former course and soon after daylight he was restored to
his senses smarting in body from his blows and in spirit for the
deception of which he had been the victim his first impulse was to
denounce balsamo to the magistrates of the town but on further reflection
he was afraid of the ridicule that a full exposure of all the
circumstances would draw upon him he therefore took the truly italian
resolution of being revenged on balsamo by murdering him at the first
convenient opportunity having given utterance to this threat in the
hearing of a friend of balsamo it was reported to the latter who
immediately packed up his valuables and quitted europe
he chose medina in arabia for his future dwellingplace and there
became acquainted with a greek named altotas a man exceedingly well
versed in all the languages of the east and an indefatigable student of
alchymy he possessed an invaluable collection of arabian manuscripts on
his favourite science and studied them with such unremitting industry
that he found he had not sufficient time to attend to his crucibles and
furnaces without neglecting his books he was looking about for an
assistant when balsamo opportunely presented himself and made so
favourable an impression that he was at once engaged in that capacity but
the relation of master and servant did not long subsist between them
balsamo was too ambitious and too clever to play a secondary part and
within fifteen days of their first acquaintance they were bound together
as friends and partners altotas in the course of a long life devoted to
alchymy had stumbled upon some valuable discoveries in chemistry one of
which was an ingredient for improving the manufacture of flax and
imparting to goods of that material a gloss and softness almost equal to
silk balsamo gave him the good advice to leave the philosophers stone
for the present undiscovered and make gold out of their flax the advice
was taken and they proceeded together to alexandria to trade with a
large stock of that article they stayed forty days in alexandria and
gained a considerable sum by their venture they afterwards visited other
cities in egypt and were equally successful they also visited turkey
where they sold drugs and amulets on their return to europe they were
driven by stress of weather into malta and were hospitably received by
pinto the grand master of the knights and a famous alchymist they
worked in his laboratory for some months and tried hard to change a
pewter platter into a silver one balsamo having less faith than his
companions was sooner wearied and obtaining from his host many letters
of introduction to rome and naples he left him and altotas to find the
philosophers stone and transmute the pewter platter without him
he had long since dropped the name of balsamo on account of the many ugly
associations that clung to it and during his travels had assumed at least
half a score others with titles annexed to them he called himself
sometimes the chevalier de fischio the marquis de melissa the baron de
belmonte de pelligrini danna de fenix de harat but most commonly the
count de cagliostro under the latter title he entered rome and never
afterwards changed it in this city he gave himself out as the restorer of
the rosicrucian philosophy said he could transmute all metals into gold
that he could render himself invisible cure all diseases and administer
an elixir against old age and decay his letters from the grand master
pinto procured him an introduction into the best families he made money
rapidly by the sale of his elixir vit and like other quacks
performed many remarkable cures by inspiring his patients with the most
complete faith and reliance upon his powers an advantage which the most
impudent charlatans often possess over the regular practitioner
while thus in a fair way of making his fortune he became acquainted with
the beautiful lorenza feliciana a young lady of noble birth but without
fortune cagliostro soon discovered that she possessed accomplishments
that were invaluable besides her ravishing beauty she had the readiest
wit the most engaging manners the most fertile imagination and the
least principle of any of the maidens of rome she was just the wife for
cagliostro who proposed himself to her and was accepted after their
marriage he instructed his fair lorenza in all the secrets of his
callingtaught her pretty lips to invoke angels and genii sylphs
salamanders and undines and when need required devils and evil
spirits lorenza was an apt scholar she soon learned all the jargon of
the alchymists and all the spells of the enchanters and thus accomplished
the hopeful pair set out on their travels to levy contributions on the
superstitious and the credulous
they first went to sleswig on a visit to the count de st germain their
great predecessor in the art of making dupes and were received by him in
the most magnificent manner they no doubt fortified their minds for the
career they had chosen by the sage discourse of that worshipful gentleman
for immediately after they left him they began their operations they
travelled for three or four years in russia poland and germany
transmuting metals telling fortunes raising spirits and selling the
elixir vit wherever they went but there is no record of their doings
from whence to draw a more particular detail it was not until they made
their appearance in england in 1776 that the names of the count and
countess di cagliostro began to acquire a european reputation they
arrived in london in the july of that year possessed of property in
plate jewels and specie to the amount of about three thousand pounds
they hired apartments in whitcombe street and lived for some months
quietly in the same house there lodged a portuguese woman named blavary
who being in necessitous circumstances was engaged by the count as
interpreter she was constantly admitted into his laboratory where he
spent much of his time in search of the philosophers stone she spread
abroad the fame of her entertainer in return for his hospitality and
laboured hard to impress every body with as full a belief in his
extraordinary powers as she felt herself but as a female interpreter of
the rank and appearance of madame blavary did not exactly correspond with
the counts notions either of dignity or decorum he hired a person named
vitellini a teacher of languages to act in that capacity vitellini was
a desperate gambler a man who had tried almost every resource to repair
his ruined fortunes including among the rest the search for the
philosophers stone immediately that he saw the counts operations he
was convinced that the great secret was his and that the golden gates of
the palace of fortune were open to let him in with still more enthusiasm
than madame blavary he held forth to his acquaintance and in all public
places that the count was an extraordinary man a true adept whose
fortune was immense and who could transmute into pure and solid gold as
much lead iron and copper as he pleased the consequence was that the
house of cagliostro was besieged by crowds of the idle the credulous and
the avaricious all eager to obtain a sight of the philosopher or to
share in the boundless wealth which he could call into existence
unfortunately for cagliostro he had fallen into evil hands instead of
duping the people of england as he might have done he became himself the
victim of a gang of swindlers who with the fullest reliance on his
occult powers only sought to make money of him vitellini introduced to
him a ruined gambler like himself named scot whom he represented as a
scottish nobleman attracted to london solely by his desire to see and
converse with the extraordinary man whose fame had spread to the distant
mountains of the north cagliostro received him with great kindness and
cordiality and lord scot thereupon introduced a woman named fry as lady
scot who was to act as chaperone to the countess di cagliostro and make
her acquainted with all the noble families of britain thus things went
swimmingly his lordship whose effects had not arrived from scotland
and who had no banker in london borrowed two hundred pounds of the count
they were lent without scruple so flattered was cagliostro by the
attentions they paid him the respect nay veneration they pretended to
feel for him and the complete deference with which they listened to every
word that fell from his lips
superstitious like all desperate gamesters scot had often tried magical
and cabalistic numbers in the hope of discovering lucky numbers in the
lottery or at the roulettetables he had in his possession a cabalistic
manuscript containing various arithmetical combinations of the kind
which he submitted to cagliostro with an urgent request that he would
select a number cagliostro took the manuscript and studied it but as he
himself informs us with no confidence in its truth he however
predicted twenty as the successful number for the 6th of november
following scot ventured a small sum upon this number out of the two
hundred pounds he had borrowed and won cagliostro incited by this
success prognosticated number twentyfive for the next drawing scot
tried again and won a hundred guineas the numbers fiftyfive and
fiftyseven were announced with equal success for the 18th of the same
month to the no small astonishment and delight of cagliostro who
thereupon resolved to try fortune for himself and not for others to all
the entreaties of scot and his lady that he would predict more numbers for
them he turned a deaf ear even while he still thought him a lord and a
man of honour but when he discovered that he was a mere swindler and the
pretended lady scot an artful woman of the town he closed his door upon
them and on all their gang
having complete faith in the supernatural powers of the count they were
in the deepest distress at having lost his countenance they tried by
every means their ingenuity could suggest to propitiate him again they
implored they threatened and endeavoured to bribe him but all was vain
cagliostro would neither see nor correspond with them in the mean time
they lived extravagantly and in the hope of future exhausted all their
present gains they were reduced to the last extremity when miss fry
obtained access to the countess and received a guinea from her on the
representation that she was starving miss fry not contented with this
begged her to intercede with her husband that for the last time he would
point out a lucky number in the lottery the countess promised to exert
her influence and cagliostro thus entreated named the number eight at
the same time reiterating his determination to have no more to do with any
of them by an extraordinary hazard which filled cagliostro with surprise
and pleasure number eight was the greatest prize in the lottery miss fry
and her associates cleared fifteen hundred guineas by the adventure and
became more than ever convinced of the occult powers of cagliostro and
strengthened in their determination never to quit him until they had made
their fortunes out of the proceeds miss fry bought a handsome necklace at
a pawnbrokers for ninety guineas she then ordered a richlychased gold
box having two compartments to be made at a jewellers and putting the
necklace in the one filled the other with a fine aromatic snuff she then
sought another interview with madame di cagliostro and urged her to
accept the box as a small token of her esteem and gratitude without
mentioning the valuable necklace that was concealed in it madame di
cagliostro accepted the present and was from that hour exposed to the
most incessant persecution from all the confederatesblavary vitellini
and the pretended lord and lady scot they flattered themselves they had
regained their lost footing in the house and came day after day to know
lucky numbers in the lottery sometimes forcing themselves up the stairs
and into the counts laboratory in spite of the efforts of the servants
to prevent them cagliostro exasperated at their pertinacity threatened
to call in the assistance of the magistrates and taking miss fry by the
shoulders pushed her into the street
from that time may be dated the misfortunes of cagliostro miss fry at
the instigation of her paramour determined on vengeance her first act
was to swear a debt of two hundred pounds against cagliostro and to cause
him to be arrested for that sum while he was in custody in a
sponginghouse scot accompanied by a low attorney broke into his
laboratory and carried off a small box containing as they believed the
powder of transmutation and a number of cabalistic manuscripts and
treatises upon alchymy they also brought an action against him for the
recovery of the necklace and miss fry accused both him and his countess
of sorcery and witchcraft and of foretelling numbers in the lottery by
the aid of the devil this latter charge was actually heard before mr
justice miller the action of trover for the necklace was tried before the
lord chief justice of the common pleas who recommended the parties to
submit to arbitration in the mean time cagliostro remained in prison for
several weeks till having procured bail he was liberated he was soon
after waited upon by an attorney named reynolds also deep in the plot
who offered to compromise all the actions upon certain conditions scot
who had accompanied him concealed himself behind the door and suddenly
rushing out presented a pistol at the heart of cagliostro swearing he
would shoot him instantly if he would not tell him truly the art of
predicting lucky numbers and of transmuting metals reynolds pretending to
be very angry disarmed his accomplice and entreated the count to satisfy
them by fair means and disclose his secrets promising that if he would
do so they would discharge all the actions and offer him no further
molestation cagliostro replied that threats and entreaties were alike
useless that he knew no secrets and that the powder of transmutation of
which they had robbed him was of no value to any body but himself he
offered however if they would discharge the actions and return the
powder and the manuscripts to forgive them all the money they had
swindled him out of these conditions were refused and scot and reynolds
departed swearing vengeance against him
cagliostro appears to have been quite ignorant of the forms of law in
england and to have been without a friend to advise him as to the best
course he should pursue while he was conversing with his countess on the
difficulties that beset them one of his bail called and invited him to
ride in a hackney coach to the house of a person who would see him
righted cagliostro consented and was driven to the kings bench prison
where his friend left him he did not discover for several hours that he
was a prisoner or in fact understand the process of being surrendered
by ones bail
he regained his liberty in a few weeks and the arbitrators between him
and miss fry made their award against him he was ordered to pay the two
hundred pounds she had sworn against him and to restore the necklace and
gold box which had been presented to the countess cagliostro was so
disgusted that he determined to quit england his pretensions besides
had been unmercifully exposed by a frenchman named morande the editor of
the courrier de leurope published in london to add to his distress
he was recognised in westminster hall as joseph balsamo the swindler of
palermo such a complication of disgrace was not to be borne he and his
countess packed up their small effects and left england with no more than
fifty pounds out of the three thousand they had brought with them
they first proceeded to brussels where fortune was more auspicious they
sold considerable quantities of the elixir of life performed many cures
and recruited their finances they then took their course through germany
to russia and always with the same success gold flowed into their
coffers faster than they could count it they quite forgot all the woes
they had endured in england and learned to be more circumspect in the
choice of their acquaintance
in the year 1780 they made their appearance in strasbourg their fame had
reached that city before them they took a magnificent hotel and invited
all the principal persons of the place to their table their wealth
appeared to be boundless and their hospitality equal to it both the
count and countess acted as physicians and gave money advice and
medicine to all the necessitous and suffering of the town many of the
cures they performed astonished those regular practitioners who did not
make sufficient allowance for the wonderful influence of imagination in
certain cases the countess who at this time was not more than
fiveandtwenty and all radiant with grace beauty and cheerfulness
spoke openly of her eldest son as a fine young man of eightandtwenty
who had been for some years a captain in the dutch service the trick
succeeded to admiration all the ugly old women in strasbourg and for
miles around thronged the saloon of the countess to purchase the liquid
which was to make them as blooming as their daughters the young women
came in equal abundance that they might preserve their charms and when
twice as old as ninon de lenclos be more captivating than she while men
were not wanting who were fools enough to imagine that they might keep off
the inevitable stroke of the grim foe by a few drops of the same
incomparable elixir the countess sooth to say looked like an
incarnation of immortal loveliness a very goddess of youth and beauty
and it is possible that the crowds of young men and old who at all
convenient seasons haunted the perfumed chambers of this enchantress were
attracted less by their belief in her occult powers than from admiration
of her languishing bright eyes and sparkling conversation but amid all
the incense that was offered at her shrine madame di cagliostro was ever
faithful to her spouse she encouraged hopes it is true but she never
realised them she excited admiration yet kept it within bounds and made
men her slaves without ever granting a favour of which the vainest might
boast
in this city they made the acquaintance of many eminent persons and
among others of the cardinal prince de rohan who was destined afterwards
to exercise so untoward an influence over their fate the cardinal who
seems to have had great faith in him as a philosopher persuaded him to
visit paris in his company which he did but remained only thirteen days
he preferred the society of strasbourg and returned thither with the
intention of fixing his residence far from the capital but he soon found
that the first excitement of his arrival had passed away people began to
reason with themselves and to be ashamed of their own admiration the
populace among whom he had lavished his charity with a bountiful hand
accused him of being the antichrist the wandering jew the man of
fourteen hundred years of age a demon in human shape sent to lure the
ignorant to their destruction while the more opulent and better informed
called him a spy in the pay of foreign governments an agent of the
police a swindler and a man of evil life the outcry grew at last so
strong that he deemed it prudent to try his fortune elsewhere
he went first to naples but that city was too near palermo he dreaded
recognition from some of his early friends and after a short stay
returned to france he chose bourdeaux as his next dwellingplace and
created as great a sensation there as he had done in strasbourg he
announced himself as the founder of a new school of medicine and
philosophy boasted of his ability to cure all diseases and invited the
poor and suffering to visit him and he would relieve the distress of the
one class and cure the ailings of the other all day long the street
opposite his magnificent hotel was crowded by the populace the halt and
the blind women with sick babes in their arms and persons suffering
under every species of human infirmity flocked to this wonderful doctor
the relief he afforded in money more than counterbalanced the failure of
his nostrums and the affluence of people from all the surrounding country
became so great that the jurats of the city granted him a military
guard to be stationed day and night before his door to keep order the
anticipations of cagliostro were realised the rich were struck with
admiration of his charity and benevolence and impressed with a full
conviction of his marvellous powers the sale of the elixir went on
admirably his saloons were thronged with wealthy dupes who came to
purchase immortality beauty that would endure for centuries was the
attraction for the fair sex health and strength for the same period were
the baits held out to the other his charming countess in the meantime
brought grist to the mill by telling fortunes and casting nativities or
granting attendant sylphs to any ladies who would pay sufficiently for
their services what was still better as tending to keep up the credit of
her husband she gave the most magnificent parties in bourdeaux
but as at strasbourg the popular delusion lasted for a few months only
and burned itself out cagliostro forgot in the intoxication of success
that there was a limit to quackery which once passed inspired distrust
when he pretended to call spirits from the tomb people became
incredulous he was accused of being an enemy to religion of denying
christ and of being the wandering jew he despised these rumours as long
as they were confined to a few but when they spread over the town when
he received no more fees when his parties were abandoned and his
acquaintance turned away when they met him in the street he thought it
high time to shift his quarters

he was by this time wearied of the provinces and turned his thoughts to
the capital on his arrival he announced himself as the restorer of
egyptian freemasonry and the founder of a new philosophy he immediately
made his way into the best society by means of his friend the cardinal de
rohan his success as a magician was quite extraordinary the most
considerable persons of the time visited him he boasted of being able
like the rosicrucians to converse with the elementary spirits to invoke
the mighty dead from the grave to transmute metals and to discover
occult things by means of the special protection of god towards him like
dr dee he summoned the angels to reveal the future and they appeared
and conversed with him in crystals and under glass bells48 there was
hardly says the biographie des contemporains a fine lady in paris
who would not sup with the shade of lucretius in the apartments of
cagliostro a military officer who would not discuss the art of war with
csar hannibal or alexander or an advocate or counsellor who would not
argue legal points with the ghost of cicero these interviews with the
departed were very expensive for as cagliostro said the dead would not
rise for nothing the countess as usual exercised all her ingenuity to
support her husbands credit she was a great favourite with her own sex
to many a delighted and wondering auditory of whom she detailed the
marvellous powers of cagliostro she said he could render himself
invisible traverse the world with the rapidity of thought and be in
several places at the same time49

he had not been long at paris before he became involved in the celebrated
affair of the queens necklace his friend the cardinal de rohan
enamoured of the charms of marie antoinette was in sore distress at her
coldness and the displeasure she had so often manifested against him
there was at that time a lady named la motte in the service of the queen
of whom the cardinal was foolish enough to make a confidant madame de la
motte in return endeavoured to make a tool of the cardinal and
succeeded but too well in her projects in her capacity of chamberwoman
or lady of honour to the queen she was present at an interview between
her majesty and m boehmer a wealthy jeweller of paris when the latter
offered for sale a magnificent diamond necklace valued at 1600000
francs or about 64000l sterling the queen admired it greatly but
dismissed the jeweller with the expression of her regret that she was too
poor to purchase it madame de la motte formed a plan to get this costly
ornament into her own possession and determined to make the cardinal de
rohan the instrument by which to effect it she therefore sought an
interview with him and pretending to sympathise in his grief for the
queens displeasure told him she knew a way by which he might be restored
to favour she then mentioned the necklace and the sorrow of the queen
that she could not afford to buy it the cardinal who was as wealthy as
he was foolish immediately offered to purchase the necklace and make a
present of it to the queen madame de la motte told him by no means to do
so as he would thereby offend her majesty his plan would be to induce
the jeweller to give her majesty credit and accept her promissory note
for the amount at a certain date to be hereafter agreed upon the
cardinal readily agreed to the proposal and instructed the jeweller to
draw up an agreement and he would procure the queens signature he
placed this in the hands of madame de la motte who returned it shortly
afterwards with the words bon bonapprouvmarie antoinette
written in the margin she told him at the same time that the queen was
highly pleased with his conduct in the matter and would appoint a meeting
with him in the gardens of versailles when she would present him with a
flower as a token of her regard the cardinal shewed the forged document
to the jeweller obtained the necklace and delivered it into the hands of
madame de la motte so far all was well her next object was to satisfy
the cardinal who awaited impatiently the promised interview with his
royal mistress there was at that time in paris a young woman named
doliva noted for her resemblance to the queen and madame de la motte
on the promise of a handsome reward found no difficulty in persuading her
to personate marie antoinette and meet the cardinal de rohan at the
evening twilight in the gardens of versailles the meeting took place
accordingly the cardinal was deceived by the uncertain light the great
resemblance of the counterfeit and his own hopes and having received the
flower from mademoiselle doliva went home with a lighter heart than had
beat in his bosom for many a day50
    50 the enemies of the unfortunate queen of france when the
         progress of the revolution embittered their animosity against
         her maintained that she was really a party in this
         transaction that she and not mademoiselle doliva met the
         cardinal and rewarded him with the flower and that the story
         above related was merely concocted between her la motte and
         others to cheat the jeweller of his 1600000 francs
in the course of time the forgery of the queens signature was discovered
boehmer the jeweller immediately named the cardinal de rohan and madame de
la motte as the persons with whom he had negotiated and they were both
arrested and thrown into the bastille la motte was subjected to a
rigorous examination and the disclosures she made implicating cagliostro
he was seized along with his wife and also sent to the bastille a story
involving so much scandal necessarily excited great curiosity nothing was
to be heard of in paris but the queens necklace with surmises of the
guilt or innocence of the several parties implicated the husband of
madame de la motte escaped to england and in the opinion of many took the
necklace with him and there disposed of it to different jewellers in
small quantities at a time but madame de la motte insisted that she had
entrusted it to cagliostro who had seized and taken it to pieces to
swell the treasures of his immense unequalled fortune she spoke of him
as an empiric a mean alchymist a dreamer on the philosophers stone a
false prophet a profaner of the true worship the selfdubbed count
cagliostro she further said that he originally conceived the project of
ruining the cardinal de rohan that he persuaded her by the exercise of
some magic influence over her mind to aid and abet the scheme and that
he was a robber a swindler and a sorcerer
after all the accused parties had remained for upwards of six months in
the bastille the trial commenced the depositions of the witnesses having
been heard cagliostro as the principal culprit was first called upon
for his defence he was listened to with the most breathless attention he
put himself into a theatrical attitude and thus begani am
oppressedi am accusedi am calumniated have i deserved this fate i
descend into my conscience and i there find the peace that men refuse me
i have travelled a great deali am known over all europe and a great
part of asia and africa i have every where shewn myself the friend of my
fellowcreatures my knowledge my time my fortune have ever been
employed in the relief of distress i have studied and practised medicine
but i have never degraded that most noble and most consoling of arts by
mercenary speculations of any kind though always giving and never
receiving i have preserved my independence i have even carried my
delicacy so far as to refuse the favours of kings i have given
gratuitously my remedies and my advice to the rich the poor have received
from me both remedies and money i have never contracted any debts and my
manners are pure and uncorrupted after much more selflaudation of the
same kind he went on to complain of the great hardships he had endured in
being separated for so many months from his innocent and loving wife who
as he was given to understand had been detained in the bastille and
perhaps chained in an unwholesome dungeon he denied unequivocally that he
had the necklace or that he had ever seen it and to silence the rumours
and accusations against him which his own secrecy with regard to the
events of his life had perhaps originated he expressed himself ready to
satisfy the curiosity of the public and to give a plain and full account
of his career he then told a romantic and incredible tale which imposed
upon no one he said he neither knew the place of his birth nor the name
of his parents but that he spent his infancy in medina in arabia and
was brought up under the name of acharat he lived in the palace of the
great muphti in that city and always had three servants to wait upon him
besides his preceptor named althotas this althotas was very fond of him
and told him that his father and mother who were christians and nobles
died when he was three months old and left him in the care of the muphti
he could never he said ascertain their names for whenever he asked
althotas the question he was told that it would be dangerous for him to
know some incautious expressions dropped by his preceptor gave him reason
to think they were from malta at the age of twelve he began his travels
and learned the various languages of the east he remained three years in
mecca where the cherif or governor shewed him so much kindness and
spoke to him so tenderly and affectionately that he sometimes thought
that personage was his father he quitted this good man with tears in his
eyes and never saw him afterwards but he was convinced that he was even
at that moment indebted to his care for all the advantages he enjoyed
whenever he arrived in any city either of europe or asia he found an
account opened for him at the principal bankers or merchants he could
draw upon them to the amount of thousands and hundreds of thousands and
no questions were ever asked beyond his name he had only to mention the
word acharat and all his wants were supplied he firmly believed that
the cherif of mecca was the friend to whom all was owing this was the
secret of his wealth and he had no occasion to resort to swindling for a
livelihood it was not worth his while to steal a diamond necklace when he
had wealth enough to purchase as many as he pleased and more magnificent
ones than had ever been worn by a queen of france as to the other charges
brought against him by madame de la motte he had but a short answer to
give she had called him an empiric he was not unfamiliar with the word
if it meant a man who without being a physician had some knowledge of
medicine and took no feeswho cured both rich and poor and took no
money from either he confessed that he was such a man that he was an
empiric she had also called him a mean alchymist whether he were an
alchymist or not the epithet mean could only be applied to those who
begged and cringed and he had never done either as regarded his being a
dreamer about the philosophers stone whatever his opinions upon that
subject might be he had been silent and had never troubled the public
with his dreams then as to his being a false prophet he had not always
been so for he had prophesied to the cardinal de rohan that madame de la
motte would prove a dangerous woman and the result had verified the
prediction he denied that he was a profaner of the true worship or that
he had ever striven to bring religion into contempt on the contrary he
respected every mans religion and never meddled with it he also denied
that he was a rosicrucian or that he had ever pretended to be three
hundred years of age or to have had one man in his service for a hundred
and fifty years in conclusion he said every statement that madame de la
motte had made regarding him was false and that she was mentiris
impudentissime which two words he begged her counsel to translate for
her as it was not polite to tell her so in french
such was the substance of his extraordinary answer to the charges against
him an answer which convinced those who were before doubtful that he was
one of the most impudent impostors that had ever run the career of
deception counsel were then heard on behalf of the cardinal de rohan and
madame de la motte it appearing clearly that the cardinal was himself the
dupe of a vile conspiracy and there being no evidence against cagliostro
they were both acquitted madame de la motte was found guilty and
sentenced to be publicly whipped and branded with a hot iron on the back
cagliostro and his wife were then discharged from custody on applying to
the officers of the bastille for the papers and effects which had been
seized at his lodgings he found that many of them had been abstracted he
thereupon brought an action against them for the recovery of his mss and
a small portion of the powder of transmutation before the affair could be
decided he received orders to quit paris within fourandtwenty hours
fearing that if he were once more enclosed in the dungeons of the bastille
he should never see daylight again he took his departure immediately and
proceeded to england on his arrival in london he made the acquaintance of
the notorious lord george gordon who espoused his cause warmly and
inserted a letter in the public papers animadverting upon the conduct of
the queen of france in the affair of the necklace and asserting that she
was really the guilty party for this letter lord george was exposed to a
prosecution at the instance of the french ambassador found guilty of
libel and sentenced to fine and a long imprisonment
cagliostro and the countess afterwards travelled in italy where they were
arrested by the papal government in 1789 and condemned to death the
charges against him were that he was a freemason a heretic and a
sorcerer this unjustifiable sentence was afterwards commuted into one of
perpetual imprisonment in the castle of st angelo his wife was allowed
to escape severer punishment by immuring herself in a nunnery cagliostro
did not long survive the loss of liberty preyed upon his
mindaccumulated misfortunes had injured his health and broken his
spirit and he died early in 1790 his fate may have been no better than
he deserved but it is impossible not to feel that his sentence for the
crimes assigned was utterly disgraceful to the government that pronounced
it
present state of alchymy
we have now finished the list of the persons who have most distinguished
themselves in this unprofitable pursuit among them are men of all ranks
characters and conditions the truthseeking but erring philosopher the
ambitious prince and the needy noble who have believed in it as well as
the designing charlatan who has not believed in it but has merely made
the pretension to it the means of cheating his fellows and living upon
their credulity one or more of all these classes will be found in the
foregoing pages it will be seen from the record of their lives that the
delusion was not altogether without its uses men in striving to gain too
much do not always overreach themselves if they cannot arrive at the
inaccessible mountaintop they may perhaps get half way towards it and
pick up some scraps of wisdom and knowledge on the road the useful
science of chemistry is not a little indebted to its spurious brother of
alchymy many valuable discoveries have been made in that search for the
impossible which might otherwise have been hidden for centuries yet to
come roger bacon in searching for the philosophers stone discovered
gunpowder a still more extraordinary substance van helmont in the same
pursuit discovered the properties of gas geber made discoveries in
chemistry which were equally important and paracelsus amidst his
perpetual visions of the transmutation of metals found that mercury was a
remedy for one of the most odious and excruciating of all the diseases
that afflict humanity
in our day little mention is made in europe of any new devotees of the
science though it is affirmed that one or two of our most illustrious men
of science do not admit the pursuit to be so absurd and vain as it has
been commonly considered in recent times the belief in witchcraft which
is scarcely more absurd still lingers in the popular mind but few are so
credulous as to believe that any elixir could make man live for centuries
or turn all our iron and pewter into gold alchymy in europe may be said
to be almost wholly exploded but in the east it still flourishes in as
great repute as ever recent travellers make constant mention of it
especially in china hindostan persia tartary egypt and arabia
modern prophecies
illustration a
an epidemic terror of the end of the world has several times spread over
the nations the most remarkable was that which seized christendom about
the middle of the tenth century numbers of fanatics appeared in france
germany and italy at that time preaching that the thousand years
prophesied in the apocalypse as the term of the worlds duration were
about to expire and that the son of man would appear in the clouds to
judge the godly and the ungodly the delusion appears to have been
discouraged by the church but it nevertheless spread rapidly among the
people51
    51 see gibbon and voltaire for further notice of this subject
the scene of the last judgment was expected to be at jerusalem in the
year 999 the number of pilgrims proceeding eastward to await the coming
of the lord in that city was so great that they were compared to a
desolating army most of them sold their goods and possessions before they
quitted europe and lived upon the proceeds in the holy land buildings of
every sort were suffered to fall into ruins it was thought useless to
repair them when the end of the world was so near many noble edifices
were deliberately pulled down even churches usually so well maintained
shared the general neglect knights citizens and serfs travelled
eastwards in company taking with them their wives and children singing
psalms as they went and looking with fearful eyes upon the sky which
they expected each minute to open to let the son of god descend in his
glory
during the thousandth year the number of pilgrims increased most of them
were smitten with terror as with a plague every phenomenon of nature
filled them with alarm a thunderstorm sent them all upon their knees in
midmarch it was the opinion that thunder was the voice of god
announcing the day of judgment numbers expected the earth to open and
give up its dead at the sound every meteor in the sky seen at jerusalem
brought the whole christian population into the streets to weep and pray
the pilgrims on the road were in the same alarm

fanatic preachers kept up the flame of terror every shooting star
furnished occasion for a sermon in which the sublimity of the approaching
judgment was the principal topic
the appearance of comets has been often thought to foretell the speedy
dissolution of this world part of this belief still exists but the comet
is no longer looked upon as the sign but the agent of destruction so
lately as in the year 1832 the greatest alarm spread over the continent of
europe especially in germany lest the comet whose appearance was then
foretold by astronomers should destroy the earth the danger of our globe
was gravely discussed many persons refrained from undertaking or
concluding any business during that year in consequence solely of their
apprehension that this terrible comet would dash us and our world to
atoms
during seasons of great pestilence men have often believed the prophecies
of crazed fanatics that the end of the world was come credulity is
always greatest in times of calamity during the great plague which
ravaged all europe between the years 1345 and 1350 it was generally
considered that the end of the world was at hand pretended prophets were
to be found in all the principal cities of germany france and italy
predicting that within ten years the trump of the archangel would sound
and the saviour appear in the clouds to call the earth to judgment
no little consternation was created in london in 1736 by the prophecy of
the famous whiston that the world would be destroyed in that year on the
13th of october crowds of people went out on the appointed day to
islington hampstead and the fields intervening to see the destruction
of london which was to be the beginning of the end a satirical account
of this folly is given in swifts miscellanies vol iii entitled a
true and faithful narrative of what passed in london on a rumour of the
day of judgment an authentic narrative of this delusion would be
interesting but this solemn witticism of pope and gay is not to be
depended upon
in the year 1761 the citizens of london were alarmed by two shocks of an
earthquake and the prophecy of a third which was to destroy them
altogether the first shock was felt on the 8th of february and threw
down several chimneys in the neighbourhood of limehouse and poplar the
second happened on the 8th of march and was chiefly felt in the north of
london and towards hampstead and highgate it soon became the subject of
general remark that there was exactly an interval of a month between the
shocks and a crackbrained fellow named bell a soldier in the life
guards was so impressed with the idea that there would be a third in
another month that he lost his senses altogether and ran about the
streets predicting the destruction of london on the 5th of april most
people thought that the first would have been a more appropriate day
but there were not wanting thousands who confidently believed the
prediction and took measures to transport themselves and families from
the scene of the impending calamity as the awful day approached the
excitement became intense and great numbers of credulous people resorted
to all the villages within a circuit of twenty miles awaiting the doom of
london islington highgate hampstead harrow and blackheath were
crowded with panicstricken fugitives who paid exorbitant prices for
accommodation to the housekeepers of these secure retreats such as could
not afford to pay for lodgings at any of those places remained in london
until two or three days before the time and then encamped in the
surrounding fields awaiting the tremendous shock which was to lay their
high city all level with the dust as happened during a similar panic in
the time of henry viii the fear became contagious and hundreds who had
laughed at the prediction a week before packed up their goods when they
saw others doing so and hastened away the river was thought to be a
place of great security and all the merchantvessels in the port were
filled with people who passed the night between the 4th and 5th on board
expecting every instant to see st pauls totter and the towers of
westminster abbey rock in the wind and fall amid a cloud of dust the
greater part of the fugitives returned on the following day convinced
that the prophet was a false one but many judged it more prudent to allow
a week to elapse before they trusted their dear limbs in london bell lost
all credit in a short time and was looked upon even by the most credulous
as a mere madman he tried some other prophecies but nobody was deceived
by them and in a few months afterwards he was confined in a lunatic
asylum
a panic terror of the end of the world seized the good people of leeds and
its neighbourhood in the year 1806 it arose from the following
circumstances a hen in a village close by laid eggs on which were
inscribed the words christ is coming great numbers visited the spot
and examined these wondrous eggs convinced that the day of judgment was
near at hand like sailors in a storm expecting every instant to go to
the bottom the believers suddenly became religious prayed violently and
flattered themselves that they repented them of their evil courses but a
plain tale soon put them down and quenched their religion entirely some
gentlemen hearing of the matter went one fine morning and caught the
poor hen in the act of laying one of her miraculous eggs they soon
ascertained beyond doubt that the egg had been inscribed with some
corrosive ink and cruelly forced up again into the birds body at this
explanation those who had prayed now laughed and the world wagged as
merrily as of yore
at the time of the plague in milan in 1630 of which so affecting a
description has been left us by ripamonte in his interesting work de
peste mediolani the people in their distress listened with avidity to
the predictions of astrologers and other impostors it is singular enough
that the plague was foretold a year before it broke out a large comet
appearing in 1628 the opinions of astrologers were divided with regard to
it some insisted that it was a forerunner of a bloody war others
maintained that it predicted a great famine but the greater number
founding their judgment upon its pale colour thought it portended a
pestilence the fulfilment of their prediction brought them into great
repute while the plague was raging
other prophecies were current which were asserted to have been delivered
hundreds of years previously they had a most pernicious effect upon the
mind of the vulgar as they induced a belief in fatalism by taking away
the hope of recoverythat greatest balm in every maladythey increased
threefold the ravages of the disease one singular prediction almost drove
the unhappy people mad an ancient couplet preserved for ages by
tradition foretold that in the year 1630 the devil would poison all
milan early one morning in april and before the pestilence had reached
its height the passengers were surprised to see that all the doors in the
principal streets of the city were marked with a curious daub or spot as
if a sponge filled with the purulent matter of the plaguesores had been
pressed against them the whole population were speedily in movement to
remark the strange appearance and the greatest alarm spread rapidly
every means was taken to discover the perpetrators but in vain at last
the ancient prophecy was remembered and prayers were offered up in all
the churches that the machinations of the evil one might be defeated
many persons were of opinion that the emissaries of foreign powers were
employed to spread infectious poison over the city but by far the greater
number were convinced that the powers of hell had conspired against them
and that the infection was spread by supernatural agencies in the mean
time the plague increased fearfully distrust and alarm took possession of
every mind  every thing was believed to have been poisoned by the devil
the waters of the wells the standing corn in the fields and the fruit
upon the trees it was believed that all objects of touch were poisoned
the walls of the houses the pavements of the streets and the very
handles of the doors the populace were raised to a pitch of ungovernable
fury a strict watch was kept for the devils emissaries and any man who
wanted to be rid of an enemy had only to say that he had seen him
besmearing a door with ointment his fate was certain death at the hands
of the mob an old man upwards of eighty years of age a daily frequenter
of the church of st antonio was seen on rising from his knees to wipe
with the skirt of his cloak the stool on which he was about to sit down a
cry was raised immediately that he was besmearing the seat with poison a
mob of women by whom the church was crowded seized hold of the feeble
old man and dragged him out by the hair of his head with horrid oaths
and imprecations he was trailed in this manner through the mire to the
house of the municipal judge that he might be put to the rack and forced
to discover his accomplices but he expired on the way many other victims
were sacrificed to the popular fury one mora who appears to have been
half a chemist and half a barber was accused of being in league with the
devil to poison milan his house was surrounded and a number of chemical
preparations were found the poor man asserted that they were intended as
preservatives against infection but some physicians to whom they were
submitted declared they were poison mora was put to the rack where he
for a long time asserted his innocence he confessed at last when his
courage was worn down by torture that he was in league with the devil and
foreign powers to poison the whole city that he had anointed the doors
and infected the fountains of water he named several persons as his
accomplices who were apprehended and put to a similar torture they were
all found guilty and executed moras house was rased to the ground and
a column erected on the spot with an inscription to commemorate his
guilt
while the public mind was filled with these marvellous occurrences the
plague continued to increase the crowds that were brought together to
witness the executions spread the infection among one another but the
fury of their passions and the extent of their credulity kept pace with
the violence of the plague every wonderful and preposterous story was
believed one in particular occupied them to the exclusion for a long
time of every other the devil himself had been seen he had taken a
house in milan in which he prepared his poisonous unguents and furnished
them to his emissaries for distribution one man had brooded over such
tales till he became firmly convinced that the wild nights of his own
fancy were realities he stationed himself in the marketplace of milan
and related the following story to the crowds that gathered round him he
was standing he said at the door of the cathedral late in the evening
and when there was nobody nigh he saw a darkcoloured chariot drawn by
six milkwhite horses stop close beside him the chariot was followed by
a numerous train of domestics in dark liveries mounted on darkcoloured
steeds in the chariot there sat a tall stranger of a majestic aspect his
long black hair floated in the windfire flashed from his large black
eyes and a curl of ineffable scorn dwelt upon his lips the look of the
stranger was so sublime that he was awed and trembled with fear when he
gazed upon him his complexion was much darker than that of any man he had
ever seen and the atmosphere around him was hot and suffocating he
perceived immediately that he was a being of another world the stranger
seeing his trepidation asked him blandly yet majestically to mount
beside him he had no power to refuse and before he was well aware that
he had moved he found himself in the chariot onwards they went with the
rapidity of the wind the stranger speaking no word until they stopped
before a door in the highstreet of milan there was a crowd of people in
the street but to his great surprise no one seemed to notice the
extraordinary equipage and its numerous train from this he concluded that
they were invisible the house at which they stopped appeared to be a
shop but the interior was like a vast halfruined palace he went with
his mysterious guide through several large and dimlylighted rooms in one
of them surrounded by huge pillars of marble a senate of ghosts was
assembled debating on the progress of the plague other parts of the
building were enveloped in the thickest darkness illumined at intervals
by flashes of lightning which allowed him to distinguish a number of
gibing and chattering skeletons running about and pursuing each other or
playing at leapfrog over one anothers backs at the rear of the mansion
was a wild uncultivated plot of ground in the midst of which arose a
black rock down its sides rushed with fearful noise a torrent of
poisonous water which insinuating itself through the soil penetrated to
all the springs of the city and rendered them unfit for use after he had
been shewn all this the stranger led him into another large chamber
filled with gold and precious stones all of which he offered him if he
would kneel down and worship him and consent to smear the doors and
houses of milan with a pestiferous salve which he held out to him he now
knew him to be the devil and in that moment of temptation prayed to god
to give him strength to resist his prayer was heardhe refused the
bribe the stranger scowled horribly upon hima loud clap of thunder
burst over his headthe vivid lightning flashed in his eyes and the next
moment he found himself standing alone at the porch of the cathedral he
repeated this strange tale day after day without any variation and all
the populace were firm believers in its truth repeated search was made to
discover the mysterious house but all in vain the man pointed out
several as resembling it which were searched by the police but the demon
of the pestilence was not to be found nor the hall of ghosts nor the
poisonous fountain but the minds of the people were so impressed with the
idea that scores of witnesses half crazed by disease came forward to
swear that they also had seen the diabolical stranger and had heard his
chariot drawn by the milkwhite steeds rumbling over the streets at
midnight with a sound louder than thunder
the number of persons who confessed that they were employed by the devil
to distribute poison is almost incredible an epidemic frenzy was abroad
which seemed to be as contagious as the plague imagination was as
disordered as the body and day after day persons came voluntarily forward
to accuse themselves they generally had the marks of disease upon them
and some died in the act of confession
during the great plague of london in 1665 the people listened with
similar avidity to the predictions of quacks and fanatics defoe says
that at that time the people were more addicted to prophecies and
astronomical conjurations dreams and old wives tales than ever they
were before or since almanacs and their predictions frightened them
terribly even the year before the plague broke out they were greatly
alarmed by the comet which then appeared and anticipated that famine
pestilence or fire would follow enthusiasts while yet the disease had
made but little progress ran about the streets predicting that in a few
days london would be destroyed
a still more singular instance of the faith in predictions occurred in
london in the year 1524 the city swarmed at that time with
fortunetellers and astrologers who were consulted daily by people of
every class in society on the secrets of futurity as early as the month
of june 1523 several of them concurred in predicting that on the 1st day
of february 1524 the waters of the thames would swell to such a height as
to overflow the whole city of london and wash away ten thousand houses
the prophecy met implicit belief it was reiterated with the utmost
confidence month after month until so much alarm was excited that many
families packed up their goods and removed into kent and essex as the
time drew nigh the number of these emigrants increased in january
droves of workmen might be seen followed by their wives and children
trudging on foot to the villages within fifteen or twenty miles to await
the catastrophe people of a higher class were also to be seen in wagons
and other vehicles bound on a similar errand by the middle of january at
least twenty thousand persons had quitted the doomed city leaving nothing
but the bare walls of their homes to be swept away by the impending
floods many of the richer sort took up their abode on the heights of
highgate hampstead and blackheath and some erected tents as far away as
waltham abbey on the north and croydon on the south of the thames
bolton the prior of st bartholomews was so alarmed that he erected
at a very great expense a sort of fortress at harrowonthehill which
he stocked with provisions for two months on the 24th of january a week
before the awful day which was to see the destruction of london he
removed thither with the brethren and officers of the priory and all his
household a number of boats were conveyed in wagons to his fortress
furnished abundantly with expert rowers in case the flood reaching so
high as harrow should force them to go farther for a restingplace many
wealthy citizens prayed to share his retreat but the prior with a
prudent forethought admitted only his personal friends and those who
brought stores of eatables for the blockade
at last the morn big with the fate of london appeared in the east the
wondering crowds were astir at an early hour to watch the rising of the
waters the inundation it was predicted would be gradual not sudden so
that they expected to have plenty of time to escape as soon as they saw
the bosom of old thames heave beyond the usual mark but the majority were
too much alarmed to trust to this and thought themselves safer ten or
twenty miles off the thames unmindful of the foolish crowds upon its
banks flowed on quietly as of yore the tide ebbed at its usual hour
flowed to its usual height and then ebbed again just as if twenty
astrologers had not pledged their words to the contrary blank were their
faces as evening approached and as blank grew the faces of the citizens
to think that they had made such fools of themselves at last night set
in and the obstinate river would not lift its waters to sweep away even
one house out of the ten thousand still however the people were afraid
to go to sleep many hundreds remained up till dawn of the next day lest
the deluge should come upon them like a thief in the night
on the morrow it was seriously discussed whether it would not be
advisable to duck the false prophets in the river luckily for them they
thought of an expedient which allayed the popular fury they asserted
that by an error a very slight one of a little figure they had fixed
the date of this awful inundation a whole century too early the stars
were right after all and they erring mortals were wrong the present
generation of cockneys was safe and london would be washed away not in
1524 but in 1624 at this announcement bolton the prior dismantled his
fortress and the weary emigrants came back
an eyewitness of the great fire of london in an account preserved among
the harleian mss in the british museum and published in the transactions
of the royal society of antiquaries relates another instance of the
credulity of the londoners the writer who accompanied the duke of york
day by day through the district included between the fleetbridge and the
thames states that in their efforts to check the progress of the flames
they were much impeded by the superstition of the people mother shipton
in one of her prophecies had said that london would be reduced to ashes
and they refused to make any efforts to prevent it53 a son of the
noted sir kenelm digby who was also a pretender to the gifts of prophecy
persuaded them that no power on earth could prevent the fulfilment of the
prediction for it was written in the great book of fate that london was
to be destroyed hundreds of persons who might have rendered valuable
assistance and saved whole parishes from devastation folded their arms
and looked on as many more gave themselves up with the less compunction
to plunder a city which they could not save54
   53 this prophecy seems to have been that set forth at length in
         the popular life of mother shipton
            when fate to england shall restore
             a king to reign as heretofore
             great death in london shall be though
             and many houses be laid low
    54 the london saturday journal of march 12th 1842 contains
         the followingan absurd report is gaining ground among the
         weakminded that london will be destroyed by an earthquake
         on the 17th of march or st patricks day this rumour is
         founded on the following ancient prophecies one professing
         to be pronounced in the year 1203 the other by dr dee the
         astrologer in 1598
            in eighteen hundred and fortytwo

                       1598 ms in the british museum
         the alarm of the population of london did not on this
         occasion extend beyond the wide circle of the uneducated
         classes but among them it equalled that recorded in the
         text it was soon afterwards stated that no such prophecy is
         to be found in the harleian ms
the prophecies of mother shipton are still believed in many of the rural
districts of england in cottages and servants halls her reputation is
great and she rules the most popular of british prophets among all the
uneducated or halfeducated portions of the community she is generally
supposed to have been born at knaresborough in the reign of henry vii
and to have sold her soul to the devil for the power of foretelling future
events though during her lifetime she was looked upon as a witch she yet
escaped the witchs fate and died peaceably in her bed at an extreme old
age near clifton in yorkshire a stone is said to have been erected to
her memory in the churchyard of that place with the following epitaph
   here lies she who never lied
    whose skill often has been tried
    her prophecies shall still survive
    and ever keep her name alive
never a day passed says her traditionary biography wherein she did
not relate something remarkable and that required the most serious
consideration people flocked to her from far and near her fame was so
great they went to her of all sorts both old and young rich and poor
especially young maidens to be resolved of their doubts relating to
things to come and all returned wonderfully satisfied in the explanations
she gave to their questions among the rest went the abbot of beverley
to whom she foretold the suppression of the monasteries by henry viii
his marriage with anne boleyn the fires for heretics in smithfield and
the execution of mary queen of scots she also foretold the accession of
james i adding that with him
   from the cold north
    every evil should come forth
on a subsequent visit she uttered another prophecy which in the opinion
of her believers still remains unfulfilled but may be expected to be
realised during the present century
   the time shall come when seas of blood
    shall mingle with a greater flood
    great noise there shall be heardgreat shouts and cries
    and seas shall thunder louder than the skies
    then shall three lions fight with three and bring
    joy to a people honour to a king
    that fiery year as soon as oer
    peace shall then be as before
    plenty shall every where be found
    and men with swords shall plough the ground
but the most famous of all her prophecies is one relating to london
thousands of persons still shudder to think of the woes that are to burst
over this unhappy realm when london and highgate are joined by one
continuous line of houses this junction which if the rage for building
lasts much longer in the same proportion as heretofore bids fair to be
soon accomplished was predicted by her shortly before her death
revolutionsthe fall of mighty monarchs and the shedding of much blood
are to signalise that event the very angels afflicted by our woes are
to turn aside their heads and weep for hapless britain
but great as is the fame of mother shipton she ranks but second in the
list of british prophets merlin the mighty merlin stands alone in his
high preeminencethe first and greatest as old drayton sings in his
polyolbion
   of merlin and his skill what region doth not hear
    the world shall still be full of merlin every year
    a thousand lingering years his prophecies have run
    and scarcely shall have end till time itself be done
spenser in his divine poem has given us a powerful description of this
renowned seer
                     who had in magic more insight
    than ever him before or after living wight
      for he by words could call out of the sky
        both sun and moon and make them him obey
      the land to sea and sea to mainland dry
        and darksome night he eke could turn to day
        huge hosts of men he could alone dismay
      and hosts of men and meanest things could frame
        whenso him list his enemies to fray
      that to this day for terror of his name
    the fiends do quake when any him to them does name
      and soothe men say that he was not the sonne
        of mortal sire or other living wighte
      but wondrously begotten and begoune
        by false illusion of a guileful sprite
        on a faire ladye nun
in these verses the poet has preserved the popular belief with regard to
merlin who is generally supposed to have been a contemporary of
vortigern opinion is divided as to whether he were a real personage or a
mere impersonation formed by the poetic fancy of a credulous people it
seems most probable that such a man did exist and that possessing
knowledge as much above the comprehension of his age as that possessed by
friar bacon was beyond the reach of his he was endowed by the wondering
crowd with the supernatural attributes that spenser has enumerated
geoffrey of monmouth translated merlins poetical odes or prophecies
into latin prose and he was much reverenced not only by geoffrey but by
most of the old annalists in a life of merlin with his prophecies and
predictions interpreted and made good by our english annals by thomas
heywood published in the reign of charles i we find several of these
pretended prophecies they seem however to have been all written by
heywood himself they are in terms too plain and positive to allow any one
to doubt for a moment of their having been composed ex post facto
speaking of richard i he says
   the lions heart will gainst the saracen rise
    and purchase from him many a glorious prize
    the rose and lily shall at first unite
    but parting of the prey prove opposite      
    but while abroad these great acts shall be done
    all things at home shall to disorder run
    cooped up and caged then shall the lion be
    but after sufferance ransomed and set free
the simpleminded thomas heywood gravely goes on to inform us that all
these things actually came to pass upon richard iii he is equally
luminous he says
   a hunchbacked monster who with teeth is born
    the mockery of art and natures scorn
    who from the womb preposterously is hurled
    and with feet forward thrust into the world
    shall from the lower earth on which he stood
    wade every step he mounts kneedeep in blood
    he shall to th height of all his hopes aspire
    and clothed in state his ugly shape admire
    but when he thinks himself most safe to stand
    from foreign parts a native whelp shall land
another of these prophecies after the event tells us that henry
viii should take the power from rome and bring it home unto
his british bower that he should root out from the land all the
razored skulls and that he should neither spare man in his rage
nor woman in his lust and that in the time of his next successor
but one there should come in the fagot and the stake master
heywood closes merlins prophecies at his own day and does not give
even a glimpse of what was to befall england after his decease many
other prophecies besides those quoted by him were he says dispersed
abroad in his day under the name of merlin but he gives
his readers a taste of one only and that is the following
   when hempe is ripe and ready to pull
    then englishman beware thy skull
this prophecy which one would think ought to have put him in mind of
the gallows at that time the not unusual fate of false prophets he
explains thus in this word hempe be five letters now by reckoning the
five successive princes from henry viii this prophecy is easily
explained h signifieth king henry beforenamed e edward his son the
sixth of that name m mary who succeeded him p philip of spain who
by marrying queen mary participated with her in the english diadem and
lastly e signifieth queen elizabeth after whose death there was a great
feare that some troubles might have arisen about the crown as this did
not happen heywood who was a sly rogue in a small way gets out of the
scrape by saying yet proved this augury true though not according to
the former expectation for after the peaceful inauguration of king
james there was great mortality not in london only but through the
whole kingdom and from which the nation was not quite clean in seven
years after
this is not unlike the subterfuge of peter of pontefract who had
prophesied the death and deposition of king john and who was hanged by
that monarch for his pains a very graphic and amusing account of this
pretended prophet is given by grafton in his chronicles of
england55 in the meanwhile says he the priestes within england
had provided them a false and counterfeated prophet called peter
wakefielde a yorkshire man who was an hermite an idle gadder about and
a pratlyng marchant now to bring this peter in credite and the kyng out
of all credite with his people diverse vaine persons bruted dayly among
the commons of the realme that christe had twice appered unto him in the
shape of a childe betwene the priestes handes once at yorke another
tyme at pomfret and that he had breathed upon him thrice saying
peace peace peace and teachyng many things which he anon declared
to the bishops and bid the people amend their naughtie living being rapt
also in spirite they sayde he behelde the joyes of heaven and sorrowes of
hell for scant were there three in the realme sayde he that lived
christianly
    55 chronicles of england by richard grafton london 1568
         p 106
this counterfeated soothsayer prophesied of king john that he should
reigne no longer than the ascensionday next followyng which was in the
yere of our lord 1211 and was the thirteenth yere from his coronation
and this he said he had by revelation then it was of him demanded
whether he should be slaine or be deposed or should voluntarily give over
the crowne he aunswered that he could not tell but of this he was sure
he sayd that neither he nor any of his stock or lineage should reigne
after that day
the king hering of this laughed much at it and made but a scoff
thereat tush saith he it is but an ideot knave and such an one as
lacketh his right wittes but when this foolish prophet had so escaped
the daunger of the kinges displeasure and that he made no more of it he
gate him abroad and prated thereof at large as he was a very idle
vagabond and used to trattle and talke more than ynough so that they
which loved the king caused him anon after to be apprehended as a
malefactor and to be throwen in prison the king not yet knowing thereof
anone after the fame of this phantasticall prophet went all the realme
over and his name was knowen every where as foolishnesse is much
regarded of the people where wisdome is not in place specially because
he was then imprisoned for the matter the rumour was the larger their
wonderynges were the wantoner their practises the foolisher their busye
talkes and other idle doinges the greater continually from thence as the
rude manner of people is old gossyps tales went abroad new tales were
invented fables were added to fables and lyes grew upon lyes so that
every daye newe slanders were laide upon the king and not one of them
true rumors arose blasphemyes were sprede the enemyes rejoyced and
treasons by the priestes were mainteyned and what lykewise was surmised
or other subtiltye practised all was then fathered upon this foolish
prophet as thus saith peter wakefield thus hath he prophesied and
thus it shall come to pass yea many times when he thought nothing
lesse and when the ascensionday was come which was prophecyed of
before king john commanded his royal tent to be spread in the open
fielde passing that day with his noble counseyle and men of honour in the
greatest solemnitie that ever he did before solacing himself with
musickale instrumentes and songs most in sight among his trustie
friendes when that day was paste in all prosperitie and myrth his
enemyes being confused turned all into an allegorical understanding to
make the prophecie good and sayde he is no longer king for the pope
reigneth and not he king john was labouring under a sentence of
excommunication at the time
then was the king by his council perswaded that this false prophet had
troubled the realme perverted the heartes of the people and raysed the
commons against him for his wordes went over the sea by the help of his
prelates and came to the french kings eare and gave to him a great
encouragement to invade the lande he had not else done it so sodeinely
but he was most fowly deceived as all they are and shall be that put
their trust in such dark drowsye dreames of hipocrites the king therefore
commended that he should be hanged up and his sonne also with him lest
any more false prophets should arise of that race
heywood who was a great stickler for the truth of all sorts of
prophecies gives a much more favourable account of this peter of pomfret
or pontefract whose fate he would in all probability have shared if he
had had the misfortune to have flourished in the same age he says that
peter who was not only a prophet but a bard predicted divers of king
johns disasters which fell out accordingly on being taxed for a lying
prophet in having predicted that the king would be deposed before he
entered into the fifteenth year of his reign he answered him boldly that
all he had said was justifiable and true for that having given up his
crown to the pope and paying him an annual tribute the pope reigned and
not he heywood thought this explanation to be perfectly satisfactory and
the prophets faith for ever established
but to return to merlin of him even to this day it may be said in the
words which burns has applied to another notorious personage
   great was his power and great his fame
    far kenned and noted is his name
his reputation is by no means confined to the land of his birth but
extends through most of the nations of europe a very curious volume of
his life prophecies and miracles written it is supposed by robert
de bosron was printed at paris in 1498 which states that the devil
himself was his father and that he spoke the instant he was born and
assured his mother a very virtuous young woman that she should not die
in childbed with him as her illnatured neighbours had predicted the
judge of the district hearing of so marvellous an occurrence summoned
both mother and child to appear before him and they went accordingly the
same day to put the wisdom of the young prophet most effectually to the
test the judge asked him if he knew his own father to which the infant
merlin replied in a clear sonorous voice yes my father is the devil
and i have his power and know all things past present and to come
his worship clapped his hands in astonishment and took the prudent
resolution of not molesting so awful a child or its mother either
early tradition attributes the building of stonehenge to the power of
merlin it was believed that those mighty stones were whirled through the
air at his command from ireland to salisbury plain and that he arranged
them in the form in which they now stand to commemorate for ever the
unhappy fate of three hundred british chiefs who were massacred on that
spot by the saxons
at abergwylly near carmarthen is still shewn the cave of the prophet and
the scene of his incantations how beautiful is the description of it
given by spenser in his faerie queene the lines need no apology for
their repetition here and any sketch of the great prophet of britain
would be incomplete without them
     there the wise merlin whilom wont they say
        to make his wonne low underneath the ground
      in a deep delve far from the view of day
        that of no living wight he mote be found
    whenso he counselled with his sprites encompassed round
      and if thou ever happen that same way
        to travel go to see that dreadful place
      it is a hideous hollow cave they say
        under a rock that lies a little space
        from the swift barry tumbling down apace
      amongst the woody hills of dynevoure
        but dare thou not i charge in any case
      to enter into that same baleful bower
    for fear the cruel fiendes should thee unwares devour
    but standing high aloft low lay thine eare
        and there such ghastly noise of iron chaines
      and brazen caudrons thou shalt rombling heare
        which thousand sprites with longenduring paines
        doe tosse that it will stun thy feeble braines
      and often times great groans and grievous stownds
        when too huge toile and labour them constraines
      and often times loud strokes and ringing sounds
    from under that deep rock most horribly rebounds
    the cause they say is this a little while
        before that merlin died he did intend
      a brazen wall in compass to compile
        about cayr merdin and did it commend
        unto these sprites to bring to perfect end
      during which work the lady of the lake
        whom long he loved for him in haste did send
      who thereby forced his workmen to forsake
    them bound till his return their labour not to slake
    in the mean time through that false ladies traine
        he was surprised and buried under biere
      ne ever to his work returned again
        natheless these fiendes may not their work forbeare
        so greatly his commandement they fear
      but there doe toile and travaile day and night
        until that brazen wall they up doe reare56

amongst other english prophets a belief in whose power has not been
entirely effaced by the light of advancing knowledge is robert nixon the
cheshire idiot a contemporary of mother shipton the popular accounts of
this man say that he was born of poor parents not far from vale royal
on the edge of the forest of delamere he was brought up to the plough
but was so ignorant and stupid that nothing could be made of him every
body thought him irretrievably insane and paid no attention to the
strange unconnected discourses which he held many of his prophecies are
believed to have been lost in this manner but they were not always
destined to be wasted upon dull and inattentive ears an incident occurred
which brought him into notice and established his fame as a prophet of
the first calibre he was ploughing in a field when he suddenly stopped
from his labour and with a wild look and strange gesture exclaimed
now dick now harry o ill done dick o well done harry harry has
gained the day his fellowlabourers in the field did not know what to
make of this rhapsody but the next day cleared up the mystery news was
brought by a messenger in hot haste that at the very instant when nixon
had thus ejaculated richard iii had been slain at the battle of
bosworth and henry vii proclaimed king of england
it was not long before the fame of the new prophet reached the ears of the
king who expressed a wish to see and converse with him a messenger was
accordingly despatched to bring him to court but long before he reached
cheshire nixon knew and dreaded the honours that awaited him indeed it
was said that at the very instant the king expressed the wish nixon was
by supernatural means made acquainted with it and that he ran about the
town of over in great distress of mind calling out like a madman that
henry had sent for him and that he must go to court and be clammed
that is starved to death these expressions excited no little wonder
but on the third day the messenger arrived and carried him to court
leaving on the minds of the good people of cheshire an impression that
their prophet was one of the greatest ever born on his arrival king henry
appeared to be troubled exceedingly at the loss of a valuable diamond and
asked nixon if he could inform him where it was to be found henry had
hidden the diamond himself with a view to test the prophets skill
great therefore was his surprise when nixon answered him in the words of
the old proverb those who hide can find from that time forth the king
implicitly believed that he had the gift of prophecy and ordered all his
words to be taken down
during all the time of his residence at court he was in constant fear of
being starved to death and repeatedly told the king that such would be
his fate if he were not allowed to depart and return into his own
country henry would not suffer it but gave strict orders to all his
officers and cooks to give him as much to eat as he wanted he lived so
well that for some time he seemed to be thriving like a noblemans
steward and growing as fat as an alderman one day the king went out
hunting when nixon ran to the palace gate and entreated on his knees
that he might not be left behind to be starved the king laughed and
calling an officer told him to take especial care of the prophet during
his absence and rode away to the forest after his departure the
servants of the palace began to jeer at and insult nixon whom they
imagined to be much better treated than he deserved nixon complained to
the officer who to prevent him from being further molested locked him
up in the kings own closet and brought him regularly his four meals a
day but it so happened that a messenger arrived from the king to this
officer requiring his immediate presence at winchester on a matter of
life and death so great was his haste to obey the kings command that he
mounted on the horse behind the messenger and rode off without bestowing
a thought upon poor nixon he did not return till three days afterwards
when remembering the prophet for the first time he went to the kings
closet and found him lying upon the floor starved to death as he had
predicted
among the prophecies of his which are believed to have been fulfilled are
the following which relate to the times of the pretender
   a great man shall come into england
    but the son of a king
    shall take from him the victory
   crows shall drink the blood of many nobles
    and the north shall rise against the south
   the coek of the north shall be made to flee
    and his feather be plucked for his pride
    that he shall almost curse the day that he was born
all these say his admirers are as clear as the sun at noonday the
first denotes the defeat of prince charles edward at the battle of
culloden by the duke of cumberland the second the execution of lords
derwentwater balmerino and lovat and the third the retreat of the
pretender from the shores of britain among the prophecies that still
remain to be accomplished are the following
   between seven eight and nine
    in england wonders shall be seen
    between nine and thirteen
    all sorrow shall be done
   through our own money and our men
    shall a dreadful war begin
    between the sickle and the suck
    all england shall have a pluck
foreign nations shall invade england with snow on their helmets and
shall bring plague famine and murder in the skirts of their garments
the town of nantwich shall be swept away by a flood
of the two first of these no explanation has yet been attempted but some
event or other will doubtless be twisted into such a shape as will fit
them the third relative to the invasion of england by a nation with snow
on their helmets is supposed by the old women to foretell most clearly a
coming war with russia as to the last there are not a few in the town
mentioned who devoutly believe that such will be its fate happily for
their peace of mind the prophet said nothing of the year that was to
witness the awful calamity so that they think it as likely to be two
centuries hence as now
the popular biographers of nixon conclude their account of him by saying
that his prophecies are by some persons thought fables yet by what has
come to pass it is now thought and very plainly appears that most of
them have proved or will prove true for which we on all occasions
ought not only to exert our utmost might to repel by force our enemies
but to refrain from our abandoned and wicked course of life and to make
our continual prayer to god for protection and safety to this though a
non sequitur every one will cry amen
besides the prophets there have been the almanacmakers lilly poor
robin partridge and francis moore physician in england and matthew
laensbergh in france and belgium but great as were their pretensions
they were modesty itself in comparison with merlin shipton and nixon
who fixed their minds upon higher things than the weather and were not so
restrained as to prophesy for only one year at a time after such prophets
the almanacmakers hardly deserve to be mentioned not even the renowned
partridge whose prognostications set all england agog in 1708 and whose
death while still alive was so pleasantly and satisfactorily proved by
isaac bickerstaff the anticlimax would be too palpable and they and
their doings must be left uncommemorated

in accordance with the plan laid down we proceed to the consideration of
the follies into which men have been led by their eager desire to pierce
the thick darkness of futurity god himself for his own wise purposes
has more than once undrawn the impenetrable veil which shrouds those awful
secrets and for purposes just as wise he has decreed that except in
these instances ignorance shall be our lot for ever it is happy for man
that he does not know what the morrow is to bring forth but unaware of
this great blessing he has in all ages of the world presumptuously
endeavoured to trace the events of unborn centuries and anticipate the
march of time he has reduced this presumption into a study he has
divided it into sciences and systems without number employing his whole
life in the vain pursuit upon no subject has it been so easy to deceive
the world as upon this in every breast the curiosity exists in a greater
or less degree and can only be conquered by a long course of
selfexamination and a firm reliance that the future would not be hidden
from our sight if it were right that we should be acquainted with it
an undue opinion of our own importance in the scale of creation is at the
bottom of all our unwarrantable notions in this respect how flattering to
the pride of man to think that the stars in their courses watch over him
and typify by their movements and aspects the joys or the sorrows that
await him he less in proportion to the universe than the allbut
invisible insects that feed in myriads on a summers leaf are to this
great globe itself fondly imagines that eternal worlds were chiefly
created to prognosticate his fate how we should pity the arrogance of the
worm that crawls at our feet if we knew that it also desired to know the
secrets of futurity and imagined that meteors shot athwart the sky to
warn it that a tomtit was hovering near to gobble it up that storms and
earthquakes the revolutions of empires or the fall of mighty monarchs
only happened to predict its birth its progress and its decay not a
whit less presuming has man shewn himself not a whit less arrogant are
the sciences so called of astrology augury necromancy geomancy
palmistry and divination of every kind
leaving out of view the oracles of pagan antiquity and religious
predictions in general and confining ourselves solely to the persons who
in modern times have made themselves most conspicuous in foretelling the
future we shall find that the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were
the golden age of these impostors many of them have been already
mentioned in their character of alchymists the union of the two
pretensions is not at all surprising it was to be expected that those who
assumed a power so preposterous as that of prolonging the life of man for
several centuries should pretend at the same time to foretell the
events which were to mark that preternatural span of existence the world
would as readily believe that they had discovered all secrets as that
they had only discovered one the most celebrated astrologers of europe
three centuries ago were alchymists agrippa paracelsus dr dee and
the rosicrucians all laid as much stress upon their knowledge of the days
to come as upon their pretended possession of the philosophers stone and
the elixir of life in their time ideas of the wonderful the diabolical
and the supernatural were rifer than ever they were before the devil or
the stars were universally believed to meddle constantly in the affairs of
men and both were to be consulted with proper ceremonies those who were
of a melancholy and gloomy temperament betook themselves to necromancy and
sorcery those more cheerful and aspiring devoted themselves to astrology
the latter science was encouraged by all the monarchs and governments of
that age in england from the time of elizabeth to that of william and
mary judicial astrology was in high repute during that period flourished
drs dee lamb and forman with lilly booker gadbury evans and scores
of nameless impostors in every considerable town and village in the
country who made it their business to cast nativities aid in the
recovery of stolen goods prognosticate happy or unhappy marriages
predict whether journeys would be prosperous and note lucky moments for
the commencement of any enterprise from the setting up of a cobblers
shop to the marching of an army men who to use the words of butler did
   deal in destinys dark counsel
    and sage opinion of the moon sell
    to whom all people far and near
    on deep importance did repair
    when brass and pewter pots did stray
    and linen slunk out of the way
illustration henry andrews the original francis moore
in lillys memoirs of his life and times there are many notices of the
inferior quacks who then abounded and upon whom he pretended to look down
with supreme contempt not because they were astrologers but because they
debased that noble art by taking fees for the recovery of stolen property
from butlers hudibras and its curious notes we may learn what immense
numbers of these fellows lived upon the credulity of mankind in that age
of witchcraft and diablerie even in our day how great is the reputation
enjoyed by the almanacmakers who assume the name of francis moore but
in the time of charles i and the commonwealth the most learned the most
noble and the most conspicuous characters did not hesitate to consult
astrologers in the most open manner lilly whom butler has immortalised
under the name of sydrophel relates that he proposed to write a work
called an introduction to astrology in which he would satisfy the whole
kingdom of the lawfulness of that art many of the soldiers were for it
he says and many of the independent party and abundance of worthy men in
the house of commons his assured friends and able to take his part
against the presbyterians who would have silenced his predictions if they
could he afterwards carried his plan into execution and when his book
was published went with another astrologer named booker to the
headquarters of the parliamentary army at windsor where they were
welcomed and feasted in the garden where general fairfax lodged they were
afterwards introduced to the general who received them very kindly and
made allusion to some of their predictions he hoped their art was lawful
and agreeable to gods word but he did not understand it himself he did
not doubt however that the two astrologers feared god and therefore he
had a good opinion of them lilly assured him that the art of astrology
was quite consonant to the scriptures and confidently predicted from his
knowledge of the stars that the parliamentary army would overthrow all
its enemies in olivers protectorate this quack informs us that he wrote
freely enough he became an independent and all the soldiery were his
friends when he went to scotland he saw a soldier standing in front of
the army with a book of prophecies in his hand exclaiming to the several
companies as they passed by him lo hear what lilly saith you are in
this month promised victory fight it out brave boys and then read that
months prediction
after the great fire of london which lilly said he had foretold he was
sent for by the committee of the house of commons appointed to inquire
into the causes of the calamity in his monarchy or no monarchy
published in 1651 he had inserted an hieroglyphical plate representing on
one side persons in windingsheets digging graves and on the other a
large city in flames after the great fire some sapient member of the
legislature bethought him of lillys book and having mentioned it in the
house it was agreed that the astrologer should be summoned lilly
attended accordingly when sir robert brook told him the reason of his
summons and called upon him to declare what he knew this was a rare
opportunity for the vainglorious lilly to vaunt his abilities and he
began a long speech in praise of himself and his pretended science he
said that after the execution of charles i he was extremely desirous to
know what might from that time forth happen to the parliament and to the
nation in general he therefore consulted the stars and satisfied
himself the result of his judgment he put into emblems and hieroglyphics
without any commentary so that the true meaning might be concealed from
the vulgar and made manifest only to the wise imitating in this the
example of many wise philosophers who had done the like
did you foresee the year of the fire said a member no quoth lilly
nor was i desirous of that i made no scrutiny after some further
parley the house found they could make nothing of the astrologer and
dismissed him with great civility
one specimen of the explanation of a prophecy given by lilly and related
by him with much complacency will be sufficient to shew the sort of trash
by which he imposed upon the million in the year 1588 says he there
was a prophecy printed in greek characters exactly deciphering the long
troubles of the english nation from 1641 to 1660 and it ended thus and
after him shall come a dreadful dead man and with him a royal g of the
best blood in the world and he shall have the crown and shall set
england on the right way and put out all heresies the following is the
explanation of this oracular absurdity
monkery being extinguished above eighty or ninety years and the lord
generals name being monk is the dead man the royal g or c it is gamma
in the greek intending c in the latin being the third letter in the
alphabet is charles ii who for his extraction may be said to be of the
best blood of the world
in france and germany astrologers met even more encouragement than they
received in england in very early ages charlemagne and his successors
fulminated their wrath against them in common with sorcerers louis xi
that most superstitious of men entertained great numbers of them at his
court and catherine de medicis that most superstitious of women hardly
ever undertook any affair of importance without consulting them she
chiefly favoured her own countrymen and during the time she governed
france the land was overrun by italian conjurors necromancers and
fortunetellers of every kind but the chief astrologer of that day
beyond all doubt was the celebrated nostradamus physician to her
husband king henry ii he was born in 1503 at the town of st remi in
provence where his father was a notary he did not acquire much fame till
he was past his fiftieth year when his famous centuries a collection
of verses written in obscure and almost unintelligible language began to
excite attention they were so much spoken of in 1556 that henry ii
resolved to attach so skilful a man to his service and appointed him his
physician in a biographical notice of him prefixed to the edition of his
vraies centuries published at amsterdam in 1668 we are informed that
he often discoursed with his royal master on the secrets of futurity and
received many great presents as his reward besides his usual allowance
for medical attendance after the death of henry he retired to his native
place where charles ix paid him a visit in 1564 and was so impressed
with veneration for his wondrous knowledge of the things that were to be
not in france only but in the whole world for hundreds of years to come
that he made him a counsellor of state and his own physician besides
treating him in other matters with a royal liberality in fine
continues his biographer i should be too prolix were i to tell all the
honours conferred upon him and all the great nobles and learned men that
arrived at his house from the very ends of the earth to see and converse
with him as if he had been an oracle many strangers in fact came to
france for no other purpose than to consult him
illustration nostradamusfrom the frontispiece to a collection of his
prophecies published at amsterdam ad 1666
the prophecies of nostradamus consist of upwards of a thousand stanzas
each of four lines and are to the full as obscure as the oracles of old
they take so great a latitude both as to time and space that they are
almost sure to be fulfilled somewhere or other in the course of a few
centuries a little ingenuity like that evinced by lilly in his
explanation about general monk and the dreadful dead man might easily
make events to fit some of them58
    58 let us try in his second century prediction 66 he says
            from great dangers the captive is escaped
             a little time great fortune changed
             in the palace the people are caught
             by good augury the city is besieged
         what is this a believer might exclaim but the escape of
         napoleon from elbahis changed fortune and the occupation
         of paris by the allied armies
         let us try again in his third century prediction 98 he
         says
            two royal brothers will make fierce war on each other
             so mortal shall be the strife between them
             that each one shall occupy a fort against the other
             for their reign and life shall be the quarrel
         some lillius redivivus would find no difficulty in this
         prediction to use a vulgar phrase it is as clear as a
         pikestaff had not the astrologer in view don miguel and don
         pedro when he penned this stanza so much less obscure and
         oracular than the rest
he is to this day extremely popular in france and the walloon country of
belgium where old farmerwives consult him with great confidence and
assiduity
catherine di medicis was not the only member of her illustrious house who
entertained astrologers at the beginning of the fifteenth century there
was a man named basil residing in florence who was noted over all italy
for his skill in piercing the darkness of futurity it is said that he
foretold to cosmo di medicis then a private citizen that he would attain
high dignity inasmuch as the ascendant of his nativity was adorned with
the same propitious aspects as those of augustus csar and the emperor
charles v59 another astrologer foretold the death of prince alexander
di medicis and so very minute and particular was he in all the
circumstances that he was suspected of being chiefly instrumental in
fulfilling his own prophecya very common resource with these fellows to
keep up their credit he foretold confidently that the prince should die
by the hand of his own familiar friend a person of a slender habit of
body a small face a swarthy complexion and of most remarkable
taciturnity so it afterwards happened alexander having been murdered in
his chamber by his cousin lorenzo who corresponded exactly with the above
description60 the author of hermippus redivivus in relating this
story inclines to the belief that the astrologer was guiltless of any
participation in the crime but was employed by some friend of prince
alexander to warn him of his danger
    59 hermippus redivivus p 142
    60 jovii elog p 320
a much more remarkable story is told of an astrologer who lived in romagna
in the fifteenth century and whose name was antiochus tibertus61 at
that time nearly all the petty sovereigns of italy retained such men in
their service and tibertus having studied the mathematics with great
success at paris and delivered many predictions some of which for
guesses were not deficient in shrewdness was taken into the household of
pandolfo di malatesta the sovereign of rimini his reputation was so
great that his study was continually thronged either with visitors who
were persons of distinction or with clients who came to him for advice
and in a short time he acquired a considerable fortune notwithstanding
all these advantages he passed his life miserably and ended it on the
scaffold the following story afterwards got into circulation and has
been often triumphantly cited by succeeding astrologers as an irrefragable
proof of the truth of their science it was said that long before he
died he uttered three remarkable propheciesone relating to himself
another to his friend and the third to his patron pandolfo di malatesta
the first delivered was that relating to his friend guido di bogni one of
the greatest captains of the time guido was exceedingly desirous to know
his fortune and so importuned tibertus that the latter consulted the
stars and the lines on his palm to satisfy him he afterwards told him
with a sorrowful face that according to all the rules of astrology and
palmistry he should be falsely suspected by his best friend and should
lose his life in consequence guido then asked the astrologer if he could
foretell his own fate upon which tibertus again consulted the stars and
found that it was decreed from all eternity that he should end his days on
the scaffold malatesta when he heard these predictions so unlikely to
all present appearance to prove true desired his astrologer to predict
his fate also and to hide nothing from him however unfavourable it might
be tibertus complied and told his patron at that time one of the most
flourishing and powerful princes of italy that he should suffer great
want and die at last like a beggar in the common hospital of bologna and
so it happened in all three cases guido di bogni was accused by his own
fatherinlaw the count di bentivoglio of a treasonable design to
deliver up the city of rimini to the papal forces and was assassinated
afterwards by order of the tyrant malatesta as he sat at the
suppertable to which he had been invited in all apparent friendship the
astrologer was at the same time thrown into prison as being concerned in
the treason of his friend he attempted to escape and had succeeded in
letting himself down from his dungeonwindow into a moat when he was
discovered by the sentinels this being reported to malatesta he gave
orders for his execution on the following morning
    61 les anecdotes de florence ou lhistoire secrte de la
         maison di medicis p 318
malatesta had at this time no remembrance of the prophecy and his own
fate gave him no uneasiness but events were silently working its
fulfilment a conspiracy had been formed though guido di bogni was
innocent of it to deliver up rimini to the pope and all the necessary
measures having been taken the city was seized by the count de
valentinois in the confusion malatesta had barely time to escape from
his palace in disguise he was pursued from place to place by his enemies
abandoned by all his former friends and finally by his own children he
at last fell ill of a languishing disease at bologna and nobody caring
to afford him shelter he was carried to the hospital where he died the
only thing that detracts from the interest of this remarkable story is the
fact that the prophecy was made after the event
for some weeks before the birth of louis xiv an astrologer from germany
who had been sent for by the marshal de bassompierre and other noblemen of
the court had taken up his residence in the palace to be ready at a
moments notice to draw the horoscope of the future sovereign of france
when the queen was taken in labour he was ushered into a contiguous
apartment that he might receive notice of the very instant the child was
born the result of his observations were the three words diu dur
feliciter meaning that the newborn prince should live and reign long
with much labour and with great glory no prediction less favourable
could have been expected from an astrologer who had his bread to get and
who was at the same time a courtier a medal was afterwards struck in
commemoration of the event upon one side of which was figured the
nativity of the prince representing him as driving the chariot of apollo
with the inscription ortus solis gallicithe rising of the gallic sun
the best excuse ever made for astrology was that offered by the great
astronomer kepler himself an unwilling practiser of the art
he had many applications from his friends to cast nativities for them and
generally gave a positive refusal to such as he was not afraid of
offending by his frankness in other cases he accommodated himself to the
prevailing delusion in sending a copy of his ephemerides to professor
gerlach he wrote that they were nothing but worthless conjectures but
he was obliged to devote himself to them or he would have starved ye
overwise philosophers he exclaimed in his tertius interveniens ye
censure this daughter of astronomy beyond her deserts know ye not that
she must support her mother by her charms the scanty reward of an
astronomer would not provide him with bread if men did not entertain
hopes of reading the future in the heavens
necromancy was next to astrology the pretended science most resorted to
by those who wished to pry into the future the earliest instance upon
record is that of the witch of endor and the spirit of samuel nearly all
the nations of antiquity believed in the possibility of summoning departed
ghosts to disclose the awful secrets that god made clear to the
disembodied many passages in allusion to this subject will at once
suggest themselves to the classical reader but this art was never carried
on openly in any country all governments looked upon it as a crime of the
deepest dye while astrology was encouraged and its professors courted
and rewarded necromancers were universally condemned to the stake or the
gallows roger bacon albertus magnus arnold of villeneuve and many
others were accused by the public opinion of many centuries of meddling
in these unhallowed matters so deeprooted has always been the popular
delusion with respect to accusations of this kind that no crime was ever
disproved with such toil and difficulty that it met great encouragement
nevertheless is evident from the vast numbers of pretenders to it who
in spite of the danger have existed in all ages and countries
geomancy or the art of foretelling the future by means of lines and
circles and other mathematical figures drawn on the earth is still
extensively practised in asiatic countries but is almost unknown in
europe
augury from the flight or entrails of birds so favourite a study among
the romans is in like manner exploded in europe its most assiduous
professors at the present day are the abominable thugs of india
divination of which there are many kinds boasts a more enduring
reputation it has held an empire over the minds of men from the earliest
periods of recorded history and is in all probability coeval with time
itself it was practised alike by the jews the egyptians the chaldeans
the persians the greeks and the romans is equally known to all modern
nations in every part of the world and is not unfamiliar to the
untutored tribes that roam in the wilds of africa and america divination
as practised in civilised europe at the present day is chiefly from
cards the teacup and the lines on the palm of the hand gipsies alone
make a profession of it but there are thousands and tens of thousands of
humble families in which the goodwife and even the goodman resort to
the grounds at the bottom of their teacups to know whether the next
harvest will be abundant or their sow bring forth a numerous litter and
in which the young maidens look to the same place to know when they are to
be married and whether the man of their choice is to be dark or fair
rich or poor kind or cruel divination by cards so great a favourite
among the moderns is of course a modern science as cards do not yet
boast an antiquity of much more than four hundred years divination by the
palm so confidently believed in by half the village lasses in europe is
of older date and seems to have been known to the egyptians in the time
of the patriarchs as well as divination by the cup which as we are
informed in genesis was practised by joseph divination by the rod was
also practised by the egyptians in comparatively recent times it was
pretended that by this means hidden treasures could be discovered it now
appears to be altogether exploded in europe onomancy or the foretelling
a mans fate by the letters of his name and the various transpositions of
which they are capable is a more modern sort of divination but it
reckons comparatively few believers

oneirocriticism or the art of interpreting dreams is a relic of the
most remote ages which has subsisted through all the changes that moral
or physical revolutions have operated in the world the records of five
thousand years bear abundant testimony to the universal diffusion of the
belief that the skilful could read the future in dreams the rules of the
art if any existed in ancient times are not known but in our day one
simple rule opens the whole secret dreams say all the wiseacres in
christendom are to be interpreted by contraries thus if you dream of
filth you will acquire something valuable if you dream of the dead you
will hear news of the living if you dream of gold and silver you run a
risk of being without either and if you dream you have many friends you
will be persecuted by many enemies the rule however does not hold good
in all cases it is fortunate to dream of little pigs but unfortunate to
dream of big bullocks if you dream you have lost a tooth you may be sure
that you will shortly lose a friend and if you dream that your house is
on fire you will receive news from a far country if you dream of vermin
it is a sign that there will be sickness in your family and if you dream
of serpents you will have friends who in the course of time will prove
your bitterest enemies but of all dreams it is most fortunate if you
dream that you are wallowing up to your neck in mud and mire clear water
is a sign of grief and great troubles distress and perplexity are
predicted if you dream that you stand naked in the public streets and
know not where to find a garment to shield you from the gaze of the
multitude
in many parts of great britain and the continents of europe and america
there are to be found elderly women in the villages and countryplaces
whose interpretations of dreams are looked upon with as much reverence as
if they were oracles in districts remote from towns it is not uncommon to
find the members of a family regularly every morning narrating their
dreams at the breakfasttable and becoming happy or miserable for the day
according to their interpretation there is not a flower that blossoms or
fruit that ripens that dreamed of is not ominous of either good or evil
to such people every tree of the field or the forest is endowed with a
similar influence over the fate of mortals if seen in the nightvisions
to dream of the ash is the sign of a long journey and of an oak
prognosticates long life and prosperity to dream you stript the bark off
any tree is a sign to a maiden of an approaching loss of a character to
a married woman of a family bereavement and to a man of an accession of
fortune to dream of a leafless tree is a sign of great sorrow and of a
branchless trunk a sign of despair and suicide the eldertree is more
auspicious to the sleeper while the firtree better still betokens all
manner of comfort and prosperity the limetree predicts a voyage across
the ocean while the yew and the alder are ominous of sickness to the
young and of death to the old62 among the flowers and fruits charged

    62 it is quite astonishing to see the great demand there is
         both in england and france for dreambooks and other trash
         of the same kind two books in england enjoy an extraordinary
         popularity and have run through upwards of fifty editions in
         as many years in london alone besides being reprinted in
         manchester edinburgh glasgow and dublin one is mother
         bridgets dreambook and oracle of fate the other is the
         norwood gipsy it is stated on the authority of one who is
         curious in these matters that there is a demand for these
         works which are sold at sums varying from a penny to
         sixpence chiefly to servantgirls and imperfectlyeducated
         people all over the country of upwards of eleven thousand
         annually and that at no period during the last thirty years
         has the average number sold been less than this the total
         number during this period would thus amount to 330000
it should be observed that the rules for the interpretation of dreams are
far from being universal the cheeks of the peasant girl of england glow
with pleasure in the morning after she has dreamed of a rose while the
paysanne of normandy dreads disappointment and vexation for the very
same reason the switzer who dreams of an oaktree does not share in the
englishmans joy for he imagines that the vision was a warning to him
that from some trifling cause an overwhelming calamity will burst over
him thus do the ignorant and the credulous torment themselves thus do
they spread their nets to catch vexation and pass their lives between
hopes which are of no value and fears which are a positive evil
omens among the other means of selfannoyance upon which men have
stumbled in their vain hope of discovering the future signs and omens
hold a conspicuous place there is scarcely an occurrence in nature which
happening at a certain time is not looked upon by some persons as a
prognosticator either of good or evil the latter are in the greatest
number so much more ingenious are we in tormenting ourselves than in
discovering reasons for enjoyment in the things that surround us we go
out of our course to make ourselves uncomfortable the cup of life is not
bitter enough to our palate and we distil superfluous poison to put into
it or conjure up hideous things to frighten ourselves at which would
never exist if we did not make them we suffer says addison63 as
much from trifling accidents as from real evils i have known the shooting
of a star spoil a nights rest and have seen a man in love grow pale and
lose his appetite upon the plucking of a merrythought a screechowl at
midnight has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers nay the voice
of a cricket has struck more terror than the roaring of a lion there is
nothing so inconsiderable which may not appear dreadful to an imagination
that is filled with omens and prognostics a rusty nail or a crooked pin
shoot up into prodigies

the century and a quarter that has passed away since addison wrote has
seen the fall of many errors many fallacies and delusions have been
crushed under the foot of time since then but this has been left
unscathed to frighten the weakminded and embitter their existence a
belief in omens is not confined to the humble and uninformed a general
who led an army with credit has been known to feel alarmed at a
windingsheet in the candle and learned men who had honourably and
fairly earned the highest honours of literature have been seen to gather
their little ones around them and fear that one would be snatched away
because
    when stole upon the time the dead of night
    and heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes
a dog in the street was howling at the moon persons who would acknowledge
freely that the belief in omens was unworthy of a man of sense have yet
confessed at the same time that in spite of their reason they have been
unable to conquer their fears of death when they heard the harmless insect
called the deathwatch ticking in the wall or saw an oblong hollow coal
fly out of the fire
many other evil omens besides those mentioned above alarm the vulgar and
the weak if a sudden shivering comes over such people they believe that
at that instant an enemy is treading over the spot that will one day be
their grave if they meet a sow when they first walk abroad in the
morning it is an omen of evil for that day to meet an ass is in like
manner unlucky it is also very unfortunate to walk under a ladder to
forget to eat goose on the festival of st michael to tread upon a
beetle or to eat the twin nuts that are sometimes found in one shell
woe in like manner is predicted to that wight who inadvertently upsets
the salt each grain that is overthrown will bring to him a day of sorrow
if thirteen persons sit at table one of them will die within the year
and all of them will be unhappy of all evil omens this is the worst the
facetious dr kitchener used to observe that there was one case in which
he believed that it was really unlucky for thirteen persons to sit down to
dinner and that was when there was only dinner enough for twelve
unfortunately for their peace of mind the great majority of people do not
take this wise view of the matter in almost every country of europe the
same superstition prevails and some carry it so far as to look upon the
number thirteen as in every way ominous of evil and if they find thirteen
coins in their purse cast away the odd one like a polluted thing the
philosophic beranger in his exquisite song thirteen at table has
taken a poetical view of this humiliating superstition and mingled as is
his wont a lesson of genuine wisdom in his lay being at dinner he
overthrows the salt and looking round the room discovers that he is the
thirteenth guest while he is mourning his unhappy fate and conjuring up
visions of disease and suffering and the grave he is suddenly startled by
the apparition of death herself not in the shape of a grim foe with
skeletonribs and menacing dart but of an angel of light who shews the
folly of tormenting ourselves with the dread of her approach when she is
the friend rather than the enemy of man and frees us from the fetters
which bind us to the dust
if men could bring themselves to look upon death in this manner living
well and wisely till her inevitable approach how vast a store of grief
and vexation would they spare themselves
among good omens one of the most conspicuous is to meet a piebald horse
to meet two of these animals is still more fortunate and if on such an
occasion you spit thrice and form any reasonable wish it will be
gratified within three days it is also a sign of good fortune if you
inadvertently put on your stocking wrong side out if you wilfully wear
your stocking in this fashion no good will come of it it is very lucky
to sneeze twice but if you sneeze a third time the omen loses its power
and your good fortune will be nipped in the bud if a strange dog follow
you and fawn on you and wish to attach itself to you it is a sign of
very great prosperity just as fortunate is it if a strange male cat comes
to your house and manifests friendly intentions towards your family if a
she cat it is an omen on the contrary of very great misfortune if a
swarm of bees alight in your garden some very high honour and great joys
await you
besides these glimpses of the future you may know something of your fate
by a diligent attention to every itching that you may feel in your body
thus if the eye or the nose itches it is a sign you will be shortly
vexed if the foot itches you will tread upon strange ground and if the
elbow itches you will change your bedfellow itching of the right hand
prognosticates that you will soon have a sum of money and of the left
that you will be called upon to disburse it
these are but a few of the omens which are generally credited in modern
europe a complete list of them would fatigue from its length and sicken
from its absurdity it would be still more unprofitable to attempt to
specify the various delusions of the same kind which are believed among
oriental nations every reader will remember the comprehensive formula of
cursing preserved in tristram shandycurse a man after any fashion you
remember or can invent you will be sure to find it there the oriental
creed of omens is not less comprehensive every movement of the body
every emotion of the mind is at certain times an omen every form and
object in nature even the shape of the clouds and the changes of the
weather every colour every sound whether of men or animals or birds or
insects or inanimate things is an omen nothing is too trifling or
inconsiderable to inspire a hope which is not worth cherishing or a fear
which is sufficient to embitter existence
from the belief in omens springs the superstition that has from very
early ages set apart certain days as more favourable than others for
prying into the secrets of futurity the following copied verbatim from
the popular dream and omen book of mother bridget will shew the belief
of the people of england at the present day those who are curious as to
the ancient history of these observances will find abundant aliment in
the everyday book

we have now taken a hasty review of the various modes of seeking to
discover the future especially as practised in modern times the main
features of the folly appear essentially the same in all countries
national character and peculiarities operate some difference of
interpretation the mountaineer makes the natural phenomena which he most
frequently witnesses prognosticative of the future the dweller in the
plains in a similar manner seeks to know his fate among the signs of the
things that surround him and tints his superstition with the hues of his
own clime the same spirit animates them allthe same desire to know that
which infinite mercy has concealed there is but little probability that
the curiosity of mankind in this respect will ever be wholly eradicated
death and ill fortune are continual bugbears to the weakminded the
irreligious and the ignorant and while such exist in the world divines
will preach upon its impiety and philosophers discourse upon its absurdity
in vain still it is evident that these follies have greatly diminished
soothsayers and prophets have lost the credit they formerly enjoyed and
skulk in secret now where they once shewed their faces in the blaze of
day so far there is manifest improvement

illustration t
the wonderful influence of imagination in the cure of diseases is well
known a motion of the hand or a glance of the eye will throw a weak and
credulous patient into a fit and a pill made of bread if taken with
sufficient faith will operate a cure better than all the drugs in the
pharmacopoeia the prince of orange at the siege of breda in 1625 cured
all his soldiers who were dying of the scurvy by a philanthropic piece
of quackery which he played upon them with the knowledge of the
physicians when all other means had failed64 many hundreds of
instances of a similar kind might be related especially from the
history of witchcraft the mummeries strange gesticulations and
barbarous jargon of witches and sorcerers which frightened credulous and
nervous women brought on all those symptoms of hysteria and other similar
diseases so well understood now but which were then supposed to be the
work of the devil not only by the victims and the public in general but
by the operators themselves
    64 see van der myes account of the siege of breda the
         garrison being afflicted with scurvy the prince of orange
         sent the physicians two or three small phials containing a
         decoction of camomile wormwood and camphor telling them to
         pretend that it was a medicine of the greatest value and
         extremest rarity which had been procured with very much
         danger and difficulty from the east and so strong that two
         or three drops would impart a healing virtue to a gallon of
         water the soldiers had faith in their commander they took
         the medicine with cheerful faces and grew well rapidly they
         afterwards thronged about the prince in groups of twenty and
         thirty at a time praising his skill and loading him with
         protestations of gratitude
in the age when alchymy began to fall into some disrepute and learning to
lift up its voice against it a new delusion based upon this
power of imagination suddenly arose and found apostles among all the
alchymists numbers of them forsaking their old pursuits made themselves
magnetisers it appeared first in the shape of mineral and afterwards of
animal magnetism under which latter name it survives to this day and
numbers its dupes by thousands
the mineral magnetisers claim the first notice as the worthy predecessors
of the quacks of the present day the honour claimed for paracelsus of
being the first of the rosicrucians has been disputed but his claim to
be considered the first of the magnetisers can scarcely be challenged it
has been already mentioned of him in the part of this work which treats
of alchymy that like nearly all the distinguished adepts he was a
physician and pretended not only to make gold and confer immortality
but to cure all diseases he was the first who with the latter view
attributed occult and miraculous powers to the magnet animated apparently
by a sincere conviction that the magnet was the philosophers stone
which if it could not transmute metals could soothe all human suffering
and arrest the progress of decay he travelled for many years in persia
and arabia in search of the mountain of adamant so famed in oriental
fables when he practised as a physician at basle he called one of his
nostrums by the name of azotha stone or crystal which he said
contained magnetic properties and cured epilepsy hysteria and spasmodic
affections he soon found imitators his fame spread far and near and
thus were sown the first seeds of that error which has since taken root
and flourished so widely in spite of the denial of modern practitioners
this must be considered the origin of magnetism for we find that
beginning with paracelsus there was a regular succession of mineral
magnetisers until mesmer appeared and gave a new feature to the delusion
paracelsus boasted of being able to transplant diseases from the human
frame into the earth by means of the magnet he said there were six ways
by which this might be effected one of them will be quite sufficient as a
specimen if a person suffer from disease either local or general let
the following remedy be tried take a magnet impregnated with mummy65
and mixed with rich earth in this earth sow some seeds that have
a congruity or homogeneity with the disease then let this earth well
sifted and mixed with mummy be laid in an earthen vessel and let the
seeds committed to it be watered daily with a lotion in which the diseased
limb or body has been washed thus will the disease be transplanted from
the human body to the seeds which are in the earth having done this
transplant the seeds from the earthen vessel to the ground and wait till
they begin to sprout into herbs as they increase the disease will
diminish and when they have arrived at their full growth it will
disappear altogether
    65 mummies were of several kinds and were all of great use in
         magnetic medicines paracelsus enumerates six kinds of
         mummies the first four only differing in the composition
         used by different people for preserving their dead are the
         egyptian arabian pisasphaltos and libyan the fifth mummy
         of peculiar power was made from criminals that had been
         hanged for from such there is a gentle siccation that
         expungeth the watery humour without destroying the oil and
         spirituall which is cherished by the heavenly luminaries
         and strengthened continually by the affluence and impulses of
         the celestial spirits whence it may be properly called by
         the name of constellated or celestial mummie the sixth kind
         of mummy was made of corpuscles or spiritual effluences
         radiated from the living body though we cannot get very
         clear ideas on this head or respecting the manner in which
         they were caughtmedicina diatastica or sympathetical
         mummie abstracted from the works of paracelsus and
         translated out of the latin by fernando parkhurst gent
         london 1653 pp 2 7 quoted by the foreign quarterly
         review vol xii p 415
kircher the jesuit whose quarrel with the alchymists was the means of
exposing many of their impostures was a firm believer in the efficacy of
the magnet having been applied to by a patient afflicted with hernia he
directed the man to swallow a small magnet reduced to powder while he
applied at the same time to the external swelling a poultice made of
filings of iron he expected that by this means the magnet when it got to
the corresponding place inside would draw in the iron and with it the
tumour which would thus he said be safely and expeditiously reduced
as this new doctrine of magnetism spread it was found that wounds
inflicted with any metallic substance could be cured by the magnet in
process of time the delusion so increased that it was deemed sufficient
to magnetise a sword to cure any hurt which that sword might have
inflicted this was the origin of the celebrated weaponsalve which
excited so much attention about the middle of the seventeenth century the
following was the recipe given by paracelsus for the cure of any wounds
inflicted by a sharp weapon except such as had penetrated the heart the
brain or the arteries take of moss growing on the head of a thief who
has been hanged and left in the air of real mummy of human blood still
warmof each one ounce of human suet two ounces of linseed oil
turpentine and armenian boleof each two drachms mix all well in a
mortar and keep the salve in an oblong narrow urn with this salve the
weapon after being dipped in the blood from the wound was to be
carefully anointed and then laid by in a cool place in the mean time
the wound was to be duly washed with fair clean water covered with a
clean soft linen rag and opened once a day to cleanse off purulent or
other matter of the success of this treatment says the writer of
the able article on animal magnetism in the twelfth volume of the
foreign quarterly review there cannot be the least doubt for surgeons
at this moment follow exactly the same method except anointing the
weapon
the weaponsalve continued to be much spoken of on the continent and many
eager claimants appeared for the honour of the invention dr fludd or a
fluctibus the rosicrucian who has been already mentioned in a previous
part of this volume was very zealous in introducing it into england he
tried it with great success in several cases and no wonder for while he
kept up the spirits of his patients by boasting of the great efficacy of
the salve he never neglected those common but much more important
remedies of washing bandaging c which the experience of all ages had
declared sufficient for the purpose fludd moreover declared that the
magnet was a remedy for all diseases if properly applied but that man
having like the earth a north and a south pole magnetism could only
take place when his body was in a boreal position in the midst of his
popularity an attack was made upon him and his favourite remedy the
salve which however did little or nothing to diminish the belief in its
efficacy one parson foster wrote a pamphlet entitled hyplocrisma
spongus or a spunge to wipe away the weaponsalve in which he
declared that it was as bad as witchcraft to use or recommend such an
unguent that it was invented by the devil who at the last day would
seize upon every person who had given it the slightest encouragement in
fact said parson foster the devil himself gave it to paracelsus
paracelsus to the emperor the emperor to the courtier the courtier to
baptista porta and baptista porta to dr fludd a doctor of physic yet
living and practising in the famous city of london who now stands tooth
and nail for it dr fludd thus assailed took up the pen in defence of
his unguent in a reply called the squeezing of parson fosters spunge
wherein the spungebearers immodest carriage and behaviour towards his
brethren is detected the bitter flames of his slanderous reports are by
the sharp vinegar of truth corrected and quite extinguished and lastly
the virtuous validity of his spunge in wiping away theweaponsalve is
crushed out and clean abolished
shortly after this dispute a more distinguished believer in the
weaponsalve made his appearance in the person of sir kenelm digby the
son of sir everard digby who was executed for his participation in the
gunpowder plot this gentleman who in other respects was an
accomplished scholar and an able man was imbued with all the extravagant
notions of the alchymists he believed in the philosophers stone and
wished to engage descartes to devote his energies to the discovery
of the elixir of life or some other means by which the existence of man
might be prolonged to an indefinite period he gave his wife the
beautiful venetia anastasia stanley a dish of capons fed upon vipers
according to the plan supposed to have been laid down by arnold of
villeneuve in the hope that she might thereby preserve her loveliness for
a century if such a man once took up the idea of the weaponsalve it was
to be expected that he would make the most of it in his hands however
it was changed from an unguent into a powder and was called the powder
of sympathy he pretended that he had acquired the knowledge of it from a
carmelite friar who had learned it in persia or armenia from an oriental
philosopher of great renown king james the prince of wales the duke of
buchingham and many other noble personages believed in its efficacy the
following remarkable instance of his mode of cure was read by sir kenelm
to a society of learned men at montpellier mr james howell the
wellknown author of the dendrologia and of various letters coming by
chance as two of his best friends were fighting a duel rushed between
them and endeavoured to part them he seized the sword of one of the
combatants by the hilt while at the same time he grasped the other by
the blade being transported with fury one against the other they
struggled to rid themselves of the hindrance caused by their friend and
in so doing the one whose sword was held by the blade by mr howell drew
it away roughly and nearly cut his hand off severing the nerves and
muscles and penetrating to the bone the other almost at the same
instant disengaged his sword and aimed a blow at the head of his
antagonist which mr howell observing raised his wounded hand with the
rapidity of thought to prevent the blow the sword fell on the back of his
already wounded hand and cut it severely it seemed said sir kenelm
digby as if some unlucky star raged over them that they should have
both shed the blood of that dear friend for whose life they would have
given their own if they had been in their proper mind at the time
seeing mr howells face all besmeared with blood from his wounded hand
they both threw down their swords and embraced him and bound up his hand
with a garter to close the veins which were cut and bled profusely they
then conveyed him home and sent for a surgeon king james who was much
attached to mr howell afterwards sent his own surgeon to attend him we
must continue the narrative in the words of sir kenelm digby it was my
chance says he to be lodged hard by him and four or five days after
as i was making myself ready he came to my house and prayed me to view
his wounds for i understand said he that you have extraordinary
remedies on such occasions and my surgeons apprehend some fear
that it may grow to a gangrene and so the hand must be cut off in
effect his countenance discovered that he was in much pain which he
said was insupportable in regard of the extreme inflammation i told him
i would willingly serve him but if haply he knew the manner how i could
cure him without touching or seeing him it might be that he would not
expose himself to my manner of curing because he would think it
peradventure either ineffectual or superstitious he replied the many
wonderful things which people have related unto me of your way of
medicinement makes me nothing doubt at all of its efficacy and all that i
have to say unto you is comprehended in the spanish proverb hagase el
milagro y hagalo mahomalet the miracle be done though mahomet do it
i asked him then for any thing that had the blood upon it so he
presently sent for his garter wherewith his hand was first bound and as
i called for a basin of water as if i would wash my hands i took a
handful of powder of vitriol which i had in my study and presently
dissolved it as soon as the bloody garter was brought me i put it in the
basin observing in the interim what mr howell did who stood talking
with a gentleman in a corner of my chamber not regarding at all what i
was doing he started suddenly as if he had found some strange alteration
in himself i asked him what he ailed i know not what ails me but i
find that i feel no more pain methinks that a pleasing kind of freshness
as it were a wet cold napkin did spread over my hand which hath taken
away the inflammation that tormented me before i replied since then
you feel already so much good of my medicament i advise you to cast away
all your plasters only keep the wound clean and in a moderate temper
betwixt heat and cold this was presently reported to the duke of
buckingham and a little after to the king who were both very curious
to know the circumstances of the business which was that after dinner i
took the garter out of the water and put it to dry before a great fire
it was scarce dry before mr howells servant came running and saying
that his master felt as much burning as ever he had done if not more for
the heat was such as if his hand were betwixt coals of fire i answered
that although that had happened at present yet he should find ease in a
short time for i knew the reason of this new accident and would provide
accordingly for his master should be free from that inflammation it
might be before he could possibly return to him but in case he found no
ease i wished him to come presently back again if not he might forbear
coming thereupon he went and at the instant i did put the
garter again into the water thereupon he found his master without any
pain at all to be brief there was no cense of pain afterwards but
within five or six days the wounds were sicatrised and entirely healed
such is the marvellous story of sir kenelm digby other practitioners of
that age were not behind him in their pretensions it was not always
thought necessary to use either the powder of sympathy or the
weaponsalve to effect a cure it was sufficient to magnetise the sword
with the hand the first faint dawn of the animal theory to relieve
any pain the same weapon had caused they asserted that if they stroked
the sword upwards with their fingers the wounded person would feel
immediate relief but if they stroked it downwards he would feel
intolerable pain66
    66 reginald scott quoted by sir walter scott in the notes to
         the lay of the last minstrel c iii v xxiii
another very singular notion of the power and capabilities of magnetism
was entertained at the same time it was believed that a sympathetic
alphabet could be made on the flesh by means of which persons could
correspond with each other and communicate all their ideas with the
rapidity of volition although thousands of miles apart from the arms of
two persons a piece of flesh was cut and mutually transplanted while
still warm and bleeding the piece so severed grew to the new arm on which
it was placed but still retained so close a sympathy with its native
limb that its old possessor was always sensible of any injury done to it
upon these transplanted pieces were tatooed the letters of the alphabet
so that when a communication was to be made either of the persons
though the wide atlantic rolled between them had only to prick his arm
with a magnetic needle and straightway his friend received intimation
that the telegraph was at work whatever letter he pricked on his own arm
pained the same letter on the arm of his correspondent
contemporary with sir kenelm digby was the no less famous mr valentine
greatraks who without mentioning magnetism or laying claim to any
theory practised upon himself and others a deception much more akin to
the animal magnetism of the present day than the mineral magnetism it was
then so much the fashion to study he was the son of an irish gentleman
of good education and property in the county of cork he fell at an
early age into a sort of melancholy derangement after some time he had
an impulse or strange persuasion in his mind which continued to present
itself whether he were sleeping or waking that god had given him the
power of curing the kings evil he mentioned this persuasion to his wife
who very candidly told him that he was a fool he was not quite sure of
this notwithstanding the high authority from which it came and
determined to make trial of the power that was in him a few days
afterwards he went to one william maher of saltersbridge in the parish
of lismore who was grievously afflicted with the kings evil in his eyes
cheek and throat upon this man who was of abundant faith he laid his
hands stroked him and prayed fervently he had the satisfaction to see
him heal considerably in the course of a few days and finally with the
aid of other remedies to be quite cured this success encouraged him in
the belief that he had a divine mission day after day he had further
impulses from on high that he was called upon to cure the ague also in
the course of time he extended his powers to the curing of epilepsy
ulcers aches and lameness all the county of cork was in a commotion to
see this extraordinary physician who certainly operated some very great
benefit in cases where the disease was heightened by hypochondria and
depression of spirits according to his own account67 such great
multitudes resorted to him from divers places that he had no time to
follow his own business or enjoy the company of his family and friends
he was obliged to set aside three days in the week from six in the
morning till six at night during which time only he laid hands upon all
that came still the crowds which thronged around him were so great that
the neighbouring towns were not able to accommodate them he thereupon
left his house in the country and went to youghal where the resort of
sick people not only from all parts of ireland but from england
continued so great that the magistrates were afraid they would infect the
place by their diseases several of these poor credulous people no sooner
saw him than they fell into fits and he restored them by waving his hand
in their faces and praying over them nay he affirmed that the touch of
his glove had driven pains away and on one occasion cast out from a
woman several devils or evil spirits who tormented her day and night
every one of these devils says greatraks was like to choke her when
it came up into her throat it is evident from this that the womans
complaint was nothing but hysteria
    67 greatraks account of himself in a letter to the honourable
         robert boyle
the clergy of the diocese of lismore who seem to have had much clearer
notions of greatraks pretensions than their parishioners set their faces
against the new prophet and worker of miracles he was cited to appear in
the deans court and prohibited from laying on his hands for the future
but he cared nothing for the church he imagined that he derived his
powers direct from heaven and continued to throw people into
fits and bring them to their senses again as usual almost exactly after
the fashion of modern magnetisers his reputation became at last so
great that lord conway sent to him from london begging that he would
come over immediately to cure a grievous headache which his lady had
suffered for several years and which the principal physicians of england
had been unable to relieve
greatraks accepted the invitation and tried his manipulations and prayers
upon lady conway he failed however in affording any relief the poor
ladys headache was excited by causes too serious to allow her any help
even from faith and a lively imagination he lived for some months in lord
conways house at ragley in warwickshire operating cures similar to
those he had performed in ireland he afterwards removed to london and
took a house in lincolnsinn fields which soon became the daily resort
of all the nervous and credulous women of the metropolis a very amusing
account of greatraks at this time 1665 is given in the second volume of
the miscellanies of st evremond under the title of the irish prophet
it is the most graphic sketch ever made of this early magnetiser whether
his pretensions were more or less absurd than those of some of his
successors who have lately made their appearance among us would be hard
to say
when m de comminges says st evremond was ambassador from his most
christian majesty to the king of great britain there came to london an
irish prophet who passed himself off as a great worker of miracles some
persons of quality having begged m de comminges to invite him to his
house that they might be witnesses of some of his miracles the
ambassador promised to satisfy them as much to gratify his own curiosity
as from courtesy to his friends and gave notice to greatraks that he
would be glad to see him
a rumour of the prophets coming soon spread all over the town and the
hotel of m de comminges was crowded by sick persons who came full of
confidence in their speedy cure the irishman made them wait a
considerable time for him but came at last in the midst of their
impatience with a grave and simple countenance that showed no signs of
his being a cheat monsieur de comminges prepared to question him
strictly hoping to discourse with him on the matters that he had read of
in van helmont and bodinus but he was not able to do so much to his
regret for the crowd became so great and cripples and others pressed
around so impatiently to be the first cured that the servants were
obliged to use threats and even force before they could
establish order among them or place them in proper ranks
the prophet affirmed that all diseases were caused by evil spirits every
infirmity was with him a case of diabolical possession the first that was
presented to him was a man suffering from gout and rheumatism and so
severely that the physicians had been unable to cure him ah said the
miracleworker i have seen a good deal of this sort of spirits when i
was in ireland they are watery spirits who bring on cold shivering and
excite an overflow of aqueous humours in our poor bodies then addressing
the man he said evil spirit who hast quitted thy dwelling in the
waters to come and afflict this miserable body i command thee to quit thy
new abode and to return to thine ancient habitation this said the sick
man was ordered to withdraw and another was brought forward in his place
this new comer said he was tormented by the melancholy vapours in fact
he looked like a hypochondriac one of those persons diseased in
imagination and who but too often become so in reality aerial spirit
said the irishman return i command thee into the airexercise thy
natural vocation of raising tempests and do not excite any more wind in
this sad unlucky body this man was immediately turned away to make room
for a third patient who in the irishmans opinion was only tormented by
a little bit of a sprite who could not withstand his command for an
instant he pretended that he recognised this sprite by some marks which
were invisible to the company to whom he turned with a smile and said
this sort of spirit does not often do much harm and is always very
diverting to hear him talk one would have imagined that he knew all
about spiritstheir names their rank their numbers their employment
and all the functions they were destined to and he boasted of being much
better acquainted with the intrigues of demons than he was with the
affairs of men you can hardly imagine what a reputation he gained in a
short time catholics and protestants visited him from every part all
believing that power from heaven was in his hands
after relating a rather equivocal adventure of a husband and wife who
implored greatraks to cast out the devil of dissension which had crept in
between them st evremond thus sums up the effect he produced on the
popular mind so great was the confidence in him that the blind fancied
they saw the light which they did not seethe deaf imagined that they
heardthe lame that they walked straight and the paralytic that they had
recovered the use of their limbs an idea of health made the sick forget
for a while their maladies and imagination which was not less
active in those merely drawn by curiosity than in the sick gave a false
view to the one class from the desire of seeing as it operated a false
cure on the other from the strong desire of being healed such was the
power of the irishman over the mind and such was the influence of the
mind upon the body nothing was spoken of in london but his prodigies and
these prodigies were supported by such great authorities that the
bewildered multitude believed them almost without examination while more
enlightened people did not dare to reject them from their own knowledge
the public opinion timid and enslaved respected this imperious and
apparently wellauthenticated error those who saw through the delusion
kept their opinion to themselves knowing how useless it was to declare
their disbelief to a people filled with prejudice and admiration
about the same time that valentine greatraks was thus magnetising the
people of london an italian enthusiast named francisco bagnone was
performing the same tricks in italy and with as great success he had
only to touch weak women with his hands or sometimes for the sake of
working more effectively upon their fanaticism with a relic to make them
fall into fits and manifest all the symptoms of magnetism
besides these several learned men in different parts of europe directed
their attention to the study of the magnet believing that it might be
rendered efficacious in many diseases van helmont in particular
published a work on the effects of magnetism on the human frame and
balthazar gracian a spaniard rendered himself famous for the boldness of
his views on the subject the magnet said the latter attracts iron
iron is found every where every thing therefore is under the influence
of magnetism it is only a modification of the general principle which
establishes harmony or foments divisions among men it is the same agent
that gives rise to sympathy antipathy and the passions68
    68 introduction to the study of animal magnetism by baron
         dupotet de sennevoy p 315
baptista porta who in the whimsical genealogy of the weaponsalve given
by parson foster in his attack upon dr  fluctibus is mentioned as one
of its fathers had also great faith in the efficacy of the magnet and
operated upon the imagination of his patients in a manner which was then
considered so extraordinary that he was accused of being a magician and
prohibited from practising by the court of rome among others who
distinguished themselves by their faith in magnetism sebastian wirdig and
william maxwell claim especial notice wirdig was professor of medicine at
the university of rostock in mecklenburg and wrote a treatise
called the new medicine of the spirits which he presented to the royal
society of london an edition of this work was printed in 1673 in which
the author maintained that a magnetic influence took place not only
between the celestial and terrestrial bodies but between all living
things the whole world he said was under the influence of magnetism
life was preserved by magnetism death was the consequence of magnetism
maxwell the other enthusiast was an admiring disciple of paracelsus and
boasted that he had irradiated the obscurity in which too many of the
wonderworking recipes of that great philosopher were enveloped his works
were printed at frankfort in 1679 it would seem from the following
passage that he was aware of the great influence of imagination as well
in the production as in the cure of diseases if you wish to work
prodigies says he abstract from the materiality of beingsincrease
the sum of spirituality in bodiesrouse the spirit from its slumbers
unless you do one or other of these thingsunless you can bind the idea
you can never perform any thing good or great here in fact lies the
whole secret of magnetism and all delusions of a similar kind increase
the spiritualityrouse the spirit from its slumbers or in other words
work upon the imaginationinduce belief and blind confidence and you may
do any thing this passage which is quoted with approbation by m
dupotet69 in a work as strongly corroborative of the theory now
advanced by the animal magnetists is just the reverse if they believe
they can work all their wonders by the means so dimly shadowed forth by
maxwell what becomes of the universal fluid pervading all nature and
which they pretend to pour into weak and diseased bodies from the tips of
their fingers
    69 introduction to the study of animal magnetism p 318
early in the eighteenth century the attention of europe was directed to a
very remarkable instance of fanaticism which has been claimed by the
animal magnetists as a proof of their science the convulsionaries of st
medard as they were called assembled in great numbers round the tomb of
their favourite saint the jansenist priest paris and taught one another
how to fall into convulsions they believed that st paris would cure all
their infirmities and the number of hysterical women and weakminded
persons of all descriptions that flocked to the tomb from far and near was
so great as daily to block up all the avenues leading to it working
themselves up to a pitch of excitement they went off one after the other
into fits while some of them still in apparent possession of all their
faculties voluntarily exposed themselves to sufferings which on
ordinary occasions would have been sufficient to deprive them of life the
scenes that occurred were a scandal to civilisation and to religiona
strange mixture of obscenity absurdity and superstition while some were
praying on bended knees at the shrine of st paris others were shrieking
and making the most hideous noises the women especially exerted
themselves on one side of the chapel there might be seen a score of them
all in convulsions while at another as many more excited to a sort of
frenzy yielded themselves up to gross indecencies some of them took an
insane delight in being beaten and trampled upon one in particular
according to montgre whose account we quote70 was so enraptured with
this illusage that nothing but the hardest blows would satisfy her
while a fellow of herculean strength was beating her with all his might
with a heavy bar of iron she kept continually urging him to renewed
exertion the harder he struck the better she liked it exclaiming all the
while well done brother well done oh how pleasant it is what good
you are doing me courage my brother courage strike harder strike
harder still another of these fanatics had if possible a still greater
love for a beating carr de montgeron who relates the circumstance was
unable to satisfy her with sixty blows of a large sledgehammer he
afterwards used the same weapon with the same degree of strength for the
sake of experiment and succeeded in battering a hole in a stone wall at
the twentyfifth stroke another woman named sonnet laid herself down on
a redhot brazier without flinching and acquired for herself the nickname
of the salamander while others desirous of a more illustrious
martyrdom attempted to crucify themselves m deleuze in his critical
history of animal magnetism attempts to prove that this fanatical
frenzy was produced by magnetism and that these mad enthusiasts
magnetised each other without being aware of it as well might he insist
that the fanaticism which tempts the hindoo bigot to keep his arms
stretched in a horizontal position till the sinews wither or his fingers
closed upon his palms till the nails grow out of the backs of his hands
is also an effect of magnetism

for a period of sixty or seventy years magnetism was almost wholly
confined to germany men of sense and learning devoted their attention to
the properties of the loadstone and one father hell a jesuit and
professor of astronomy at the university of vienna rendered himself
famous by his magnetic cures about the year 1771 or 1772 he invented
steelplates of a peculiar form which he applied to the naked body as a
cure for several diseases in the year 1774 he communicated his system to
anthony mesmer the latter improved upon the ideas of father hell
constructed a new theory of his own and became the founder of animal
magnetism
it has been the fashion among the enemies of the new delusion to decry
mesmer as an unprincipled adventurer while his disciples have extolled
him to the skies as a regenerator of the human race in nearly the same
words as the rosicrucians applied to their founders he has been called
the discoverer of the secret which brings man into more intimate connexion
with his creator the deliverer of the soul from the debasing trammels of
the flesh the man who enables us to set time at defiance and conquer the
obstructions of space a careful sifting of his pretensions and
examination of the evidence brought forward to sustain them will soon
shew which opinion is the more correct that the writer of these pages
considers him in the light of a man who deluding himself was the means
of deluding others may be inferred from his finding a place in these
volumes and figuring among the flamels the agrippas the borris the
bhmens and the cagliostros
he was born in may 1734 at mersburg in swabia and studied medicine at
the university of vienna he took his degrees in 1766 and chose the
influence of the planets on the human body as the subject of his inaugural
dissertation having treated the matter quite in the style of the old
astrological physicians he was exposed to some ridicule both then and
afterwards even at this early period some faint ideas of his great theory
were germinating in his mind he maintained in his dissertation that the
sun moon and fixed stars mutually affect each other in their orbits
that they cause and direct in our earth a flux and reflux not only in the
sea but in the atmosphere and affect in a similar manner all organised
bodies through the medium of a subtile and mobile fluid which pervades
the universe and associates all things together in mutual intercourse and
harmony this influence he said was particularly exercised on the
nervous system and produced two states which he called intension and
remission which seemed to him to account for the different periodical
revolutions observable in several maladies when in afterlife he met with
father hell he was confirmed by that persons observations in the truth
of many of his own ideas having caused hell to make him some magnetic
plates he determined to try experiments with them himself for his further
satisfaction
he tried accordingly and was astonished at his success the faith of
their wearers operated wonders with the metallic plates mesmer made due
reports to father hell of all he had done and the latter published them
as the results of his own happy invention and speaking of mesmer as a
physician whom he had employed to work under him mesmer took offence at
being thus treated considering himself a far greater personage than
father hell he claimed the invention as his own accused hell of a breach
of confidence and stigmatised him as a mean person anxious to turn the
discoveries of others to his own account hell replied and a very pretty
quarrel was the result which afforded small talk for months to the
literati of vienna hell ultimately gained the victory mesmer nothing
daunted continued to promulgate his views till he stumbled at last upon
the animal theory
one of his patients was a young lady named oesterline who suffered under
a convulsive malady her attacks were periodical and attended by a rush
of blood to the head followed by delirium and syncope these symptoms he
soon succeeded in reducing under his system of planetary influence and
imagined he could foretell the periods of accession and remission having
thus accounted satisfactorily to himself for the origin of the disease
the idea struck him that he could operate a certain cure if he could
ascertain beyond doubt what he had long believed that there existed
between the bodies which compose our globe an action equally reciprocal
and similar to that of the heavenly bodies by means of which he could
imitate artificially the periodical revolutions of the flux and reflux
before mentioned he soon convinced himself that this action did exist
when trying the metallic plates of father hell he thought their efficacy
depended on their form but he found afterwards that he could produce the
same effects without using them at all merely by passing his hands
downwards towards the feet of the patient even when at a considerable
distance
this completed the theory of mesmer he wrote an account of his discovery
to all the learned societies of europe soliciting their investigation
the academy of sciences at berlin was the only one that answered him and
their answer was any thing but favourable to his system or flattering to
himself still he was not discouraged he maintained to all who would
listen to him that the magnetic matter or fluid pervaded all the
universethat every human body contained it and could communicate the
superabundance of it to another by an exertion of the will writing to a
friend from vienna he said i have observed that the magnetic is almost
the same thing as the electric fluid and that it may be propagated in the
same manner by means of intermediate bodies steel is not the only
substance adapted to this purpose i have rendered paper bread wool
silk stones leather glass wood men and dogsin short every thing i
touched magnetic to such a degree that these substances produced the
same effects as the loadstone on diseased persons i have charged jars
with magnetic matter in the same way as is done with electricity
mesmer did not long find his residence at vienna as agreeable as he
wished his pretensions were looked upon with contempt or indifference
and the case of mademoiselle oesterline brought him less fame than
notoriety he determined to change his sphere of action and travelled
into swabia and switzerland in the latter country he met with the
celebrated father gassner who like valentine greatraks amused himself
by casting out devils and healing the sick by merely laying hands upon
them at his approach delicate girls fell into convulsions and
hypochondriacs fancied themselves cured his house was daily besieged by
the lame the blind and the hysteric mesmer at once acknowledged the
efficacy of his cures and declared that they were the obvious result of
his own newlydiscovered power of magnetism a few of the fathers
patients were forthwith subjected to the manipulations of mesmer and the
same symptoms were induced he then tried his hand upon some paupers in
the hospitals of berne and zurich and succeeded according to his own
account but no other persons in curing an opththalmia and a gutta
serena with memorials of these achievements he returned to vienna in the
hope of silencing his enemies or at least forcing them to respect his
newlyacquired reputation and to examine his system more attentively
his second appearance in that capital was not more auspicious than the
first he undertook to cure a mademoiselle paradis who was quite blind
and subject to convulsions he magnetised her several times and then
declared that she was cured at least if she was not it was her fault
and not his an eminent oculist of that day named barth went to visit
her and declared that she was as blind as ever while her family said she
was as much subject to convulsions as before mesmer persisted that she
was cured like the french philosopher he would not allow facts to
interfere with his theory71 he declared that there was a conspiracy
against him and that mademoiselle paradis at the instigation of her
family feigned blindness in order to injure his reputation
    71 an enthusiastic philosopher of whose name we are not
         informed had constructed a very satisfactory theory on some
         subject or other and was not a little proud of it but the
         facts my dear fellow said his friend the facts do not
         agree with your theorydont they replied the
         philosopher shrugging his shoulders then tant pis pour
         les faitsso much the worse for the facts
the consequences of this pretended cure taught mesmer that vienna
was not the sphere for him paris the idle the debauched the
pleasurehunting the noveltyloving was the scene for a philosopher like
him and thither he repaired accordingly he arrived at paris in 1778 and
began modestly by making himself and his theory known to the principal
physicians at first his encouragement was but slight he found people
more inclined to laugh at than to patronise him but he was a man who had
great confidence in himself and of a perseverance which no difficulties
could overcome he hired a sumptuous apartment which he opened to all
comers who chose to make trial of the new power of nature m deslon a
physician of great reputation became a convert and from that time
animal magnetism or as some called it mesmerism became the fashion in
paris the women were quite enthusiastic about it and their admiring
tattle wafted its fame through every grade of society mesmer was the
rage and high and low rich and poor credulous and unbelieving all
hastened to convince themselves of the power of this mighty magician who
made such magnificent promises mesmer who knew as well as any man living
the influence of the imagination determined that on that score nothing
should be wanting to heighten the effect of the magnetic charm in all
paris there was not a house so charmingly furnished as monsieur mesmers
richlystained glass shed a dim religious light on his spacious saloons
which were almost covered with mirrors orangeblossoms scented all the
air of his corridors incense of the most expensive kinds burned in
antique vases on his chimneypieces olian harps sighed melodious music
from distant chambers while sometimes a sweet female voice from above or
below stole softly upon the mysterious silence that was kept in the
house and insisted upon from all visitors was ever any thing so
delightful cried all the mrs wittitterleys of paris as they thronged
to his house in search of pleasant excitement so wonderful said the
pseudophilosophers who would believe anything if it were the fashion
so amusing said the wornout debauchs who had drained the cup of
sensuality to its dregs and who longed to see lovely women in
convulsions with the hope that they might gain some new emotions from the
sight
the following was the mode of operation in the centre of the saloon was
placed an oval vessel about four feet in its longest diameter and one
foot deep in this were laid a number of winebottles filled with
magnetised water well corkedup and disposed in radii with their necks
outwards water was then poured into the vessel so as just to cover the
bottles and filings of iron were thrown in occasionally to heighten the
magnetic effect the vessel was then covered with an iron cover
pierced through with many holes and was called the baquet from each
hole issued a long movable rod of iron which the patients were to apply
to such parts of their bodies as were afflicted around this baquet the
patients were directed to sit holding each other by the hand and
pressing their knees together as closely as possible to facilitate the
passage of the magnetic fluid from one to the other
then came in the assistant magnetisers generally strong handsome young
men to pour into the patient from their fingertips fresh streams of the
wondrous fluid they embraced the patient between the knees rubbed them
gently down the spine and the course of the nerves using gentle pressure
upon the breasts of the ladies and staring them out of countenance to
magnetise them by the eye all this time the most rigorous silence was
maintained with the exception of a few wild notes on the harmonica or the
pianoforte or the melodious voice of a hidden operasinger swelling
softly at long intervals gradually the cheeks of the ladies began to
glow their imaginations to become inflamed and off they went one after
the other in convulsive fits some of them sobbed and tore their hair
others laughed till the tears ran from their eyes while others shrieked
and screamed and yelled till they became insensible altogether
this was the crisis of the delirium in the midst of it the chief actor
made his appearance waving his wand like prospero to work new wonders
dressed in a long robe of lilaccoloured silk richly embroidered with gold
flowers bearing in his hand a white magnetic rod and with a look of
dignity which would have sat well on an eastern caliph he marched with
solemn strides into the room he awed the still sensible by his eye and
the violence of their symptoms diminished he stroked the insensible with
his hands upon the eyebrows and down the spine traced figures upon their
breast and abdomen with his long white wand and they were restored to
consciousness they became calm acknowledged his power and said they
felt streams of cold or burning vapour passing through their frames
according as he waved his wand or his fingers before them
it is impossible says m dupotet to conceive the sensation which
mesmers experiments created in paris no theological controversy in the
earlier ages of the catholic church was ever conducted with greater
bitterness his adversaries denied the discovery some calling him a
quack others a fool and others again like the abb fiard a man who had
sold himself to the devil his friends were as extravagant in their
praise as his foes were in their censure paris was inundated with
pamphlets upon the subject as many defending as attacking the doctrine
at court the queen expressed herself in favour of it and nothing
else was to be heard of in society
by the advice of m deslon mesmer challenged an examination of his
doctrine by the faculty of medicine he proposed to select twentyfour
patients twelve of whom he would treat magnetically leaving the other
twelve to be treated by the faculty according to the old and approved
methods he also stipulated that to prevent disputes the government
should nominate certain persons who were not physicians to be present at
the experiments and that the object of the inquiry should be not how
these effects were produced but whether they were really efficacious in
the cure of any disease the faculty objected to limit the inquiry in this
manner and the proposition fell to the ground
mesmer now wrote to marie antoinette with the view of securing her
influence in obtaining for him the protection of government he wished to
have a chteau and its lands given to him with a handsome yearly income
that he might be enabled to continue his experiments at leisure
untroubled by the persecution of his enemies he hinted the duty of
governments to support men of science and expressed his fear that if he
met no more encouragement he should be compelled to carry his great
discovery to some other land more willing to appreciate him in the eyes
of your majesty said he four or five hundred thousand francs applied
to a good purpose are of no account the welfare and happiness of your
people are every thing my discovery ought to be received and rewarded
with a munificence worthy of the monarch to whom i shall attach myself
the government at last offered him a pension of twenty thousand francs
and the cross of the order of st michael if he had made any discovery in
medicine and would communicate it to physicians nominated by the king
the latter part of the proposition was not agreeable to mesmer he feared
the unfavourable report of the kings physicians and breaking off the
negotiation spoke of his disregard of money and his wish to have his
discovery at once recognised by the government he then retired to spa in
a fit of disgust upon pretence of drinking the waters for the benefit of
his health
after he had left paris the faculty of medicine called upon m deslon
for the third and last time to renounce the doctrine of animal magnetism
or be expelled from their body m deslon so far from doing this
declared that he had discovered new secrets and solicited further
examination a royal commission of the faculty of medicine was in
consequence appointed on the 12th of march 1784 seconded by another
commission of the acadmie des sciences to investigate the phenomena and
report upon them the first commission was composed of the
principal physicians of paris while among the eminent men comprised in
the latter were benjamin franklin lavoisier and bailly the historian of
astronomy mesmer was formally invited to appear before this body but
absented himself from day to day upon one pretence or another m deslon
was more honest because he thoroughly believed in the phenomena which it
is to be questioned if mesmer ever did and regularly attended the
sittings and performed experiments
bailly has thus described the scenes of which he was a witness in the
course of this investigation the sick persons arranged in great numbers
and in several rows around the baquet receive the magnetism by all
these means by the iron rods which convey it to them from the
baquetby the cords wound round their bodiesby the connexion of the
thumb which conveys to them the magnetism of their neighboursand by the
sounds of a pianoforte or of an agreeable voice diffusing the magnetism
in the air the patients were also directly magnetised by means of the
finger and wand of the magnetiser moved slowly before their faces above
or behind their heads and on the diseased parts always observing the
direction of the holes the magnetiser acts by fixing his eyes on them
but above all they are magnetised by the application of his hands and the
pressure of his fingers on the hypochondres and on the regions of the
abdomen an application often continued for a long timesometimes for
several hours
meanwhile the patients in their different conditions present a very
varied picture some are calm tranquil and experience no effect others
cough spit feel slight pains local or general heat and have sweatings
others again are agitated and tormented with convulsions these
convulsions are remarkable in regard to the number affected with them to
their duration and force as soon as one begins to be convulsed several
others are affected the commissioners have observed some of these
convulsions last more than three hours they are accompanied with
expectorations of a muddy viscous water brought away by violent efforts
sometimes streaks of blood have been observed in this fluid these
convulsions are characterised by the precipitous involuntary motion of
all the limbs and of the whole body by the contraction of the throatby
the leaping motions of the hypochondria and the epigastriumby the
dimness and wandering of the eyesby piercing shrieks tears sobbing
and immoderate laughter they are preceded or followed by a state of
langour or reverie a kind of depression and sometimes drowsiness the
smallest sudden noise occasions a shuddering and it was remarked that
the change of measure in the airs played on the pianoforte had a
great influence on the patients a quicker motion a livelier melody
agitated them more and renewed the vivacity of their convulsions
nothing is more astonishing than the spectacle of these convulsions one
who has not seen them can form no idea of them the spectator is as much
astonished at the profound repose of one portion of the patients as at the
agitation of the restat the various accidents which are repeated and at
the sympathies which are exhibited some of the patients may be seen
devoting their attention exclusively to one another rushing towards each
other with open arms smiling soothing and manifesting every symptom of
attachment and affection all are under the power of the magnetiser it
matters not in what state of drowsiness they may be the sound of his
voicea look a motion of his handbrings them out of it among the
patients in convulsions there are always observed a great many women and
very few men72
    72 rapport des commissaires rdig par m bailly paris 1784
these experiments lasted for about five months they had hardly commenced
before mesmer alarmed at the loss both of fame and profit determined to
return to paris some patients of rank and fortune enthusiastic believers
in his doctrine had followed him to spa one of them named bergasse
proposed to open a subscription for him of one hundred shares at one
hundred louis each on condition that he would disclose his secret to the
subscribers who were to be permitted to make whatever use they pleased of
it mesmer readily embraced the proposal and such was the infatuation
that the subscription was not only filled in a few days but exceeded by
no less a sum than one hundred and forty thousand francs
with this fortune he returned to paris and recommenced his experiments
while the royal commission continued theirs his admiring pupils who had
paid him so handsomely for his instructions spread his fame over the
country and established in all the principal towns of france societies
of harmony for trying experiments and curing all diseases by means of
magnetism some of these societies were a scandal to morality being
joined by profligate men of depraved appetites who took a disgusting
delight in witnessing young girls in convulsions many of the pretended
magnetisers were asserted at the time to be notorious libertines who took
that opportunity of gratifying their passions
at last the commissioners published their report which was drawn up by
the illustrious and unfortunate bailly for clearness of reasoning and
strict impartiality it has never been surpassed after detailing the
various experiments made and their results they came to the conclusion
that the only proof advanced in support of animal magnetism was the
effects it produced on the human bodythat those effects could be
produced without passes or other magnetic manipulationsthat all these
manipulations and passes and ceremonies never produce any effect at all if
employed without the patients knowledge and that therefore imagination
did and animal magnetism did not account for the phenomena
this report was the ruin of mesmers reputation in france he quitted
paris shortly after with the three hundred and forty thousand francs
which had been subscribed by his admirers and retired to his own country
where he died in 1815 at the advanced age of eightyone but the seeds he
had sown fructified of themselves nourished and brought to maturity by
the kindly warmth of popular credulity imitators sprang up in france
germany and england more extravagant than their master and claiming
powers for the new science which its founder had never dreamt of among
others cagliostro made good use of the delusion in extending his claims
to be considered a master of the occult sciences but he made no
discoveries worthy to be compared to those of the marquis de puysegur and
the chevalier barbarin honest men who began by deceiving themselves
before they deceived others
the marquis de puysegur the owner of a considerable estate at busancy
was one of those who had entered into the subscription for mesmer after
that individual had quitted france he retired to busancy with his
brother to try animal magnetism upon his tenants and cure the country
people of all manner of diseases he was a man of great simplicity and
much benevolence and not only magnetised but fed the sick that flocked
around him in all the neighbourhood and indeed within a circumference of
twenty miles he was looked upon as endowed with a power almost divine
his great discovery as he called it was made by chance one day he had
magnetised his gardener and observing him to fall into a deep sleep it
occurred to him that he would address a question to him as he would have
done to a natural somnambulist he did so and the man replied with much
clearness and precision m de puysegur was agreeably surprised he
continued his experiments and found that in this state of magnetic
somnambulism the soul of the sleeper was enlarged and brought into more
intimate communion with all nature and more especially with him m de
puysegur he found that all further manipulations were unnecessary that
without speaking or making any sign he could convey his will to the
patient that he could in fact converse with him soul to soul
without the employment of any physical operation whatever
simultaneously with this marvellous discovery he made another which
reflects equal credit upon his understanding like valentine greatraks he
found it hard work to magnetise all that camethat he had not even time
to take the repose and relaxation which were necessary for his health in
this emergency he hit upon a clever expedient he had heard mesmer say
that he could magnetise bits of wood why should he not be able to
magnetise a whole tree it was no sooner thought than done there was a
large elm on the village green at busancy under which the peasant girls
used to dance on festive occasions and the old men to sit drinking their
vin du pays on the fine summer evenings m de puysegur proceeded to
this tree and magnetised it by first touching it with his hands and then
retiring a few steps from it all the while directing streams of the
magnetic fluid from the branches toward the trunk and from the trunk
toward the root this done he caused circular seats to be erected round
it and cords suspended from it in all directions when the patients had
seated themselves they twisted the cords round the diseased parts of
their bodies and held one another firmly by their thumbs to form a direct
channel of communication for the passage of the fluid
m de puysegur had now two hobbiesthe man with the enlarged soul and
the magnetic elm the infatuation of himself and his patients cannot be
better expressed than in his own words writing to his brother on the
17th of may 1784 he says if you do not come my dear friend you will
not see my extraordinary man for his health is now almost quite restored
i continue to make use of the happy power for which i am indebted to m
mesmer every day i bless his name for i am very useful and produce many
salutary effects on all the sick poor in the neighbourhood they flock
around my tree there were more than one hundred and thirty of them this
morning it is the best baquet possible not a leaf of it but
communicates health all feel more or less the good effects of it you
will be delighted to see the charming picture of humanity which this
presents i have only one regretit is that i cannot touch all who come
but my magnetised manmy intelligencesets me at ease he teaches me
what conduct i should adopt according to him it is not at all necessary
that i should touch every one a look a gesture even a wish is
sufficient and it is one of the most ignorant peasants of the country
that teaches me this when he is in a crisis i know of nothing more
profound more prudent more clearsighted clairvoyant than he is
in another letter describing his first experiment with the magnetic tree
he says yesterday evening i brought my first patient to it as soon as i
had put the cord round him he gazed at the tree and with an air of
astonishment which i cannot describe exclaimed what is it that i see
there his head then sunk down and he fell into a perfect fit of
somnambulism at the end of an hour i took him home to his house again
when i restored him to his senses several men and women came to tell him
what he had been doing he maintained it was not true that weak as he
was and scarcely able to walk it would have been scarcely possible for
him to have gone down stairs and walked to the tree today i have
repeated the experiment on him and with the same success i own to you
that my head turns round with pleasure to think of the good i do madame
de puysegur the friends she has with her my servants and in fact all
who are near me feel an amazement mingled with admiration which cannot
be described but they do not experience the half of my sensations
without my tree which gives me rest and which will give me still more i
should be in a state of agitation inconsistent i believe with my
health i exist too much if i may be allowed to use the expression
in another letter he descants still more poetically upon his gardener
with the enlarged soul he says it is from this simple man this tall
and stout rustic twentythree years of age enfeebled by disease or
rather by sorrow and therefore the more predisposed to be affected by any
great natural agentit is from this man i repeat that i derive
instruction and knowledge when in the magnetic state he is no longer a
peasant who can hardly utter a single sentence he is a being to describe
whom i cannot find a name i need not speak i have only to think before
him when he instantly understands and answers me should any body come
into the room he sees him if i desire it but not else and addresses
him and says what i wish to say not indeed exactly as i dictate to him
but as truth requires when he wants to add more than i deem it prudent
strangers should hear i stop the flow of his ideas and of his
conversation in the middle of a word and give it quite a different turn
among other persons attracted to busancy by the report of these
extraordinary occurrences was m cloquet the receiver of finance his
appetite for the marvellous being somewhat insatiable he readily believed
all that was told him by m de puysegur he also has left a record of what
he saw and what he credited which throws a still clearer light upon the
progress of the delusion73 he says that the patients he saw in the
magnetic state had an appearance of deep sleep during which all
the physical faculties were suspended to the advantage of the
intellectual faculties the eyes of the patients were closed the sense of
hearing was abolished and they awoke only at the voice of their
magnetiser if any one touched a patient during a crisis or even the
chair on which he was seated says m cloquet it would cause him much
pain and suffering and throw him into convulsions during the crisis
they possess an extraordinary and supernatural power by which on
touching a patient presented to them they can feel what part of his body
is diseased even by merely passing their hand over the clothes another
singularity was that these sleepers who could thus discover diseases see
into the interior of other mens stomachs and point out remedies
remembered absolutely nothing after the magnetiser thought proper to
disenchant them the time that elapsed between their entering the crisis
and their coming out of it was obliterated not only had the magnetiser
the power of making himself heard by the somnambulists but he could make
them follow him by merely pointing his finger at them from a distance
though they had their eyes the whole time completely closed
    73 introduction to the study of animal magnetism by baron
         dupotet p 73
such was animal magnetism under the auspices of the marquis de puysegur
while he was exhibiting these phenomena around his elmtree a magnetiser
of another class appeared in lyons in the person of the chevalier de
barbarin this gentleman thought the effort of the will without any of
the paraphernalia of wands or baquets was sufficient to throw patients
into the magnetic sleep he tried it and succeeded by sitting at the
bedside of his patients and praying that they might be magnetised they
went off into a state very similar to that of the persons who fell under
the notice of m de puysegur in the course of time a very considerable
number of magnetisers acknowledging barbarin for their model and called
after him barbarinists appeared in different parts and were believed to
have effected some remarkable cures in sweden and germany this sect of
fanatics increased rapidly and were called spiritualists to
distinguish them from the followers of m de puysegur who were called
experimentalists they maintained that all the effects of animal
magnetism which mesmer believed to be producible by a magnetic fluid
dispersed through nature were produced by the mere effort of one human
soul acting upon another that when a connexion had once been established
between a magnetiser and his patient the former could communicate his
influence to the latter from any distance even hundreds of miles by the
will one of them thus described the blessed state of a magnetic patient
in such a man animal instinct ascends to the highest degree admissible in
this world the clairvoyant is then a pure animal without any
admixture of matter his observations are those of a spirit he is similar
to god his eye penetrates all the secrets of nature when his attention
is fixed on any of the objects of this worldon his disease his death
his wellbeloved his friends his relations his enemiesin spirit he
sees them acting he penetrates into the causes and the consequences of
their actions he becomes a physician a prophet a divine74

let us now see what progress these mysteries made in england in the year
1788 dr mainauduc who had been a pupil first of mesmer and afterwards
of deslon arrived in bristol and gave public lectures upon magnetism
his success was quite extraordinary people of rank and fortune hastened
from london to bristol to be magnetised or to place themselves under his
tuition dr george winter in his history of animal magnetism gives
the following list of them they amounted to one hundred and
twentyseven among whom there were one duke one duchess one
marchioness two countesses one earl one baron three baronesses one
bishop five right honourable gentlemen and ladies two baronets seven
members of parliament one clergyman two physicians seven surgeons
besides ninetytwo gentlemen and ladies of respectability he afterwards
established himself in london where he performed with equal success
he began by publishing proposals to the ladies for the formation of a
hygeian society in this paper he vaunted highly the curative effects of
animal magnetism and took great credit to himself for being the first
person to introduce it into england and thus concluded as this method
of cure is not confined to sex or college education and the fair sex
being in general the most sympathising part of the creation and most
immediately concerned in the health and care of its offspring i think
myself bound in gratitude to you ladies for the partiality you have
shewn me in midwifery to contribute as far as lies in my power to
render you additionally useful and valuable to the community with this
view i propose forming my hygeian society to be incorporated with that of
paris as soon as twenty ladies have given in their names the day shall
be appointed for the first meeting at my house when they are to pay
fifteen guineas which will include the whole expense
hannah more in a letter addressed to horace walpole in september 1788
speaks of the demoniacal mummeries of dr mainauduc and says he was in
a fair way of gaining a hundred thousand pounds by them as mesmer had
done by his exhibitions in paris
so much curiosity was excited by the subject that about the same time a
man named holloway gave a course of lectures on animal magnetism
in london at the rate of five guineas for each pupil and realised a
considerable fortune loutherbourg the painter and his wife followed the
same profitable trade and such was the infatuation of the people to be
witnesses of their strange manipulations that at times upwards of three
thousand persons crowded around their house at hammersmith unable to gain
admission the tickets sold at prices varying from one to three guineas
loutherbourg performed his cures by the touch after the manner of
valentine greatraks and finally pretended to a divine mission an account
of his miracles as they were called was published in 1789 entitled a
list of new cures performed by mr and mrs de loutherbourg of
hammersmith terrace without medicine by a lover of the lamb of god
dedicated to his grace the archbishop of canterbury
this lover of the lamb of god was a halfcrazy old woman named mary
pratt who conceived for mr and mrs de loutherbourg a veneration which
almost prompted her to worship them she chose for the motto of her
pamphlet a verse in the thirteenth chapter of the acts of the apostles
behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for i will work a work in
your days which ye shall not believe though a man declare it unto you
attempting to give a religious character to the cures of the painter she
thought a woman was the proper person to make them known since the
apostle had declared that a man should not be able to conquer the
incredulity of the people she stated that from christmas 1788 to july
1789 de loutherbourg and his wife had cured two thousand people having
been made proper recipients to receive divine manuductions which
heavenly and divine influx coming from the radix god his divine
majesty had most graciously bestowed upon them to diffuse healing to all
be they deaf dumb blind lame or halt
in her dedication to the archbishop of canterbury she implored him to
compose a new form of prayer to be used in all churches and chapels that
nothing might impede this inestimable gift from having its due course she
further entreated all the magistrates and men of authority in the land to
wait on mr and mrs de loutherbourg to consult with them on the
immediate erection of a large hospital with a pool of bethesda attached
to it all the magnetisers were scandalised at the preposterous jabber of
this old woman and de loutherbourg appears to have left london to avoid
hercontinuing however in conjunction with his wife the fantastic
tricks which had turned the brain of this poor fanatic and deluded many
others who pretended to more sense than she had
from this period until 1798 magnetism excited little or no attention in
england an attempt to revive the belief in it was made in that
year but it was in the shape of mineral rather than of animal magnetism
one benjamin douglas perkins an american practising as a surgeon in
leicester square invented and took out a patent for the celebrated
metallic tractors he pretended that these tractors which were two
small pieces of metal strongly magnetised something resembling the steel
plates which were first brought into notice by father hell would cure
gout rheumatism palsy and in fact almost every disease the human
frame was subject to if applied externally to the afflicted part and
moved about gently touching the surface only the most wonderful stories
soon obtained general circulation and the press groaned with pamphlets
all vaunting the curative effects of the tractors which were sold at five
guineas the pair perkins gained money rapidly gouty subjects forgot
their pains in the presence of this new remedy the rheumatism fled at its
approach and toothache which is often cured by the mere sight of a
dentist vanished before perkins and his marvellous steelplates the
benevolent society of friends of whose body he was a member warmly
patronised the invention desirous that the poor who could not afford to
pay mr perkins five guineas or even five shillings for his tractors
should also share in the benefits of that sublime discovery they
subscribed a large sum and built an hospital called the perkinean
institution in which all comers might be magnetised free of cost in the
course of a few months they were in very general use and their lucky
inventor in possession of five thousand pounds
dr haygarth an eminent physician at bath recollecting the influence of
imagination in the cure of disease hit upon an expedient to try the real
value of the tractors perkinss cures were too well established to be
doubted and dr haygarth without gainsaying them quietly but in the
face of numerous witnesses exposed the delusion under which people
laboured with respect to the curative medium he suggested to dr falconer
that they should make wooden tractors paint them to resemble the steel
ones and see if the very same effects would not be produced five
patients were chosen from the hospital in bath upon whom to operate four
of them suffered severely from chronic rheumatism in the ankle knee
wrist and hip and the fifth had been afflicted for several months with
the gout on the day appointed for the experiments dr haygarth and his
friends assembled at the hospital and with much solemnity brought forth
the fictitious tractors four out of the five patients said their pains
were immediately relieved and three of them said they were not only
relieved but very much benefited one felt his knee warmer and said he
could walk across the room he tried and succeeded although on the
previous day he had not been able to stir the gouty man felt his
pains diminish rapidly and was quite easy for nine hours until he went
to bed when the twitching began again on the following day the real
tractors were applied to all the patients when they described their
symptoms in nearly the same terms
to make still more sure the experiment was tried in the bristol
infirmary a few weeks afterwards on a man who had a rheumatic affection
in the shoulder so severe as to incapacitate him from lifting his hand
from his knee the fictitious tractors were brought and applied to the
afflicted part one of the physicians to add solemnity to the scene
drawing a stopwatch from his pocket to calculate the time exactly while
another with a pen in his hand sat down to write the change of symptoms
from minute to minute as they occurred in less than four minutes the man
felt so much relieved that he lifted his hand several inches without any
pain in the shoulder
an account of these matters was published by dr haygarth in a small
volume entitled of the imagination as a cause and cure of disorders
exemplified by fictitious tractors the exposure was a coup de grace to
the system of mr perkins his friends and patrons still unwilling to
confess that they had been deceived tried the tractors upon sheep cows
and horses alleging that the animals received benefit from the metallic
plates but none at all from the wooden ones but they found nobody to
believe them the perkinean institution fell into neglect and perkins
made his exit from england carrying with him about ten thousand pounds
to soothe his declining years in the good city of pennsylvania
thus was magnetism laughed out of england for a time in france the
revolution left men no leisure for studying it the socits de
lharmonie of strasbourg and other great towns lingered for a while
till sterner matters occupying mens attention they were one after the
other abandoned both by pupils and professors the system thus driven
from the first two nations of europe took refuge among the dreamy
philosophers of germany there the wonders of the magnetic sleep grew more
and more wonderful every day the patients acquired the gift of prophecy
their vision extended over all the surface of the globe they could hear
and see with their toes and fingers and read unknown languages and
understand them too by merely having the book placed on their stomachs
ignorant peasants when once entranced by the grand mesmeric fluid could
spout philosophy diviner than plato ever wrote descant upon the mysteries
of the mind with more eloquence and truth than the profoundest
metaphysicians the world ever saw and solve knotty points of divinity
with as much ease as waking men could undo their shoebuckles
during the first twelve years of the present century little was heard of
animal magnetism in any country of europe even the germans forgot their
airy fancies recalled to the knowledge of this everyday world by the
roar of napoleons cannon and the fall or the establishment of kingdoms
during this period a cloud of obscurity hung over the science which was
not dispersed until m deleuze published in 1813 his histoire critique
du magntisme animal this work gave a new impulse to the halfforgotten
fancy newspapers pamphlets and books again waged war upon each other on
the question of its truth or falsehood and many eminent men in the
profession of medicine recommenced inquiry with an earnest design to
discover the truth
the assertions made in the celebrated treatise of deleuze are thus summed
up75 there is a fluid continually escaping from the human body and
forming an atmosphere around us which as it has no determined
current produces no sensible effects on surrounding individuals it is
however capable of being directed by the will and when so directed
is sent forth in currents with a force corresponding to the energy we
possess its motion is similar to that of the rays from burning bodies
it possesses different qualities in different individuals it is capable
of a high degree of concentration and exists also in trees the will of
the magnetiser guided by a motion of the hand several times repeated in
the same direction can fill a tree with this fluid most persons when
this fluid is poured into them from the body and by the will of the
magnetiser feel a sensation of heat or cold when he passes his hand
before them without even touching them some persons when sufficiently
charged with this fluid fall into a state of somnambulism or magnetic
ecstasy and when in this state they see the fluid encircling the
magnetiser like a halo of light and issuing in luminous streams from his
mouth and nostrils his head and hands possessing a very agreeable smell
and communicating a particular taste to food and water
    75 see the very clear and dispassionate article upon the
         subject in the fifth volume 1830 of the foreign review
         p 96 et seq
one would think that these notions were quite enough to be insisted upon
by any physician who wished to be considered sane but they form only a
small portion of the wondrous things related by m deleuze he further
said when magnetism produces somnambulism the person who is in this
state acquires a prodigious extension of all his faculties several of his
external organs especially those of sight and hearing become inactive
but the sensations which depend upon them take place internally
seeing and hearing are carried on by the magnetic fluid which transmits
the impressions immediately and without the intervention of any nerves or
organs directly to the brain thus the somnambulist though his eyes and
ears are closed not only sees and hears but sees and hears much better
than he does when awake in all things he feels the will of the
magnetiser although that will be not expressed he sees into the interior
of his own body and the most secret organisation of the bodies of all
those who may be put en rapport or in magnetic connexion with him
most commonly he only sees those parts which are diseased and disordered
and intuitively prescribes a remedy for them he has prophetic visions and
sensations which are generally true but sometimes erroneous he
expresses himself with astonishing eloquence and facility he is not free
from vanity he becomes a more perfect being of his own accord for a
certain time if guided wisely by the magnetiser but wanders if he is
illdirected
according to m deleuze any person could become a magnetiser and produce
these effects by conforming to the following conditions and acting upon
the following rules
forget for a while all your knowledge of physics and metaphysics
remove from your mind all objections that may occur
imagine that it is in your power to take the malady in hand and throw it
on one side
never reason for six weeks after you have commenced the study
have an active desire to do good a firm belief in the power of
magnetism and an entire confidence in employing it in short repel all
doubts desire success and act with simplicity and attention
that is to say be very credulous be very persevering reject all past
experience and do not listen to reason and you are a magnetiser after
m deleuzes own heart
having brought yourself into this edifying state remove from the patient
all persons who might be troublesome to you keep with you only the
necessary witnessesa single person if need be desire them not to occupy
themselves in any way with the processes you employ and the effects which
result from them but to join with you in the desire of doing good to your
patient arrange yourself so as neither to be too hot nor too cold and in
such a manner that nothing may obstruct the freedom of your motions and
take precautions to prevent interruption during the sitting make your
patient then sit as commodiously as possible and place yourself opposite
to him on a seat a little more elevated in such a manner that his knees
may be betwixt yours and your feet at the side of his first request him
to resign himself to think of nothing not to perplex himself by
examining the effects which may be produced to banish all fear to
surrender himself to hope and not to be disturbed or discouraged if the
action of magnetism should cause in him momentary pains after having
collected yourself take his thumbs between your fingers in such a way
that the internal part of your thumbs may be in contact with the internal
part of his and then fix your eyes upon him you must remain from two
to five minutes in this situation or until you feel an equal heat between
your thumbs and his this done you will withdraw your hands removing
them to the right and left and at the same time turning them till their
internal surface be outwards and you will raise them to the height of the
head you will now place them upon the two shoulders and let them remain
there about a minute afterwards drawing them gently along the arms to the
extremities of the fingers touching very slightly as you go you will
renew this pass five or six times always turning your hands and removing
them a little from the body before you lift them you will then place them
above the head and after holding them there for an instant lower them
passing them before the face at the distance of one or two inches down
to the pit of the stomach there you will stop them two minutes also
putting your thumbs upon the pit of the stomach and the rest of your
fingers below the ribs you will then descend slowly along the body to the
knees or rather if you can do so without deranging yourself to the
extremity of the feet you will repeat the same processes several times
during the remainder of the sitting you will also occasionally approach
your patient so as to place your hands behind his shoulders in order to
descend slowly along the spine of the back and the thighs down to the
knees or the feet after the first passes you may dispense with putting
your hands upon the head and may make the subsequent passes upon the
arms beginning at the shoulders and upon the body beginning at the
stomach
such was the process of magnetising recommended by deleuze that delicate
fanciful and nervous women when subjected to it should have worked
themselves into convulsions will be readily believed by the sturdiest
opponent of animal magnetism to sit in a constrained posturebe stared
out of countenance by a fellow who enclosed her knees between his while
he made passes upon different parts of her body was quite enough to
throw any weak woman into a fit especially if she were predisposed to
hysteria and believed in the efficacy of the treatment it is just as
evident that those of stronger minds and healthier bodies should be sent
to sleep by the process that these effects have been produced by these
means there are thousands of instances to shew but are they testimony in
favour of animal magnetismdo they prove the existence of the
magnetic fluid it needs neither magnetism nor ghost from the grave to
tell us that silence monotony and long recumbency in one position must
produce sleep or that excitement imitation and a strong imagination
acting upon a weak body will bring on convulsions
m deleuzes book produced quite a sensation in france the study was
resumed with redoubled vigour in the following year a journal was
established devoted exclusively to the science under the title of
annales du magntisme animal and shortly afterwards appeared the
bibliothque du magntisme animal and many others about the same time
the abb faria the man of wonders began to magnetise and the belief
being that he had more of the mesmeric fluid about him and a stronger
will than most men he was very successful in his treatment his
experiments afford a convincing proof that imagination can operate all
and the supposed fluid none of the results so confidently claimed as
evidence of the new science he placed his patients in an armchair told
them to shut their eyes and then in a loud commanding voice pronounced
the single word sleep he used no manipulations whateverhad no
baquet or conductor of the fluid but he nevertheless succeeded in
causing sleep in hundreds of patients he boasted of having in his time
produced five thousand somnambulists by this method it was often
necessary to repeat the command three or four times and if the patient
still remained awake the abb got out of the difficulty by dismissing him
from the chair and declaring that he was incapable of being acted on and
it should be especially remarked that the magnetisers do not lay claim to
universal efficacy for their fluid the strong and the healthy cannot be
magnetised the incredulous cannot be magnetised those who reason upon it
cannot be magnetised those who firmly believe in it can be magnetised
the weak in body can be magnetised and the weak in mind can be
magnetised and lest from some cause or other individuals of the latter
classes should resist the magnetic charm the apostles of the science
declare that there are times when even they cannot be acted upon the
presence of one scorner or unbeliever may weaken the potency of the fluid
and destroy its efficacy in m deleuzes instructions to a magnetiser he
expressly says never magnetise before inquisitive persons76

here we conclude the subject as it would serve no good purpose to extend
to greater length the history of animal magnetism especially at a time
when many phenomena the reality of which it is impossible to dispute are
daily occurring to startle and perplex the most learned
impartial and truthloving of mankind enough however has been stated
to shew that if there be some truth in magnetism there has been much
error misconception and exaggeration taking its history from the
commencement it can hardly be said to have been without its uses to
quote the words of bailly in 1784 magnetism has not been altogether
unavailing to the philosophy which condemns it it is an additional fact
to record among the errors of the human mind and a great experiment on
the strength of the imagination over that vast inquiry of the influence
of mind over matteran inquiry which the embodied intellect of mankind
will never be able to fathom completelyit will at least have thrown a
feeble and imperfect light it will have afforded an additional proof of
the strength of the unconquerable will and the weakness of matter as
compared with it another illustration of the words of the inspired
psalmist that we are fearfully and wonderfully made

influence of politics and religion on the hair and beard
    speak with respect and honour
    both of the beard and the beards owner
                                        hudibras
the famous declaration of st paul that long hair was a shame unto a
man has been made the pretext for many singular enactments both of
civil and ecclesiastical governments the fashion of the hair and the cut
of the beard were state questions in france and england from the
establishment of christianity until the fifteenth century
we find too that in much earlier times men were not permitted to do as
they liked with their own hair alexander the great thought that the
beards of the soldiery afforded convenient handles for the enemy to lay
hold of preparatory to cutting off their heads and with a view of
depriving them of this advantage he ordered the whole of his army to be
closely shaven his notions of courtesy towards an enemy were quite
different from those entertained by the north american indians and
amongst whom it is held a point of honour to allow one chivalrous lock
to grow that the foe in taking the scalp may have something to catch
hold of
at one time long hair was the symbol of sovereignty in europe we learn
from gregory of tours that among the successors of clovis it was the
exclusive privilege of the royal family to have their hair long and
curled the nobles equal to kings in power would not shew any
inferiority in this respect and wore not only their hair but their
beards of an enormous length this fashion lasted with but slight
changes till the time of louis the debonnaire but his successors up to
hugh capet wore their hair short by way of distinction even the serfs
had set all regulation at defiance and allowed their locks and beards to
grow
at the time of the invasion of england by william the conqueror the
normans wore their hair very short harold in his progress towards
hastings sent forward spies to view the strength and number of the enemy
they reported amongst other things on their return that the host did
almost seem to be priests because they had all their face and both their
lips shaven the fashion among the english at the time was to wear the
hair long upon the head and the upper lip but to shave the chin when the
haughty victors had divided the broad lands of the saxon thanes and
franklins among them when tyranny of every kind was employed to make the
english feel that they were indeed a subdued and broken nation the latter
encouraged the growth of their hair that they might resemble as little as
possible their cropped and shaven masters
this fashion was exceedingly displeasing to the clergy and prevailed to a
considerable extent in france and germany towards the end of the eleventh
century it was decreed by the pope and zealously supported by the
ecclesiastical authorities all over europe that such persons as wore long
hair should be excommunicated while living and not be prayed for when
dead william of malmesbury relates that the famous st wulstan bishop
of worcester was peculiarly indignant whenever he saw a man with long
hair he declaimed against the practice as one highly immoral criminal
and beastly he continually carried a small knife in his pocket and
whenever any body offending in this respect knelt before him to receive
his blessing he would whip it out slily and cut off a handful and then
throwing it in his face tell him to cut off all the rest or he would go
to hell
but fashion which at times it is possible to move with a wisp stands
firm against a lever and men preferred to run the risk of damnation to
parting with the superfluity of their hair in the time of henry i
anselm archbishop of canterbury found it necessary to republish the
famous decree of excommunication and outlawry against the offenders but
as the court itself had begun to patronise curls the fulminations of the
church were unavailing henry i and his nobles wore their hair in long
ringlets down their backs and shoulders and became a scandalum magnatum
in the eyes of the godly one serlo the kings chaplain was so grieved
in spirit at the impiety of his master that he preached a sermon from the
wellknown text of st paul before the assembled court in which he drew
so dreadful a picture of the torments that awaited them in the other
world that several of them burst into tears and wrung their hair as if
they would have pulled it out by the roots henry himself was observed to
weep the priest seeing the impression he had made determined to strike
while the iron was hot and pulling a pair of scissors from his pocket
cut the kings hair in presence of them all several of the principal
courtiers consented to do the like and for a short time long hair
appeared to be going out of fashion but the courtiers thought after the
first glow of their penitence had been cooled by reflection that the
clerical delilah had shorn them of their strength and in less than six
months they were as great sinners as ever
anselm the archbishop of canterbury who had been a monk of bec in
normandy and who had signalised himself at rouen by his fierce opposition
to long hair was still anxious to work a reformation in this matter but
his pertinacity was far from pleasing to the king who had finally made up
his mind to wear ringlets there were other disputes of a more serious
nature between them so that when the archbishop died the king was so
glad to be rid of him that he allowed the see to remain vacant for five
years still the cause had other advocates and every pulpit in the land
resounded with anathemas against that disobedient and longhaired
generation but all was of no avail stowe in writing of this period
asserts on the authority of some more ancient chronicler that men
forgetting their birth transformed themselves by the length of their
haires into the semblance of woman kind and that when their hair
decayed from age or other causes they knit about their heads certain
rolls and braidings of false hair at last accident turned the tide of
fashion a knight of the court who was exceedingly proud of his beauteous
locks dreamed one night that as he lay in bed the devil sprang upon
him and endeavoured to choke him with his own hair he started in
affright and actually found that he had a great quantity of hair in his
mouth sorely stricken in conscience and looking upon the dream as a
warning from heaven he set about the work of reformation and cut off his
luxuriant tresses the same night the story was soon bruited abroad of
course it was made the most of by the clergy and the knight being a man
of influence and consideration and the acknowledged leader of the
fashion his example aided by priestly exhortations was very generally
imitated men appeared almost as decent as st wulstan himself could have
wished the dream of a dandy having proved more efficacious than the
entreaties of a saint but as stowe informs us scarcely was one year
past when all that thought themselves courtiers fell into the former
vice and contended with women in their long haires henry the king
appears to have been quite uninfluenced by the dreams of others for even
his own would not induce him a second time to undergo a cropping from
priestly shears it is said that he was much troubled at this time by
disagreeable visions having offended the church in this and other
respects he could get no sound refreshing sleep and used to imagine
that he saw all the bishops abbots and monks of every degree standing
around his bedside and threatening to belabour him with their pastoral
staves which sight we are told so frightened him that he often started
naked out of his bed and attacked the phantoms sword in hand grimbalde
his physician who like most of his fraternity at that day was an
ecclesiastic never hinted that his dreams were the result of a bad
digestion but told him to shave his head be reconciled to the church
and reform himself with alms and prayer but he would not take this good
advice and it was not until he had been nearly drowned a year afterwards
in a violent storm at sea that he repented of his evil ways cut his hair
short and paid proper deference to the wishes of the clergy
in france the thunders of the vatican with regard to long curly hair were
hardly more respected than in england louis vii however was more
obedient than his brotherking and cropped himself as closely as a monk
to the great sorrow of all the gallants of his court his queen the gay
haughty and pleasureseeking eleanor of guienne never admired him in
this trim and continually reproached him with imitating not only the
headdress but the asceticism of the monks from this cause a coldness
arose between them the lady proving at last unfaithful to her shaven and
indifferent lord they were divorced and the kings of france lost the
rich provinces of guienne and poitou which were her dowry she soon after
bestowed her hand and her possessions upon henry duke of normandy
afterwards henry ii of england and thus gave the english sovereigns that
strong footing in france which was for so many centuries the cause of such
long and bloody wars between the nations when the crusades had drawn all
the smart young fellows into palestine the clergy did not find it so
difficult to convince the staid burghers who remained in europe of the
enormity of long hair during the absence of richard coeur de lion his
english subjects not only cut their hair close but shaved their faces
william fitzosbert or longbeard the great demagogue of that day
reintroduced among the people who claimed to be of saxon origin the
fashion of long hair he did this with the view of making them as unlike
as possible to the citizens and the normans he wore his own beard hanging
down to his waist from whence the name by which he is best known to
posterity
the church never shewed itself so great an enemy to the beard as to long
hair on the head it generally allowed fashion to take its own course
both with regard to the chin and the upper lip this fashion varied
continually for we find that in little more than a century after the
time of richard i when beards were short that they had again become so
long as to be mentioned in the famous epigram made by the scots who
visited london in 1327 when david son of robert bruce was married to
joan the sister of king edward this epigram which was stuck on the
churchdoor of st peter stangate ran as follows
   long beards heartlesse
    painted hoods witlesse
    gray coats gracelesse
    make england thriftlesse
when the emperor charles v ascended the throne of spain he had no beard
it was not to be expected that the obsequious parasites who always
surround a monarch could presume to look more virile than their master
immediately all the courtiers appeared beardless with the exception of
such few grave old men as had outgrown the influence of fashion and who
had determined to die bearded as they had lived sober people in general
saw this revolution with sorrow and alarm and thought that every manly
virtue would be banished with the beard it became at the time a common
saying
         desde que no hay barba no hay mas alma
    we have no longer souls since we have lost our beards
in france also the beard fell into disrepute after the death of henry iv
from the mere reason that his successor was too young to have one some of
the more immediate friends of the great barnais and his minister sully
among the rest refused to part with their beards notwithstanding the
jeers of the new generation
who does not remember the division of england into the two great parties
of roundheads and cavaliers in those days every species of vice and
iniquity was thought by the puritans to lurk in the long curly tresses of
the monarchists while the latter imagined that their opponents were as
destitute of wit of wisdom and of virtue as they were of hair a mans
locks were the symbol of his creed both in politics and religion the
more abundant the hair the more scant the faith and the balder the head
the more sincere the piety
illustration peter the great
but among all the instances of the interference of governments with mens
hair the most extraordinary not only for its daring but for its
success is that of peter the great in 1705 by this time fashion had
condemned the beard in every other country in europe and with a voice
more potent than popes or emperors had banished it from civilised
society but this only made the russians cling more fondly to their
ancient ornament as a mark to distinguish them from foreigners whom they
hated peter however resolved that they should be shaven if he had been
a man deeply read in history he might have hesitated before he attempted
so despotic an attack upon the timehallowed customs and prejudices of his
countrymen but he was not he did not know or consider the danger of the
innovation he only listened to the promptings of his own indomitable
will and his fiat went forth that not only the army but all ranks of
citizens from the nobles to the serfs should shave their beards a
certain time was given that people might get over the first throes of
their repugnance after which every man who chose to retain his beard was
to pay a tax of one hundred roubles the priests and the serfs were put on
a lower footing and allowed to retain theirs upon payment of a copeck
every time they passed the gate of a city great discontent existed in
consequence but the dreadful fate of the strelitzes was too recent to be
forgotten and thousands who had the will had not the courage to revolt
as is well remarked by a writer in the encyclopdia britannica they
thought it wiser to cut off their beards than to run the risk of incensing
a man who would make no scruple in cutting off their heads wiser too
than the popes and bishops of a former age he did not threaten them with
eternal damnation but made them pay in hard cash the penalty of their
disobedience for many years a very considerable revenue was collected
from this source the collectors gave in receipt for its payment a small
copper coin struck expressly for the purpose and called the
borodovia or the bearded on one side it bore the figure of a
nose mouth and moustaches with a long bushy beard surmounted by the
words deuyee vyeatee money received the whole encircled by a
wreath and stamped with the black eagle of russia on the reverse it
bore the date of the year every man who chose to wear a beard was obliged
to produce this receipt on his entry into a town those who were
refractory and refused to pay the tax were thrown into prison
since that day the rulers of modern europe have endeavoured to persuade
rather than to force in all matters pertaining to fashion the vatican
troubles itself no more about beards or ringlets and men may become hairy
as bears if such is their fancy without fear of excommunication or
deprivation of their political rights folly has taken a new start and
cultivates the moustache
even upon this point governments will not let men alone religion as yet
has not meddled with it but perhaps it will and politics already
influence it considerably before the revolution of 1830 neither the
french nor belgian citizens were remarkable for their moustaches but
after that event there was hardly a shopkeeper either in paris or
brussels whose upper lip did not suddenly become hairy with real or mock
moustaches during a temporary triumph gained by the dutch soldiers over
the citizens of louvain in october 1830 it became a standing joke
against the patriots that they shaved their faces clean immediately and
the wits of the dutch army asserted that they had gathered moustaches
enough from the denuded lips of the belgians to stuff mattresses for all
the sick and wounded in their hospital
the last folly of this kind is still more recent in the german
newspapers of august 1838 appeared an ordonnance signed by the king of
bavaria forbidding civilians on any pretence whatever to wear
moustaches and commanding the police and other authorities to arrest and
cause to be shaved the offending parties strange to say adds le
droit the journal from which this account is taken moustaches
disappeared immediately like leaves from the trees in autumn every body
made haste to obey the royal order and not one person was arrested
the king of bavaria a rhymester of some celebrity has taken a good many
poetical licences in his time his licence in this matter appears neither
poetical nor reasonable it is to be hoped that he will not take it into
his royal head to make his subjects shave theirs nothing but that is
wanting to complete their degradation

every age has its peculiar folly some scheme project or phantasy into
which it plunges spurred on either by the love of gain the necessity of
excitement or the mere force of imitation failing in these it has some
madness to which it is goaded by political or religious causes or both
combined every one of these causes influenced the crusades and conspired
to render them the most extraordinary instance upon record of the extent
to which popular enthusiasm can be carried history in her solemn page
informs us that the crusaders were but ignorant and savage men that
their motives were those of bigotry unmitigated and that their pathway
was one of blood and tears romance on the other hand dilates upon their
piety and heroism and portrays in her most glowing and impassioned hues
their virtue and magnanimity the imperishable honour they acquired for
themselves and the great services they rendered to christianity in the
following pages we shall ransack the stores of both to discover the true
spirit that animated the motley multitude who took up arms in the service
of the cross leaving history to vouch for facts but not disdaining the
aid of contemporary poetry and romance to throw light upon feelings
motives and opinions
in order to understand thoroughly the state of public feeling in europe at
the time when peter the hermit preached the holy war it will be necessary
to go back for many years anterior to that event we must make
acquaintance with the pilgrims of the eighth ninth and tenth centuries
and learn the tales they told of the dangers they had passed and the
wonders they had seen pilgrimages to the holy land seem at first to have
been undertaken by converted jews and by christian devotees of lively
imagination pining with a natural curiosity to visit the scenes which of
all others were most interesting in their eyes the pious and the impious
alike flocked to jerusalemthe one class to feast their sight on the
scenes hallowed by the life and sufferings of their lord and the other
because it soon became a generally received opinion that such a
pilgrimage was sufficient to rub off the long score of sins however
atrocious another and very numerous class of pilgrims were the idle and
roving who visited palestine then as the moderns visit italy or
switzerland now because it was the fashion and because they might please
their vanity by retailing on their return the adventures they had met
with but the really pious formed the great majority every year their
numbers increased until at last they became so numerous as to be called
the armies of the lord full of enthusiasm they set the dangers and
difficulties of the way at defiance and lingered with holy rapture on
every scene described by the evangelists to them it was bliss indeed to
drink the clear waters of the jordan or be baptised in the same stream
where john had baptised the saviour they wandered with awe and pleasure
in the purlieus of the temple on the solemn mount of olives or the awful
calvary where a god had bled for sinful men to these pilgrims every
object was precious relics were eagerly sought after flagons of water
from jordan or panniers of mould from the hill of the crucifixion were
brought home and sold at extravagant prices to churches and monasteries
more apocryphal relics such as the wood of the true cross the tears of
the virgin mary the hems of her garments the toenails and hair of the
apostleseven the tents that paul had helped to manufacturewere
exhibited for sale by the knavish in palestine and brought back to europe
with wondrous cost and care a grove of a hundred oaks would not have
furnished all the wood sold in little morsels as remnants of the true
cross and the tears of mary if collected together would have filled a
cistern
for upwards of two hundred years the pilgrims met with no impediment in
palestine the enlightened haroun al reschid and his more immediate
successors encouraged the stream which brought so much wealth into syria
and treated the wayfarers with the utmost courtesy the race of fatemite
caliphswho although in other respects as tolerant were more
distressed for money or more unscrupulous in obtaining it than their
predecessors of the house of abbasimposed a tax of a bezant for each
pilgrim that entered jerusalem this was a serious hardship upon the
poorer sort who had begged their weary way across europe and arrived at
the bourne of all their hopes without a coin a great outcry was
immediately raised but still the tax was rigorously levied the pilgrims
unable to pay were compelled to remain at the gate of the holy city until
some rich devotee arriving with his train paid the tax and let them in
robert of normandy father of william the conqueror who in common with
many other nobles of the highest rank undertook the pilgrimage found on
his arrival scores of pilgrims at the gate anxiously expecting his coming
to pay the tax for them upon no occasion was such a boon refused
the sums drawn from this source were a mine of wealth to the moslem
governors of palestine imposed as the tax had been at a time when
pilgrimages had become more numerous than ever a strange idea had taken
possession of the popular mind at the close of the tenth and commencement
of the eleventh century it was universally believed that the end of the
world was at hand that the thousand years of the apocalypse were near
completion and that jesus christ would descend upon jerusalem to judge
mankind all christendom was in commotion a panic terror seized upon the
weak the credulous and the guilty who in those days formed more than
nineteentwentieths of the population forsaking their homes kindred and
occupation they crowded to jerusalem to await the coming of the lord
lightened as they imagined of a load of sin by their weary pilgrimage
to increase the panic the stars were observed to fall from heaven
earthquakes to shake the land and violent hurricanes to blow down the
forests all these and more especially the meteoric phenomena were
looked upon as the forerunners of the approaching judgments not a meteor
shot athwart the horizon that did not fill a district with alarm and send
away to jerusalem a score of pilgrims with staff in hand and wallet on
their back praying as they went for the remission of their sins men
women and even children trudged in droves to the holy city in
expectation of the day when the heavens would open and the son of god
descend in his glory this extraordinary delusion while it augmented the
numbers increased also the hardships of the pilgrims beggars became so
numerous on all the highways between the west of europe and
constantinople that the monks the great almsgivers upon these occasions
would have brought starvation within sight of their own doors if they had
not economised their resources and left the devotees to shift for
themselves as they could hundreds of them were glad to subsist upon the
berries that ripened by the road who before this great flux might have
shared the bread and flesh of the monasteries
but this was not the greatest of their difficulties on their arrival in
jerusalem they found that a sterner race had obtained possession of the
holy land the caliphs of bagdad had been succeeded by the harsh turks of
the race of seljook who looked upon the pilgrims with contempt and
aversion the turks of the eleventh century were more ferocious and less
scrupulous than the saracens of the tenth they were annoyed at the
immense number of pilgrims who overran the country and still more so
because they shewed no intention of quitting it the hourly expectation of
the last judgment kept them waiting and the turks apprehensive of being
at last driven from the soil by the swarms that were still arriving
heaped up difficulties in their way persecution of every kind awaited
them they were plundered and beaten with stripes and kept in suspense
for months at the gates of jerusalem unable to pay the golden bezant that
was to procure them admission
when the first epidemic terror of the day of judgment began to subside a
few pilgrims ventured to return to europe their hearts big with
indignation at the insults they had suffered every where as they passed
they related to a sympathising auditory the wrongs of christendom strange
to say even these recitals increased the mania for pilgrimage the
greater the dangers of the way the fairer chance that sins of deep dye
would be atoned for difficulty and suffering only heightened the merit
and fresh hordes issued from every town and village to win favour in the
sight of heaven by a visit to the holy sepulchre thus did things continue
during the whole of the eleventh century
the train that was to explode so fearfully was now laid and there wanted
but the hand to apply the torch at last the man appeared upon the scene
like all who have ever achieved so great an end peter the hermit was
exactly suited to the age neither behind it nor in advance of it but
acute enough to penetrate its mystery ere it was discovered by any other
enthusiastic chivalrous bigoted and if not insane not far removed
from insanity he was the very prototype of the time true enthusiasm is
always persevering and always eloquent and these two qualities were
united in no common degree in the person of this extraordinary preacher
he was a monk of amiens and ere he assumed the hood had served as a
soldier he is represented as having been ill favoured and low in stature
but with an eye of surpassing brightness and intelligence having been
seized with the mania of the age he visited jerusalem and remained there
till his blood boiled to see the cruel persecution heaped upon the
devotees on his return home he shook the world by the eloquent story of
their wrongs
before entering into any further details of the marvellous results of his
preaching it will be advisable to cast a glance at the state of the mind
of europe that we may understand all the better the causes of his
success first of all there was the priesthood which exercising as it
did the most conspicuous influence upon the fortunes of society claims
the largest share of attention religion was the ruling idea of that day
and the only civiliser capable of taming such wolves as then constituted
the flock of the faithful the clergy were all in all and though they
kept the popular mind in the most slavish subjection with regard to
religious matters they furnished it with the means of defence against all
other oppression except their own in the ecclesiastical ranks were
concentrated all the true piety all the learning all the wisdom of the
time and as a natural consequence a great portion of power which their
very wisdom perpetually incited them to extend the people knew nothing of
kings and nobles except in the way of injuries inflicted the first ruled
for or more properly speaking against the barons and the barons only
existed to brave the power of the kings or to trample with their iron
heels upon the neck of prostrate democracy the latter had no friend but
the clergy and these though they necessarily instilled the superstition
from which they themselves were not exempt yet taught the cheering
doctrine that all men were equal in the sight of heaven thus while
feudalism told them they had no rights in this world religion told them
they had every right in the next with this consolation they were for the
time content for political ideas had as yet taken no root when the
clergy for other reasons recommended the crusade the people joined in
it with enthusiasm the subject of palestine filled all minds the
pilgrims tales of two centuries warmed every imagination and when their
friends their guides and their instructors preached a war so much in
accordance with their own prejudices and modes of thinking the enthusiasm
rose into a frenzy
but while religion inspired the masses another agent was at work upon the
nobility these were fierce and lawless tainted with every vice endowed
with no virtue and redeemed by one good quality alone that of courage
the only religion they felt was the religion of fear that and their
overboiling turbulence alike combined to guide them to the holy land most
of them had sins enough to answer for they lived with their hand against
every man and with no law but their own passions they set at defiance
the secular power of the clergy but their hearts quailed at the awful
denunciations of the pulpit with regard to the life to come war was the
business and the delight of their existence and when they were promised
remission of all their sins upon the easy condition of following their
favourite bent it is not to be wondered at that they rushed with
enthusiasm to the onslaught and became as zealous in the service of the
cross as the great majority of the people who were swayed by more purely
religious motives fanaticism and the love of battle alike impelled them
to the war while the kings and princes of europe had still another motive
for encouraging their zeal policy opened their eyes to the great
advantages which would accrue to themselves by the absence of so many
restless intriguing and bloodthirsty men whose insolence it required
more than the small power of royalty to restrain within due bounds thus
every motive was favourable to the crusades every class of society was
alike incited to join or encourage the war kings and the clergy by
policy the nobles by turbulence and the love of dominion and the people
by religious zeal and the concentrated enthusiasm of two centuries
skilfully directed by their only instructors
it was in palestine itself that peter the hermit first conceived the grand
idea of rousing the powers of christendom to rescue the christians of the
east from the thraldom of the mussulmans and the sepulchre of jesus from
the rude hands of the infidel the subject engrossed his whole mind even
in the visions of the night he was full of it one dream made such an
impression upon him that he devoutly believed the saviour of the world
himself appeared before him and promised him aid and protection in his
holy undertaking if his zeal had ever wavered before this was sufficient
to fix it for ever
peter after he had performed all the penances and duties of his
pilgrimage demanded an interview with simeon the patriarch of the greek
church at jerusalem though the latter was a heretic in peters eyes yet
he was still a christian and felt as acutely as himself for the
persecutions heaped by the turks upon the followers of jesus the good
prelate entered fully into his views and at his suggestion wrote
letters to the pope and to the most influential monarchs of christendom
detailing the sorrows of the faithful and urging them to take up arms in
their defence peter was not a laggard in the work taking an affectionate
farewell of the patriarch he returned in all haste to italy pope urban
ii occupied the apostolic chair it was at that time far from being an
easy seat his predecessor gregory had bequeathed him a host of disputes
with the emperor henry iv of germany and he had converted philip i of
france into an enemy by his strenuous opposition to an adulterous
connexion formed by that monarch so many dangers encompassed him that
the vatican was no secure abode and he had taken refuge in apulia under
the protection of the renowned robert guiscard thither peter appears to
have followed him though in what spot their meeting took place is not
stated with any precision by ancient chroniclers or modern historians
urban received him most kindly read with tears in his eyes the epistle
from the patriarch simeon and listened to the eloquent story of the
hermit with an attention which shewed how deeply he sympathised with the
woes of the christian church enthusiasm is contagious and the pope
appears to have caught it instantly from one whose zeal was so unbounded
giving the hermit full powers he sent him abroad to preach the holy war
to all the nations and potentates of christendom the hermit preached and
countless thousands answered to his call france germany and italy
started at his voice and prepared for the deliverance of zion one of the
early historians of the crusade who was himself an eyewitness of the
rapture of europe1 describes the personal appearance of the hermit at
this time he says that there appeared to be something of divine in every
thing which he said or did the people so highly reverenced him that they
plucked hairs from the mane of his mule that they might keep them as
relics while preaching he wore in general a woollen tunic with a
darkcoloured mantle which fell down to his heels his arms and feet were
bare and he ate neither flesh nor bread supporting himself chiefly upon
fish and wine he set out says the chronicler from whence i know not
but we saw him passing through the towns and villages preaching every
where and the people surrounding him in crowds loading him with
offerings and celebrating his sanctity with such great praises that i
never remember to have seen such honours bestowed upon any one thus he
went on untired inflexible and full of devotion communicating his own
madness to his hearers until europe was stirred from its very depths
    1 guibert de nogent
while the hermit was appealing with such signal success to the people the
pope appealed with as much success to those who were to become the chiefs
and leaders of the expedition his first step was to call a council at
placentia in the autumn of the year 1095 here in the assembly of the
clergy the pope debated the grand scheme and gave audience to emissaries
who had been sent from constantinople by the emperor of the east to
detail the progress made by the turks in their design of establishing
themselves in europe the clergy were of course unanimous in support of
the crusade and the council separated each individual member of it being
empowered to preach it to his people
but italy could not be expected to furnish all the aid required and the
pope crossed the alps to inspire the fierce and powerful nobility and
chivalrous population of gaul his boldness in entering the territory and
placing himself in the power of his foe king philip of france is not the
least surprising feature of his mission some have imagined that cool
policy alone actuated him while others assert that it was mere zeal as
warm and as blind as that of peter the hermit the latter opinion seems to
be the true one society did not calculate the consequences of what it was
doing every man seemed to act from impulse only and the pope in
throwing himself into the heart of france acted as much from impulse as
the thousands who responded to his call a council was eventually summoned
to meet him at clermont in auvergne to consider the state of the church
reform abuses and above all make preparations for the war it was in
the midst of an extremely cold winter and the ground was covered with
snow during seven days the council sat with closed doors while immense
crowds from all parts of france flocked into the town in expectation that
the pope himself would address the people all the towns and villages for
miles around were filled with the multitude even the fields were
encumbered with people who unable to procure lodging pitched their
tents under the trees and by the wayside all the neighbourhood presented
the appearance of a vast camp
illustration the cathedral of clermont
during the seven days deliberation a sentence of excommunication was
passed upon king philip for adultery with bertrade de montfort countess
of anjou and for disobedience to the supreme authority of the apostolic
see this bold step impressed the people with reverence for so stern a
church which in the discharge of its duty shewed itself no respecter of
persons their love and their fear were alike increased and they were
prepared to listen with more intense devotion to the preaching of so
righteous and inflexible a pastor the great square before the cathedral
church of clermont became every instant more densely crowded as the hour
drew nigh when the pope was to address the populace issuing from the
church in his full canonicals surrounded by his cardinals and bishops in
all the splendour of romish ecclesiastical costume the pope stood before
the populace on a high scaffolding erected for the occasion and covered
with scarlet cloth a brilliant array of bishops and cardinals surrounded
him and among them humbler in rank but more important in the worlds
eye the hermit peter dressed in his simple and austere habiliments
historians differ as to whether or not peter addressed the crowd but as
all agree that he was present it seems reasonable to suppose that he
spoke but it was the oration of the pope that was most important as he
lifted up his hands to ensure attention every voice immediately became
still he began by detailing the miseries endured by their brethren in the
holy land how the plains of palestine were desolated by the outrageous
heathen who with the sword and the firebrand carried wailing into the
dwellings and flames into the possessions of the faithful how christian
wives and daughters were defiled by pagan lust how the altars of the true
god were desecrated and the relics of the saints trodden under foot
you continued the eloquent pontiff and urban ii was one of the most
eloquent men of the day you who hear me and who have received the
true faith and been endowed by god with power and strength and
greatness of soulwhose ancestors have been the prop of christendom and
whose kings have put a barrier against the progress of the infideli
call upon you to wipe off these impurities from the face of the earth and
lift your oppressed fellowchristians from the depths into which they have
been trampled the sepulchre of christ is possessed by the heathen the
sacred places dishonoured by their vileness oh brave knights and
faithful people offspring of invincible fathers ye will not degenerate
from your ancient renown ye will not be restrained from embarking in this
great cause by the tender ties of wife or little ones but will remember
the words of the saviour of the world himself whosoever loves father and
mother more than me is not worthy of me whosoever shall abandon for my
names sake his house or his brethren or his sisters or his father or
his mother or his wife or his children or his lands shall receive a
hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life
the warmth of the pontiff communicated itself to the crowd and the
enthusiasm of the people broke out several times ere he concluded his
address he went on to portray not only the spiritual but the temporal
advantages that would accrue to those who took up arms in the service of
the cross palestine was he said a land flowing with milk and honey and
precious in the sight of god as the scene of the grand events which had
saved mankind that land he promised should be divided among them
moreover they should have full pardon for all their offences either
against god or man go then he added in expiation of your sins and
go assured that after this world shall have passed away imperishable
glory shall be yours in the world which is to come the enthusiasm was no
longer to be restrained and loud shouts interrupted the speaker the
people exclaiming as if with one voice dieu le veult dieu le veult
with great presence of mind urban took advantage of the outburst and as
soon as silence was obtained continued dear brethren today is shewn
forth in you that which the lord has said by his evangelist when two or
three are gathered together in my name there will i be in the midst of
them to bless them if the lord god had not been in your souls you would
not all have pronounced the same words or rather god himself pronounced
them by your lips for it was he that put them in your hearts be they
then your warcry in the combat for those words came forth from god let
the army of the lord when it rushes upon his enemies shout but that one
cry dieu le veult dieu le veult let whoever is inclined to devote
himself to this holy cause make it a solemn engagement and bear the cross
of the lord either on his breast or his brow till he set out and let him
who is ready to begin his march place the holy emblem on his shoulders in
memory of that precept of our saviour he who does not take up his cross
and follow me is not worthy of me
the news of this council spread to the remotest parts of europe in an
incredibly short space of time long before the fleetest horseman could
have brought the intelligence it was known by the people in distant
provinces a fact which was considered as nothing less than supernatural
but the subject was in every bodys mouth and the minds of men were
prepared for the result the enthusiastic merely asserted what they
wished and the event tallied with their prediction this was however
quite enough in those days for a miracle and as a miracle every one
regarded it
for several months after the council of clermont france and germany
presented a singular spectacle the pious the fanatic the needy the
dissolute the young and the old even women and children and the halt
and lame enrolled themselves by hundreds in every village the clergy
were busied in keeping up the excitement promising eternal rewards to
those who assumed the red cross and fulminating the most awful
denunciations against all the worldlyminded who refused or even
hesitated every debtor who joined the crusade was freed by the papal
edict from the claims of his creditors outlaws of every grade were made
equal with the honest upon the same conditions the property of those who
went was placed under the protection of the church and st paul and st
peter themselves were believed to descend from their high abode to watch
over the chattels of the absent pilgrims signs and portents were seen in
the air to increase the fervour of the multitude an auroraborealis of
unusual brilliancy appeared and thousands of the crusaders came out to
gaze upon it prostrating themselves upon the earth in adoration it was
thought to be a sure prognostic of the interposition of the most high and
a representation of his armies fighting with and overthrowing the
infidels reports of wonders were every where rife a monk had seen two
gigantic warriors on horseback the one representing a christian and the
other a turk fighting in the sky with flaming swords the christian of
course overcoming the paynim myriads of stars were said to have fallen
from heaven each representing the fall of a pagan foe it was believed at
the same time that the emperor charlemagne would rise from the grave and
lead on to victory the embattled armies of the lord a singular feature of
the popular madness was the enthusiasm of the women every where they
encouraged their lovers and husbands to forsake all things for the holy
war many of them burned the sign of the cross upon their breasts and
arms and coloured the wound with a red dye as a lasting memorial of
their zeal others still more zealous impressed the mark by the same
means upon the tender limbs of young children and infants at the breast
guibert de nogent tells of a monk who made a large incision upon his
forehead in the form of a cross which he coloured with some powerful
ingredient telling the people that an angel had done it when he was
asleep this monk appears to have been more of a rogue than a fool for he
contrived to fare more sumptuously than any of his brother pilgrims upon
the strength of his sanctity the crusaders every where gave him presents
of food and money and he became quite fat ere he arrived at jerusalem
notwithstanding the fatigues of the way if he had acknowledged in the
first place that he had made the wound himself he would not have been
thought more holy than his fellows but the story of the angel was a
clincher
all those who had property of any description rushed to the mart to change
it into hard cash lands and houses could be had for a quarter of their
value while arms and accoutrements of war rose in the same proportion
corn which had been excessively dear in anticipation of a year of
scarcity suddenly became plentiful and such was the diminution in the
value of provisions that seven sheep were sold for five deniers2 the
nobles mortgaged their estates for mere trifles to jews and unbelievers
or conferred charters of immunity upon the towns and communes within their
fiefs for sums which a few years previously they would have rejected
with disdain the farmer endeavoured to sell his plough and the artisan
his tools to purchase a sword for the deliverance of jerusalem women
disposed of their trinkets for the same purpose during the spring and
summer of this year 1096 the roads teemed with crusaders all hastening
to the towns and villages appointed as the rendezvous of the district
some were on horseback some in carts and some came down the rivers in
boats and rafts bringing their wives and children all eager to go to
jerusalem very few knew where jerusalem was some thought it fifty
thousand miles away and others imagined that it was but a months
journey while at sight of every town or castle the children exclaimed
is that jerusalem is that the city3 parties of knights and nobles
might be seen travelling eastward and amusing themselves as they went
with the knightly diversion of hawking to lighten the fatigues of the
way
    2 guibert de nogent
    3 guibert de nogent
guibert de nogent who did not write from hearsay but from actual
observation says the enthusiasm was so contagious that when any one
heard the orders of the pontiff he went instantly to solicit his
neighbours and friends to join with him in the way of god for so they
called the proposed expedition the counts palatine were full of the
desire to undertake the journey and all the inferior knights were
animated with the same zeal even the poor caught the flame so ardently
that no one paused to think of the inadequacy of his means or to consider
whether he ought to yield up his farm his vineyard or his fields each
one set about selling his property at as low a price as if he had been
held in some horrible captivity and sought to pay his ransom without loss
of time those who had not determined upon the journey joked and laughed
at those who were thus disposing of their goods at such ruinous prices
prophesying that the expedition would be miserable and their return worse
but they held this language only for a day the next they were suddenly
seized with the same frenzy as the rest those who had been loudest in
their jeers gave up all their property for a few crowns and set out with
those they had so laughed at a few hours before in most cases the laugh
was turned against them for when it became known that a man was
hesitating his more zealous neighbours sent him a present of a
knittingneedle or a distaff to shew their contempt of him there was no
resisting this so that the fear of ridicule contributed its fair
contingent to the armies of the lord
another effect of the crusade was the religious obedience with which it
inspired the people and the nobility for that singular institution the
truce of god at the commencement of the eleventh century the clergy of
france sympathising for the woes of the people but unable to diminish
them by repressing the rapacity and insolence of the feudal chiefs
endeavoured to promote universal goodwill by the promulgation of the
famous peace of god all who conformed to it bound themselves by oath
not to take revenge for any injury not to enjoy the fruits of property
usurped from others nor to use deadly weapons in reward of which they
would receive remission of all their sins however benevolent the
intention of this peace it led to nothing but perjury and violence
reigned as uncontrolled as before in the year 1041 another attempt was
made to soften the angry passions of the semibarbarous chiefs and the
truce of god was solemnly proclaimed the truce lasted from the
wednesday evening to the monday morning of every week in which interval
it was strictly forbidden to recur to violence on any pretext or to seek
revenge for any injury it was impossible to civilise men by these means
few even promised to become peaceable for so unconscionable a period as
five days aweek or if they did they made ample amends on the two days
left open to them the truce was afterwards shortened from the saturday
evening to the monday morning but little or no diminution of violence and
bloodshed was the consequence at the council of clermont urban ii again
solemnly proclaimed the truce so strong was the religious feeling that
every one hastened to obey all minor passions disappeared before the
grand passion of crusading the feudal chief ceased to oppress the robber
to plunder the people to complain but one idea was in all hearts and
there seemed to be no room for any other
the encampments of these heterogeneous multitudes offered a singular
aspect those vassals who ranged themselves under the banners of their
lord erected tents around his castle while those who undertook the war on
their own account constructed booths and huts in the neighbourhood of the
towns or villages preparatory to their joining some popular leader of the
expedition the meadows of france were covered with tents as the
belligerents were to have remission of all their sins on their arrival in
palestine hundreds of them gave themselves up to the most unbounded
licentiousness the courtesan with the red cross upon her shoulders
plied her shameless trade with sensual pilgrims without scruple on either
side the lover of good cheer gave loose rein to his appetite and
drunkenness and debauchery flourished their zeal in the service of the
lord was to wipe out all faults and follies and they had the same surety
of salvation as the rigid anchorite this reasoning had charms for the
ignorant and the sounds of lewd revelry and the voice of prayer rose at
the same instant from the camp
it is now time to speak of the leaders of the expedition great multitudes
ranged themselves under the command of peter the hermit whom as the
originator they considered the most appropriate leader of the war others
joined the banner of a bold adventurer whom history has dignified with no
other name than that of gautier sans avoir or walter the pennyless but
who is represented as having been of noble family and well skilled in the
art of war a third multitude from germany flocked around the standard of
a monk named gottschalk of whom nothing is known except that he was a
fanatic of the deepest dye all these bands which together are said to
have amounted to three hundred thousand men women and children were
composed of the vilest rascality of europe without discipline principle
or true courage they rushed through the nations like a pestilence
spreading terror and death wherever they went the first multitude that
set forth was led by walter the pennyless early in the spring of 1096
within a very few months after the council of clermont each man of that
irregular host aspired to be his own master like their nominal leader
each was poor to penury and trusted for subsistence on his journey to the
chances of the road rolling through germany like a tide they entered
hungary where at first they were received with some degree of kindness
by the people the latter had not yet caught sufficient of the fire of
enthusiasm to join the crusade themselves but were willing enough to
forward the cause by aiding those embarked in it unfortunately this good
understanding did not last long the swarm were not contented with food
for their necessities but craved for luxuries also they attacked and
plundered the dwellings of the country people and thought nothing of
murder where resistance was offered on their arrival before semlin the
outraged hungarians collected in large numbers and attacking the rear of
the crusading host slew a great many of the stragglers and taking away
their arms and crosses affixed them as trophies to the walls of the city
walter appears to have been in no mood or condition to make reprisals for
his army destructive as a plague of locusts when plunder urged them on
were useless against any regular attack from a determined enemy their
rear continued to be thus harassed by the wrathful hungarians until they
were fairly out of their territory on his entrance into bulgaria walter
met with no better fate the cities and towns refused to let him pass the
villages denied him provisions and the citizens and country people
uniting slaughtered his followers by hundreds the progress of the army
was more like a retreat than an advance but as it was impossible to stand
still walter continued his course till he arrived at constantinople with
a force which famine and the sword had diminished to onethird of its
original number
the greater multitude led by the enthusiastic hermit followed close upon
his heels with a bulky train of baggage and women and children
sufficient to form a host of themselves if it were possible to find a
rabble more vile than the army of walter the pennyless it was that led by
peter the hermit being better provided with means they were not reduced
to the necessity of pillage in their progress through hungary and had
they taken any other route than that which led through semlin might
perhaps have traversed the country without molestation on their arrival
before that city their fury was raised at seeing the arms and red crosses
of their predecessors hanging as trophies over the gates their pentup
ferocity exploded at the sight the city was tumultuously attacked and
the besiegers entering not by dint of bravery but of superior numbers
it was given up to all the horrors which follow when victory brutality
and licentiousness are linked together every evil passion was allowed to
revel with impunity and revenge lust and avariceeach had its
hundreds of victims in unhappy semlin any maniac can kindle a
conflagration but it may require many wise men to put it out peter the
hermit had blown the popular fury into a flame but to cool it again was
beyond his power his followers rioted unrestrained until the fear of
retaliation warned them to desist when the king of hungary was informed
of the disasters of semlin he marched with a sufficient force to chastise
the hermit who at the news broke up his camp and retreated towards the
morava a broad and rapid stream that joins the danube a few miles to the
eastward of belgrade here a party of indignant bulgarians awaited him
and so harassed him as to make the passage of the river a task both of
difficulty and danger great numbers of his infatuated followers perished
in the waters and many fell under the swords of the bulgarians the
ancient chronicles do not mention the amount of the hermits loss at this
passage but represent it in general terms as very great
at nissa the duke of bulgaria fortified himself in fear of an assault
but peter having learned a little wisdom from experience thought it best
to avoid hostilities he passed three nights in quietness under the walls
and the duke not wishing to exasperate unnecessarily so fierce and
rapacious a host allowed the townspeople to supply them with provisions
peter took his departure peaceably on the following morning but some
german vagabonds falling behind the main body of the army set fire to
the mills and house of a bulgarian with whom it appears they had had
some dispute on the previous evening the citizens of nissa who had
throughout mistrusted the crusaders and were prepared for the worst
sallied out immediately and took signal vengeance the spoilers were cut
to pieces and the townspeople pursuing the hermit captured all the women
and children who had lagged in the rear and a great quantity of baggage
peter hereupon turned round and marched back to nissa to demand
explanation of the duke of bulgaria the latter fairly stated the
provocation given and the hermit could urge nothing in palliation of so
gross an outrage a negotiation was entered into which promised to be
successful and the bulgarians were about to deliver up the women and
children when a party of undisciplined crusaders acting solely upon
their own suggestion endeavoured to scale the walls and seize upon the
town peter in vain exerted his authority the confusion became general
and after a short but desperate battle the crusaders threw down their
arms and fled in all directions their vast host was completely routed
the slaughter being so great among them as to be counted not by
hundreds but by thousands
it is said that the hermit fled from this fatal field to a forest a few
miles from nissa abandoned by every human creature it would be curious
to know whether after so dire a reverse
                        his enpierced breast
    sharp sorrow did in thousand pieces rive
or whether his fiery zeal still rose superior to calamity and pictured
the eventual triumph of his cause he so lately the leader of a hundred
thousand men was now a solitary skulker in the forests liable at every
instant to be discovered by some pursuing bulgarian and cut off in mid
career chance at last brought him within sight of an eminence where two
or three of his bravest knights had collected five hundred of the
stragglers these gladly received the hermit and a consultation having
taken place it was resolved to gather together the scattered remnants of
the army fires were lighted on the hill and scouts sent out in all
directions for the fugitives horns were sounded at intervals to make
known that friends were near and before nightfall the hermit saw himself
at the head of seven thousand men during the succeeding day he was
joined by twenty thousand more and with this miserable remnant of his
force he pursued his route towards constantinople the bones of the rest
mouldered in the forests of bulgaria
on his arrival at constantinople where he found walter the pennyless
awaiting him he was hospitably received by the emperor alexius it might
have been expected that the sad reverses they had undergone would have
taught his followers common prudence but unhappily for them their
turbulence and love of plunder was not to be restrained although they
were surrounded by friends by whom all their wants were liberally
supplied they could not refrain from rapine in vain the hermit exhorted
them to tranquillity he possessed no more power over them in subduing
their passions than the obscurest soldier of the host they set fire to
several public buildings in constantinople out of pure mischief and
stripped the lead from the roofs of the churches which they afterwards
sold for old metal in the purlieus of the city from this time may be
dated the aversion which the emperor alexius entertained for the
crusaders and which was afterwards manifested in all his actions even
when he had to deal with the chivalrous and more honourable armies which
arrived after the hermit he seems to have imagined that the turks
themselves were enemies less formidable to his power than these
outpourings of the refuse of europe he soon found a pretext to hurry them
into asia minor peter crossed the bosphorus with walter but the excesses
of his followers were such that despairing of accomplishing any good end
by remaining at their head he left them to themselves and returned to
constantinople on the pretext of making arrangements with the government
of alexius for a proper supply of provisions the crusaders forgetting
that they were in the enemys country and that union above all things
was desirable gave themselves up to dissensions violent disputes arose
between the lombards and normans commanded by walter the pennyless and
the franks and germans led out by peter the latter separated themselves
from the former and choosing for their leader one reinaldo or reinhold
marched forward and took possession of the fortress of exorogorgon the
sultan solimaun was on the alert with a superior force a party of
crusaders which had been detached from the fort and stationed at a
little distance as an ambuscade were surprised and cut to pieces and
exorogorgon invested on all sides the siege was protracted for eight
days during which the christians suffered the most acute agony from the
want of water it is hard to say how long the hope of succour or the
energy of despair would have enabled them to hold out their treacherous
leader cut the matter short by renouncing the christian faith and
delivering up the fort into the hands of the sultan he was followed by
two or three of his officers all the rest refusing to become mahometans
were ruthlessly put to the sword thus perished the last wretched remnant
of the vast multitude which had traversed europe with peter the hermit
walter the pennyless and his multitude met as miserable a fate on the
news of the disasters of exorogorgon they demanded to be led instantly
against the turks walter who only wanted good soldiers to have made a
good general was cooler of head and saw all the dangers of such a step
his force was wholly insufficient to make any decisive movement in a
country where the enemy was so much superior and where in case of
defeat he had no secure position to fall back upon and he therefore
expressed his opinion against advancing until the arrival of
reinforcements this prudent counsel found no favour the army loudly
expressed their dissatisfaction at their chief and prepared to march
forward without him upon this the brave walter put himself at their
head and rushed to destruction proceeding towards nice the modern
isnik he was intercepted by the army of the sultan a fierce battle
ensued in which the turks made fearful havoc out of twentyfive thousand
christians twentytwo thousand were slain and among them gautier
himself who fell pierced by seven mortal wounds the remaining three
thousand retreated upon civitot where they entrenched themselves

disgusted as was peter the hermit at the excesses of the multitude who
at his call had forsaken europe his heart was moved with grief and pity
at their misfortunes all his former zeal revived casting himself at the
feet of the emperor alexius he implored him with tears in his eyes to
send relief to the few survivors at civitot the emperor consented and a
force was sent which arrived just in time to save them from destruction
the turks had beleaguered the place and the crusaders were reduced to the
last extremity negotiations were entered into and the last three
thousand were conducted in safety to constantinople alexius had suffered
too much by their former excesses to be very desirous of retaining them in
his capital he therefore caused them all to be disarmed and furnishing
each with a sum of money he sent them back to their own country
while these events were taking place fresh hordes were issuing from the
woods and wilds of germany all bent for the holy land they were
commanded by a fanatical priest named gottschalk who like gautier and
peter the hermit took his way through hungary history is extremely
meagre in her details of the conduct and fate of this host which amounted
to at least one hundred thousand men robbery and murder seem to have
journeyed with them and the poor hungarians were rendered almost
desperate by their numbers and rapacity karloman the king of the
country made a bold effort to get rid of them for the resentment of his
people had arrived at such a height that nothing short of the total
extermination of the crusaders would satisfy them gottschalk had to pay
the penalty not only for the ravages of his own bands but for those of
the swarms that had come before him he and his army were induced by some
means or other to lay down their arms the savage hungarians seeing them
thus defenceless set upon them and slaughtered them in great numbers
how many escaped their arrows we are not informed but not one of them
reached palestine
other swarms under nameless leaders issued from germany and france more
brutal and more frantic than any that had preceded them their fanaticism
surpassed by far the wildest freaks of the followers of the hermit in
bands varying in numbers from one to five thousand they traversed the
country in all directions bent upon plunder and massacre they wore the
symbol of the crusade upon their shoulders but inveighed against the
folly of proceeding to the holy land to destroy the turks while they left
behind them so many jews the still more inveterate enemies of christ
they swore fierce vengeance against this unhappy race and murdered all
the hebrews they could lay their hands on first subjecting them to the
most horrible mutilation according to the testimony of albert aquensis
they lived among each other in the most shameless profligacy and their
vice was only exceeded by their superstition whenever they were in search
of jews they were preceded by a goose and goat which they believed to be
holy and animated with divine power to discover the retreats of the
unbelievers in germany alone they slaughtered more than a thousand jews
notwithstanding all the efforts of the clergy to save them so dreadful
was the cruelty of their tormentors that great numbers of jews committed
selfdestruction to avoid falling into their hands
again it fell to the lot of the hungarians to deliver europe from these
pests when there were no more jews to murder the bands collected in one
body and took the old route to the holy land a route stained with the
blood of three hundred thousand who had gone before and destined also to
receive theirs the number of these swarms has never been stated but so
many of them perished in hungary that contemporary writers despairing of
giving any adequate idea of their multitudes state that the fields were
actually heaped with their corpses and that for miles in its course the
waters of the danube were dyed with their blood it was at mersburg on
the danube that the greatest slaughter took placea slaughter so great
as to amount almost to extermination the hungarians for a while disputed
the passage of the river but the crusaders forced their way across and
attacking the city with the blind courage of madness succeeded in making
a breach in the walls at this moment of victory an unaccountable fear
came over them throwing down their arms they fled panicstricken no one
knew why and no one knew whither the hungarians followed sword in hand
and cut them down without remorse and in such numbers that the stream of
the danube is said to have been choked up by their unburied bodies
this was the worst paroxysm of the madness of europe and this passed her
chivalry stepped upon the scene men of cool heads mature plans and
invincible courage stood forward to lead and direct the grand movement of
europe upon asia it is upon these men that romance has lavished her most
admiring epithets leaving to the condemnation of history the vileness and
brutality of those who went before of these leaders the most
distinguished were godfrey of bouillon duke of lorraine and raymond count
of toulouse four other chiefs of the royal blood of europe also assumed
the cross and led each his army to the holy land hugh count of
vermandois brother of the king of france robert duke of normandy the
elder brother of william rufus robert count of flanders and bohemund
prince of tarentum eldest son of the celebrated robert guiscard these
men were all tinged with the fanaticism of the age but none of them acted
entirely from religious motives they were neither utterly reckless like
gautier sans avoir crazy like peter the hermit nor brutal like
gottschalk the monk but possessed each of these qualities in a milder
form their valour being tempered by caution their religious zeal by
worldly views and their ferocity by the spirit of chivalry they saw
whither led the torrent of the public will and it being neither their
wish nor their interest to stem it they allowed themselves to be carried
with it in the hope that it would lead them at last to a haven of
aggrandisement around them congregated many minor chiefs the flower of
the nobility of france and italy with some few from germany england and
spain it was wisely conjectured that armies so numerous would find a
difficulty in procuring provisions if they all journeyed by the same road
they therefore resolved to separate godfrey de bouillon proceeding
through hungary and bulgaria the count of toulouse through lombardy and
dalmatia and the other leaders through apulia to constantinople where
the several divisions were to reunite the forces under these leaders have
been variously estimated the princess anna comnena talks of them as
having been as numerous as the sands on the seashore or the stars in the
firmament fulcher of chartres is more satisfactory and exaggerates less
magnificently when he states that all the divisions when they had sat
down before nice in bithynia amounted to one hundred thousand horsemen
and six hundred thousand men on foot exclusive of the priests women and
children gibbon is of opinion that this amount is exaggerated but thinks
the actual numbers did not fall very far short of the calculation the
princess anna afterwards gives the number of those under godfrey of
bouillon as eighty thousand foot and horse and supposing that each of the
other chiefs led an army as numerous the total would be near half a
million this must be over rather than under the mark as the army of
godfrey of bouillon was confessedly the largest when it set out and
suffered less by the way than any other

the count of vermandois was the first who set foot on the grecian
territory on his arrival at durazzo he was received with every mark of
respect and courtesy by the agents of the emperor and his followers were
abundantly supplied with provisions suddenly however and without cause
assigned the count was arrested by order of the emperor alexius and
conveyed a close prisoner to constantinople various motives have been
assigned by different authors as having induced the emperor to this
treacherous and imprudent proceeding by every writer he has been
condemned for so flagrant a breach of hospitality and justice the most
probable reason for his conduct appears to be that suggested by guibert of
nogent who states that alexius fearful of the designs of the crusaders
upon his throne resorted to this extremity in order afterwards to force
the count to take the oath of allegiance to him as the price of his
liberation the example of a prince so eminent as the brother of the king
of france would he thought be readily followed by the other chiefs of
the crusade in the result he was wofully disappointed as every man
deserves to be who commits positive evil that doubtful good may ensue but
this line of policy accorded well enough with the narrowmindedness of the
emperor who in the enervating atmosphere of his highly civilised and
luxurious court dreaded the influx of the hardy and ambitious warriors of
the west and strove to nibble away by unworthy means the power which he
had not energy enough to confront if danger to himself had existed from
the residence of the chiefs in his dominions he might easily have averted
it by the simple means of placing himself at the head of the european
movement and directing its energies to their avowed object the conquest
of the holy land but the emperor instead of being as he might have
been the lord and leader of the crusades which he had himself aided in
no inconsiderable degree to suscitate by his embassies to the pope became
the slave of men who hated and despised him no doubt the barbarous
excesses of the followers of gautier and peter the hermit made him look
upon the whole body of them with disgust but it was the disgust of a
little mind which is glad of any excuse to palliate or justify its own
irresolution and love of ease
godfrey of bouillon traversed hungary in the most quiet and orderly
manner on his arrival at mersburg he found the country strewed with the
mangled corpses of the jewkillers and demanded of the king of hungary
for what reason his people had set upon them the latter detailed the
atrocities they had committed and made it so evident to godfrey that the
hungarians had only acted in selfdefence that the highminded leader
declared himself satisfied and passed on without giving or receiving
molestation on his arrival at philippopoli he was informed for the first
time of the imprisonment of the count of vermandois he immediately sent
messengers to the emperor demanding the counts release and threatening
in case of refusal to lay waste the country with fire and sword after
waiting a day at philippopoli he marched on to adrianople where he was
met by his messengers returning with the emperors refusal godfrey the
bravest and most determined of the leaders of the crusade was not a man
to swerve from his word and the country was given up to pillage alexius
here committed another blunder no sooner did he learn from dire
experience that the crusader was not an utterer of idle threats than he
consented to the release of the prisoner as he had been unjust in the
first instance he became cowardly in the second and taught his enemies
for so the crusaders were forced to consider themselves a lesson which
they took care to remember to his cost that they could hope nothing from
his sense of justice but every thing from his fears godfrey remained
encamped for several weeks in the neighbourhood of constantinople to the
great annoyance of alexius who sought by every means to extort from him
the homage he had extorted from vermandois sometimes he acted as if at
open and declared war with the crusaders and sent his troops against
them sometimes he refused to supply them with food and ordered the
markets to be shut against them while at other times he was all for peace
and goodwill and sent costly presents to godfrey the honest
straightforward crusader was at last so wearied by his false kindness and
so pestered by his attacks that allowing his indignation to get the
better of his judgment he gave up the country around constantinople to be
plundered by his soldiers for six days the flames of the farmhouses
around struck terror into the heart of alexius but as godfrey
anticipated they convinced him of his error fearing that constantinople
itself would be the next object of attack he sent messengers to demand an
interview with godfrey offering at the same time to leave his son as a
hostage for his good faith godfrey agreed to meet him and whether to
put an end to these useless dissensions or for some other unexplained
reason he rendered homage to alexius as his liege lord he was thereupon
loaded with honours and according to a singular custom of that age
underwent the ceremony of the adoption of honour as son to the emperor
godfrey and his brother baudouin de bouillon conducted themselves with
proper courtesy on this occasion but were not able to restrain the
insolence of their followers who did not conceive themselves bound to
keep any terms with a man so insincere as he had shewn himself one
barbarous chieftain count robert of paris carried his insolence so far
as to seat himself upon the throne an insult which alexius merely
resented with a sneer but which did not induce him to look with less
mistrust upon the hordes that were still advancing
it is impossible notwithstanding his treachery to avoid feeling some
compassion for the emperor whose life at this time was rendered one long
scene of misery by the presumption of the crusaders and his not
altogether groundless fears of the evil they might inflict upon him
should any untoward circumstance force the current of their ambition to
the conquest of his empire his daughter anna comnena feelingly deplores
his state of life at this time and a learned german4 in a recent work
describes it on the authority of the princess in the following manner
to avoid all occasion of offence to the crusaders alexius complied with
all their whims and their on many occasions unreasonable demands even
at the expense of great bodily exertion at a time when he was suffering
severely under the gout which eventually brought him to his grave no
crusader who desired an interview with him was refused access he listened
with the utmost patience to the longwinded harangues which their
loquacity or zeal continually wearied him with he endured without
expressing any impatience the unbecoming and haughty language which they
permitted themselves to employ towards him and severely reprimanded his
officers when they undertook to defend the dignity of the imperial station
from these rude assaults for he trembled with apprehension at the
slightest disputes lest they might become the occasion of greater evil
though the counts often appeared before him with trains altogether
unsuitable to their dignity and to hissometimes with an entire troop
which completely filled the royal apartmentthe emperor held his peace
he listened to them at all hours he often seated himself on his throne at
daybreak to attend to their wishes and requests and the evening twilight
saw him still in the same place very frequently he could not snatch time
to refresh himself with meat and drink during many nights he could not
obtain any repose and was obliged to indulge in an unrefreshing sleep
upon his throne with his head resting on his hands even this slumber was
continually disturbed by the appearance and harangues of some
newlyarrived rude knights when all the courtiers wearied out by the
efforts of the day and by nightwatching could no longer keep themselves
on their feet and sank down exhaustedsome upon benches and others on
the flooralexius still rallied his strength to listen with seeming
attention to the wearisome chatter of the latins that they might have no
occasion or pretext for discontent in such a state of fear and anxiety
how could alexius comport himself with dignity and like an emperor
    4 m wilkens geschichte der kreuzzge
alexius however had himself to blame in a great measure for the
indignities he suffered owing to his insincerity the crusaders
mistrusted him so much that it became at last a common saying that the
turks and saracens were not such inveterate foes to the western or latin
christians as the emperor alexius and the greeks5 it would be needless
in this sketch which does not profess to be so much a history of the
crusades as of the madness of europe from which they sprang to detail
the various acts of bribery and intimidation cajolery and hostility by
which alexius contrived to make each of the leaders in succession as they
arrived take the oath of allegiance to him as their suzerain one way or
another he exacted from each the barren homage on which he had set his
heart and they were then allowed to proceed into asia minor one only

their residence in constantinople was productive of no good to the armies
of the cross bickerings and contentions on the one hand and the
influence of a depraved and luxurious court on the other destroyed the
elasticity of their spirits and cooled the first ardour of their
enthusiasm at one time the army of the count of toulouse was on the point
of disbanding itself and had not their leader energetically removed them
across the bosphorus this would have been the result once in asia their
spirits in some degree revived and the presence of danger and difficulty
nerved them to the work they had undertaken the first operation of the
war was the siege of nice to gain possession of which all their efforts
were directed
godfrey of bouillon and the count of vermandois were joined under its
walls by each host in succession as it left constantinople among the
celebrated crusaders who fought at this siege we find besides the leaders
already mentioned the brave and generous tancred whose name and fame
have been immortalised in the gerusalemme liberata the valorous bishop
of puy baldwin afterwards king of jerusalem and peter the hermit now
an almost solitary soldier shorn of all the power and influence he had
formerly possessed kilij aslaun the sultan of roum and chief of the
seljukian turks whose deeds surrounded by the false halo of romance are
familiar to the readers of tasso under the name of soliman marched to
defend this city but was defeated after several obstinate engagements in
which the christians shewed a degree of heroism that quite astonished him
the turkish chief had expected to find a wild undisciplined multitude
like that under peter the hermit without leaders capable of enforcing
obedience instead of which he found the most experienced leaders of the
age at the head of armies that had just fanaticism enough to be ferocious
but not enough to render them ungovernable in these engagements many
hundreds fell on both sides and on both sides the most revolting
barbarity was practised the crusaders cut off the heads of the fallen
mussulmans and sent them in panniers to constantinople as trophies of
their victory after the temporary defeat of kilij aslaun the siege of
nice was carried on with redoubled vigour the turks defended themselves
with the greatest obstinacy and discharged showers of poisoned arrows
upon the crusaders when any unfortunate wretch was killed under the
walls they let down iron hooks from above and drew the body up which
after stripping and mutilating they threw back again at the besiegers
the latter were well supplied with provisions and for sixandthirty days
the siege continued without any relaxation of the efforts on either side
many tales are told of the almost superhuman heroism of the christian
leadershow one man put a thousand to flight and how the arrows of the
faithful never missed their mark one anecdote of godfrey of bouillon
related by albert of aix is worth recording not only as shewing the high
opinion entertained of his valour but as shewing the contagious credulity
of the armiesa credulity which as often led them to the very verge of
defeat as it incited them to victory one turk of gigantic stature took
his station day by day on the battlements of nice and bearing an
enormous bow committed great havoc among the christian host not a shaft
he sped but bore death upon its point and although the crusaders aimed
repeatedly at his breast and he stood in the most exposed position their
arrows fell harmless at his feet he seemed to be invulnerable to attack
and a report was soon spread abroad that he was no other than the arch
fiend himself and that mortal hand could not prevail against him godfrey
of bouillon who had no faith in the supernatural character of the
mussulman determined if possible to put an end to the dismay which was
rapidly paralysing the exertions of his best soldiers taking a huge
crossbow he stood forward in front of the army to try the steadiness of
his hand against the muchdreaded archer the shaft was aimed directly at
his heart and took fatal effect the moslem fell amid the groans of the
besieged and the shouts of deus adjuva deus adjuva the warcry of the
besiegers
at last the crusaders imagined that they had overcome all obstacles and
were preparing to take possession of the city when to their great
astonishment they saw the flag of the emperor alexius flying from the
battlements an emissary of the emperor named faticius or tatin had
contrived to gain admission with a body of greek troops at a point which
the crusaders had left unprotected and had persuaded the turks to
surrender to him rather than to the crusading forces the greatest
indignation prevailed in the army when this stratagem was discovered and
the soldiers were with the utmost difficulty prevented from renewing the
attack and besieging the greek emissary
the army however continued its march and by some means or other was
broken into two divisions some historians say accidentally6 while
others affirm by mutual consent and for the convenience of obtaining
provisions on the way7 the one division was composed of the forces
under bohemund tancred and the duke of normandy while the other which
took a route at some distance on the right was commanded by godfrey of
bouillon and the other chiefs the sultan of roum who after his losses
at nice had been silently making great efforts to crush the crusaders at
one blow collected in a very short time all the multitudinous tribes that
owed him allegiance and with an army which according to a moderate
calculation amounted to two hundred thousand men chiefly cavalry he
fell upon the first division of the christian host in the valley of
dorylum it was early in the morning of the 1st of july 1097 when the
crusaders saw the first companies of the turkish horsemen pouring down
upon them from the hills bohemund had hardly time to set himself in
order and transport his sick and helpless to the rear when the
overwhelming force of the orientals was upon him the christian army
composed principally of men on foot gave way on all sides and the hoofs
of the turkish steeds and the poisoned arrows of their bowmen mowed them
down by hundreds after having lost the flower of their chivalry the
christians retreated upon their baggage when a dreadful slaughter took
place neither women nor children nor the sick were spared just as they
were reduced to the last extremity godfrey of bouillon and the count of
toulouse made their appearance on the field and turned the tide of
battle after an obstinate engagement the turks fled and their rich camp
fell into the hands of the enemy the loss of the crusaders amounted to
about four thousand men with several chiefs of renown among whom were
count robert of paris and william the brother of tancred the loss of the
turks which did not exceed this number taught them to pursue a different
mode of warfare the sultan was far from being defeated with his still
gigantic army he laid waste all the country on either side of the
crusaders the latter who were unaware of the tactics of the enemy found
plenty of provisions in the turkish camp but so far from economising
these resources they gave themselves up for several days to the most
unbounded extravagance they soon paid dearly for their heedlessness in
the ravaged country of phrygia through which they advanced towards
antiochetta they suffered dreadfully for want of food for themselves and
pasture for their cattle above them was a scorching sun almost
sufficient of itself to dry up the freshness of the land a task which the
firebrands of the sultan had but too surely effected and water was not to
be had after the first day of their march the pilgrims died at the rate
of five hundred a day the horses of the knights perished on the road and
the baggage which they had aided to transport was either placed upon dogs
sheep and swine or abandoned altogether in some of the calamities that
afterwards befell them the christians gave themselves up to the most
reckless profligacy but upon this occasion the dissensions which
prosperity had engendered were all forgotten religion often disregarded
arose in the stern presence of misfortune and cheered them as they died
by the promises of eternal felicity

at length they reached antiochetta where they found water in abundance
and pastures for their expiring cattle plenty once more surrounded them
and here they pitched their tents untaught by the bitter experience of
famine they again gave themselves up to luxury and waste
on the 18th of october they sat down before the strong city of antioch
the siege of which and the events to which it gave rise are among the
most extraordinary incidents of the crusade the city which is situated
on an eminence and washed by the river orontes is naturally a very
strong position and the turkish garrison were well supplied with
provisions to endure a long siege in this respect the christians were
also fortunate but unluckily for themselves unwise their force amounted
to three hundred thousand fighting men and we are informed by raymond
dargilles that they had so much provision that they threw away the
greater part of every animal they killed being so dainty that they would
only eat particular parts of the beast so insane was their extravagance
that in less than ten days famine began to stare them in the face after
making a fruitless attempt to gain possession of the city by a coup de
main they starving themselves sat down to starve out the enemy but
with want came a cooling of enthusiasm the chiefs began to grow weary of
the expedition baldwin had previously detached himself from the main body
of the army and proceeding to edessa had intrigued himself into the
supreme power in that little principality the other leaders were animated
with less zeal than heretofore stephen of chartres and hugh of vermandois
began to waver unable to endure the privations which their own folly and
profusion had brought upon them even peter the hermit became sick at
heart ere all was over when the famine had become so urgent that they
were reduced to eat human flesh in the extremity of their hunger bohemund
and robert of flanders set forth on an expedition to procure a supply
they were in a slight degree successful but the relief they brought was
not economised and in two days they were as destitute as before
faticius the greek commander and representative of alexius deserted with
his division under pretence of seeking for food and his example was
followed by various bodies of crusaders
misery was rife among those who remained and they strove to alleviate it
by a diligent attention to signs and omens these with extraordinary
visions seen by the enthusiastic alternately cheered and depressed them
according as they foretold the triumph or pictured the reverses of the
cross at one time a violent hurricane arose levelling great trees with
the ground and blowing down the tents of the christian leaders at
another time an earthquake shook the camp and was thought to
prognosticate some great impending evil to the cause of christendom but a
comet which appeared shortly afterwards raised them from the despondency
into which they had fallen their lively imaginations making it assume the
form of a flaming cross leading them on to victory famine was not the
least of the evils they endured unwholesome food and the impure air from
the neighbouring marshes engendered pestilential diseases which carried
them off more rapidly than the arrows of the enemy a thousand of them
died in a day and it became at last a matter of extreme difficulty to
afford them burial to add to their misery each man grew suspicious of
his neighbour for the camp was infested by turkish spies who conveyed
daily to the besieged intelligence of the movements and distresses of the
enemy with a ferocity engendered by despair bohemund caused two spies
whom he had detected to be roasted alive in presence of the army and
within sight of the battlements of antioch but even this example failed
to reduce their numbers and the turks continued to be as well informed as
the christians themselves of all that was passing in the camp
the news of the arrival of a reinforcement of soldiers from europe with
an abundant stock of provisions came to cheer them when reduced to the
last extremity the welcome succour landed at st simeon the port of
antioch and about six miles from that city thitherwards the famishing
crusaders proceeded in tumultuous bands followed by bohemund and the
count of toulouse with strong detachments of their retainers and vassals
to escort the supplies in safety to the camp the garrison of antioch
forewarned of this arrival was on the alert and a corps of turkish
archers was despatched to lie in ambuscade among the mountains and
intercept their return bohemund laden with provisions was encountered
in the rocky passes by the turkish host great numbers of his followers
were slain and he himself had just time to escape to the camp with the
news of his defeat godfrey of bouillon the duke of normandy and the
other leaders had heard the rumour of this battle and were at that
instant preparing for the rescue the army was immediately in motion
animated both by zeal and by hunger and marched so rapidly as to
intercept the victorious turks before they had time to reach antioch with
their spoil a fierce battle ensued which lasted from noon till the going
down of the sun the christians gained and maintained the advantage each
man fighting as if upon himself alone had depended the fortune of the day
hundreds of turks perished in the orontes and more than two thousand were
left dead upon the field of battle all the provision was recaptured and
brought in safety to the camp whither the crusaders returned singing
alleluia or shouting deus adjuva deus adjuva
this relief lasted for some days and had it been duly economised would
have lasted much longer but the chiefs had no authority and were unable
to exercise any control over its distribution famine again approached
with rapid strides and stephen count of blois not liking the prospect
withdrew from the camp with four thousand of his retainers and
established himself at alexandretta the moral influence of this desertion
was highly prejudicial upon those who remained and bohemund the most
impatient and ambitious of the chiefs foresaw that unless speedily
checked it would lead to the utter failure of the expedition it was
necessary to act decisively the army murmured at the length of the siege
and the sultan was collecting his forces to crush them against the
efforts of the crusaders antioch might have held out for months but
treason within effected that which courage without might have striven for
in vain
baghasihan the turkish prince or emir of antioch had under his command
an armenian of the name of phirouz whom he had entrusted with the defence
of a tower on that part of the city wall which overlooked the passes of
the mountains bohemund by means of a spy who had embraced the christian
religion and to whom he had given his own name at baptism kept up a
daily communication with this captain and made him the most magnificent
promises of reward if he would deliver up his post to the crusaders
whether the proposal was first made by bohemund or by the armenian is
uncertain but that a good understanding soon existed between them is
undoubted and a night was fixed for the execution of the project
bohemund communicated the scheme to godfrey and the count of toulouse
with the stipulation that if the city were won he as the soul of the
enterprise should enjoy the dignity of prince of antioch the other
leaders hesitated ambition and jealousy prompted them to refuse their aid
in furthering the views of the intriguer more mature consideration
decided them to acquiesce and seven hundred of the bravest knights were
chosen for the expedition the real object of which for fear of spies
was kept a profound secret from the rest of the army when all was ready
a report was promulgated that the seven hundred were intended to form an
ambuscade for a division of the sultans army which was stated to be
approaching
every thing favoured the treacherous project of the armenian captain who
on his solitary watchtower received due intimation of the approach of
the crusaders the night was dark and stormy not a star was visible
above and the wind howled so furiously as to overpower all other sounds
the rain fell in torrents and the watchers on the towers adjoining to
that of phirouz could not hear the tramp of the armed knights for the
wind nor see them for the obscurity of the night and the dismalness of
the weather when within shot of the walls bohemund sent forward an
interpreter to confer with the armenian the latter urged them to make
haste and seize the favourable interval as armed men with lighted
torches patrolled the battlements every half hour and at that instant
they had just passed the chiefs were instantly at the foot of the wall
phirouz let down a rope bohemund attached it to the end of a ladder of
hides which was then raised by the armenian and held while the knights
mounted a momentary fear came over the spirits of the adventurers and
every one hesitated at last bohemund8 encouraged by phirouz from
above ascended a few steps on the ladder and was followed by godfrey
count robert of flanders and a number of other knights as they advanced
others pressed forward until their weight became too great for the
ladder which breaking precipitated about a dozen of them to the ground
where they fell one upon the other making a great clatter with their
heavy coats of mail for a moment they thought that all was lost but the
wind made so loud a howling as it swept in fierce gusts through the
mountain gorgesand the orontes swollen by the rain rushed so noisily
alongthat the guards heard nothing the ladder was easily repaired and
the knights ascended two at a time and reached the platform in safety
when sixty of them had thus ascended the torch of the coming patrol was
seen to gleam at the angle of the wall hiding themselves behind a
buttress they awaited his coming in breathless silence as soon as he
arrived at arms length he was suddenly seized and before he could open
his lips to raise an alarm the silence of death closed them up for ever
they next descended rapidly the spiral staircase of the tower and opening
the portal admitted the whole of their companions raymond of toulouse
who cognisant of the whole plan had been left behind with the main body
of the army heard at this instant the signal horn which announced that
an entry had been effected and leading on his legions the town was
attacked from within and without

imagination cannot conceive a scene more dreadful than that presented by
the devoted city of antioch on that night of horror the crusaders fought
with a blind fury which fanaticism and suffering alike incited men
women and children were indiscriminately slaughtered till the streets
ran with blood darkness increased the destruction for when morning
dawned the crusaders found themselves with their swords at the breasts of
their fellowsoldiers whom they had mistaken for foes the turkish
commander fled first to the citadel and that becoming insecure to the
mountains whither he was pursued and slain and his grey head brought
back to antioch as a trophy at daylight the massacre ceased and the
crusaders gave themselves up to plunder they found gold and jewels and
silks and velvets in abundance but of provisions which were of more
importance to them they found but little of any kind corn was
excessively scarce and they discovered to their sorrow that in this
respect the besieged had been but little better off than the besiegers
illustration siege of antioch
before they had time to instal themselves in their new position and take
the necessary measures for procuring a supply the city was invested by
the turks the sultan of persia had raised an immense army which he
entrusted to the command of kerbogha the emir of mosul with instructions
to sweep the christian locusts from the face of the land the emir
effected a junction with kilij aslaun and the two armies surrounded the
city discouragement took complete possession of the christian host and
numbers of them contrived to elude the vigilance of the besiegers and
escape to count stephen of blois at alexandretta to whom they related the
most exaggerated tales of the misery they had endured and the utter
hopelessness of continuing the war stephen forthwith broke up his camp
and retreated towards constantinople on his way he was met by the emperor
alexius at the head of a considerable force hastening to take possession
of the conquests made by the christians in asia as soon as he heard of
their woful plight he turned back and proceeded with the count of blois
to constantinople leaving the remnant of the crusaders to shift for
themselves
the news of this defection increased the discouragement at antioch all
the useless horses of the army had been slain and eaten and dogs cats
and rats were sold at enormous prices even vermin were becoming scarce
with increasing famine came a pestilence so that in a short time but
sixty thousand remained of the three hundred thousand that had originally
invested antioch but this bitter extremity while it annihilated the
energy of the host only served to knit the leaders more firmly together
and bohemund godfrey and tancred swore never to desert the cause as long
as life lasted the former strove in vain to reanimate the courage of his
followers they were weary and sick at heart and his menaces and promises
were alike thrown away some of them had shut themselves up in the houses
and refused to come forth bohemund to drive them to their duty set fire
to the whole quarter and many of them perished in the flames while the
rest of the army looked on with the utmost indifference bohemund
animated himself by a worldly spirit did not know the true character of
the crusaders nor understand the religious madness which had brought them
in such shoals from europe a priest more clearsighted devised a scheme
which restored all their confidence and inspired them with a courage so
wonderful as to make the poor sixty thousand emaciated sick and starving
zealots put to flight the wellfed and six times as numerous legions of
the sultan of persia
this priest a native of provence was named peter barthelemy and whether
he were a knave or an enthusiast or both a principal or a tool in the
hands of others will ever remain a matter of doubt certain it is
however that he was the means of raising the siege of antioch and
causing the eventual triumph of the armies of the cross when the strength
of the crusaders was completely broken by their sufferings and hope had
fled from every bosom peter came to count raymond of toulouse and
demanded an interview on matters of serious moment he was immediately
admitted he said that some weeks previously at the time the christians
were besieging antioch he was reposing alone in his tent when he was
startled by the shock of the earthquake which had so alarmed the whole
host through violent terror of the shock he could only ejaculate god
help me when turning round he saw two men standing before him whom he at
once recognised by the halo of glory around them as beings of another
world one of them appeared to be an aged man with reddish hair sprinkled
with grey black eyes and a long flowing grey beard the other was
younger larger and handsomer and had something more divine in his
aspect the elderly man alone spoke and informed him that he was the holy
apostle st andrew and desired him to seek out the count raymond the
bishop of puy and raymond of altopulto and ask them why the bishop did
not exhort the people and sign them with the cross which he bore the
apostle then took him naked in his shirt as he was and transported him
through the air into the heart of the city of antioch where he led him
into the church of st peter at that time a saracen mosque the apostle
made him stop by the pillar close to the steps by which they ascend on the
south side to the altar where hung two lamps which gave out a light
brighter than that of the noonday sun the younger man whom he did not at
that time know standing afar off near the steps of the altar the
apostle then descended into the ground and brought up a lance which he
gave into his hand telling him that it was the very lance that had opened
the side whence had flowed the salvation of the world with tears of joy
he held the holy lance and implored the apostle to allow him to take it
away and deliver it into the hands of count raymond the apostle refused
and buried the lance again in the ground commanding him when the city
was won from the infidels to go with twelve chosen men and dig it up
again in the same place the apostle then transported him back to his
tent and the two vanished from his sight he had neglected he said to
deliver this message afraid that his wonderful tale would not obtain
credence from men of such high rank after some days he again saw the holy
vision as he was gone out of the camp to look for food this time the
divine eyes of the younger looked reproachfully upon him he implored the
apostle to choose some one else more fitted for the mission but the
apostle refused and smote him with a disorder of the eyes as a
punishment for his disobedience with an obstinacy unaccountable even to
himself he had still delayed a third time the apostle and his companion
had appeared to him as he was in a tent with his master william at st
simeon on that occasion st andrew told him to bear his command to the
count of toulouse not to bathe in the waters of the jordan when he came to
it but to cross over in a boat clad in a shirt and breeches of linen
which he should sprinkle with the sacred waters of the river these
clothes he was afterwards to preserve along with the holy lance his
master william although he could not see the saint distinctly heard the
voice giving orders to that effect again he neglected to execute the
commission and again the saints appeared to him when he was at the port
of mamistra about to sail for cyprus and st andrew threatened him with
eternal perdition if he refused longer upon this he made up his mind to
divulge all that had been revealed to him
the count of toulouse who in all probability concocted this tale with
the priest appeared struck with the recital and sent immediately for the
bishop of puy and raymond of altapulto the bishop at once expressed his
disbelief of the whole story and refused to have any thing to do in the
matter the count of toulouse on the contrary saw abundant motives if
not for believing for pretending to believe and in the end he so
impressed upon the mind of the bishop the advantage that might be derived
from it in working up the popular mind to its former excitement that the
latter reluctantly agreed to make search in due form for the holy weapon
the day after the morrow was fixed upon for the ceremony and in the mean
time peter was consigned to the care of raymond the counts chaplain in
order that no profane curiosity might have an opportunity of
crossexamining him and putting him to a nonplus
twelve devout men were forthwith chosen for the undertaking among whom
were the count of toulouse and his chaplain they began digging at
sunrise and continued unwearied till near sunset without finding the
lance they might have dug till this day with no better success had not
peter himself sprung into the pit praying to god to bring the lance to
light for the strengthening and victory of his people those who hide
know where to find and so it was with peter for both he and the lance
found their way into the hole at the same time on a sudden he and
raymond the chaplain beheld its point in the earth and raymond drawing
it forth kissed it with tears of joy in sight of the multitude which had
assembled in the church it was immediately enveloped in a rich purple
cloth already prepared to receive it and exhibited in this state to the
faithful who made the building resound with their shouts of gladness
illustration the holy lance
peter had another vision the same night and became from that day forth
dreamer of dreams in general to the army he stated on the following
day that the apostle andrew and the youth with the divine aspect
appeared to him again and directed that the count of toulouse as a
reward for his persevering piety should carry the holy lance at the head
of the army and that the day on which it was found should be observed as
a solemn festival throughout christendom st andrew shewed him at the
same time the holes in the feet and hands of his benign companion and he
became convinced that he stood in the awful presence of the redeemer
peter gained so much credit by his visions that dreaming became
contagious other monks beside himself were visited by the saints who
promised victory to the host if it would valiantly hold out to the last
and crowns of eternal glory to those who fell in the fight two deserters
wearied of the fatigues and privations of the war who had stealthily left
the camp suddenly returned and seeking bohemund told him that they had
been met by two apparitions who with great anger had commanded them to
return the one of them said that he recognised his brother who had been
killed in battle some months before and that he had a halo of glory
around his head the other still more hardy asserted that the apparition
which had spoken to him was the saviour himself who had promised eternal
happiness as his reward if he returned to his duty but the pains of
eternal fire if he rejected the cross no one thought of disbelieving
these men the courage of the army immediately revived despondency gave
way to hope every arm grew strong again and the pangs of hunger were for
a time disregarded the enthusiasm which had led them from europe burned
forth once more as brightly as ever and they demanded with loud cries
to be led against the enemy the leaders were not unwilling in a battle
lay their only chance of salvation and although godfrey bohemund and
tancred received the story of the lance with much suspicion they were too
wise to throw discredit upon an imposture which bade fair to open the
gates of victory
peter the hermit was previously sent to the camp of kerbogha to propose
that the quarrel between the two religions should be decided by a chosen
number of the bravest soldiers of each army kerbogha turned from him with
a look of contempt and said he could agree to no proposals from a set of
such miserable beggars and robbers with this uncourteous answer peter
returned to antioch preparations were immediately commenced for an attack
upon the enemy the latter continued to be perfectly well informed of all
the proceedings of the christian camp the citadel of antioch which
remained in their possession overlooked the town and the commander of
the fortress could distinctly see all that was passing within on the
morning of the 28th of june 1098 a black flag hoisted from its highest
tower announced to the besieging army that the christians were about to
sally forth
the moslem leaders knew the sad inroads that famine and disease had made
upon the numbers of the foe they knew that not above two hundred of the
knights had horses to ride upon and that the foot soldiers were sick and
emaciated but they did not know the almost incredible valour which
superstition had infused into their hearts the story of the lance they
treated with the most supreme contempt and secure of an easy victory
they gave themselves no trouble in preparing for the onslaught it is
related that kerbogha was playing a game at chess when the black flag on
the citadel gave warning of the enemys approach and that with true
oriental coolness he insisted upon finishing the game ere he bestowed any
of his attention upon a foe so unworthy the defeat of his advanced post
of two thousand men aroused him from his apathy
the crusaders after this first victory advanced joyfully towards the
mountains hoping to draw the turks to a place where their cavalry would
be unable to manoeuvre their spirits were light and their courage high
as led on by the duke of normandy count robert of flanders and hugh of
vermandois they came within sight of the splendid camp of the enemy
godfrey of bouillon and adhemar bishop of puy followed immediately after
these leaders the latter clad in complete armour and bearing the holy
lance within sight of the whole army bohemund and tancred brought up the
rear
kerbogha aware at last that his enemy was not so despicable took
vigorous measures to remedy his mistake and preparing himself to meet
the christians in front he despatched the sultan soliman of roum to
attack them in the rear to conceal this movement he set fire to the
dried weeds and grass with which the ground was covered and soliman
taking a wide circuit with his cavalry succeeded under cover of the
smoke in making good his position in the rear the battle raged furiously
in front the arrows of the turks fell thick as hail and their
welltrained squadrons trod the crusaders under their hoofs like stubble
still the affray was doubtful for the christians had the advantage of the
ground and were rapidly gaining upon the enemy when the overwhelming
forces of soliman arrived in the rear godfrey and tancred flew to the
rescue of bohemund spreading dismay in the turkish ranks by their fierce
impetuosity the bishop of puy was left almost alone with the provenals
to oppose the legions commanded by kerbogha in person but the presence of
the holy lance made a hero of the meanest soldier in his train still
however the numbers of the enemy seemed interminable the christians
attacked on every side began at last to give way and the turks made sure
of victory
at this moment a cry was raised in the christian host that the saints were
fighting on their side the battlefield was clear of the smoke from the
burning weeds which had curled away and hung in white clouds of
fantastic shape on the brow of the distant mountains some imaginative
zealot seeing this dimly through the dust of the battle called out to
his fellows to look at the army of saints clothed in white and riding
upon white horses that were pouring over the hills to the rescue all
eyes were immediately turned to the distant smoke faith was in every
heart and the old battlecry god wills it god wills it resounded
through the field as every soldier believing that god was visibly
sending his armies to his aid fought with an energy unfelt before a
panic seized the persian and turkish hosts and they gave way in all
directions in vain kerbogha tried to rally them fear is more contagious
than enthusiasm and they fled over the mountains like deer pursued by the
hounds the two leaders seeing the uselessness of further efforts fled
with the rest and that immense army was scattered over palestine leaving
nearly seventy thousand of its dead upon the field of battle
their magnificent camp fell into the hands of the enemy with its rich
stores of corn and its droves of sheep and oxen jewels gold and rich
velvets in abundance were distributed among the army tancred followed the
fugitives over the hills and reaped as much plunder as those who had
remained in the camp the way as they fled was covered with valuables
and horses of the finest breed of arabia became so plentiful that every
knight of the christians was provided with a steed the crusaders in this
battle acknowledge to have lost nearly ten thousand men
their return to antioch was one of joy indeed the citadel was surrendered
at once and many of the turkish garrison embraced the christian faith
and the rest were suffered to depart a solemn thanksgiving was offered up
by the bishop of puy in which the whole army joined and the holy lance
was visited by every soldier
the enthusiasm lasted for some days and the army loudly demanded to be
led forward to jerusalem the grand goal of all their wishes but none of
their leaders was anxious to movethe more prudent among them such as
godfrey and tancred for reasons of expediency and the more ambitious
such as the count of toulouse and bohemund for reasons of selfinterest
violent dissensions sprang up again between all the chiefs raymond of
toulouse who was left at antioch to guard the town had summoned the
citadel to surrender as soon as he saw that there was no fear of any
attack upon the part of the persians and the other chiefs found upon
their return his banner waving on its walls this had given great offence
to bohemund who had stipulated the principality of antioch as his reward
for winning the town in the first instance godfrey and tancred supported
his claim and after a great deal of bickering the flag of raymond was
lowered from the tower and that of bohemund hoisted in its stead who
assumed from that time the title of prince of antioch raymond however
persisted in retaining possession of one of the city gates and its
adjacent towers which he held for several months to the great annoyance
of bohemund and the scandal of the army the count became in consequence
extremely unpopular although his ambition was not a whit more
unreasonable than that of bohemund himself nor of baldwin who had taken
up his quarters at edessa where he exercised the functions of a petty
sovereign
the fate of peter barthelemy deserves to be recorded honours and
consideration had come thick upon him after the affair of the lance and
he consequently felt bound in conscience to continue the dreams which had
made him a personage of so much importance the mischief of it was that
like many other liars he had a very bad memory and he contrived to make
his dreams contradict each other in the most palpable manner st john one
night appeared to him and told one tale while a week after st paul
told a totally different story and held out hopes quite incompatible with
those of his apostolic brother the credulity of that age had a wide maw
and peters visions must have been absurd and outrageous indeed when the
very men who had believed in the lance refused to swallow any more of his
wonders bohemund at last for the purpose of annoying the count of
toulouse challenged poor peter to prove the truth of his story of the
lance by the fiery ordeal peter could not refuse a trial so common in
that age and being besides encouraged by the count and his chaplain
raymond an early day was appointed for the ceremony the previous night
was spent in prayer and fasting according to custom and peter came forth
in the morning bearing the lance in his hand and walked boldly up to the
fire the whole army gathered round impatient for the result many
thousands still believing that the lance was genuine and peter a holy
man prayers having been said by raymond dagilles peter walked into the
flames and had got nearly through when pain caused him to lose his
presence of mind the heat too affected his eyes and in his anguish he
turned round unwittingly and passed through the fire again instead of
stepping out of it as he should have done the result was that he was
burned so severely that he never recovered and after lingering for some
days he expired in great agony
most of the soldiers were suffering either from wounds disease or
weariness and it was resolved by godfreythe tacitly acknowledged chief
of the enterprisethat the army should have time to refresh itself ere
they advanced upon jerusalem it was now july and he proposed that they
should pass the hot months of august and september within the walls of
antioch and march forward in october with renewed vigour and numbers
increased by fresh arrivals from europe this advice was finally adopted
although the enthusiasts of the army continued to murmur at the delay in
the mean time the count of vermandois was sent upon an embassy to the
emperor alexius at constantinople to reproach him for his base desertion
of the cause and urge him to send the reinforcements he had promised the
count faithfully executed his mission of which by the way alexius took
no notice whatever and remained for some time at constantinople till
his zeal never very violent totally evaporated he then returned to
france sick of the crusade and determined to intermeddle with it no
more
the chiefs though they had determined to stay at antioch for two months
could not remain quiet for so long a time they would in all probability
have fallen upon each other had there been no turks in palestine upon
whom they might vent their impetuosity godfrey proceeded to edessa to
aid his brother baldwin in expelling the saracens from his principality
and the other leaders carried on separate hostilities against them as
caprice or ambition dictated at length the impatience of the army to be
led against jerusalem became so great that the chiefs could no longer
delay and raymond tancred and robert of normandy marched forward with
their divisions and laid siege to the small but strong town of marah
with their usual improvidence they had not food enough to last a
beleaguering army for a week they suffered great privations in
consequence till bohemund came to their aid and took the town by storm
in connexion with this siege the chronicler raymond dagilles the same
raymond the chaplain who figured in the affair of the holy lance relates
a legend in the truth of which he devoutly believed and upon which tasso
has founded one of the most beautiful passages of his poem it is worth
preserving as shewing the spirit of the age and the source of the
extraordinary courage manifested by the crusaders on occasions of extreme
difficulty one day says raymond anselme de ribeaumont beheld young
engelram the son of the count de st paul who had been killed at marah
enter his tent how is it said anselme to him that you whom i saw
lying dead on the field of battle are full or lifeyou must know
replied engelram that those who fight for jesus christ never die but
whence resumed anselme comes that strange brightness that surrounds
you upon this engelram pointed to the sky where anselme saw a palace of
diamond and crystal it is thence said he that i derive the beauty
which surprises you my dwelling is there a still finer one is prepared
for you and you shall soon come to inhabit it farewell we shall meet
again tomorrow with these words engelram returned to heaven anselme
struck by the vision sent the next morning for the priests received the
sacrament and although full of health took a last farewell of all his
friends telling them that he was about to leave this world a few hours
afterwards the enemy having made a sortie anselme went out against them
sword in hand and was struck on the forehead by a stone from a turkish
sling which sent him to heaven to the beautiful palace that was prepared
for him
illustration shrine of the nativity
new disputes arose between the prince of antioch and the count of toulouse
with regard to the capture of this town which were with the utmost
difficulty appeased by the other chiefs delays also took place in the
progress of the army especially before archas and the soldiery were so
exasperated that they were on the point of choosing new leaders to conduct
them to jerusalem godfrey upon this set fire to his camp at archas and
marched forward he was immediately joined by hundreds of the provenals
of the count of toulouse the latter seeing the turn affairs were taking
hastened after them and the whole host proceeded towards the holy city
so long desired amid sorrow and suffering and danger at emmaus they
were met by a deputation from the christians of bethlehem praying for
immediate aid against the oppression of the infidels the very name of
bethlehem the birthplace of the saviour was music to their ears and
many of them wept with joy to think they were approaching a spot so
hallowed albert of aix informs us that their hearts were so touched that
sleep was banished from the camp and that instead of waiting till the
mornings dawn to recommence their march they set out shortly after
midnight full of hope and enthusiasm for upwards of four hours the
mailclad legions tramped stedfastly forward in the dark and when the sun
arose in unclouded splendour the towers and pinnacles of jerusalem
gleamed upon their sight all the tender feelings of their nature were
touched no longer brutal fanatics but meek and humble pilgrims they
knelt down upon the sod and with tears in their eyes exclaimed to one
another jerusalem jerusalem some of them kissed the holy ground
others stretched themselves at full length upon it in order that their
bodies might come in contact with the greatest possible extent of it and
others prayed aloud the women and children who had followed the camp from
europe and shared in all its dangers fatigues and privations were more
boisterous in their joy the former from longnourished enthusiasm and
the latter from mere imitation9 and prayed and wept and laughed till
they almost put the more sober to the blush
    9 guibert de nogent relates a curious instance of the
        imitativeness of these juvenile crusaders he says that
        during the siege of antioch the christian and saracen boys
        used to issue forth every evening from the town and camp in
        great numbers under the command of captains chosen from among
        themselves armed with sticks instead of swords and stones
        instead of arrows they ranged themselves in battle order
        and shouting each the warcry of their country fought with
        the utmost desperation some of them lost their eyes and many
        became cripples for life from the injuries they received on
        these occasions
illustration the pilgrims at the first sight of jerusalem
the first ebullition of their gladness having subsided the army marched
forward and invested the city on all sides the assault was almost
immediately begun but after the christians had lost some of their bravest
knights that mode of attack was abandoned and the army commenced its
preparations for a regular siege mangonels moveable towers and
batteringrams together with a machine called a sow made of wood and
covered with raw hides inside of which miners worked to undermine the
walls were forthwith constructed and to restore the courage and
discipline of the army which had suffered from the unworthy dissensions
of the chiefs the latter held out the hand of friendship to each other
and tancred and the count of toulouse embraced in sight of the whole camp
the clergy aided the cause with their powerful voice and preached union
and goodwill to the highest and the lowest a solemn procession was also
ordered round the city in which the entire army joined prayers being
offered up at every spot which gospel records had taught them to consider
as peculiarly sacred
the saracens upon the ramparts beheld all these manifestations without
alarm to incense the christians whom they despised they constructed
rude crosses and fixed them upon the walls and spat upon and pelted them
with dirt and stones this insult to the symbol of their faith raised the
wrath of the crusaders to that height that bravery became ferocity and
enthusiasm madness when all the engines of war were completed the attack
was recommenced and every soldier of the christian army fought with a
vigour which the sense of private wrong invariably inspires every man had
been personally outraged and the knights worked at the batteringrams
with as much readiness as the meanest soldiers the saracen arrows and
balls of fire fell thick and fast among them but the tremendous rams
still heaved against the walls while the best marksmen of the host were
busily employed in the several floors of the moveable towers in dealing
death among the turks upon the battlements godfrey raymond tancred and
robert of normandy each upon his tower fought for hours with unwearied
energy often repulsed but ever ready to renew the struggle the turks
no longer despising the enemy defended themselves with the utmost skill
and bravery till darkness brought a cessation of hostilities short was
the sleep that night in the christian camp the priests offered up solemn
prayers in the midst of the attentive soldiery for the triumph of the
cross in this last great struggle and as soon as morning dawned every
one was in readiness for the affray the women and children lent their
aid the latter running unconcerned to and fro while the arrows fell fast
around them bearing water to the thirsty combatants the saints were
believed to be aiding their efforts and the army impressed with this
idea surmounted difficulties under which a force thrice as numerous but
without their faith would have quailed and been defeated raymond of
toulouse at last forced his way into the city by escalade while at the
very same moment tancred and robert of normandy succeeded in bursting open
one of the gates the turks flew to repair the mischief and godfrey of
bouillon seeing the battlements comparatively deserted let down the
drawbridge of his moveable tower and sprang forward followed by all the
knights of his train in an instant after the banner of the cross floated
upon the walls of jerusalem the crusaders raising once more their
redoubtable warcry rushed on from every side and the city was taken
the battle raged in the streets for several hours and the christians
remembering their insulted faith gave no quarter to young or old male or
female sick or strong not one of the leaders thought himself at liberty
to issue orders for staying the carnage and if he had he would not have
been obeyed the saracens fled in great numbers to the mosque of soliman
but they had not time to fortify themselves within it ere the christians
were upon them ten thousand persons are said to have perished in that
building alone
peter the hermit who had remained so long under the veil of neglect was
repaid that day for all his zeal and all his sufferings as soon as the
battle was over the christians of jerusalem issued forth from their
hidingplaces to welcome their deliverers they instantly recognised the
hermit as the pilgrim who years before had spoken to them so eloquently
of the wrongs and insults they had endured and promised to stir up the
princes and people of europe in their behalf they clung to the skirts of
his garments in the fervour of their gratitude and vowed to remember him
for ever in their prayers many of them shed tears about his neck and
attributed the deliverance of jerusalem solely to his courage and
perseverance peter afterwards held some ecclesiastical office in the holy
city but what it was or what was his ultimate fate history has
forgotten to inform us some say that he returned to france and founded a
monastery but the story does not rest upon sufficient authority
illustration siege of jerusalem
the grand object for which the popular swarms of europe had forsaken their
homes was now accomplished the moslem mosques of jerusalem were converted
into churches for a purer faith and the mount of calvary and the
sepulchre of christ were profaned no longer by the presence or the power
of the infidel popular frenzy had fulfilled its mission and as a
natural consequence it began to subside from that time forth the news of
the capture of jerusalem brought numbers of pilgrims from europe and
among others stephen count of chartres and hugh of vermandois to atone
for their desertion but nothing like the former enthusiasm existed among
the nations
thus then ends the history of the first crusade for the better
understanding of the second it will be necessary to describe the interval
between them and to enter into a slight sketch of the history of
jerusalem under its latin kings the long and fruitless wars they
continued to wage with the unvanquished saracens and the poor and
miserable results which sprang from so vast an expenditure of zeal and so
deplorable a waste of human life
illustration jerusalem
the necessity of having some recognised chief was soon felt by the
crusaders and godfrey de bouillon less ambitious than bohemund or
raymond of toulouse gave his cold consent to wield a sceptre which the
latter chiefs would have clutched with eagerness he was hardly invested
with the royal mantle before the saracens menaced his capital with much
vigour and judgment he exerted himself to follow up the advantages he had
gained and marching out to meet the enemy before they had time to besiege
him in jerusalem he gave them battle at ascalon and defeated them with
great loss he did not however live long to enjoy his new dignity being
seized with a fatal illness when he had only reigned nine months to him
succeeded his brother baldwin of edessa the latter monarch did much to
improve the condition of jerusalem and to extend its territory but was
not able to make a firm footing for his successors for fifty years in
which the history of jerusalem is full of interest to the historical
student the crusaders were exposed to fierce and constant hostilities
often gaining battles and territory and as often losing them but
becoming every day weaker and more divided while the saracens became
stronger and more united to harass and root them out the battles of this
period were of the most chivalrous character and deeds of heroism were
done by the handful of brave knights that remained in syria which have
hardly their parallel in the annals of war in the course of time
however the christians could not avoid feeling some respect for the
courage and admiration for the polished manners and advanced civilisation
of the saracens so much superior to the rudeness and semibarbarism of
europe at that day difference of faith did not prevent them from forming
alliances with the darkeyed maidens of the east one of the first to set
the example of taking a paynim spouse was king baldwin himself and these
connexions in time became not only frequent but almost universal among
such of the knights as had resolved to spend their lives in palestine
these eastern ladies were obliged however to submit to the ceremony of
baptism before they could be received to the arms of a christian lord
these and their offspring naturally looked upon the saracens with less
hatred than did the zealots who conquered jerusalem and who thought it a
sin deserving the wrath of god to spare an unbeliever we find in
consequence that the most obstinate battles waged during the reigns of
the later kings of jerusalem were fought by the new and raw levies who
from time to time arrived from europe lured by the hope of glory or
spurred by fanaticism the latter broke without scruple the truces
established between the original settlers and the saracens and drew down
severe retaliation upon many thousands of their brethren in the faith
whose prudence was stronger than their zeal and whose chief desire was to
live in peace
illustration bible of baldwins queen
things remained in this unsatisfactory state till the close of the year
1145 when edessa the strong frontier town of the christian kingdom fell
into the hands of the saracens the latter were commanded by zenghi a
powerful and enterprising monarch and after his death by his son
nourheddin as powerful and enterprising as his father an unsuccessful
attempt was made by the count of edessa to regain the fortress but
nourheddin with a large army came to the rescue and after defeating the
count with great slaughter marched into edessa and caused its
fortifications to be razed to the ground that the town might never more
be a bulwark of defence for the kingdom of jerusalem the road to the
capital was now open and consternation seized the hearts of the
christians nourheddin it was known was only waiting for a favourable
opportunity to advance upon jerusalem and the armies of the cross
weakened and divided were not in a condition to make any available
resistance the clergy were filled with grief and alarm and wrote
repeated letters to the pope and the sovereigns of europe urging the
expediency of a new crusade for the relief of jerusalem by far the
greater number of the priests of palestine were natives of france and
these naturally looked first to their own country the solicitations they
sent to louis vii were urgent and oft repeated and the chivalry of
france began to talk once more of arming in defence of the birthplace of
jesus the kings of europe whose interest it had not been to take any
part in the first crusade began to bestir themselves in this and a man
appeared eloquent as peter the hermit to arouse the people as that
preacher had done
we find however that the enthusiasm of the second did not equal that of
the first crusade in fact the mania had reached its climax in the time
of peter the hermit and decreased regularly from that period the third
crusade was less general than the second and the fourth than the third
and so on until the public enthusiasm was quite extinct and jerusalem
returned at last to the dominion of its old masters without a convulsion
in christendom various reasons have been assigned for this and one very
generally put forward is that europe was wearied with continued
struggles and had become sick of precipitating itself upon asia m
guizot in his admirable lectures upon european civilisation successfully
combats this opinion and offers one of his own which is far more
satisfactory he says in his eighth lecture it has been often repeated
that europe was tired of continually invading asia this expression
appears to me exceedingly incorrect it is not possible that human beings
can be wearied with what they have not donethat the labours of their
forefathers can fatigue them weariness is a personal not an inherited
feeling the men of the thirteenth century were not fatigued by the
crusades of the twelfth they were influenced by another cause a great
change had taken place in ideas sentiments and social conditions the
same desires and the same wants were no longer felt the same things were
no longer believed the people refused to believe what their ancestors
were persuaded of
this is in fact the secret of the change and its truth becomes more
apparent as we advance in the history of the crusades and compare the
state of the public mind at the different periods when godfrey of
bouillon louis vii and richard i were chiefs and leaders of the
movement the crusades themselves were the means of operating a great
change in national ideas and advancing the civilisation of europe in the
time of godfrey the nobles were allpowerful and alloppressive and
equally obnoxious to kings and people during their absence along with
that portion of the community the deepest sunk in ignorance and
superstition both kings and people fortified themselves against the
renewal of aristocratic tyranny and in proportion as they became free
became civilised it was during this period that in france the grand
centre of the crusading madness the communes began to acquire strength
and the monarch to possess a practical and not a merely theoretic
authority order and comfort began to take root and when the second
crusade was preached men were in consequence much less willing to abandon
their homes than they had been during the first such pilgrims as had
returned from the holy land came back with minds more liberal and expanded
than when they set out they had come in contact with a people more
civilised than themselves they had seen something more of the world and
had lost some portion however small of the prejudice and bigotry of
ignorance the institution of chivalry had also exercised its humanising
influence and coming bright and fresh through the ordeal of the crusades
had softened the character and improved the hearts of the aristocratic
order the trouvres and troubadours singing of love and war in
strains pleasing to every class of society helped to root out the gloomy
superstitions which at the first crusade filled the minds of all those
who were able to think men became in consequence less exclusively under
the mental thraldom of the priesthood and lost much of the credulity
which formerly distinguished them
the crusades appear never to have excited so much attention in england as
on the continent of europe not because the people were less fanatical
than their neighbours but because they were occupied in matters of graver
interest the english were suffering too severely from the recent
successful invasion of their soil to have much sympathy to bestow upon
the distresses of people so far away as the christians of palestine and
we find that they took no part in the first crusade and very little in
the second even then those who engaged in it were chiefly norman knights
and their vassals and not the saxon franklins and population who no
doubt thought in their sorrow as many wise men have thought since that
charity should begin at home
germany was productive of more zeal in the cause and her raw uncivilised
hordes continued to issue forth under the banners of the cross in numbers
apparently undiminished when the enthusiasm had long been on the wane in
other countries they were sunk at that time in a deeper slough of
barbarism than the livelier nations around them and took in consequence
a longer period to free themselves from their prejudices in fact the
second crusade drew its chief supplies of men from that quarter where
alone the expedition can be said to have retained any portion of
popularity
such was the state of mind of europe when pope eugenius moved by the
reiterated entreaties of the christians of syria commissioned st bernard
to preach a new crusade st bernard was a man eminently qualified for the
mission he was endowed with an eloquence of the highest order could move
an auditory to tears or laughter or fury as it pleased him and had led
a life of such rigid and selfdenying virtue that not even calumny could
lift her finger and point it at him he had renounced high prospects in
the church and contented himself with the simple abbacy of clairvaux in
order that he might have the leisure he desired to raise his powerful
voice against abuses wherever he found them vice met in him an austere
and uncompromising reprover no man was too high for his reproach and
none too low for his sympathy he was just as well suited for his age as
peter the hermit had been for the age preceding he appealed more to the
reason his predecessor to the passions peter the hermit collected a mob
while st bernard collected an army both were endowed with equal zeal and
perseverance springing in the one from impulse and in the other from
conviction and a desire to increase the influence of the church that
great body of which he was a pillar and an ornament
illustration cathedral of vezelai
one of the first converts he made was in himself a host louis vii was
both superstitious and tyrannical and in a fit of remorse for the
infamous slaughter he had authorised at the sacking of vitry he made a
vow to undertake the journey to the holy land10 he was in this
disposition when st bernard began to preach and wanted but little
persuasion to embark in the cause his example had great influence upon
the nobility who impoverished as many of them were by the sacrifices
made by their fathers in the holy wars were anxious to repair their
ruined fortunes by conquests on a foreign shore these took the field with
such vassals as they could command and in a very short time an army was
raised amounting to two hundred thousand men at vezelai the monarch
received the cross from the hands of st bernard on a platform elevated
in sight of all the people several nobles three bishops and his queen
eleanor of aquitaine were present at this ceremony and enrolled
themselves under the banner of the cross st bernard cutting up his red
sacerdotal vestments and making crosses of them to be sewn on the
shoulders of the people an exhortation from the pope was read to the
multitude granting remission of their sins to all who should join the
crusade and directing that no man on that holy pilgrimage should encumber
himself with heavy baggage and vain superfluities and that the nobles
should not travel with dogs or falcons to lead them from the direct road
as had happened to so many during the first crusade
    10 the sacking of vitry reflects indelible disgrace upon louis
         vii his predecessors had been long engaged in resistance to
         the outrageous powers assumed by the popes and louis
         continued the same policy the ecclesiastical chapter of
         bourges having elected an archbishop without his consent he
         proclaimed the election to be invalid and took severe and
         prompt measures against the refractory clergy thibault count
         de champagne took up arms in defence of the papal authority
         and entrenched himself in the town of vitry louis
         immediately took the field to chastise the rebel and he
         besieged the town with so much vigour that the count was
         forced to surrender upwards of thirteen hundred of the
         inhabitants fully one half of whom were women and children
         took refuge in the church and when the gates of the city
         were opened and all resistance had ceased louis inhumanly
         gave orders to set fire to the sacred edifice and a thousand
         persons perished in the flames
the command of the army was offered to st bernard but he wisely refused
to accept a station for which his habits had unqualified him after
consecrating louis with great solemnity at st denis as chief of the
expedition he continued his course through the country stirring up the
people wherever he went so high an opinion was entertained of his
sanctity that he was thought to be animated by the spirit of prophecy
and to be gifted with the power of working miracles many women excited
by his eloquence and encouraged by his predictions forsook their
husbands and children and clothing themselves in male attire hastened
to the war st bernard himself wrote a letter to the pope detailing his
success and stating that in several towns there did not remain a single
male inhabitant capable of bearing arms and that every where castles and
towns were to be seen filled with women weeping for their absent husbands
but in spite of this apparent enthusiasm the numbers who really took up
arms were inconsiderable and not to be compared to the swarms of the
first crusade a levy of no more than two hundred thousand men which was
the utmost the number amounted to could hardly have depopulated a country
like france to the extent mentioned by st bernard his description of
the state of the country appears therefore to have been much more
poetical than true
suger the able minister of louis endeavoured to dissuade him from
undertaking so long a journey at a time when his own dominions so much
needed his presence but the king was pricked in his conscience by the
cruelties of vitry and was anxious to make the only reparation which the
religion of that day considered sufficient he was desirous moreover of
testifying to the world that though he could brave the temporal power of
the church when it encroached upon his prerogatives he could render all
due obedience to its spiritual decrees whenever it suited his interest or
tallied with his prejudices to do so suger therefore implored in vain
and louis received the pilgrims staff at st denis and made all
preparations for his pilgrimage
in the mean time st bernard passed into germany where similar success
attended his preaching the renown of his sanctity had gone before him
and he found every where an admiring audience thousands of people who
could not understand a word he said flocked around him to catch a glimpse
of so holy a man and the knights enrolled themselves in great numbers in the
service of the cross each receiving from his hands the symbol of the
cause but the people were not led away as in the days of gottschalk we
do not find that they rose in such tremendous masses of two and three
hundred thousand men swarming over the country like a plague of locusts
still the enthusiasm was very great the extraordinary tales that were
told and believed of the miracles worked by the preacher brought the
country people from far and near devils were said to vanish at his sight
and diseases of the most malignant nature to be cured by his touch11
the emperor conrad caught at last the contagion from his subjects and
declared his intention to follow the cross
    11 philip archdeacon of the cathedral of liege wrote a
         detailed account of all the miracles performed by st bernard
         during thirtyfour days of his mission they averaged about
         ten per day the disciples of st bernard complained bitterly
         that the people flocked around their master in such numbers
         that they could not see half the miracles he performed but
         they willingly trusted the eyes of others as far as faith in
         the miracles went and seemed to vie with each other whose
         credulity should be greatest
the preparations were carried on so vigorously under the orders of conrad
that in less than three months he found himself at the head of an army
containing at least one hundred and fifty thousand effective men besides
a great number of women who followed their husbands and lovers to the war
one troop of them rode in the attitude and armour of men their chief wore
gilt spurs and buskins and thence acquired the epithet of the
goldenfooted lady conrad was ready to set out long before the french
monarch and in the month of june 1147 he arrived before constantinople
having passed through hungary and bulgaria without offence to the
inhabitants
illustration pilgrims staff
manuel comnenus the greek emperor successor not only to the throne but
to the policy of alexius looked with alarm upon the new levies who had
come to eat up his capital and imperil its tranquillity too weak to
refuse them a passage through his dominions too distrustful of them to
make them welcome when they came and too little assured of the advantages
likely to result to himself from the war to feign a friendship which he
did not feel the greek emperor gave offence at the very outset his
subjects in the pride of superior civilisation called the germans
barbarians while the latter who if semibarbarous were at least honest
and straightforward retorted upon the greeks by calling them doublefaced
knaves and traitors disputes continually arose between them and conrad
who had preserved so much good order among his followers during their
passage was unable to restrain their indignation when they arrived at
constantinople for some offence or other which the greeks had given them
but which is rather hinted at than stated by the scanty historians of the
day the germans broke into the magnificent pleasuregarden of the
emperor where he had a valuable collection of tame animals for which the
grounds had been laid out in woods caverns groves and streams that
each might follow in captivity his natural habits the enraged germans
meriting the name of barbarians that had been bestowed upon them laid
waste this pleasant retreat and killed or let loose the valuable animals
it contained manuel who is said to have beheld the devastation from his
palace windows without power or courage to prevent it was completely
disgusted with his guests and resolved like his predecessor alexius to
get rid of them on the first opportunity he sent a message to conrad
respectfully desiring an interview but the german refused to trust
himself within the walls of constantinople the greek emperor on his
part thought it compatible neither with his dignity nor his safety to
seek the german and several days were spent in insincere negotiations
manuel at length agreed to furnish the crusading army with guides to
conduct it through asia minor and conrad passed over the hellespont with
his forces the advanced guard being commanded by himself and the rear by
the warlike bishop of freysinghen
historians are almost unanimous in their belief that the wily greek gave
instructions to his guides to lead the army of the german emperor into
dangers and difficulties it is certain that instead of guiding them
through such districts of asia minor as afforded water and provisions
they led them into the wilds of cappadocia where neither was to be
procured and where they were suddenly attacked by the sultan of the
seljukian turks at the head of an immense force the guides whose
treachery is apparent from this fact alone fled at the first sight of the
turkish army and the christians were left to wage unequal warfare with
their enemy entangled and bewildered in desert wilds toiling in their
heavy mail the germans could make but little effective resistance to the
attacks of the turkish light horse who were down upon them one instant
and out of sight the next now in the front and now in the rear the agile
foe showered his arrows upon them enticing them into swamps and hollows
from which they could only extricate themselves after long struggles and
great losses the germans confounded by this mode of warfare lost all
conception of the direction they were pursuing and went back instead of
forward suffering at the same time for want of provisions they fell an
easy prey to their pursuers count bernhard one of the bravest leaders of
the german expedition was surrounded with his whole division not one of
whom escaped the turkish arrows the emperor himself had nearly fallen a
victim and was twice severely wounded so persevering was the enemy and
so little able were the germans to make even a shew of resistance that
when conrad at last reached the city of nice he found that instead of
being at the head of an imposing force of one hundred thousand foot and
seventy thousand horse he had but fifty or sixty thousand men and these
in the most worn and wearied condition
totally ignorant of the treachery of the greek emperor although he had
been warned to beware of it louis vii proceeded at the head of his
army through worms and ratisbon towards constantinople at ratisbon he
was met by a deputation from manuel bearing letters so full of hyperbole
and flattery that louis is reported to have blushed when they were read
to him by the bishop of langres the object of the deputation was to
obtain from the french king a promise to pass through the grecian
territories in a peaceable and friendly manner and to yield to the greek
emperor any conquest he might make in asia minor the first part of the
proposition was immediately acceded to but no notice was taken of the
second and more unreasonable louis marched on and passing through
hungary pitched his tents in the outskirts of constantinople
on his arrival manuel sent him a friendly invitation to enter the city at
the head of a small train louis at once accepted it and was met by the
emperor at the porch of his palace the fairest promises were made every
art that flattery could suggest was resorted to and every argument
employed to induce him to yield his future conquests to the greek louis
obstinately refused to pledge himself and returned to his army convinced
that the emperor was a man not to be trusted negotiations were however
continued for several days to the great dissatisfaction of the french
army the news that arrived of a treaty entered into between manuel and
the turkish sultan changed their dissatisfaction into fury and the
leaders demanded to be led against constantinople swearing that they
would raze the treacherous city to the ground louis did not feel inclined
to accede to this proposal and breaking up his camp he crossed over
into asia
here he heard for the first time of the mishaps of the german emperor
whom he found in a woful plight under the walls of nice the two monarchs
united their forces and marched together along the seacoast to ephesus
but conrad jealous it would appear of the superior numbers of the
french and not liking to sink into a vassal for the time being of his
rival withdrew abruptly with the remnant of his legions and returned to
constantinople manuel was all smiles and courtesy he condoled with the
german so feelingly upon his losses and cursed the stupidity or treachery
of the guides with such apparent heartiness that conrad was half inclined
to believe in his sincerity
louis marching onward in the direction of jerusalem came up with the
enemy on the banks of the meander the turks contested the passage of the
river but the french bribed a peasant to point out a ford lower down
crossing the river without difficulty they attacked the turks with much
vigour and put them to flight whether the turks were really defeated or
merely pretended to be so is doubtful but the latter supposition seems
to be the true one it is probable that it was part of a concerted plan to
draw the invaders onwards to more unfavourable ground where their
destruction might be more certain if such were the scheme it succeeded
to the hearts wish of its projectors the crusaders on the third day
after their victory arrived at a steep mountainpass on the summit of
which the turkish host lay concealed so artfully that not the slightest
vestige of their presence could be perceived with labouring steps and
slow they toiled up the steep ascent when suddenly a tremendous
fragment of rock came bounding down the precipices with an awful crash
bearing dismay and death before it at the same instant the turkish
archers started from their hidingplaces and discharged a shower of
arrows upon the footsoldiers who fell by hundreds at a time the arrows
rebounded harmlessly against the iron mail of the knights which the turks
observing took aim at their steeds and horse and rider fell down the
steep into the rapid torrent which rushed below louis who commanded the
rearguard received the first intimation of the onslaught from the sight
of the wounded and flying soldiers and not knowing the numbers of the
enemy he pushed vigorously forward to stay by his presence the panic
which had taken possession of his army all his efforts were in vain
immense stones continued to be hurled upon them as they advanced bearing
men and horse before them and those who succeeded in forcing their way to
the top were met handtohand by the turks and cast down headlong upon
their companions louis himself fought with the energy of desperation but
had great difficulty to avoid falling into the enemys hands he escaped
at last under cover of the night with the remnant of his forces and took
up his position before attalia here he restored the discipline and the
courage of his disorganised and disheartened followers and debated with
his captains the plan that was to be pursued after suffering severely
both from disease and famine it was resolved that they should march to
antioch which still remained an independent principality under the
successors of bohemund of tarentum at this time the sovereignty was
vested in the person of raymond the uncle of eleanor of aquitaine this
prince presuming upon his relationship to the french queen endeavoured
to withdraw louis from the grand object of the crusadethe defence of the
kingdom of jerusalem and secure his cooperation in extending the limits
and the power of his principality of antioch the prince of tripoli formed
a similar design but louis rejected the offers of both and marched
after a short delay to jerusalem the emperor conrad was there before
him having left constantinople with promises of assistance from manuel
comnenusassistance which never arrived and was never intended
illustration damascus
a great council of the christian princes of palestine and the leaders of
the crusade was then summoned to discuss the future operations of the
war it was ultimately determined that it would further the cause of the
cross in a greater degree if the united armies instead of proceeding to
edessa laid siege to the city of damascus and drove the saracens from
that strong position this was a bold scheme and had it been boldly
followed out would have insured in all probability the success of the
war but the christian leaders never learned from experience the necessity
of union that very soul of great enterprises though they all agreed upon
the policy of the plan yet every one had his own notions as to the means
of executing it the princes of antioch and tripoli were jealous of each
other and of the king of jerusalem the emperor conrad was jealous of the
king of france and the king of france was disgusted with them all but he
had come out to palestine in accordance with a solemn vow his religion
though it may be called bigotry was sincere and he determined to remain
to the very last moment that a chance was left of effecting any good for
the cause he had set his heart on
the siege of damascus was accordingly commenced and with so much ability
and vigour that the christians gained a considerable advantage at the very
outset for weeks the siege was pressed till the shattered fortifications
and diminishing resistance of the besieged gave evidence that the city
could not hold out much longer at that moment the insane jealousy of the
leaders led to dissensions that soon caused the utter failure not only of
the siege but of the crusade a modern cookerybook in giving a recipe
for cooking a hare says first catch your hare and then kill ita
maxim of indisputable wisdom the christian chiefs on this occasion had
not so much sagacity for they began a violent dispute among themselves
for the possession of a city which was still unconquered there being
already a prince of antioch and a prince of tripoli twenty claimants
started for the principality of damascus and a grand council of the
leaders was held to determine the individual on whom the honour should
devolve many valuable days were wasted in this discussion the enemy in
the meanwhile gaining strength from their inactivity it was at length
after a stormy deliberation agreed that count robert of flanders who had
twice visited the holy land should be invested with the dignity the
other claimants refused to recognise him or to cooperate in the siege
until a more equitable arrangement had been made suspicion filled the
camp the most sinister rumours of intrigues and treachery were set
afloat and the discontented candidates withdrew at last to the other side
of the city and commenced operations on their own account without a
probability of success they were soon joined by the rest of the army the
consequence was that the weakest side of the city and that on which they
had already made considerable progress in the work of demolition was left
uncovered the enemy was prompt to profit by the mistake and received an
abundant supply of provisions and refortified the walls before the
crusaders came to their senses again when this desirable event happened
it was too late saph eddin the powerful emir of mousoul was in the
neighbourhood at the head of a large army advancing by forced marches to
the relief of the city the siege was abruptly abandoned and the foolish
crusaders returned to jerusalem having done nothing to weaken the enemy
but every thing to weaken themselves
the freshness of enthusiasm had now completely subsided even the meanest
soldiers were sick at heart conrad from whose fierce zeal at the outset
so much might have been expected was wearied with reverses and returned
to europe with the poor remnant of his host louis lingered a short time
longer for very shame but the pressing solicitations of his minister
suger induced him to return to france thus ended the second crusade its
history is but a chronicle of defeats it left the kingdom of jerusalem in
a worse state than when it quitted europe and gained nothing but disgrace
for its leaders and discouragement for all concerned
st bernard who had prophesied a result so different fell after this
into some disrepute and experienced like many other prophets the fate
of being without honour in his own country what made the matter worse he
could not obtain it in any other still however there were not wanting
zealous advocates to stand forward in his behalf and stem the tide of
incredulity which unopposed would have carried away his reputation the
bishop of freysinghen declared that prophets were not always able to
prophesy and that the vices of the crusaders drew down the wrath of
heaven upon them but the most ingenious excuse ever made for st bernard
is to be found in his life by geoffroi de clairvaux where he
pertinaciously insists that the crusade was not unfortunate st bernard
he says had prophesied a happy result and that result could not be
considered other than happy which had peopled heaven with so glorious an
army of martyrs geoffroi was a cunning pleader and no doubt convinced
a few of the zealous but plain people who were not wanting even in those
days retained their own opinion or what amounts to the same thing
were convinced against their will
we now come to the consideration of the third crusade and of the causes
which rendered it necessary the epidemic frenzy which had been cooling
ever since the issue of the first expedition was now extinct or very
nearly so and the nations of europe looked with cold indifference upon
the armaments of their princes but chivalry had flourished in its natural
element of war and was now in all its glory it continued to supply
armies for the holy land when the popular ranks refused to deliver up
their ablebodied swarms poetry which more than religion inspired the
third crusade was then but caviare to the million who had other
matters of sterner import to claim all their attention but the knights
and their retainers listened with delight to the martial and amatory
strains of the minstrels minnesngers trouvres and troubadours and
burned to win favour in ladies eyes by shewing prowess in the holy land
the third was truly the romantic era of the crusades men fought then not
so much for the sepulchre of jesus and the maintenance of a christian
kingdom in the east as to gain glory for themselves in the best and
almost only field where glory could be obtained they fought not as
zealots but as soldiers not for religion but for honour not for the
crown of martyrdom but for the favour of the lovely
illustration seal of barbarossa
it is not necessary to enter into a detail of the events by which saladin
attained the sovereignty of the east or how after a succession of
engagements he planted the moslem banner once more upon the battlements
of jerusalem the christian knights and population including the grand
orders of st john the hospitallers and the templars were sunk in an
abyss of vice and torn by unworthy jealousies and dissensions were
unable to resist the welltrained armies which the wise and mighty saladin
brought forward to crush them but the news of their fall created a
painful sensation among the chivalry of europe whose noblest members were
linked to the dwellers in palestine by many ties both of blood and
friendship the news of the great battle of tiberias in which saladin
defeated the christian host with terrible slaughter arrived first in
europe and was followed in quick succession by that of the capture of
jerusalem antioch tripoli and other cities dismay seized upon the
clergy the pope urban iii was so affected by the news that he pined
away for grief and was scarcely seen to smile again until he sank into
the sleep of death12 his successor gregory viii felt the loss as
acutely but had better strength to bear it and instructed all the clergy
of the christian world to stir up the people to arms for the recovery of
the holy sepulchre william archbishop of tyre a humble follower in the
path of peter the hermit left palestine to preach to the kings of europe

henry ii of england and philip augustus of france at the head of their
chivalry supported the crusade with all their influence until wars and
dissensions nearer home estranged them from it for a time the two kings
met at gisors in normandy in the month of january 1188 accompanied by a
brilliant train of knights and warriors william of tyre was present and
expounded the cause of the cross with considerable eloquence and the
whole assembly bound themselves by oath to proceed to jerusalem it was
agreed at the same time that a tax called saladins tithe and consisting
of the tenth part of all possessions whether landed or personal should
be enforced over christendom upon every one who was either unable or
unwilling to assume the cross the lord of every feof whether lay or
ecclesiastical was charged to raise the tithe within his own
jurisdiction and any one who refused to pay his quota became by that act
the bondsman and absolute property of his lord at the same time the
greatest indulgence was shewn to those who assumed the cross no man was
at liberty to stay them by process of any kind whether for debt or
robbery or murder the king of france at the breaking up of the
conference summoned a parliament at paris where these resolutions were
solemnly confirmed while henry ii did the same for his norman
possessions at rouen and for england at geddington in northamptonshire
to use the words of an ancient chronicler14 he held a parliament about
the voyage into the holy land and troubled the whole land with the paying
of tithes towards it
    14 stowe
illustration philip augustus
but it was not england alone that was troubled by the tax the people
of france also looked upon it with no pleasant feelings and appear from
that time forth to have changed their indifference for the crusade into
aversion even the clergy who were exceedingly willing that other people
should contribute half or even all their goods in furtherance of their
favourite scheme were not at all anxious to contribute a single sous
themselves millot15 relates that several of them cried out against the
impost among the rest the clergy of rheims were called upon to pay their
quota but sent a deputation to the king begging him to be contented with
the aid of their prayers as they were too poor to contribute in any other
shape philip augustus knew better and by way of giving them a lesson
employed three nobles of the vicinity to lay waste the church lands the
clergy informed of the outrage applied to the king for redress i will
aid you with my prayers said the monarch condescendingly and will
entreat those gentlemen to let the church alone he did as he had
promised but in such a manner that the nobles who appreciated the joke
continued their devastations as before again the clergy applied to the
king what would you have of me he replied in answer to their
remonstrances you gave me your prayers in my necessity and i have given
you mine in yours the clergy understood the argument and thought it the
wiser course to pay their quota of saladins tithe without further parley
    15 elmens de lhistoire de france
this anecdote shews the unpopularity of the crusade if the clergy
disliked to contribute it is no wonder that the people felt still greater
antipathy but the chivalry of europe was eager for the affray the tithe
was rigorously collected and armies from england france burgundy
italy flanders and germany were soon in the field the two kings who
were to have led it were however drawn into broils by an aggression of
richard duke of guienne better known as richard coeur de lion upon the
territory of the count of toulouse and the proposed journey to palestine
was delayed war continued to rage between france and england and with so
little probability of a speedy termination that many of the nobles bound
to the crusade left the two monarchs to settle the differences at their
leisure and proceeded to palestine without them
death at last stepped in and removed henry ii from the hostility of his
foes and the treachery and ingratitude of his children his son richard
immediately concluded an alliance with philip augustus and the two young
valiant and impetuous monarchs united all their energies to forward the
crusade they met with a numerous and brilliant retinue at nonancourt in
normandy where in sight of their assembled chivalry they embraced as
brothers and swore to live as friends and true allies until a period of
forty days after their return from the holy land with a view of purging
their camp from the follies and vices which had proved so ruinous to
preceding expeditions they drew up a code of laws for the government of
the army gambling had been carried to a great extent and proved the
fruitful source of quarrels and bloodshed and one of their laws
prohibited any person in the army beneath the degree of a knight from
playing at any game for money16 knights and clergymen might play for
money but no one was permitted to lose or gain more than twenty shillings
in a day under a penalty of one hundred shillings the personal
attendants of the monarchs were also allowed to play to the same extent
the penalty in their case for infraction was that they should be whipped
naked through the army for the space of three days any crusader who
struck another and drew blood was ordered to have his hand cut off and
whoever slew a brother crusader was condemned to be tied alive to the
corpse of his victim and buried with him no young women were allowed to
follow the army to the great sorrow of many vicious and of many virtuous
dames who had not courage to elude the decree by dressing in male attire
but many highminded and affectionate maidens and matrons bearing the
sword or the spear followed their husbands and lovers to the war in spite
of king richard and in defiance of danger the only women allowed to
accompany the army in their own habiliments were washerwomen of fifty
years complete and any others of the fair sex who had reached the same
age
    16 strutts sports and pastimes
these rules having been promulgated the two monarchs marched together to
lyons where they separated agreeing to meet again at messina philip
proceeded across the alps to genoa where he took ship and was conveyed
in safety to the place of rendezvous richard turned in the direction of
marseilles where he also took ship for messina his impetuous disposition
hurried him into many squabbles by the way and his knights and followers
for the most part as brave and as foolish as himself imitated him very
zealously in this particular at messina the sicilians charged the most
exorbitant prices for every necessary of life richards army in vain
remonstrated from words they came to blows and as a last resource
plundered the sicilians since they could not trade with them continual
battles were the consequence in one of which lebrun the favourite
attendant of richard lost his life the peasantry from far and near came
flocking to the aid of the townspeople and the battle soon became
general richard irritated at the loss of his favourite and incited by
report that tancred the king of sicily was fighting at the head of his
own people joined the mle with his boldest knights and beating back
the sicilians attacked the city sword in hand stormed the battlements
tore down the flag of sicily and planted his own in its stead this
collision gave great offence to the king of france who became from that
time jealous of richard and apprehensive that his design was not so much
to reestablish the christian kingdom of jerusalem as to make conquests
for himself he however exerted his influence to restore peace between
the english and sicilians and shortly afterwards set sail for acre with
distrust of his ally germinating in his heart
illustration the island of rhodes
richard remained behind for some weeks in a state of inactivity quite
unaccountable in one of his temperament he appears to have had no more
squabbles with the sicilians but to have lived an easy luxurious life
forgetting in the lap of pleasure the objects for which he had quitted
his own dominions and the dangerous laxity he was introducing into his
army the superstition of his soldiers recalled him at length to a sense
of his duty a comet was seen for several successive nights which was
thought to menace them with the vengeance of heaven for their delay
shooting stars gave them similar warning and a fanatic of the name of
joachim with his drawn sword in his hand and his long hair streaming
wildly over his shoulders went through the camp howling all night long
and predicting plague famine and every other calamity if they did not
set out immediately richard did not deem it prudent to neglect the
intimations and after doing humble penance for his remissness he set
sail for acre
a violent storm dispersed his fleet but he arrived safely at rhodes with
the principal part of the armament here he learned that three of his
ships had been stranded on the rocky coasts of cyprus and that the ruler
of the island isaac comnenus had permitted his people to pillage the
unfortunate crews and had refused shelter to his betrothed bride the
princess berengaria and his sister who in one of the vessels had been
driven by stress of weather into the port of limisso the fiery monarch
swore to be revenged and collecting all his vessels sailed back to
limisso isaac comnenus refused to apologise or explain and richard in
no mood to be trifled with landed on the island routed with great loss
the forces sent to oppose him and laid the whole country under
contribution
illustration richard i and berengaria
on his arrival at acre he found the whole of the chivalry of europe there
before him guy of lusignan the king of jerusalem had long before
collected the bold knights of the temple the hospital and st john and
had laid siege to acre which was resolutely defended by the sultan
saladin with an army magnificent both for its numbers and its discipline
for nearly two years the crusaders had pushed the siege and made efforts
almost superhuman to dislodge the enemy various battles had taken place
in the open fields with no decisive advantage to either party and guy of
lusignan had begun to despair of taking that strong position without aid
from europe his joy was extreme on the arrival of philip with all his
chivalry and he only awaited the coming of coeur de lion to make one last
decisive attack upon the town when the fleet of england was first seen
approaching the shores of syria a universal shout arose from the
christian camp and when richard landed with his train one louder still
pierced to the very mountains of the south where saladin lay with all his
army
it may be remarked as characteristic of this crusade that the christians
and the moslems no longer looked upon each other as barbarians to whom
mercy was a crime each host entertained the highest admiration for the
bravery and magnanimity of the other and in their occasional truces met
upon the most friendly terms the moslem warriors were full of courtesy to
the christian knights and had no other regret than to think that such
fine fellows were not mahomedans the christians with a feeling precisely
similar extolled to the skies the nobleness of the saracens and sighed
to think that such generosity and valour should be sullied by disbelief in
the gospel of jesus but when the strife began all these feelings
disappeared and the struggle became mortal
the jealousy excited in the mind of philip by the events of messina still
rankled and the two monarchs refused to act in concert instead of making
a joint attack upon the town the french monarch assailed it alone and
was repulsed richard did the same and with the same result philip tried
to seduce the soldiers of richard from their allegiance by the offer of
three gold pieces per month to every knight who would forsake the banners
of england for those of france richard endeavoured to neutralise the
offer by a larger one and promised four pieces to every french knight who
should join the lion of england in this unworthy rivalry their time was
wasted to the great detriment of the discipline and efficiency of their
followers some good was nevertheless effected for the mere presence of
two such armies prevented the besieged city from receiving supplies and
the inhabitants were reduced by famine to the most woful straits saladin
did not deem it prudent to risk a general engagement by coming to their
relief but preferred to wait till dissension had weakened his enemy and
made him an easy prey perhaps if he had been aware of the real extent of
the extremity in acre he would have changed his plan but cut off from
the town he did not know its misery till it was too late after a short
truce the city capitulated upon terms so severe that saladin afterwards
refused to ratify them the chief conditions were that the precious wood
of the true cross captured by the moslems in jerusalem should be
restored that a sum of two hundred thousand gold pieces should be paid
and that all the christian prisoners in acre should be released together
with two hundred knights and a thousand soldiers detained in captivity by
saladin the eastern monarch as may be well conceived did not set much
store on the wood of the cross but was nevertheless anxious to keep it
as he knew its possession by the christians would do more than a victory
to restore their courage he refused therefore to deliver it up or to
accede to any of the conditions and richard as he had previously
threatened barbarously ordered all the saracen prisoners in his power to
be put to death
the possession of the city only caused new and unhappy dissensions between
the christian leaders the archduke of austria unjustifiably hoisted his
flag on one of the towers of acre which richard no sooner saw than he
tore it down with his own hands and trampled it under his feet philip
though he did not sympathise with the archduke was piqued at the
assumption of richard and the breach between the two monarchs became
wider than ever a foolish dispute arose at the same time between guy of
lusignan and conrad of montferrat for the crown of jerusalem the inferior
knights were not slow to imitate the pernicious example and jealousy
distrust and illwill reigned in the christian camp in the midst of this
confusion the king of france suddenly announced his intention to return to
his own country richard was filled with indignation and exclaimed
eternal shame light on him and on all france if for any cause he
leave this work unfinished but philip was not to be stayed his health
had suffered by his residence in the east and ambitious of playing a
first part he preferred to play none at all than to play second to king
richard leaving a small detachment of burgundians behind he returned to
france with the remainder of his army and coeur de lion without feeling
in the multitude of his rivals that he had lost the greatest became
painfully convinced that the right arm of the enterprise was lopped off
after his departure richard refortified acre restored the christian
worship in the churches and leaving a christian garrison to protect it
marched along the seacoast towards ascalon saladin was on the alert and
sent his light horse to attack the rear of the christian army while he
himself miscalculating their weakness since the defection of philip
endeavoured to force them to a general engagement the rival armies met
near azotus a fierce battle ensued in which saladin was defeated and put
to flight and the road to jerusalem left free for the crusaders
again discord exerted its baleful influence and prevented richard from
following up his victory his opinion was constantly opposed by the other
leaders all jealous of his bravery and influence and the army instead
of marching to jerusalem or even to ascalon as was first intended
proceeded to jaffa and remained in idleness until saladin was again in a
condition to wage war against them
illustration bethlehem
many months were spent in fruitless hostilities and as fruitless
negotiations richards wish was to recapture jerusalem but there were
difficulties in the way which even his bold spirit could not conquer his
own intolerable pride was not the least cause of the evil for it
estranged many a generous spirit who would have been willing to
cooperate with him in all cordiality at length it was agreed to march to
the holy city but the progress made was so slow and painful that the
soldiers murmured and the leaders meditated retreat the weather was hot
and dry and there was little water to be procured saladin had choked up
the wells and cisterns on the route and the army had not zeal enough to
push forward amid such privation at bethlehem a council was held to
debate whether they should retreat or advance retreat was decided upon
and immediately commenced it is said that richard was first led to a
hill whence he could obtain a sight of the towers of jerusalem and that
he was so affected at being so near it and so unable to relieve it that
he hid his face behind his shield and sobbed aloud
the army separated into two divisions the smaller falling back upon
jaffa and the larger commanded by richard and the duke of burgundy
returning to acre before the english monarch had made all his
preparations for his return to europe a messenger reached acre with the
intelligence that jaffa was besieged by saladin and that unless relieved
immediately the city would be taken the french under the duke of
burgundy were so wearied with the war that they refused to aid their
brethren in jaffa richard blushing with shame at their pusillanimity
called his english to the rescue and arrived just in time to save the
city his very name put the saracens to flight so great was their dread
of his prowess saladin regarded him with the warmest admiration and when
richard after his victory demanded peace willingly acceded a truce was
concluded for three years and eight months during which christian
pilgrims were to enjoy the liberty of visiting jerusalem without hindrance
or payment of any tax the crusaders were allowed to retain the cities of
tyre and jaffa with the country intervening saladin with a princely
generosity invited many of the christians to visit jerusalem and several
of the leaders took advantage of his offer to feast their eyes upon a spot
which all considered so sacred many of them were entertained for days in
the sultans own palace from which they returned with their tongues laden
with the praises of the noble infidel richard and saladin never met
though the impression that they did will remain on many minds who have
been dazzled by the glorious fiction of sir walter scott but each admired
the prowess and nobleness of soul of his rival and agreed to terms far
less onerous than either would have accepted had this mutual admiration
not existed17
    17 richard left a high reputation in palestine so much terror
         did his name occasion that the women of syria used it to
         frighten their children for ages afterwards every
         disobedient child became still when told that king richard
         was coming even men shared the panic that his name created
         and a hundred years afterwards whenever a horse shied at any
         object in the way his rider would exclaim what dost thou
         think king richard is in the bush
the king of england no longer delayed his departure for messengers from
his own country brought imperative news that his presence was required to
defeat the intrigues that were fomenting against his crown his long
imprisonment in the austrian dominions and final ransom are too well known
to be dwelt upon and thus ended the third crusade less destructive of
human life than the two first but quite as useless
the flame of popular enthusiasm now burned pale indeed and all the
efforts of popes and potentates were insufficient to rekindle it at last
after flickering unsteadily like a lamp expiring in the socket it burned
up brightly for one final instant and was extinguished for ever
the fourth crusade as connected with popular feeling requires little or
no notice at the death of saladin which happened a year after the
conclusion of his truce with richard of england his vast empire fell to
pieces his brother saif eddin or saphaddin seized upon syria in the
possession of which he was troubled by the sons of saladin when this
intelligence reached europe the pope celestine iii judged the moment
favourable for preaching a new crusade but every nation in europe was
unwilling and cold towards it the people had no ardour and kings were
occupied with more weighty matters at home the only monarch of europe who
encouraged it was the emperor henry of germany under whose auspices the
dukes of saxony and bavaria took the field at the head of a considerable
force they landed in palestine and found any thing but a welcome from
the christian inhabitants under the mild sway of saladin they had
enjoyed repose and toleration and both were endangered by the arrival of
the germans they looked upon them in consequence as overofficious
intruders and gave them no encouragement in the warfare against
saphaddin the result of this crusade was even more disastrous than the
last for the germans contrived not only to embitter the saracens against
the christians of judea but to lose the strong city of jaffa and cause
the destruction of ninetenths of the army with which they had quitted
europe and so ended the fourth crusade
the fifth was more important and had a result which its projectors never
dreamed ofno less than the sacking of constantinople and the placing of
a french dynasty upon the imperial throne of the eastern csars each
succeeding pope however much he may have differed from his predecessors
on other points zealously agreed in one that of maintaining by every
possible means the papal ascendency no scheme was so likely to aid in
this endeavour as the crusades as long as they could persuade the kings
and nobles of europe to fight and die in syria their own sway was secured
over the minds of men at home such being their object they never
inquired whether a crusade was or was not likely to be successful whether
the time were well or ill chosen or whether men and money could be
procured in sufficient abundance pope innocent iii would have been proud
if he could have bent the refractory monarchs of england and france into
so much submission but john and philip augustus were both engaged both
had deeply offended the church and had been laid under her ban and both
were occupied in important reforms at home philip in bestowing immunities
upon his subjects and john in having them forced from him the emissaries
of the pope therefore plied them in vain but as in the first and second
crusades the eloquence of a powerful preacher incited the nobility and
through them a certain portion of the people foulque bishop of neuilly
an ambitious and enterprising prelate entered fully into the views of the
court of rome and preached the crusade wherever he could find an
audience chance favoured him to a degree he did not himself expect for
he had in general found but few proselytes and those few but cold in the
cause theobald count of champagne had instituted a grand tournament to
which he had invited all the nobles from far and near upwards of two
thousand knights were present with their retainers besides a vast
concourse of people to witness the sports in the midst of the festivities
foulque arrived upon the spot and conceiving the opportunity to be a
favourable one he addressed the multitude in eloquent language and
passionately called upon them to enrol themselves for the new crusade the
count de champagne young ardent and easily excited received the cross
at his hands the enthusiasm spread rapidly charles count of blois
followed the example and of the two thousand knights present scarcely
one hundred and fifty refused the popular phrensy seemed on the point of
breaking out as in the days of yore the count of flanders the count of
bar the duke of burgundy and the marquis of montferrat brought all
their vassals to swell the train and in a very short space of time an
effective army was on foot and ready to march to palestine
the dangers of an overland journey were too well understood and the
crusaders endeavoured to make a contract with some of the italian states
to convey them over in their vessels dandolo the aged doge of venice
offered them the galleys of the republic but the crusaders on their
arrival in that city found themselves too poor to pay even half the sum
demanded every means was tried to raise money the crusaders melted down
their plate and ladies gave up their trinkets contributions were
solicited from the faithful but came in so slowly as to make it evident
to all concerned that the faithful of europe were outnumbered by the
prudent as a last resource dandolo offered to convey them to palestine
at the expense of the republic if they would previously aid in the
recapture of the city of zara which had been seized from the venetians a
short time previously by the king of hungary the crusaders consented
much to the displeasure of the pope who threatened excommunication upon
all who should be turned aside from the voyage to jerusalem but
notwithstanding the fulminations of the church the expedition never
reached palestine the siege of zara was speedily undertaken after a long
and brave defence the city surrendered at discretion and the crusaders
were free if they had so chosen it to use their swords against the
saracens but the ambition of the chiefs had been directed by unforeseen
circumstances elsewhere
after the death of manuel comnenus the greek empire had fallen a prey to
intestine divisions his son alexius ii had succeeded him but was
murdered after a short reign by his uncle andronicus who seized upon the
throne his reign also was but of short duration isaac angelus a member
of the same family took up arms against the usurper and having defeated
and captured him in a pitched battle had him put to death he also
mounted the throne only to be cast down from it his brother alexius
deposed him and to incapacitate him from reigning put out his eyes and
shut him up in a dungeon neither was alexius iii allowed to remain in
peaceable possession of the throne the son of the unhappy isaac whose
name also was alexius fled from constantinople and hearing that the
crusaders had undertaken the siege of zara made them the most magnificent
offers if they would afterwards aid him in deposing his uncle his offers
were that if by their means he was reestablished in his fathers
dominions he would place the greek church under the authority of the pope
of rome lend the whole force of the greek empire to the conquest of
palestine and distribute two hundred thousand marks of silver among the
crusading army the offer was accepted with a proviso on the part of some
of the leaders that they should be free to abandon the design if it met
with the disapproval of the pope but this was not to be feared the
submission of the schismatic greeks to the see of rome was a greater bribe
to the pontiff than the utter annihilation of the saracen power in
palestine would have been
the crusaders were soon in movement for the imperial city their
operations were skilfully and courageously directed and spread such
dismay as to paralyse the efforts of the usurper to retain possession of
his throne after a vain resistance he abandoned the city to its fate
and fled no one knew whither the aged and blind isaac was taken from his
dungeon by his subjects and placed upon the throne ere the crusaders were
apprised of the flight of his rival his son alexius iv was afterwards
associated with him in the sovereignty
but the conditions of the treaty gave offence to the grecian people whose
prelates refused to place themselves under the dominion of the see of
rome alexius at first endeavoured to persuade his subjects to admission
and prayed the crusaders to remain in constantinople until they had
fortified him in the possession of a throne which was yet far from secure
he soon became unpopular with his subjects and breaking faith with regard
to the subsidies he offended the crusaders war was at length declared
upon him by both parties by his people for his tyranny and by his former
friends for his treachery he was seized in his palace by his own guards
and thrown into prison while the crusaders were making ready to besiege
his capital the greeks immediately proceeded to the election of a new
monarch and looking about for a man of courage energy and perseverance
they fixed upon alexius ducas who with almost every bad quality was
possessed of the virtues they needed he ascended the throne under the
name of murzuphlis one of his first acts was to rid himself of his
youngest predecessora broken heart had already removed the blind old
isaac no longer a stumblingblock in his wayand the young alexius was
soon after put to death in his prison
illustration constantinople
war to the knife was now declared between the greeks and the franks and
early in the spring of the year 1204 preparations were commenced for an
assault upon constantinople the french and venetians entered into a
treaty for the division of the spoils among their soldiery for so
confident were they of success that failure never once entered into their
calculations this confidence led them on to victory while the greeks
cowardly as treacherous people always are were paralysed by a foreboding
of evil it has been a matter of astonishment to all historians that
murzuphlis with the reputation for courage which he had acquired and the
immense resources at his disposal took no better measures to repel the
onset of the crusaders their numbers were as a mere handful in comparison
with those which he could have brought against them and if they had the
hopes of plunder to lead them on the greeks had their homes to fight for
and their very existence as a nation to protect after an impetuous
assault repulsed for one day but renewed with double impetuosity on
another the crusaders lashed their vessels against the walls slew every
man who opposed them and with little loss to themselves entered the
city murzuphlis fled and constantinople was given over to be pillaged by
the victors the wealth they found was enormous in money alone there was
sufficient to distribute twenty marks of silver to each knight ten to
each squire or servant at arms and five to each archer jewels velvets
silks and every luxury of attire with rare wines and fruits and
valuable merchandise of every description also fell into their hands and
were bought by the trading venetians and the proceeds distributed among
the army two thousand persons were put to the sword but had there been
less plunder to take up the attention of the victors the slaughter would
in all probability have been much greater
in many of the bloody wars which defile the page of history we find that
soldiers utterly reckless of the works of god will destroy his
masterpiece man with unsparing brutality but linger with respect round
the beautiful works of art they will slaughter women and children but
spare a picture will hew down the sick the helpless and the
hoaryheaded but refrain from injuring a fine piece of sculpture the
latins on their entrance into constantinople respected neither the works
of god nor man but vented their brutal ferocity upon the one and
satisfied their avarice upon the other many beautiful bronze statues
above all price as works of art were broken into pieces to be sold as old
metal the finelychiselled marble which could be put to no such vile
uses was also destroyed with a recklessness if possible still more
atrocious18
    18 the following is a list of some of the works of art thus
         destroyed from nicetas a contemporary greek author 1st a
         colossal juno from the forum of constantine the head of

         of paris presenting the apple to venus 3d an immense
         bronze pyramid crowned by a female figure which turned with
         the wind 4th the colossal statue of bellerophon in bronze
         which was broken down and cast into the furnace under the
         inner nail of the horses hind foot on the left side was
         found a seal wrapped in a woollen cloth 5th a figure of
         hercules by lysimachus of such vast dimensions that the
         thumb was equal in circumference to the waist of a man 6th
         the ass and his driver cast by order of augustus after the
         battle of actium in commemoration of his having discovered
         the position of anthony through the means of an assdriver
         7th the wolf suckling the twins of rome 8th the gladiator
         in combat with a lion 9th the hippopotamus 10th the
         sphinxes 11th an eagle fighting with a serpent 12th a
         beautiful statue of helen 13th a group with a monster
         somewhat resembling a bull engaged in deadly conflict with a
         serpent and many other works of art too numerous to
         mention
the carnage being over and the spoil distributed six persons were chosen
from among the franks and six from among the venetians who were to meet
and elect an emperor previously binding themselves by oath to select the
individual best qualified among the candidates the choice wavered between
baldwin count of flanders and boniface marquis of montferrat but fell
eventually upon the former he was straightway robed in the imperial
purple and became the founder of a new dynasty he did not live long to
enjoy his power or to consolidate it for his successors who in their
turn were soon swept away in less than sixty years the rule of the
franks at constantinople was brought to as sudden and disastrous a
termination as the reign of murzuphlis and this was the grand result of
the fifth crusade
pope innocent iii although he had looked with no very unfavourable eye
upon these proceedings regretted that nothing had been done for the
relief of the holy land still upon every convenient occasion he
enforced the necessity of a new crusade until the year 1213 his
exhortations had no other effect than to keep the subject in the mind of
europe every spring and summer detachments of pilgrims continued to set
out for palestine to the aid of their brethren but not in sufficient
numbers to be of much service these periodical passages were called the
passagium martii or the passage of march and the passagium johannis
or the passage of the festival of st john these did not consist entirely
of soldiers armed against the saracen but of pilgrims led by devotion
and in performance of their vows bearing nothing with them but their
staff and their wallet early in the spring of 1213 a more extraordinary
body of crusaders was raised in france and germany an immense number of
boys and girls amounting according to some accounts to thirty thousand
were incited by the persuasion of two monks to undertake the journey to
palestine they were no doubt composed of the idle and deserted children
who generally swarm in great cities nurtured in vice and daring and
ready for any thing the object of the monks seems to have been the
atrocious one of inveigling them into slaveships on pretence of sending
them to syria and selling them for slaves on the coast of africa19
great numbers of these poor victims were shipped at marseilles but the
vessels with the exception of two or three were wrecked on the shores of
italy and every soul perished the remainder arrived safely in africa
and were bought up as slaves and sent off into the interior of the
country another detachment arrived at genoa but the accomplices in this
horrid plot having taken no measures at that port expecting them all at
marseilles they were induced to return to their homes by the genoese
    19 see jacob de voragine and albericus
fuller in his quaint history of the holy warre says that this crusade
was done by the instinct of the devil and he adds a reason which may
provoke mirth now but which was put forth by the worthy historian in all
soberness and sincerity he says the devil being cloyed with the
murdering of men desired a cordial of childrens blood to comfort his
weak stomach as epicures when tired of mutton resort to lamb for a
change
it appears from other authors that the preaching of the vile monks had
such an effect upon these deluded children that they ran about the
country exclaiming o lord jesus restore thy cross to us and that
neither bolts nor bars the fear of fathers nor the love of mothers was
sufficient to restrain them from journeying to jerusalem
the details of these strange proceedings are exceedingly meagre and
confused and none of the contemporary writers who mention the subject
have thought it worth while to state the names of the monks who originated
the scheme or the fate they met for their wickedness two merchants of
marseilles who were to have shared in the profits were it is said
brought to justice for some other crime and suffered death but we are
not informed whether they divulged any circumstances relating to this
matter
pope innocent iii does not seem to have been aware that the causes of
this juvenile crusade were such as have been stated for upon being
informed that numbers of them had taken the cross and were marching to
the holy land he exclaimed these children are awake while we sleep he
imagined apparently that the mind of europe was still bent on the
recovery of palestine and that the zeal of these children implied a sort
of reproach upon his own lukewarmness very soon afterwards he bestirred
himself with more activity and sent an encyclical letter to the clergy of
christendom urging them to preach a new crusade as usual a number of
adventurous nobles who had nothing else to do enrolled themselves with
their retainers at a council of lateran which was held while these bands
were collecting innocent announced that he himself would take the cross
and lead the armies of christ to the defence of his sepulchre in all
probability he would have done so for he was zealous enough but death
stepped in and destroyed his project ere it was ripe his successor
encouraged the crusade though he refused to accompany it and the
armament continued in france england and germany no leaders of any
importance joined it from the former countries andrew king of hungary was
the only monarch who had leisure or inclination to leave his dominions
the dukes of austria and bavaria joined him with a considerable army of
germans and marching to spalatro took ship for cyprus and from thence
to acre
the whole conduct of the king of hungary was marked by pusillanimity and
irresolution he found himself in the holy land at the head of a very
efficient army the saracens were taken by surprise and were for some
weeks unprepared to offer any resistance to his arms he defeated the
first body sent to oppose him and marched towards mount tabor with the
intention of seizing upon an important fortress which the saracens had
recently constructed he arrived without impediment at the mount and
might have easily taken it but a sudden fit of cowardice came over him
and he returned to acre without striking a blow he very soon afterwards
abandoned the enterprise altogether and returned to his own country
tardy reinforcements arrived at intervals from europe and the duke of
austria now the chief leader of the expedition had still sufficient
forces at his command to trouble the saracens very seriously it was
resolved by him in council with the other chiefs that the whole energy
of the crusade should be directed upon egypt the seat of the saracen
power in its relationship to palestine and from whence were drawn the
continual levies that were brought against them by the sultan damietta
which commanded the river nile and was one of the most important cities
of egypt was chosen as the first point of attack the siege was forthwith
commenced and carried on with considerable energy until the crusaders
gained possession of a tower which projected into the middle of the
stream and was looked upon as the very key of the city
while congratulating themselves upon this success and wasting in revelry
the time which should have been employed in turning it to further
advantage they received the news of the death of the wise sultan
saphaddin his two sons camhel and cohreddin divided his empire between
them syria and palestine fell to the share of cohreddin while egypt was
consigned to the other brother who had for some time exercised the
functions of lieutenant of that country being unpopular among the
egyptians they revolted against him giving the crusaders a finer
opportunity for making a conquest than they had ever enjoyed before but
quarrelsome and licentious as they had been from time immemorial they did
not see that the favourable moment had come or seeing could not profit
by it while they were revelling or fighting among themselves under the
walls of damietta the revolt was suppressed and camhel firmly
established on the throne of egypt in conjunction with his brother
cohreddin his next care was to drive the christians from damietta and
for upwards of three months they bent all their efforts to throw in
supplies to the besieged or draw on the besiegers to a general
engagement in neither were they successful and the famine in damietta
became so dreadful that vermin of every description were thought luxuries
and sold for exorbitant prices a dead dog became more valuable than a
live ox in time of prosperity unwholesome food brought on disease and
the city could hold out no longer for absolute want of men to defend the
walls
cohreddin and camhel were alike interested in the preservation of so
important a position and convinced of the certain fate of the city they
opened a conference with the crusading chiefs offering to yield the whole
of palestine to the christians upon the sole condition of the evacuation
of egypt with a blindness and wrongheadedness almost incredible these
advantageous terms were refused chiefly through the persuasion of
cardinal pelagius an ignorant and obstinate fanatic who urged upon the
duke of austria and the french and english leaders that infidels never
kept their word that their offers were deceptive and merely intended to
betray the conferences were brought to an abrupt termination by the
crusaders and a last attack made upon the walls of damietta the besieged
made but slight resistance for they had no hope and the christians
entered the city and found out of seventy thousand people but three
thousand remaining so fearful had been the ravages of the twin fiends
plague and famine
several months were spent in damietta the climate either weakened the
frames or obscured the understandings of the christians for after their
conquest they lost all energy and abandoned themselves more
unscrupulously than ever to riot and debauchery john of brienne who by
right of his wife was the nominal sovereign of jerusalem was so
disgusted with the pusillanimity arrogance and dissensions of the
chiefs that he withdrew entirely from them and retired to acre large
bodies also returned to europe and cardinal pelagius was left at liberty
to blast the whole enterprise whenever it pleased him he managed to
conciliate john of brienne and marched forward with these combined forces
to attack cairo it was only when he had approached within a few hours
march of that city that he discovered the inadequacy of his army he
turned back immediately but the nile had risen since his departure the
sluices were opened and there was no means of reaching damietta in this
strait he sued for the peace he had formerly spurned and happily for
himself found the generous brothers camhel and cohreddin still willing to
grant it damietta was soon afterwards given up and the cardinal returned
to europe john of brienne retired to acre to mourn the loss of his
kingdom embittered against the folly of his pretended friends who had
ruined where they should have aided him and thus ended the sixth crusade
the seventh was more successful frederic ii emperor of germany had
often vowed to lead his armies to the defence of palestine but was as
often deterred from the journey by matters of more pressing importance
cohreddin was a mild and enlightened monarch and the christians of syria
enjoyed repose and toleration under his rule but john of brienne was not
willing to lose his kingdom without an effort and the popes in europe
were ever willing to embroil the nations for the sake of extending their
own power no monarch of that age was capable of rendering more effective
assistance than frederic of germany to inspire him with more zeal it was
proposed that he should wed the young princess violante daughter of john
of brienne and heiress of the kingdom of jerusalem frederic consented
with joy and eagerness the princess was brought from acre to rome without
delay and her marriage celebrated on a scale of great magnificence her
father john of brienne abdicated all his rights in favour of his
soninlaw and jerusalem had once more a king who had not only the will
but the power to enforce his claims preparations for the new crusade
were immediately commenced and in the course of six months the emperor
was at the head of a welldisciplined army of sixty thousand men matthew
paris informs us that an army of the same amount was gathered in england
and most of the writers upon the crusades adopt his statement when john
of brienne was in england before his daughters marriage with the emperor
was thought of praying for the aid of henry iii and his nobles to
recover his lost kingdom he did not meet with much encouragement
grafton in his chronicle says he departed again without any great
comfort but when a man of more influence in european politics appeared
upon the scene the english nobles were as ready to sacrifice themselves
in the cause as they had been in the time of coeur de lion
the army of frederic encamped at brundusium but a pestilential disease
having made its appearance among them their departure was delayed for
several months in the mean time the empress violante died in childbed
john of brienne who had already repented of his abdication and was
besides incensed against frederic for many acts of neglect and insult no
sooner saw the only tie which bound them severed by the death of his
daughter than he began to bestir himself and make interest with the pope
to undo what he had done and regain the honorary crown he had renounced
pope gregory ix a man of a proud unconciliating and revengeful
character owed the emperor a grudge for many an act of disobedience to
his authority and encouraged the overtures of john of brienne more than
he should have done frederic however despised them both and as soon
as his army was convalescent set sail for acre he had not been many days
at sea when he was himself attacked with the malady and obliged to return
to otranto the nearest port gregory who had by this time decided in the
interest of john of brienne excommunicated the emperor for returning from
so holy an expedition on any pretext whatever frederic at first treated
the excommunication with supreme contempt but when he got well he gave
his holiness to understand that he was not to be outraged with impunity
and sent some of his troops to ravage the papal territories this
however only made the matter worse and gregory despatched messengers to
palestine forbidding the faithful under severe pains and penalties to
hold any intercourse with the excommunicated emperor thus between them
both the scheme which they had so much at heart bade fair to be as
effectually ruined as even the saracens could have wished frederic still
continued his zeal in the crusade for he was now king of jerusalem and
fought for himself and not for christendom or its representative pope
gregory hearing that john of brienne was preparing to leave europe he
lost no time in taking his own departure and arrived safely at acre it
was here that he first experienced the evil effects of excommunication
the christians of palestine refused to aid him in any way and looked with
distrust if not with abhorrence upon him the templars hospitallers
and other knights shared at first the general feeling but they were not
men to yield a blind obedience to a distant potentate especially when it
compromised their own interests when therefore frederic prepared to
march upon jerusalem without them they joined his banners to a man
illustration templar and hospitaller
it is said that previous to quitting europe the german emperor had
commenced a negotiation with the sultan camhel for the restoration of the
holy land and that camhel who was jealous of the ambition of his brother
cohreddin was willing to stipulate to that effect on condition of being
secured by frederic in the possession of the more important territory of
egypt but before the crusaders reached palestine camhel was relieved
from all fears by the death of his brother he nevertheless did not think
it worth while to contest with the crusaders the barren corner of the
earth which had already been dyed with so much christian and saracen
blood and proposed a truce of three years only stipulating in addition
that the moslems should be allowed to worship freely in the temple of
jerusalem this happy termination did not satisfy the bigoted christians
of palestine the tolerance they sought for themselves they were not
willing to extend to others and they complained bitterly of the privilege
of free worship allowed to their opponents unmerited good fortune had
made them insolent and they contested the right of the emperor to become
a party to any treaty as long as he remained under the ecclesiastical
ban frederic was disgusted with his new subjects but as the templars
and hospitallers remained true to him he marched to jerusalem to be
crowned all the churches were shut against him and he could not even
find a priest to officiate at his coronation he had despised the papal
authority too long to quail at it now when it was so unjustifiably
exerted and as there was nobody to crown him he very wisely crowned
himself he took the royal diadem from the altar with his own hands and
boldly and proudly placed it on his brow no shouts of an applauding
populace made the welkin ring no hymns of praise and triumph resounded
from the ministers of religion but a thousand swords started from their
scabbards to testify that their owners would defend the new monarch to the
death
it was hardly to be expected that he would renounce for any long period
the dominion of his native land for the uneasy crown and barren soil of
palestine he had seen quite enough of his new subjects before he was six
months among them and more important interests called him home john of
brienne openly leagued with pope gregory against him was actually
employed in ravaging his territories at the head of a papal army this
intelligence decided his return as a preliminary step he made those who
had contemned his authority feel to their sorrow that he was their
master he then set sail loaded with the curses of palestine and thus
ended the seventh crusade which in spite of every obstacle and
disadvantage had been productive of more real service to the holy land
than any that had gone before a result solely attributable to the bravery
of frederic and the generosity of the sultan camhel
soon after the emperors departure a new claimant started for the throne
of jerusalem in the person of alice queen of cyprus and halfsister of
the mary who by her marriage had transferred her right to john of
brienne the grand military orders however clung to frederic and alice
was obliged to withdraw
so peaceful a termination to the crusade did not give unmixed pleasure in
europe the chivalry of france and england were unable to rest and long
before the conclusion of the truce were collecting their armies for an
eighth expedition in palestine also the contentment was far from
universal many petty mahomedan states in the immediate vicinity were not
parties to the truce and harassed the frontier towns incessantly the
templars ever turbulent waged bitter war with the sultan of aleppo and
in the end were almost exterminated so great was the slaughter among them
that europe resounded with the sad story of their fate and many a noble
knight took arms to prevent the total destruction of an order associated
with so many high and inspiring remembrances camhel seeing the
preparations that were making thought that his generosity had been
sufficiently shewn and the very day the truce was at an end assumed the
offensive and marching forward to jerusalem took possession of it after
routing the scanty forces of the christians before this intelligence
reached europe a large body of crusaders was on the march headed by the
king of navarre the duke of burgundy the count de bretagne and other
leaders on their arrival they learned that jerusalem had been taken but
that the sultan was dead and his kingdom torn by rival claimants to the
supreme power the dissensions of their foes ought to have made them
united but as in all previous crusades each feudal chief was master of
his own host and acted upon his own responsibility and without reference
to any general plan the consequence was that nothing could be done a
temporary advantage was gained by one leader who had no means of
improving it while another was defeated without means of retrieving
himself thus the war lingered till the battle of gaza when the king of
navarre was defeated with great loss and compelled to save himself from
total destruction by entering into a hard and oppressive treaty with the
emir of karac
at this crisis aid arrived from england commanded by richard earl of
cornwall the namesake of coeur de lion and inheritor of his valour his
army was strong and full of hope they had confidence in themselves and in
their leader and looked like men accustomed to victory their coming
changed the aspect of affairs the new sultan of egypt was at war with the
sultan of damascus and had not forces to oppose two enemies so powerful
he therefore sent messengers to meet the english earl offering an
exchange of prisoners and the complete cession of the holy land richard
who had not come to fight for the mere sake of fighting agreed at once to
terms so advantageous and became the deliverer of palestine without
striking a blow the sultan of egypt then turned his whole force against
his moslem enemies and the earl of cornwall returned to europe thus
ended the eighth crusade the most beneficial of all christendom had no
further pretence for sending her fierce levies to the east to all
appearance the holy wars were at an end the christians had entire
possession of jerusalem tripoli antioch edessa acre jaffa and in
fact of nearly all judea and could they have been at peace among
themselves they might have overcome without great difficulty the
jealousy and hostility of their neighbours a circumstance as unforeseen
as it was disastrous blasted this fair prospect and reillumed for the
last time the fervour and fury of the crusades
gengis khan and his successors had swept over asia like a tropical storm
overturning in their progress the landmarks of ages kingdom after kingdom
was cast down as they issued innumerable from the far recesses of the
north and east and among others the empire of korasmin was overrun by
these allconquering hordes the korasmins a fierce uncivilised race
thus driven from their homes spread themselves in their turn over the
south of asia with fire and sword in search of a restingplace in their
impetuous course they directed themselves towards egypt whose sultan
unable to withstand the swarm that had cast their longing eyes on the
fertile valleys of the nile endeavoured to turn them from their course
for this purpose he sent emissaries to barbaquan their leader inviting
them to settle in palestine and the offer being accepted by the wild
horde they entered the country before the christians received the
slightest intimation of their coming it was as sudden as it was
overwhelming onwards like the simoom they came burning and slaying
and were at the walls of jerusalem before the inhabitants had time to look
round them they spared neither life nor property they slew women and
children and priests at the altar and profaned even the graves of those
who had slept for ages they tore down every vestige of the christian
faith and committed horrors unparalleled in the history of warfare about
seven thousand of the inhabitants of jerusalem sought safety in retreat
but before they were out of sight the banner of the cross was hoisted
upon the walls by the savage foe to decoy them back the artifice was but
too successful the poor fugitives imagined that help had arrived from
another direction and turned back to regain their homes nearly the whole
of them were massacred and the streets of jerusalem ran with blood
illustration jaffa
the templars hospitallers and teutonic knights forgot their long and
bitter animosities and joined hand in hand to rout out this desolating
foe they entrenched themselves in jaffa with all the chivalry of
palestine that yet remained and endeavoured to engage the sultans of
emissa and damascus to assist them against the common enemy the aid
obtained from the moslems amounted at first to only four thousand men but
with these reinforcements walter of brienne the lord of jaffa resolved
to give battle to the korasmins the conflict was as deadly as despair on
the one side and unmitigated ferocity on the other could make it it
lasted with varying fortune for two days when the sultan of emissa fled
to his fortifications and walter of brienne fell into the enemys hands
the brave knight was suspended by the arms to a cross in sight of the
walls of jaffa and the korasminian leader declared that he should remain
in that position until the city surrendered walter raised his feeble
voice not to advise surrender but to command his soldiers to hold out to
the last but his gallantry was unavailing so great had been the
slaughter that out of the grand array of knights there now remained but
sixteen hospitallers thirtythree templars and three teutonic cavaliers
these with the sad remnant of the army fled to acre and the korasmins
were masters of palestine
the sultans of syria preferred the christians to this fierce horde for
their neighbours even the sultan of egypt began to regret the aid he had
given to such barbarous foes and united with those of emissa and damascus
to root them from the land the korasmins amounted to but twenty thousand
men and were unable to resist the determined hostility which encompassed
them on every side the sultans defeated them in several engagements and
the peasantry rose up in masses to take vengeance upon them gradually
their numbers were diminished no mercy was shewn them in defeat
barbaquan their leader was slain and after five years of desperate
struggles they were finally extirpated and palestine became once more
the territory of the mussulmans
illustration william longsword
a short time previous to this devastating eruption louis ix fell sick in
paris and dreamed in the delirium of his fever that he saw the christian
and moslem host fighting before jerusalem and the christians defeated
with great slaughter the dream made a great impression on his
superstitious mind and he made a solemn vow that if ever he recovered
his health he would take a pilgrimage to the holy land when the news of
the misfortunes of palestine and the awful massacres at jerusalem and
jaffa arrived in europe st louis remembered him of his dream more
persuaded than ever that it was an intimation direct from heaven he
prepared to take the cross at the head of his armies and march to the
deliverance of the holy sepulchre from that moment he doffed the royal
mantle of purple and ermine and dressed in the sober serge becoming a
pilgrim all his thoughts were directed to the fulfilment of his design
and although his kingdom could but ill spare him he made every
preparation to leave it pope innocent iv applauded his zeal and afforded
him every assistance he wrote to henry iii of england to forward the
cause in his dominions and called upon the clergy and laity all over
europe to contribute towards it william longsword the celebrated earl of
salisbury took the cross at the head of a great number of valiant knights
and soldiers but the fanaticism of the people was not to be awakened
either in france or england great armies were raised but the masses no
longer sympathised taxation had been the great cooler of zeal it was no
longer a disgrace even to a knight if he refused to take the cross
rutebeuf a french minstrel who flourished about this time 1250
composed a dialogue between a crusader and a noncrusader which the
reader will find translated in ways fabliaux the crusader uses every
argument to persuade the noncrusader to take up arms and forsake every
thing in the holy cause but it is evident from the greater force of the
arguments used by the noncrusader that he was the favourite of the
minstrel to a most urgent solicitation of his friend the crusader he
replies
   i read thee right thou holdest good
      to this same land i straight should hie
    and win it back with mickle blood
      nor gaine one foot of soil thereby
    while here dejected and forlorn
      my wife and babes are left to mourn
    my goodly mansion rudely marred
      all trusted to my dogs to guard
    but i fair comrade well i wot
      an ancient saw of pregnant wit
    doth bid us keep what we have got
      and troth i mean to follow it
this being the general feeling it is not to be wondered at that louis ix
was occupied fully three years in organising his forces and in making the
necessary preparations for his departure when all was ready he set sail
for cyprus accompanied by his queen his two brothers the counts danjou
and dartois and a long train of the noblest chivalry of france his
third brother the count de poitiers remained behind to collect another
corps of crusaders and followed him in a few months afterwards the army
united at cyprus and amounted to fifty thousand men exclusive of the
english crusaders under william longsword again a pestilential disease
made its appearance to which many hundreds fell victims it was in
consequence found necessary to remain in cyprus until the spring louis
then embarked for egypt with his whole host but a violent tempest
separated his fleet and he arrived before damietta with only a few
thousand men they were however impetuous and full of hope and although
the sultan melick shah was drawn up on the shore with a force infinitely
superior it was resolved to attempt a landing without waiting the arrival
of the rest of the army louis himself in wild impatience sprang from
his boat and waded on shore while his army inspired by his enthusiastic
bravery followed shouting the old warcry of the first crusaders dieu
le veut dieu le veut a panic seized the turks a body of their cavalry
attempted to bear down upon the crusaders but the knights fixed their
large shields deep in the sands of the shore and rested their lances upon
them so that they projected above and formed a barrier so imposing that
the turks afraid to breast it turned round and fairly took to flight at
the moment of this panic a false report was spread in the saracen host
that the sultan had been slain the confusion immediately became
generalthe deroute was complete damietta itself was abandoned and
the same night the victorious crusaders fixed their headquarters in that
city the soldiers who had been separated from their chief by the tempest
arrived shortly afterwards and louis was in a position to justify the
hope not only of the conquest of palestine but of egypt itself
but too much confidence proved the bane of his army they thought as they
had accomplished so much that nothing more remained to be done and gave
themselves up to ease and luxury when by the command of louis they
marched towards cairo they were no longer the same men success instead
of inspiring had unnerved them debauchery had brought on disease and
disease was aggravated by the heat of a climate to which none of them were
accustomed their progress towards massoura on the road to cairo was
checked by the thanisian canal on the banks of which the saracens were
drawn up to dispute the passage louis gave orders that a bridge should be
thrown across and the operations commenced under cover of two
catcastles or high movable towers the saracens soon destroyed them by
throwing quantities of greek fire the artillery of that day upon them
and louis was forced to think of some other means of effecting his design
a peasant agreed for a considerable bribe to point out a ford where the
army might wade across and the count dartois was despatched with
fourteen hundred men to attempt it while louis remained to face the
saracens with the main body of the army the count dartois got safely
over and defeated the detachment that had been sent to oppose his
landing flushed with the victory the brave count forgot the inferiority
of his numbers and pursued the panicstricken enemy into massoura he was
now completely cut off from the aid of his brother crusaders which the
moslems perceiving took courage and returned upon him with a force
swollen by the garrison of massoura and by reinforcements from the
surrounding districts the battle now became hand to hand the christians
fought with the energy of desperate men but the continually increasing
numbers of the foe surrounded them completely and cut off all hope
either of victory or escape the count dartois was among the foremost of
the slain and when louis arrived to the rescue the brave advancedguard
was nearly cut to pieces of the fourteen hundred but three hundred
remained the fury of the battle was now increased threefold the french
king and his troops performed prodigies of valour and the saracens under
the command of the emir ceccidun fought as if they were determined to
exterminate in one last decisive effort the new european swarm that had
settled upon their coast at the fall of the evening dews the christians
were masters of the field of massoura and flattered themselves that they
were the victors selflove would not suffer them to confess that the
saracens had withdrawn and not retreated but their leaders were too
wofully convinced that that fatal field had completed the disorganisation
of the christian army and that all hopes of future conquest were at an
end
impressed with this truth the crusaders sued for peace the sultan
insisted upon the immediate evacuation of damietta and that louis himself
should be delivered as hostage for the fulfilment of the condition his
army at once refused and the negotiations were broken off it was now
resolved to attempt a retreat but the agile saracens now in the front
and now in the rear rendered it a matter of extreme difficulty and cut
off the stragglers in great numbers hundreds of them were drowned in the
nile and sickness and famine worked sad ravages upon those who escaped
all other casualties louis himself was so weakened by disease fatigue
and discouragement that he was hardly able to sit upon his horse in the
confusion of the flight he was separated from his attendants and left a
total stranger upon the sands of egypt sick weary and almost
friendless one knight geffry de sergines alone attended him and led
him to a miserable hut in a small village where for several days he lay
in the hourly expectation of death he was at last discovered and taken
prisoner by the saracens who treated him with all the honour due to his
rank and all the pity due to his misfortunes under their care his health
rapidly improved and the next consideration was that of his ransom
the saracens demanded besides money the cession of acre tripoli and
other cities of palestine louis unhesitatingly refused and conducted
himself with so much pride and courage that the sultan declared he was the
proudest infidel he had ever beheld after a good deal of haggling the
sultan agreed to waive these conditions and a treaty was finally
concluded the city of damietta was restored a truce of ten years agreed
upon and ten thousand golden bezants paid for the release of louis and
the liberation of all the captives louis then withdrew to jaffa and
spent two years in putting that city and cesarea with the other
possessions of the christians in palestine into a proper state of
defence he then returned to his own country with great reputation as a
saint but very little as a soldier
matthew paris informs us that in the year 1250 while louis was in egypt
thousands of the english were resolved to go to the holy war had not the
king strictly guarded his ports and kept his people from running out of
doors when the news arrived of the reverses and captivity of the french
king their ardour cooled and the crusade was sung of only but not
spoken of
in france a very different feeling was the result the news of the kings
capture spread consternation through the country a fanatic monk of
citeaux suddenly appeared in the villages preaching to the people and
announcing that the holy virgin accompanied by a whole army of saints and
martyrs had appeared to him and commanded him to stir up the shepherds
and farmlabourers to the defence of the cross to them only was his
discourse addressed and his eloquence was such that thousands flocked
around him ready to follow wherever he should lead the pastures and the
cornfields were deserted and the shepherds or pastoureaux as they
were termed became at last so numerous as to amount to upwards of fifty
thousandmillot says one hundred thousand men20 the queen blanche
who governed as regent during the absence of the king encouraged at first
the armies of the pastoureaux but they soon gave way to such vile
excesses that the peaceably disposed were driven to resistance robbery
murder and violation marked their path and all good men assisted by the
government united in putting them down they were finally dispersed but
not before three thousand of them had been massacred many authors say
that the slaughter was still greater

the ten years truce concluded in 1264 and st louis was urged by two
powerful motives to undertake a second expedition for the relief of
palestine these were fanaticism on the one hand and a desire of
retrieving his military fame on the other which had suffered more than
his parasites liked to remind him of the pope of course encouraged his
design and once more the chivalry of europe began to bestir themselves
in 1268 edward the heir of the english monarchy announced his
determination to join the crusade and the pope clement iv wrote to the
prelates and clergy to aid the cause by their persuasions and their
revenues in england they agreed to contribute a tenth of their
possessions and by a parliamentary order a twentieth was taken from the
corn and movables of all the laity at michaelmas
in spite of the remonstrances of the few clearheaded statesmen who
surrounded him urging the ruin that might in consequence fall upon his
then prosperous kingdom louis made every preparation for his departure
the warlike nobility were nothing loath and in the spring of 1270 the
king set sail with an army of sixty thousand men he was driven by stress
of weather into sardinia and while there a change in his plans took
place instead of proceeding to acre as he originally intended he shaped
his course for tunis on the african coast the king of tunis had some
time previously expressed himself favourably disposed towards the
christians and their religion and louis it appears had hopes of
converting him and securing his aid against the sultan of egypt what
honour would be mine he used to say if i could become godfather to
this mussulman king filled with this idea he landed in africa near the
site of the city of carthage but found that he had reckoned without his
host the king of tunis had no thoughts of renouncing his religion nor
intention of aiding the crusaders in any way on the contrary he opposed
their landing with all the forces that could be collected on so sudden an
emergency the french however made good their first position and
defeated the moslems with considerable loss they also gained some
advantage over the reinforcements that were sent to oppose them but an
infectious flux appeared in the army and put a stop to all future
victories the soldiers died at the rate of a hundred in a day the enemy
at the same time made as great havoc as the plague st louis himself was
one of the first attacked by the disease his constitution had been
weakened by fatigues and even before he left france he was unable to bear
the full weight of his armour it was soon evident to his sorrowing
soldiers that their beloved monarch could not long survive he lingered
for some days and died in carthage in the fiftysixth year of his age
deeply regretted by his army and his subjects and leaving behind him one
of the most singular reputations in history he is the modelking of
ecclesiastical writers in whose eyes his very defects became virtues
because they were manifested in furtherance of their cause more
unprejudiced historians while they condemn his fanaticism admit that he
was endowed with many high and rare qualities that he was in no one point
behind his age and in many in advance of it
his brother charles of anjou in consequence of a revolution in sicily
had become king of that country before he heard of the death of louis he
had sailed from messina with large reinforcements on his landing near
carthage he advanced at the head of his army amid the martial music of
drums and trumpets he was soon informed how inopportune was his
rejoicing and shed tears before his whole army such as no warrior would
have been ashamed to shed a peace was speedily agreed upon with the king
of tunis and the armies of france and sicily returned to their homes
illustration seal of edward i
so little favour had the crusade found in england that even the exertions
of the heir to the throne had only collected a small force of fifteen
hundred men with these few prince edward sailed from dover to bourdeaux
in the expectation that he would find the french king in that city st
louis however had left a few weeks previously upon which edward
followed him to sardinia and afterwards to tunis before his arrival in
africa st louis was no more and peace had been concluded between france
and tunis he determined however not to relinquish the crusade
returning to sicily he passed the winter in that country and endeavoured
to augment his little army in the spring he set sail for palestine and
arrived in safety at acre the christians were torn as usual by mutual
jealousies and animosities the two great military orders were as virulent
and as intractable as ever opposed to each other and to all the world
the arrival of edward had the effect of causing them to lay aside their
unworthy contention and of uniting heart to heart in one last effort for
the deliverance of their adopted country a force of six thousand
effective warriors was soon formed to join those of the english prince
and preparations were made for the renewal of hostilities the sultan
bibars or bendocdar21 a fierce mamluke who had been placed on the
throne by a bloody revolution was at war with all his neighbours and
unable for that reason to concentrate his whole strength against them
edward took advantage of this and marching boldly forward to nazareth
defeated the turks and gained possession of that city this was the whole
amount of his successes the hot weather engendered disease among his
troops and he himself the life and soul of the expedition fell sick
among the first he had been ill for some time and was slowly recovering
when a messenger desired to speak with him on important matters and to
deliver some despatches into his own hand while the prince was occupied
in examining them the traitorous messenger drew a dagger from his belt
and stabbed him in the breast the wound fortunately was not deep and
edward had regained a portion of his strength he struggled with the
assassin and put him to death with his own dagger at the same time
calling loudly for assistance22 his attendants came at his call and
found him bleeding profusely and ascertained on inspection that the
dagger was poisoned means were instantly taken to purify the wound and
an antidote was sent by the grand master of the templars which removed all
danger from the effects of the poison camden in his history has adopted
the more popular and certainly more beautiful version of this story
which says that the princess eleonora in her love for her gallant
husband sucked the poison from his wound at the risk of her own life to
use the words of old fuller it is a pity so pretty a story should not be
true and that so sovereign a remedy as a womans tongue anointed with
the virtue of loving affection should not have performed the good deed

    22 the reader will recognise the incident which sir walter scott
         has introduced into his beautiful romance the talisman
         and which with the license claimed by poets and romancers
         he represents as having befallen king richard i
edward suspected and doubtless not without reason that the assassin was
employed by the sultan of egypt but it amounted to suspicion only and by
the sudden death of the assassin the principal clue to the discovery of
the truth was lost for ever edward on his recovery prepared to resume
the offensive but the sultan embarrassed by the defence of interests
which for the time being he considered of more importance made offers
of peace to the crusaders this proof of weakness on the part of the enemy
was calculated to render a man of edwards temperament more anxious to
prosecute the war but he had also other interests to defend news arrived
in palestine of the death of his father king henry iii and his presence
being necessary in england he agreed to the terms of the sultan these
were that the christians should be allowed to retain their possessions in
the holy land and that a truce of ten years should be proclaimed edward
then set sail for england and thus ended the last crusade
the afterfate of the holy land may be told in a few words the
christians unmindful of their past sufferings and of the jealous
neighbours they had to deal with first broke the truce by plundering some
egyptian traders near margat the sultan immediately revenged the outrage
by taking possession of margat and war once more raged between the
nations margat made a gallant defence but no reinforcements arrived from
europe to prevent its fall tripoli was the next and other cities in
succession until at last acre was the only city of palestine that
remained in possession of the christians

the grand master of the templars collected together his small and devoted
band and with the trifling aid afforded by the king of cyprus prepared
to defend to the death the last possession of his order europe was deaf
to his cry for aid the numbers of the foe were overwhelming and devoted
bravery was of no avail in that disastrous siege the christians were all
but exterminated the king of cyprus fled when he saw that resistance was
vain and the grand master fell at the head of his knights pierced with a
hundred wounds seven templars and as many hospitallers alone escaped
from the dreadful carnage the victorious moslems then set fire to the
city and the rule of the christians in palestine was brought to a close
for ever
this intelligence spread alarm and sorrow among the clergy of europe who
endeavoured to rouse once more the energy and enthusiasm of the nations in
the cause of the holy land but the popular mania had run its career the
spark of zeal had burned its appointed time and was never again to be
reillumined here and there a solitary knight announced his determination
to take up arms and now and then a king gave cold encouragement to the
scheme but it dropped almost as soon as spoken of to be renewed again
still more feebly at some longer interval
now what was the grand result of all these struggles europe expended
millions of her treasures and the blood of two millions of her children
and a handful of quarrelsome knights retained possession of palestine for
about one hundred years even had christendom retained it to this day the
advantage if confined to that would have been too dearly purchased but
notwithstanding the fanaticism that originated and the folly that
conducted them the crusades were not productive of unmitigated evil the
feudal chiefs became better members of society by coming in contact in
asia with a civilisation superior to their own the people secured some
small instalments of their rights kings no longer at war with their
nobility had time to pass some good laws the human mind learned some
little wisdom from hard experience and casting off the slough of
superstition in which the roman clergy had so long enveloped it became
prepared to receive the seeds of the approaching reformation thus did the
allwise disposer of events bring good out of evil and advance the
civilisation and ultimate happiness of the nations of the west by means of
the very fanaticism that had led them against the east but the whole
subject is one of absorbing interest and if carried fully out in all its
bearings would consume more space than the plan of this work will allow
the philosophic student will draw his own conclusions and he can have no
better field for the exercise of his powers than this european
madnessits advantages and disadvantages its causes and results

the belief that disembodied spirits may be permitted to revisit this world
has its foundation upon that sublime hope of immortality which is at once
the chief solace and greatest triumph of our reason even if revelation
did not teach us we feel that we have that within us which shall never
die and all our experience of this life but makes us cling the more
fondly to that one repaying hope but in the early days of little
knowledge this grand belief became the source of a whole train of
superstitions which in their turn became the fount from whence flowed a
deluge of blood and horror europe for a period of two centuries and a
half brooded upon the idea not only that parted spirits walked the earth
to meddle in the affairs of men but that men had power to summon evil
spirits to their aid to work woe upon their fellows an epidemic terror
seized upon the nations no man thought himself secure either in his
person or possessions from the machinations of the devil and his agents
every calamity that befell him he attributed to a witch if a storm arose
and blew down his barn it was witchcraft if his cattle died of a
murrainif disease fastened upon his limbs or death entered suddenly and
snatched a beloved face from his hearththey were not visitations of
providence but the works of some neighbouring hag whose wretchedness or
insanity caused the ignorant to raise their finger and point at her as a
witch the word was upon every bodys tongue france italy germany
england scotland and the far north successively ran mad upon this
subject and for a long series of years furnished their tribunals with so
many trials for witchcraft that other crimes were seldom or never spoken
of thousands upon thousands of unhappy persons fell victims to this cruel
and absurd delusion in many cities of germany as will be shewn more
fully in its due place hereafter the average number of executions for
this pretended crime was six hundred annually or two every day if we
leave out the sundays when it is to be supposed that even this madness
refrained from its work
a misunderstanding of the famous text of the mosaic law thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live no doubt led many conscientious men astray whose
superstition warm enough before wanted but a little corroboration to
blaze out with desolating fury in all ages of the world men have tried to
hold converse with superior beings and to pierce by their means the
secrets of futurity in the time of moses it is evident that there were
impostors who trafficked upon the credulity of mankind and insulted the
supreme majesty of the true god by pretending to the power of divination
hence the law which moses by divine command promulgated against these
criminals but it did not follow as the superstitious monomaniacs of the
middle ages imagined that the bible established the existence of the
power of divination by its edicts against those who pretended to it from
the best authorities it appears that the hebrew word which has been
rendered venefica and witch means a poisoner and divineress a
dabbler in spells or fortuneteller the modern witch was a very
different character and joined to her pretended power of foretelling
future events that of working evil upon the life limbs and possessions
of mankind this power was only to be acquired by an express compact
signed in blood with the devil himself by which the wizard or witch
renounced baptism and sold his or her immortal soul to the evil one
without any saving clause of redemption
there are so many wondrous appearances in nature for which science and
philosophy cannot even now account that it is not surprising that when
natural laws were still less understood men should have attributed to
supernatural agency every appearance which they could not otherwise
explain the merest tyro now understands various phenomena which the
wisest of old could not fathom the schoolboy knows why upon high
mountains there should on certain occasions appear three or four suns in
the firmament at once and why the figure of a traveller upon one eminence
should be reproduced inverted and of a gigantic stature upon another we
all know the strange pranks which imagination can play in certain
diseases that the hypochondriac can see visions and spectres and that
there have been cases in which men were perfectly persuaded that they were
teapots science has lifted up the veil and rolled away all the fantastic
horrors in which our forefathers shrouded these and similar cases the man
who now imagines himself a wolf is sent to the hospital instead of to the
stake as in the days of the witch mania and earth air and sea are
unpeopled of the grotesque spirits that were once believed to haunt them
before entering further into the history of witchcraft it may be as well
if we consider the absurd impersonation of the evil principle formed by
the monks in their legends we must make acquaintance with the primum
mobile and understand what sort of a personage it was who gave the
witches in exchange for their souls the power to torment their
fellowcreatures the popular notion of the devil was that he was a
large illformed hairy sprite with horns a long tail cloven feet and
dragons wings in this shape he was constantly brought on the stage by
the monks in their early miracles and mysteries in these
representations he was an important personage and answered the purpose of
the clown in the modern pantomime the great fun for the people was to see
him well belaboured by the saints with clubs or cudgels and to hear him
howl with pain as he limped off maimed by the blow of some vigorous
anchorite st dunstan generally served him the glorious trick for which
he is renowned catching hold of his nose with a pair of redhot pincers
till
   rocks and distant dells resounded with his cries
some of the saints spat in his face to his very great annoyance and
others chopped pieces off of his tail which however always grew on
again this was paying him in his own coin and amused the populace
mightily for they all remembered the scurvy tricks he had played them and
their forefathers it was believed that he endeavoured to trip people up
by laying his long invisible tail in their way and giving it a sudden
whisk when their legs were over itthat he used to get drunk and swear
like a trooper and be so mischievous in his cups as to raise tempests and
earthquakes to destroy the fruits of the earth and the barns and
homesteads of true believersthat he used to run invisible spits into
people by way of amusing himself in the long winter evenings and to
proceed to taverns and regale himself with the best offering in payment
pieces of gold which on the dawn of the following morning invariably
turned into slates sometimes disguised as a large drake he used to lurk
among the bulrushes and frighten the weary traveller out of his wits by
his awful quack the reader will remember the lines of burns in his
address to the deil which so well express the popular notion on this
point
   ae dreary windy winter night
    the stars shot down wi sklentin light
    wi you mysel i got a fright
            ayont the lough
    ye like a rashbush stood in sight
            wi waving sough
    the cudgel in my nieve did shake
    each bristled hair stood like a stake
    when wi an eldritch stour quaick quaick
            among the springs
    awa ye squattered like a drake
            on whistling wings
in all the stories circulated and believed about him he was represented
as an ugly petty mischievous spirit who rejoiced in playing off all
manner of fantastic tricks upon poor humanity milton seems to have been
the first who succeeded in giving any but a ludicrous description of him
the sublime pride which is the quintessence of evil was unconceived
before his time all other limners made him merely grotesque but milton
made him awful in this the monks shewed themselves but miserable
romancers for their object undoubtedly was to represent the fiend as
terrible as possible but there was nothing grand about their satan on
the contrary he was a low mean devil whom it was easy to circumvent
and fine fun to play tricks with but as is well and eloquently remarked
by a modern writer23 the subject has also its serious side an indian
deity with its wild distorted shape and grotesque attitude appears
merely ridiculous when separated from its accessories and viewed by
daylight in a museum but restore it to the darkness of its own hideous
temple bring back to our recollection the victims that have bled upon its
altar or been crushed beneath its car and our sense of the ridiculous
subsides into aversion and horror so while the superstitious dreams of
former times are regarded as mere speculative insanities we may be for a
moment amused with the wild incoherencies of the patients but when we
reflect that out of these hideous misconceptions of the principle of evil
arose the belief in witchcraftthat this was no dead faith but one
operating on the whole being of society urging on the wisest and the
mildest to deeds of murder or cruelties scarcely less than murderthat
the learned and the beautiful young and old male and female were
devoted by its influence to the stake and the scaffoldevery feeling
disappears except that of astonishment that such things could be and
humiliation at the thought that the delusion was as lasting as it was
universal
    23 see article on demonology in the sixth volume of the
         foreign quarterly review
besides this chief personage there was an infinite number of inferior
demons who played conspicuous parts in the creed of witchcraft the pages
of bekker leloyer bodin delrio and de lancre abound with descriptions
of the qualities of these imps and the functions which were assigned
them from these authorsthree of whom were commissioners for the trial
of witches and who wrote from the confessions made by the supposed
criminals and the evidence delivered against themand from the more
recent work of m jules garinet the following summary of the creed has
been with great pains extracted the student who is desirous of knowing
more is referred to the works in question he will find enough in every
leaf to make his blood curdle with shame and horror but the purity of
these pages shall not be soiled by any thing so ineffably humiliating and
disgusting as a complete exposition of them what is here culled will be a
sufficient sample of the popular belief and the reader would but lose
time who should seek in the writings of the demonologists for more ample
details he will gain nothing by lifting the veil which covers their
unutterable obscenities unless like sterne he wishes to gather fresh
evidence of what a beast man is in that case he will find plenty there
to convince him that the beast would be libelled by the comparison
it was thought that the earth swarmed with millions of demons of both
sexes many of whom like the human race traced their lineage up to adam
who after the fall was led astray by devils assuming the forms of
beautiful women to deceive him these demons increased and multiplied
among themselves with the most extraordinary rapidity their bodies were
of the thin air and they could pass through the hardest substances with
the greatest ease they had no fixed residence or abiding place but were
tossed to and fro in the immensity of space when thrown together in great
multitudes they excited whirlwinds in the air and tempests in the waters
and took delight in destroying the beauty of nature and the monuments of
the industry of man although they increased among themselves like
ordinary creatures their numbers were daily augmented by the souls of
wicked men of children stillborn of women who died in childbed and of
persons killed in duels the whole air was supposed to be full of them
and many unfortunate men and women drew them by thousands into their
mouths and nostrils at every inspiration and the demons lodging in their
bowels or other parts of their bodies tormented them with pains and
diseases of every kind and sent them frightful dreams st gregory of
nice relates a story of a nun who forgot to say her benedicite and make
the sign of the cross before she sat down to supper and who in
consequence swallowed a demon concealed among the leaves of a lettuce
most persons said the number of these demons was so great that they could
not be counted but wierus asserted that they amounted to no more than
seven millions four hundred and five thousand nine hundred and twentysix
and that they were divided into seventytwo companies or battalions to
each of which there was a prince or captain they could assume any shape
they pleased when they were male they were called incubi and when
female succubi they sometimes made themselves hideous and at other
times they assumed shapes of such transcendent loveliness that mortal
eyes never saw beauty to compete with theirs
although the devil and his legions could appear to mankind at any time it
was generally understood that he preferred the night between friday and
saturday if satan himself appeared in human shape he was never perfectly
and in all respects like a man he was either too black or too white too
large or too small or some of his limbs were out of proportion to the
rest of his body most commonly his feet were deformed and he was obliged
to curl up and conceal his tail in some part of his habiliments for take
what shape he would he could not get rid of that encumbrance he
sometimes changed himself into a tree or a river and upon one occasion he
transformed himself into a barrister as we learn from wierus book iv
chapter 9 in the reign of philippe le bel he appeared to a monk in the
shape of a dark man riding a tall black horse then as a friar afterwards
as an ass and finally as a coachwheel instances are not rare in which
both he and his inferior demons have taken the form of handsome young men
and successfully concealing their tails have married beautiful young
women who have had children by them such children were easily
recognisable by their continual shrieking by their requiring five nurses
to suckle them and by their never growing fat
all these demons were at the command of any individual who would give up
his immortal soul to the prince of evil for the privilege of enjoying
their services for a stated period the wizard or witch could send them to
execute the most difficult missions whatever the witch commanded was
performed except it was a good action in which case the order was
disobeyed and evil worked upon herself instead
at intervals according to the pleasure of satan there was a general
meeting of the demons and all the witches this meeting was called the
sabbath from its taking place on the saturday or immediately after
midnight on fridays these sabbaths were sometimes held for one district
sometimes for another and once at least every year it was held on the
brocken or among other high mountains as a general sabbath of the fiends
for the whole of christendom
the devil generally chose a place where four roads met as the scene of
this assembly or if that was not convenient the neighbourhood of a lake
upon this spot nothing would ever afterwards grow as the hot feet of the
demons and witches burnt the principle of fecundity from the earth and
rendered it barren for ever when orders had been once issued for the
meeting of the sabbath all the wizards and witches who failed to attend
it were lashed by demons with a rod made of serpents or scorpions as a
punishment for their inattention or want of punctuality
in france and england the witches were supposed to ride uniformly upon
broomsticks but in italy and spain the devil himself in the shape of a
goat used to transport them on his back which lengthened or shortened
according to the number of witches he was desirous of accommodating no
witch when proceeding to the sabbath could get out by a door or window
were she to try ever so much their general mode of ingress was by the
keyhole and of egress by the chimney up which they flew broom and all
with the greatest ease to prevent the absence of the witches from being
noticed by their neighbours some inferior demon was commanded to assume
their shapes and lie in their beds feigning illness until the sabbath
was over
when all the wizards and witches had arrived at the place of rendezvous
the infernal ceremonies of the sabbath began satan having assumed his
favourite shape of a large hegoat with a face in front and another in
his haunches took his seat upon a throne and all present in succession
paid their respects to him and kissed him in his face behind this done
he appointed a master of the ceremonies in company with whom he made a
personal examination of all the wizards and witches to see whether they
had the secret mark about them by which they were stamped as the devils
own this mark was always insensible to pain those who had not yet been
marked received the mark from the master of the ceremonies the devil at
the same time bestowing nicknames upon them this done they all began to
sing and dance in the most furious manner until some one arrived who was
anxious to be admitted into their society they were then silent for a
while until the newcomer had denied his salvation kissed the devil
spat upon the bible and sworn obedience to him in all things they then
began dancing again with all their might and singing these words
   alegremos alegremos
    que gente va tenemos
in the course of an hour or two they generally became wearied of this
violent exercise and then they all sat down and recounted the evil deeds
they had done since their last meeting those who had not been malicious
and mischievous enough towards their fellowcreatures received personal
chastisement from satan himself who flogged them with thorns or scorpions
till they were covered with blood and unable to sit or stand
when this ceremony was concluded they were all amused by a dance of
toads thousands of these creatures sprang out of the earth and standing
on their hind legs danced while the devil played the bagpipes or the
trumpet these toads were all endowed with the faculty of speech and
entreated the witches to reward them with the flesh of unbaptised babes
for their exertions to give them pleasure the witches promised
compliance the devil bade them remember to keep their word and then
stamping his foot caused all the toads to sink into the earth in an
instant the place being thus cleared preparation was made for the
banquet where all manner of disgusting things were served up and greedily
devoured by the demons and witches although the latter were sometimes
regaled with choice meats and expensive wines from golden plates and
crystal goblets but they were never thus favoured unless they had done an
extraordinary number of evil deeds since the last period of meeting
after the feast they began dancing again but such as had no relish for
any more exercise in that way amused themselves by mocking the holy
sacrament of baptism for this purpose the toads were again called up
and sprinkled with filthy water the devil making the sign of the cross
and all the witches calling out in nomine patric aragueaco petrica
agora agora valentia jouando goure gaits goustia which meant in
the name of patrick petrick of aragon now now all our ills are over
when the devil wished to be particularly amused he made the witches strip
off their clothes and dance before him each with a cat tied round her
neck and another dangling from her body in form of a tail when the cock
crew they all disappeared and the sabbath was ended
this is a summary of the belief which prevailed for many centuries nearly
all over europe and which is far from eradicated even at this day it was
varied in some respects in several countries but the main points were the
same in france germany great britain italy spain and the far north of
europe
the early annals of france abound with stories of supposed sorcery but it
was not until the time of charlemagne that the crime acquired any great
importance this monarch says m jules garinet24 had several times
given orders that all necromancers astrologers and witches should be
driven from his states but as the number of criminals augmented daily he
found it necessary at last to resort to severer measures in consequence
he published several edicts which may be found at length in the
capitulaire de baluse by these every sort of magic enchantment and
witchcraft was forbidden and the punishment of death decreed against
those who in any way evoked the devil compounded lovephilters afflicted
either man or woman with barrenness troubled the atmosphere excited
tempests destroyed the fruits of the earth dried up the milk of cows or
tormented their fellowcreatures with sores and diseases all persons
found guilty of exercising these execrable arts were to be executed
immediately upon conviction that the earth might be rid of the burden and
curse of their presence and those even who consulted them might also be
punished with death25

         in his literary history of italy and some other critics
         have objected to tassos poem that he has attributed to the
         crusaders a belief in magic which did not exist at that
         time if these critics had referred to the edicts of
         charlemagne they would have seen that tasso was right and
         that a disposition too eager to spy out imperfections in a
         great work was leading themselves into error
after this time prosecutions for witchcraft are continually mentioned
especially by the french historians it was a crime imputed
with so much ease and repelled with so much difficulty that the
powerful whenever they wanted to ruin the weak and could fix no
other imputation upon them had only to accuse them of witchcraft
to ensure their destruction instances in which this crime was made
the pretext for the most violent persecution both of individuals and
of communities whose real offences were purely political or religious
must be familiar to every reader the extermination of the stedinger
in 1234 of the templars from 1307 to 1313 the execution of joan
of arc in 1429 and the unhappy scenes of arras in 1459 are the
most prominent the first of these is perhaps the least known but
is not among the least remarkable the following account from dr
kortms interesting history26 of the republican confederacies of the
middle ages will shew the horrible convenience of imputations of
witchcraft when royal or priestly wolves wanted a pretext for a quarrel

the frieslanders inhabiting the district from the weser to the zuydersee
had long been celebrated for their attachment to freedom and their
successful struggles in its defence as early as the eleventh century they
had formed a general confederacy against the encroachments of the normans
and the saxons which was divided into seven seelands holding annually
a diet under a large oaktree at aurich near the upstalboom here they
managed their own affairs without the control of the clergy and ambitious
nobles who surrounded them to the great scandal of the latter they
already had true notions of a representative government the deputies of
the people levied the necessary taxes deliberated on the affairs of the
community and performed in their simple and patriarchal manner nearly
all the functions of the representative assemblies of the present day
finally the archbishop of bremen together with the count of oldenburg
and other neighbouring potentates formed a league against that section of
the frieslanders known by the name of the stedinger and succeeded after
harassing them and sowing dissensions among them for many years in
bringing them under the yoke but the stedinger devotedly attached to
their ancient laws by which they had attained a degree of civil and
religious liberty very uncommon in that age did not submit without a
violent struggle they arose in insurrection in the year 1204 in defence
of the ancient customs of their country refused to pay taxes to the
feudal chiefs or tithes to the clergywho had forced themselves into
their peaceful retreatsand drove out many of their oppressors for a
period of eightandtwenty years the brave stedinger continued the
struggle singlehanded against the forces of the archbishops of bremen and
the counts of oldenburg and destroyed in the year 1232 the strong
castle of slutterberg near delmenhorst built by the latter nobleman as a
position from which he could send out his marauders to plunder and destroy
the possessions of the peasantry
the invincible courage of these poor people proving too strong for their
oppressors to cope with by the ordinary means of warfare the archbishop
of bremen applied to pope gregory ix for his spiritual aid against them
that prelate entered cordially into the cause and launching forth his
anathema against the stedinger as heretics and witches encouraged all
true believers to assist in their extermination a large body of thieves
and fanatics broke into their country in the year 1233 killing and
burning wherever they went and not sparing either women or children the
sick or the aged in their rage the stedinger however rallied in great
force routed their invaders and killed in battle their leader count
burckhardt of oldenburg with many inferior chieftains
again the pope was applied to and a crusade against the stedinger was
preached in all that part of germany the pope wrote to all the bishops
and leaders of the faithful an exhortation to arm to root out from the
land those abominable witches and wizards the stedinger said his
holiness seduced by the devil have abjured all the laws of god and man
slandered the church insulted the holy sacraments consulted witches to
raise evil spirits shed blood like water taken the lives of priests and
concocted an infernal scheme to propagate the worship of the devil whom
they adore under the name of asmodi the devil appears to them in
different shapessometimes as a goose or a duck and at others in the
figure of a pale blackeyed youth with a melancholy aspect whose embrace
fills their hearts with eternal hatred against the holy church of christ
this devil presides at their sabbaths when they all kiss him and dance
around him he then envelopes them in total darkness and they all male
and female give themselves up to the grossest and most disgusting
debauchery
in consequence of these letters of the pope the emperor of germany
frederic ii also pronounced his ban against them the bishops of
ratzebourg lubeck osnabrck munster and minden took up arms to
exterminate them aided by the duke of brabant the counts of holland of
clves of the mark of oldenburg of egmond of diest and many other
powerful nobles an army of forty thousand men was soon collected which
marched under the command of the duke of brabant into the country of the
stedinger the latter mustered vigorously in defence of their lives and
liberties but could raise no greater force including every man capable
of bearing arms than eleven thousand men to cope against the overwhelming
numbers of their foe they fought with the energy of despair but all in
vain eight thousand of them were slain on the field of battle the whole
race was exterminated and the enraged conquerors scoured the country in
all directions slew the women and children and old men drove away the
cattle fired the woods and cottages and made a total waste of the land

just as absurd and effectual was the charge brought against the templars
in 1307 when they had rendered themselves obnoxious to the potentates and
prelacy of christendom their wealth their power their pride and their
insolence had raised up enemies on every side and every sort of
accusation was made against them but failed to work their overthrow
until the terrible cry of witchcraft was let loose upon them this
effected its object and the templars were extirpated they were accused
of having sold their souls to the devil and of celebrating all the
infernal mysteries of the witches sabbath it was pretended that when
they admitted a novice into their order they forced him to renounce his
salvation and curse jesus christ that they then made him submit to many
unholy and disgusting ceremonies and forced him to kiss the superior on
the cheek the navel and the breech and spit three times upon a
crucifix that all the members were forbidden to have connexion with
women but might give themselves up without restraint to every species of
unmentionable debauchery that when by any mischance a templar infringed
this order and a child was born the whole order met and tossed it about
like a shuttlecock from one to the other until it expired that they then
roasted it by a slow fire and with the fat which trickled from it
anointed the hair and beard of a large image of the devil it was also
said that when one of the knights died his body was burnt into a powder
and then mixed with wine and drunk by every member of the order philip
iv who to exercise his own implacable hatred invented in all
probability the greater part of these charges issued orders for the
immediate arrest of all the templars in his dominions the pope afterwards
took up the cause with almost as much fervour as the king of france and
in every part of europe the templars were thrown into prison and their
goods and estates confiscated hundreds of them when put to the rack
confessed even the most preposterous of the charges against them and by
so doing increased the popular clamour and the hopes of their enemies it
is true that when removed from the rack they denied all they had
previously confessed but this circumstance only increased the outcry and
was numbered as an additional crime against them they were considered in
a worse light than before and condemned forthwith to the flames as
relapsed heretics fiftynine of these unfortunate victims were all burned
together by a slow fire in a field in the suburbs of paris protesting to
the very last moment of their lives their innocence of the crimes imputed
to them and refusing to accept of pardon upon condition of acknowledging
themselves guilty similar scenes were enacted in the provinces and for
four years hardly a month passed without witnessing the execution of one
or more of these unhappy men finally in 1313 the last scene of this
tragedy closed by the burning of the grandmaster jacques de molay and
his companion guy the commander of normandy any thing more atrocious it
is impossible to conceivedisgraceful alike to the monarch who
originated the pope who supported and the age which tolerated the
monstrous iniquity that the malice of a few could invent such a charge is
a humiliating thought for the lover of his species but that millions of
mankind should credit it is still more so
the execution of joan of arc is the next most notorious example which
history affords us of the imputation of witchcraft against a political
enemy instances of similar persecution in which this crime was made the
pretext for the gratification of political or religious hatred might be
multiplied to a great extent but it is better to proceed at once to the
consideration of the bull of pope innocent the torch that set fire to the
longlaid train and caused so fearful an explosion over the christian
world it will be necessary however to go back for some years anterior
to that event the better to understand the motives that influenced the
church in the promulgation of that fearful document
towards the close of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth
century many witches were burned in different parts of europe as a
natural consequence of the severe persecution the crime or the
pretenders to it increased those who found themselves accused and
threatened with the penalties if they happened to be persons of a bad and
malicious disposition wished they had the power imputed to them that
they might be revenged upon their persecutors numerous instances are upon
record of halfcrazed persons being found muttering the spells which were
supposed to raise the evil one when religion and law alike recognised the
crime it is no wonder that the weak in reason and the strong in
imagination especially when they were of a nervous temperament fancied
themselves endued with the terrible powers of which all the world was
speaking the belief of their neighbours did not lag behind their own and
execution was the speedy consequence
illustration joan of arc
as the fear of witchcraft increased the catholic clergy strove to fix the
imputation of it upon those religious sects the pioneers of the
reformation who began about this time to be formidable to the church of
rome if a charge of heresy could not ensure their destruction that of
sorcery and witchcraft never failed in the year 1459 a devoted
congregation of the waldenses at arras who used to repair at night to
worship god in their own manner in solitary places fell victims to an
accusation of sorcery it was rumoured in arras that in the desert places
to which they retired the devil appeared before them in human form and
read from a large book his laws and ordinances to which they all promised
obedience that he then distributed money and food among them to bind
them to his service which done they gave themselves up to every species
of lewdness and debauchery upon these rumours several creditable persons
in arras were seized and imprisoned together with a number of decrepit
and idiotic old women the rack that convenient instrument for making the
accused confess any thing was of course put in requisition monstrelet
in his chronicle says that they were tortured until some of them admitted
the truth of the whole accusations and said besides that they had seen
and recognised in their nocturnal assemblies many persons of rank many
prelates seigneurs governors of bailliages and mayors of cities being
such names as the examiners had themselves suggested to the victims
several who had been thus informed against were thrown into prison and so
horribly tortured that reason fled and in their ravings of pain they
also confessed their midnight meetings with the devil and the oaths they
had taken to serve him upon these confessions judgment was pronounced
the poor old women as usual in such cases were hanged and burned in the
marketplace the more wealthy delinquents were allowed to escape upon
payment of large sums it was soon after universally recognised that these
trials had been conducted in the most odious manner and that the judges
had motives of private vengeance against many of the more influential
persons who had been implicated the parliament of paris afterwards
declared the sentence illegal and the judges iniquitous but its arrt
was too late to be of service even to those who had paid the fine or to
punish the authorities who had misconducted themselves for it was not
delivered until thirtytwo years after the executions had taken place
in the mean time accusations of witchcraft spread rapidly in france
italy and germany strange to say that although in the first instance
chiefly directed against heretics the latter were as firm believers in
the crime as even the catholics themselves in after times we also find
that the lutherans and calvinists became greater witchburners than ever
the romanists had been so deeply was the prejudice rooted every other
point of belief was in dispute but that was considered by every sect to
be as well established as the authenticity of the scriptures or the
existence of a god
but at this early period of the epidemic the persecutions were directed by
the heads of the catholic church the spread of heresy betokened it was
thought the coming of antichrist florimond in his work concerning
antichrist exposed the secret of these prosecutions he says all who
have afforded us some signs of the approach of antichrist agree that the
increase of sorcery and witchcraft is to distinguish the melancholy period
of his advent and was ever age so afflicted as ours the seats destined
for criminals in our courts of justice are blackened with persons accused
of this guilt there are not judges enough to try them our dungeons are
gorged with them no day passes that we do not render our tribunals bloody
by the dooms which we pronounce or in which we do not return to our homes
discountenanced and terrified at the horrible confessions which we have
heard and the devil is accounted so good a master that we cannot commit
so great a number of his slaves to the flames but what there shall arise
from their ashes a sufficient number to supply their place
florimond here spoke the general opinion of the church of rome but it
never suggested itself to the mind of any person engaged in these trials
that if it were indeed a devil who raised up so many new witches to fill
the places of those consumed it was no other than one in their own
employthe devil of persecution but so it was the more they burned the
more they found to burn until it became a common prayer with women in the
humbler walks of life that they might never live to grow old it was
sufficient to be aged poor and halfcrazed to ensure death at the stake
or the scaffold
illustration gate of constance
in the year 1487 there was a severe storm in switzerland which laid waste
the country for four miles around constance two wretched old women whom
the popular voice had long accused of witchcraft were arrested on the
preposterous charge of having raised the tempest the rack was displayed
and the two poor creatures were extended upon it in reply to various
questions from their tormentors they owned in their agony that they were
in the constant habit of meeting the devil that they had sold their souls
to him and that at their command he had raised the tempest upon this
insane and blasphemous charge they were condemned to die in the criminal
registers of constance there stands against the name of each the simple
but significant phrase convicta et combusta
this case and hundreds of others were duly reported to the ecclesiastical
powers there happened at that time to be a pontiff at the head of the
church who had given much of his attention to the subject of witchcraft
and who with the intention of rooting out the supposed crime did more to
increase it than any other man that ever lived john baptist cibo elected
to the papacy in 1485 under the designation of innocent viii was
sincerely alarmed at the number of witches and launched forth his
terrible manifesto against them in his celebrated bull of 1488 he called
the nations of europe to the rescue of the church of christ upon earth
imperilled by the arts of satan and set forth the horrors that had
reached his ears how that numbers of both sexes had intercourse with the
infernal fiends how by their sorceries they afflicted both man and beast
how they blighted the marriagebed destroyed the births of women and the
increase of cattle and how they blasted the corn on the ground the
grapes of the vineyard the fruits of the trees and the herbs of the
field in order that criminals so atrocious might no longer pollute the
earth he appointed inquisitors in every country armed with the apostolic
power to convict and punish
it was now that the witch mania properly so called may be said to have
fairly commenced immediately a class of men sprang up in europe who made
it the sole business of their lives to discover and burn the witches
sprenger in germany was the most celebrated of these national scourges
in his notorious work the malleus maleficarum he laid down a regular
form of trial and appointed a course of examination by which the
inquisitors in other countries might best discover the guilty the
questions which were always enforced by torture were of the most absurd
and disgusting nature the inquisitors were required to ask the suspected
whether they had midnight meetings with the devil whether they attended
the witches sabbath on the brocken whether they had their familiar
spirits whether they could raise whirlwinds and call down the lightning
and whether they had had sexual intercourse with satan
straightway the inquisitors set to work cumanus in italy burned
fortyone poor women in one province alone and sprenger in germany
burned a number which can never be ascertained correctly but which it is
agreed on all hands amounted to more than five hundred in a year the
great resemblance between the confessions of the unhappy victims was
regarded as a new proof of the existence of the crime but this is not
astonishing the same questions from the malleus maleficarum were put to
them all and torture never failed to educe the answer required by the
inquisitor numbers of people whose imaginations were filled with these
horrors went further in the way of confession than even their tormentors
anticipated in the hope that they would thereby be saved from the rack
and put out of their misery at once some confessed that they had had
children by the devil but no one who had ever been a mother gave
utterance to such a frantic imagining even in the extremity of her
anguish the childless only confessed it and were burned instanter as
unworthy to live
for fear the zeal of the enemies of satan should cool successive popes
appointed new commissions one was appointed by alexander vi in 1494
another by leo x in 1521 and a third by adrian vi in 1522 they were
all armed with the same powers to hunt out and destroy and executed their
fearful functions but too rigidly in geneva alone five hundred persons
were burned in the years 1515 and 1516 under the title of protestant
witches it would appear that their chief crime was heresy and their
witchcraft merely an aggravation bartolomeo de spina has a list still
more fearful he informs us that in the year 1524 no less than a thousand
persons suffered death for witchcraft in the district of como and that
for several years afterwards the average number of victims exceeded a
hundred annually one inquisitor remigius took great credit to himself
for having during fifteen years convicted and burned nine hundred
in france about the year 1520 fires for the execution of witches blazed
in almost every town danus in his dialogues of witches says they
were so numerous that it would be next to impossible to tell the number of
them so deep was the thraldom of the human mind that the friends and
relatives of the accused parties looked on and approved the wife or
sister of a murderer might sympathise in his fate but the wives and
husbands of sorcerers and witches had no pity the truth is that pity was
dangerous for it was thought no one could have compassion on the
sufferings of a witch who was not a dabbler in sorcery to have wept for a
witch would have insured the stake in some districts however the
exasperation of the people broke out in spite of superstition the
inquisitor of a rural township in piedmont burned the victims so
plentifully and so fast that there was not a family in the place which
did not lose a member the people at last arose and the inquisitor was
but too happy to escape from the country with whole limbs the archbishop
of the diocese proceeded afterwards to the trial of such as the inquisitor
had left in prison
some of the charges were so utterly preposterous that the poor wretches
were at once liberated others met a harder but the usual fate some of
them were accused of having joined the witches dance at midnight under a
blasted oak where they had been seen by creditable people the husbands
of several of these women two of whom were young and beautiful swore
positively that at the time stated their wives were comfortably asleep in
their arms but it was all in vain their word was taken but the
archbishop told them they had been deceived by the devil and their own
senses it was true they might have had the semblance of their wives in
their beds but the originals were far away at the devils dance under the
oak the honest fellows were confounded and their wives burned forthwith

in the year 1561 five poor women of verneuil were accused of transforming
themselves into cats and in that shape attending the sabbath of the
fiendsprowling around satan who presided over them in the form of a
goat and dancing to amuse him upon his back they were found guilty
and burned27

in 1564 three wizards and a witch appeared before the presidents salvert
and davanton they confessed when extended on the rack that they
anointed the sheeppens with infernal unguents to kill the sheep that
they attended the sabbath where they saw a great black goat which spoke
to them and made them kiss him each holding a lighted candle in his hand
while he performed the ceremony they were all executed at poitiers
in 1571 the celebrated sorcerer trois echelles was burned in the place de
grve in paris he confessed in the presence of charles ix and of the
marshals de montmorency de retz and the sieur du mazille physician to
the king that he could perform the most wonderful things by the aid of a
devil to whom he had sold himself he described at great length the
saturnalia of the fiends the sacrifices which they offered up the
debaucheries they committed with the young and handsome witches and the
various modes of preparing the infernal unguent for blighting cattle he
said he had upwards of twelve hundred accomplices in the crime of
witchcraft in various parts of france whom he named to the king and many
of whom were afterwards arrested and suffered execution
at dle two years afterwards gilles garnier a native of lyons was
indicted for being a loupgarou or manwolf and for prowling in that
shape about the country at night to devour little children the indictment
against him as read by henri camus doctor of laws and counsellor of the
king was to the effect that he gilles garnier had seized upon a little
girl twelve years of age whom he drew into a vineyard and there killed
partly with his teeth and partly with his hands seeming like wolfs paws
that from thence he trailed her bleeding body along the ground with his
teeth into the wood of la serre where he ate the greatest portion of her
at one meal and carried the remainder home to his wife that upon another
occasion eight days before the festival of all saints he was seen to
seize another child in his teeth and would have devoured her had she not
been rescued by the country people and that the said child died a few
days afterwards of the injuries he had inflicted that fifteen days after
the same festival of all saints being again in the shape of a wolf he
devoured a boy thirteen years of age having previously torn off his leg
and thigh with his teeth and hid them away for his breakfast on the
morrow he was furthermore indicted for giving way to the same diabolical
and unnatural propensities even in his shape of a man and that he had
strangled a boy in a wood with the intention of eating him which crime he
would have effected if he had not been seen by the neighbours and
prevented
gilles garnier was put to the rack after fifty witnesses had deposed
against him he confessed every thing that was laid to his charge he was
thereupon brought back into the presence of his judges when dr camus in
the name of the parliament of dle pronounced the following sentence
seeing that gilles garnier has by the testimony of credible witnesses
and by his own spontaneous confession been proved guilty of the
abominable crimes of lycanthropy and witchcraft this court condemns him
the said gilles to be this day taken in a cart from this spot to the
place of execution accompanied by the executioner matre excuteur de
la haute justice where he by the said executioner shall be tied to a
stake and burned alive and that his ashes be then scattered to the winds
the court further condemns him the said gilles to the costs of this
prosecution
given at dle this 18th day of january 1573
in 1578 the parliament of paris was occupied for several days with the
trial of a man named jacques rollet he also was found guilty of being a
loupgarou and in that shape devouring a little boy he was burnt alive
in the place de grve
in 1579 so much alarm was excited in the neighbourhood of melun by the
increase of witches and loupgarous that a council was held to devise
some measures to stay the evil a decree was passed that all witches and
consulters with witches should be punished with death and not only those
but fortunetellers and conjurors of every kind the parliament of rouen
took up the same question in the following year and decreed that the
possession of a grimoire or book of spells was sufficient evidence of
witchcraft and that all persons on whom such books were found should be
burned alive three councils were held in different parts of france in the
year 1583 all in relation to the same subject the parliament of
bourdeaux issued strict injunctions to all curates and clergy whatever to
use redoubled efforts to root out the crime of witchcraft the parliament
of tours was equally peremptory and feared the judgments of an offended
god if all these dealers with the devil were not swept from the face of
the land the parliament of rheims was particularly severe against the
noueurs daiguillette or tyers of the knotpeople of both sexes who
took pleasure in preventing the consummation of marriage that they might
counteract the command of god to our first parents to increase and
multiply this parliament held it to be sinful to wear amulets to preserve
from witchcraft and that this practice might not be continued within its
jurisdiction drew up a form of exorcism which would more effectually
defeat the agents of the devil and put them to flight
a case of witchcraft which created a great sensation in its day occurred
in 1588 at a village in the mountains of auvergne about two leagues from
apchon a gentleman of that place being at his window there passed a
friend of his who had been out hunting and who was then returning to his
own house the gentleman asked his friend what sport he had had upon
which the latter informed him that he had been attacked in the plain by a
large and savage wolf which he had shot at without wounding and that he
had then drawn out his huntingknife and cut off the animals forepaw as
it sprang upon his neck to devour him the huntsman upon this put his hand
into his bag to pull out the paw but was shocked to find that it was a
womans hand with a weddingring on the finger the gentleman immediately
recognised his wifes ring which says the indictment against her
made him begin to suspect some evil of her he immediately went in
search of her and found her sitting by the fire in the kitchen with her
arm hidden underneath her apron he tore off her apron with great
vehemence and found that she had no hand and that the stump was even
then bleeding she was given into custody and burnt at riom in presence
of some thousands of spectators28

in the midst of these executions rare were the gleams of mercy few
instances are upon record of any acquittal taking place when the crime was
witchcraft the discharge of fourteen persons by the parliament of paris
in the year 1589 is almost a solitary example of a return to reason
fourteen persons condemned to death for witchcraft appealed against the
judgment to the parliament of paris which for political reasons had been
exiled to tours the parliament named four commissionerspierre pigray
the kings surgeon and messieurs leroi renard and falaiseau the kings
physiciansto visit and examine these witches and see whether they had
the mark of the devil upon them pigray who relates the circumstance in
his work on surgery book vii chap 10 says the visit was made in
presence of two counsellors of the court the witches were all stripped
naked and the physicians examined their bodies very diligently pricking
them in all the marks they could find to see whether they were insensible
to pain which was always considered a certain proof of guilt they were
however very sensible of the pricking and some of them called out very
lustily when the pins were driven into them we found them continues
pierre pigray to be very poor stupid people and some of them insane
many of them were quite indifferent about life and one or two of them
desired death as a relief for their sufferings our opinion was that they
stood more in need of medicine than of punishment and so we reported to
the parliament their case was thereupon taken into further consideration
and the parliament after mature counsel amongst all the members ordered
the poor creatures to be sent to their homes without inflicting any
punishment upon them
such was the dreadful state of italy germany and france during the
sixteenth century which was far from being the worst crisis of the
popular madness with regard to witchcraft let us see what was the state
of england during the same period the reformation which in its progress
had rooted out so many errors stopped short at this the greatest error
of all luther and calvin were as firm believers in witchcraft as pope
innocent himself and their followers shewed themselves more zealous
persecutors than the romanists dr hutchinson in his work on witchcraft
asserts that the mania manifested itself later in england and raged with
less virulence than on the continent the first assertion only is true
for though the persecution began later both in england and scotland its
progress was as fearful as elsewhere
it was not until more than fifty years after the issuing of the bull of
innocent viii that the legislature of england thought fit to make any
more severe enactments against sorcery than those already in operation
the statute of 1541 was the first that specified the particular crime of
witchcraft at a much earlier period many persons had suffered death for
sorcery in addition to other offences but no executions took place for
attending the witches sabbath raising tempests afflicting cattle with
barrenness and all the fantastic trumpery of the continent two statutes
were passed in 1551 the first relating to false prophecies caused
mainly no doubt by the impositions of elizabeth barton the holy maid of
kent in 1534 and the second against conjuration witchcraft and
sorcery but even this enactment did not consider witchcraft as penal in
itself and only condemned to death those who by means of spells
incantations or contracts with the devil attempted the lives of their
neighbours the statute of elizabeth in 1562 at last recognised
witchcraft as a crime of the highest magnitude whether exerted or not to
the injury of the lives limbs and possessions of the community from
that date the persecution may be fairly said to have commenced in england
it reached its climax in the early part of the seventeenth century which
was the hottest period of the mania all over europe
a few cases of witch persecution in the sixteenth century will enable the
reader to form a more accurate idea of the progress of this great error
than if he plunged at once into that busy period of its history when
matthew hopkins and his coadjutors exercised their infernal calling
several instances occur in england during the latter years of the reign of
elizabeth at this time the public mind had become pretty familiar with
the details of the crime bishop jewell in his sermons before her
majesty used constantly to conclude them by a fervent prayer that she
might be preserved from witches upon one occasion in 1598 his words
were it may please your grace to understand that witches and sorcerers
within these last four years are marvellously increased within this your
graces realm your graces subjects pine away even unto the death their
colour fadeththeir flesh rotteththeir speech is benumbedtheir senses
are bereft i pray god they may never practise further than upon the
subject

by degrees an epidemic terror of witchcraft spread into the villages in
proportion as the doctrine of the puritans took root this dread
increased and of course brought persecution in its train the church of
england has claimed and is entitled to the merit of having been less
influenced in these matters than any other sect of christians but still
they were tainted with the superstition of the age one of the most
flagrant instances of cruelty and delusion upon record was consummated
under the authority of the church and commemorated till a very late
period by an annual lecture at the university of cambridge
this is the celebrated case of the witches of warbois who were executed
about thirtytwo years after the passing of the statute of elizabeth
although in the interval but few trials are recorded there is
unfortunately but too much evidence to shew the extreme length to which
the popular prejudice was carried many women lost their lives in every
part of england without being brought to trial at all from the injuries
received at the hands of the people the number of these can never be
ascertained
the case of the witches of warbois merits to be detailed at length not
only from the importance attached to it for so many years by the learned
of the university but from the singular absurdity of the evidence upon
which men sensible in all other respects could condemn their
fellowcreatures to the scaffold
the principal actors in this strange drama were the families of sir samuel
cromwell and a mr throgmorton both gentlemen of landed property near
warbois in the county of huntingdon mr throgmorton had several
daughters the eldest of whom mistress joan was an imaginative and
melancholy girl whose head was filled with stories of ghosts and witches
upon one occasion she chanced to pass the cottage of one mrs or as she
was called mother samuel a very aged a very poor and a very ugly
woman mother samuel was sitting at her door knitting with a black cap
upon her head when this silly young lady passed and taking her eyes from
her work she looked stedfastly at her mistress joan immediately fancied
that she felt sudden pains in all her limbs and from that day forth never
ceased to tell her sisters and every body about her that mother samuel
had bewitched her the other children took up the cry and actually
frightened themselves into fits whenever they passed within sight of this
terrible old woman
mr and mrs throgmorton not a whit wiser than their children believed
all the absurd tales they had been told and lady cromwell a gossip of
mrs throgmorton made herself very active in the business and determined
to bring the witch to the ordeal the sapient sir samuel joined in the
scheme and the children thus encouraged gave loose reins to their
imaginations which seem to have been of the liveliest they soon invented
a whole host of evil spirits and names for them besides which they said
were sent by mother samuel to torment them continually seven spirits
especially they said were raised from hell by this wicked woman to throw
them into fits and as the children were actually subject to fits their
mother and her commeres gave the more credit to the story the names of
these spirits were first smack second smack third smack blue
catch hardname and pluck
throgmorton the father was so pestered by these idle fancies and yet so
well inclined to believe them that he marched valiantly forth to the hut
where mother samuel resided with her husband and daughter and dragged her
forcibly into his own grounds lady cromwell mrs throgmorton and the
girls were in waiting armed with long pins to prick the witch and see if
they could draw blood from her lady cromwell who seems to have been the
most violent of the party tore the old womans cap off her head and
plucking out a handful of her grey hair gave it to mrs throgmorton to
burn as a charm which would preserve them all from her future
machinations it was no wonder that the poor creature subjected to this
rough usage should give vent to an involuntary curse upon her tormentors
she did so and her curse was never forgotten her hair however was
supposed to be a grand specific and she was allowed to depart half dead
with terror and illusage for more than a year the families of cromwell
and throgmorton continued to persecute her and to assert that her imps
afflicted them with pains and fits turned the milk sour in their pans
and prevented their cows and ewes from bearing in the midst of these
fooleries lady cromwell was taken ill and died it was then remembered
that her death had taken place exactly a year and a quarter since she was
cursed by mother samuel and that on several occasions she had dreamed of
the witch and a black cat the latter being of course the archenemy of
mankind himself
sir samuel cromwell now conceived himself bound to take more energetic
measures against the sorceress since he had lost his wife by her means
the year and a quarter and the black cat were proofs positive all the
neighbours had taken up the cry of witchcraft against mother samuel and
her personal appearance unfortunately for her the very ideal of what a
witch ought to be increased the popular suspicion it would appear that
at last the poor woman believed even to her own disadvantage that she
was what every body represented her to be being forcibly brought into mr
throgmortons house when his daughter joan was in one of her customary
fits she was commanded by him and sir samuel cromwell to expel the devil
from the young lady she was told to repeat her exorcism and to add as
i am a witch and the causer of lady cromwells death i charge thee
fiend to come out of her she did as was required of her and moreover
confessed that her husband and daughter were leagued with her in
witchcraft and had like her sold their souls to the devil the whole
family were immediately arrested and sent to huntingdon to prison
the trial was instituted shortly afterwards before mr justice fenner
when all the crazy girls of mr throgmortons family gave evidence against
mother samuel and her family they were all three put to the torture the
old woman confessed in her anguish that she was a witch that she had cast
her spells upon the young ladies and that she had caused the death of
lady cromwell the father and daughter stronger in mind than their
unfortunate wife and parent refused to confess any thing and asserted
their innocence to the last they were all three condemned to be hanged
and their bodies burned the daughter who was young and goodlooking
excited the pity of many persons and she was advised to plead pregnancy
that she might gain at least a respite from death the poor girl refused
proudly on the ground that she would not be accounted both a witch and a
strumpet her halfwitted old mother caught at the idea of a few weeks
longer life and asserted that she was pregnant the court was convulsed
with laughter in which the wretched victim herself joined and this was
accounted an additional proof that she was a witch the whole family were
executed on the 7th of april 1593
sir samuel cromwell as lord of the manor received the sum of 40l out of
the confiscated property of the samuels which he turned into a
rentcharge of 40s yearly for the endowment of an annual sermon or
lecture upon the enormity of witchcraft and this case in particular to
be preached by a doctor or bachelor of divinity of queens college
cambridge i have not been able to ascertain the exact date at which this
annual lecture was discontinued but it appears to have been preached so
late as 1718 when dr hutchinson published his work upon witchcraft
to carry on in proper chronological order the history of the witch
delusion in the british isles it will be necessary to examine into what
was taking place in scotland during all that part of the sixteenth century
anterior to the accession of james vi to the crown of england we
naturally expect that the scotcha people renowned from the earliest
times for their powers of imaginationshould be more deeply imbued with
this gloomy superstition than their neighbours of the south the nature of
their soil and climate tended to encourage the dreams of early ignorance
ghosts goblins wraiths kelpies and a whole host of spiritual beings
were familiar to the dwellers by the misty glens of the highlands and the
romantic streams of the lowlands their deeds whether of good or ill
were enshrined in song and took a greater hold upon the imagination
because verse had sanctified them but it was not till the religious
reformers began the practice of straining scripture to the severest
extremes that the arm of the law was called upon to punish witchcraft as a
crime per se what pope innocent viii had done for germany and france
the preachers of the reformation did for the scottish people witchcraft
instead of being a mere article of faith became enrolled in the
statutebook and all good subjects and true christians were called upon
to take arms against it the ninth parliament of queen mary passed an act
in 1563 which decreed the punishment of death against witches and
consulters with witches and immediately the whole bulk of the people were
smitten with an epidemic fear of the devil and his mortal agents persons
in the highest ranks of life shared and encouraged the delusion of the
vulgar many were themselves accused of witchcraft and noble ladies were
shewn to have dabbled in mystic arts and proved to the world that if they
were not witches it was not for want of the will
among the dames who became notorious for endeavouring to effect their
wicked ends by the devils aid may be mentioned the celebrated lady
buccleugh of branxholme familiar to all the readers of sir walter scott
the countess of lothian the countess of angus the countess of athol
lady kerr the countess of huntley euphemia macalzean the daughter of
lord cliftonhall and lady fowlis among the celebrated of the other sex
who were accused of wizardism was sir lewis ballantyne the lord
justiceclerk for scotland who if we may believe scot of scotstarvet
dealt by curiosity with a warlock called richard grahame and prayed him
to raise the devil the warlock consented and raised him in propri
person in the yard of his house in the canongate at sight of whom the
lord justiceclerk was so terrified that he took sickness and thereof
died by such idle reports as these did the envious ruin the reputation
of those they hated though it would appear in this case that sir lewis
had been fool enough to make the attempt of which he was accused and that
the success of the experiment was the only apocryphal part of the story
illustration john knox
the enemies of john knox invented a similar tale which found ready
credence among the roman catholics glad to attach any stigma to that
grand scourge of the vices of their church it was reported that he and
his secretary went into the churchyard of st andrews with the intent to
raise some sanctes but that by a mistake in their conjurations they
raised the great fiend himself instead of the saints they wished to
consult the popular rumour added that knoxs secretary was so frightened
at the great horns goggle eyes and long tail of satan that he went mad
and shortly afterwards died knox himself was built of sterner stuff and
was not to be frightened
the first name that occurs in the records of the high court of justiciary
of persons tried or executed for witchcraft is that of janet bowman in
1572 nine years after the passing of the act of mary no particulars of
her crimes are given and against her name there only stands the words
convict and brynt it is not however to be inferred that in this
interval no trials or executions took place for it appears on the
authority of documents of unquestioned authenticity in the advocates
library at edinburgh29 that the privy council made a practice of
granting commissions to resident gentlemen and ministers in every part of
scotland to examine try and execute witches within their own parishes
no records of those who suffered from the sentence of these tribunals have
been preserved but if popular tradition may be believed even to the
amount of onefourth of its assertions their number was fearful after
the year 1572 the entries of executions for witchcraft in the records of
the high court become more frequent but do not average more than one per
annumanother proof that trials for this offence were in general
entrusted to the local magistracy the latter appear to have ordered
witches to the stake with as little compunction and after as summary a
mode as modern justices of the peace order a poacher to the stocks
    29 foreign quarterly review vol vi p 41
as james vi advanced in manhood he took great interest in the witch
trials one of them especiallythat of gellie duncan dr fian and their
accomplices in the year 1591engrossed his whole attention and no doubt
suggested in some degree the famous work on demonology which he wrote
shortly afterwards as these witches had made an attempt upon his own
life it is not surprising with his habits that he should have watched
the case closely or become strengthened in his prejudice and superstition
by its singular details no other trial that could be selected would give
so fair an idea of the delusions of the scottish people as this whether
we consider the number of victims the absurdity of the evidence and the
real villany of some of the persons implicated it is equally
extraordinary
gellie duncan the prime witch in these proceedings was servant to the
deputy bailiff of tranent a small town in haddingtonshire about ten
miles from edinburgh though neither old nor ugly as witches usually
were but young and goodlooking her neighbours from some suspicious
parts of her behaviour had long considered her a witch she had it
appears some pretensions to the healing art some cures which she
effected were so sudden that the worthy bailiff her master who like
his neighbours mistrusted her considered them no less than miraculous
in order to discover the truth he put her to the torture but she
obstinately refused to confess that she had dealings with the devil it
was the popular belief that no witch would confess as long as the mark
which satan had put upon her remained undiscovered upon her body somebody
present reminded the torturing bailie of this fact and on examination
the devils mark was found upon the throat of poor gellie she was put to
the torture again and her fortitude giving way under the extremity of her
anguish she confessed that she was indeed a witchthat she had sold her
soul to the devil and effected all her cures by his aid this was
something new in the witch creed according to which the devil delighted
more in laying diseases on than in taking them off but gellie duncan
fared no better on that account the torture was still applied until she
had named all her accomplices among whom were one cunningham a reputed
wizard known by the name of dr fian a grave and matronlike witch
named agnes sampson euphemia macalzean the daughter of lord cliftonhall
already mentioned and nearly forty other persons some of whom were the
wives of respectable individuals in the city of edinburgh every one of
these persons was arrested and the whole realm of scotland thrown into
commotion by the extraordinary nature of the disclosures which were
anticipated
about two years previous to this time james had suddenly left his
kingdom and proceeded gallantly to denmark to fetch over his bride the
princess of denmark who had been detained by contrary weather in the
harbour of upslo after remaining for some months in copenhagen he set
sail with his young bride and arrived safely in leith on the 1st of may
1590 having experienced a most boisterous passage and been nearly
wrecked as soon as the arrest of gellie duncan and fian became known in
scotland it was reported by every body who pretended to be wellinformed
that these witches and their associates had by the devils means raised
the storms which had endangered the lives of the king and queen gellie
in her torture had confessed that such was the fact and the whole
kingdom waited aghast and openmouthed for the corroboration about to be
furnished by the trial
agnes sampson the grave and matronlike witch implicated by gellie
duncan was put to the horrible torture of the pilliewinkis she laid
bare all the secrets of the sisterhood before she had suffered an hour
and confessed that gellie duncan dr fian marian lincup euphemia
macalzean herself and upwards of two hundred witches and warlocks used
to assemble at midnight in the kirk of north berwick where they met the
devil that they had plotted there to attempt the kings life that they
were incited to this by the old fiend himself who had asserted with a
thundering oath that james was the greatest enemy he ever had and that
there would be no peace for the devils children upon earth until he were
got rid of that the devil upon these occasions always liked to have a
little music and that gellie duncan used to play a reel before him on a
trump or jews harp to which all the witches danced
james was highly flattered at the idea that the devil should have said
that he was the greatest enemy he ever had he sent for gellie duncan to
the palace and made her play before him the same reel which she had
played at the witches dance in the kirk
illustration torture of the boots
dr fian or rather cunningham a petty schoolmaster of tranent was put
to the torture among the rest he was a man who had led an infamous life
was a compounder of and dealer in poisons and a pretender to magic
though not guilty of the preposterous crimes laid to his charge there is
no doubt that he was a sorcerer in will though not in deed and that he
deserved all the misery he endured when put on the rack he would confess
nothing and held out so long unmoved that the severe torture of the
boots was resolved upon he endured this till exhausted nature could
bear no longer when insensibility kindly stepped in to his aid when it
was seen that he was utterly powerless and that his tongue cleaved to the
roof of his mouth he was released restoratives were administered and
during the first faint gleam of returning consciousness he was prevailed
upon to sign ere he well knew what he was about a full confession in
strict accordance with those of gellie duncan and agnes sampson he was
then remanded to his prison from which after two days he managed some
how or other to escape he was soon recaptured and brought before the
court of justiciary james himself being present fian now denied all the
circumstances of the written confession which he had signed whereupon the
king enraged at his stubborn wilfulness ordered him once more to the
torture his finger nails were riven out with pincers and long needles
thrust up to the eye into the quick but he did not wince he was then
consigned again to the boots in which to quote a pamphlet published at
the time30 he continued so long and abode so many blows in them that
his legs were crushed and beaten together as small as might be and the
bones and flesh so bruised that the blood and marrow spouted forth in
great abundance whereby they were made unserviceable for ever
    30 news from scotland declaring the damnable life of dr
         fian
the astonishing similarity of the confessions of all the persons
implicated in these proceedings has often been remarked it would appear
that they actually endeavoured to cause the kings death by their spells
and sorceries fian who was acquainted with all the usual tricks of his
profession deceived them with pretended apparitions so that many of them
were really convinced that they had seen the devil the sum of their
confessions was to the following effect
satan who was of course a great foe of the reformed religion was
alarmed that king james should marry a protestant princess to avert the
consequences to the realms of evil he had determined to put an end to the
king and his bride by raising a storm on their voyage home satan first
of all sent a thick mist over the waters in the hope that the kings
vessel might be stranded on the coast amid the darkness this failing dr
fian who from his superior scholarship was advanced to the dignity of
the devils secretary was commanded to summon all the witches to meet
their master each one sailing on a sieve on the high seas
on all hallowmas eve they assembled to the number of upwards of two
hundred including gellie duncan agnes sampson euphemia macalzean one
barbara napier and several warlocks and each embarking in a riddle or
sieve they sailed over the ocean very substantially after cruising
about for some time they met with the fiend bearing in his claws a cat
which had been previously drawn nine times through the fire this he
delivered to one of the warlocks telling him to cast it into the sea and
cry hola this was done with all solemnity and immediately the ocean
became convulsed the waters hissed loudly and the waves rose mountains
high
   twisting their arms to the duncoloured heaven
the witches sailed gallantly through the tempest they had raised and
landing on the coast of scotland took their sieves in their hands and
marched on in procession to the haunted kirk of north berwick where the
devil had resolved to hold a preaching gellie duncan the musician of the
party tripped on before playing on her jews harp and singing
   cummer go ye before cummer go ye
    gif ye will not go before cummer let me
arrived at the kirk they paced around it withershins that is in
reverse of the apparent motion of the sun dr fian then blew into the
keyhole of the door which opened immediately and all the witches
entered as it was pitch dark fian blew with his mouth upon the candles
which immediately lighted and the devil was seen occupying the pulpit he
was attired in a black gown and hat and the witches saluted him by crying
all hail master his body was hard like iron his face terrible his
nose like the beak of an eagle he had great burning eyes his hands and
legs were hairy and he had long claws upon his hands and feet and spake
with an exceedingly gruff voice before commencing his sermon he called
over the names of his congregation demanding whether they had been good
servants and what success had attended their operations against the life
of the king and his bride
gray meill a crazy old warlock who acted as beadle or doorkeeper was
silly enough to answer that nothing ailed the king yet god be thanked
upon which the devil in a rage stepped down from the pulpit and boxed
his ears for him he then remounted and commenced the preaching
commanding them to be dutiful servants to him and do all the evil they
could euphemia macalzean and agnes sampson bolder than the rest asked
him whether he had brought the image or picture of king james that they
might by pricking it cause pains and diseases to fall upon him the
father of lies spoke truth for once and confessed that he had forgotten
it upon which euphemia macalzean upbraided him loudly for his
carelessness the devil however took it all in good part although agnes
sampson and several other women let loose their tongues at him
immediately when they had done scolding he invited them all to a grand
entertainment a newly buried corpse was dug up and divided among them
which was all they had in the way of edibles he was more liberal in the
matter of drink and gave them so much excellent wine that they soon
became jolly gellie duncan then played the old tune upon her trump and
the devil himself led off the dance with euphemia macalzean thus they
kept up the sport till the cock crew
agnes sampson the wise woman of keith as she was called added some
other particulars in her confession she stated that on a previous
occasion she had raised an awful tempest in the sea by throwing a cat
into it with four joints of men tied to its feet she said also that on
their grand attempt to drown king james they did not meet with the devil
after cruising about but that he had accompanied them from the first and
that she had seen him dimly in the distance rolling himself before them
over the great waves in shape and size not unlike a huge haystack they
met with a foreign ship richly laden with wines and other good things
which they boarded and sunk after they had drunk all the wine and made
themselves quite merry
illustration james the demonologist
some of these disclosures were too much even for the abundant faith of
king james and he more than once exclaimed that the witches were like
their master extreme lyars but they confessed many other things of a
less preposterous nature and of which they were no doubt really guilty
agnes sampson said she was to have taken the kings life by anointing his
linen with a strong poison gellie duncan used to threaten her neighbours
by saying she would send the devil after them and many persons of weaker
minds than usual were frightened into fits by her and rendered subject to
them for the remainder of their lives dr fian also made no scruple in
aiding and abetting murder and would rid any person of an enemy by means
of poison who could pay him his fee for it euphemia macalzean also was
far from being pure there is no doubt that she meditated the kings
death and used such means to compass it as the superstition of the age
directed she was a devoted partisan of bothwell who was accused by many
of the witches as having consulted them on the period of the kings death
they were all found guilty and sentenced to be hanged and burned barbara
napier though found guilty upon other counts was acquitted upon the
charge of having been present at the great witch meeting in berwick kirk
the king was highly displeased and threatened to have the jury indicted
for a wilful error upon an assize they accordingly reconsidered their
verdict and threw themselves upon the kings mercy for the fault they had
committed james was satisfied and barbara napier was hanged along with
gellie duncan agnes sampson dr fian and fiveandtwenty others
euphemia macalzean met a harder fate her connexion with the bold and
obnoxious bothwell and her share in poisoning one or two individuals who
had stood in her way were thought deserving of the severest punishment
the law could inflict instead of the ordinary sentence directing the
criminal to be first strangled and then burned the wretched woman was
doomed to be bound to a stake and burned in ashes quick to the
death this cruel sentence was executed on the 25th of june 1591
these trials had the most pernicious consequences all over scotland the
lairds and ministers in their districts armed with due power from the
privy council tried and condemned old women after the most summary
fashion those who still clung to the ancient faith of rome were the
severest sufferers as it was thought after the disclosures of the fierce
enmity borne by the devil towards a protestant king and his protestant
wife that all the catholics were leagued with the powers of evil to work
woe on the realm of scotland upon a very moderate calculation it is
presumed that from the passing of the act of queen mary till the accession
of james to the throne of england a period of thirtynine years the
average number of executions for witchcraft in scotland was two hundred
annually or upwards of seventeen thousand altogether for the first nine
years the number was not one quarter so great but towards the years 1590
to 1593 the number must have been more than four hundred the case last
cited was one of an extraordinary character the general aspect of the
trials will be better seen from that of isabel gowdie which as it would
be both wearisome and disgusting to go through them all is given as a
fair specimen although it took place at a date somewhat later than the
reign of james this woman wearied of her life by the persecutions of her
neighbours voluntarily gave herself up to justice and made a confession
embodying the whole witchcreed of the period she was undoubtedly a
monomaniac of the most extraordinary kind she said that she deserved to
be stretched upon an iron rack and that her crimes could never be atoned
for even if she were to be drawn asunder by wild horses she named a long
list of her associates including nearly fifty women and a few warlocks
they dug up the graves of unchristened infants whose limbs were
serviceable in their enchantments when they wanted to destroy the crops
of an enemy they yoked toads to his plough and on the following night
satan himself ploughed the land with his team and blasted it for the
season the witches had power to assume almost any shape but they
generally chose either that of a cat or a hare oftenest the latter
isabel said that on one occasion when she was in this disguise she was
sore pressed by a pack of hounds and had a very narrow escape with her
life she reached her own door at last feeling the hot breath of the
pursuing dogs at her haunches she managed however to hide herself
behind a chest and got time to pronounce the magic words that could alone
restore her to her proper shape they were
   hare hare
    god send thee care
        i am in a hares likeness now
        but i shall be a woman een now
    hare hare
    god send thee care
if witches when in this shape were bitten by the dogs they always
retained the marks in their human form but she had never heard that any
witch had been bitten to death when the devil appointed any general
meeting of the witches the custom was that they should proceed through
the air mounted on broomsticks or on corn or beanstraws pronouncing as
they went
   horse and pattock horse and go
    horse and pellats ho ho ho
they generally left behind them a broom or a threelegged stool which
when placed in their beds and duly charmed assumed the human shape till
their return this was done that the neighbours might not know when they
were absent
she added that the devil furnished his favourite witches with servant imps
to attend upon them these imps were called the roaring lion thief of
hell waituponherself ranting roarer carefornaught c and
were known by their liveries which were generally yellow saddun
seagreen peagreen or grassgreen satan never called the witches by
the names they had received at baptism neither were they allowed in his
presence so to designate each other such a breach of the infernal
etiquette assuredly drew down his most severe displeasure but as some
designation was necessary he rebaptised them in their own blood by the
names of ableandstout overthedikewithit raisethewind
picklenearestthewind batterthemdownmaggy blowkale and such
like the devil himself was not very particular what name they called him
so that it was not black john if any witch was unthinking enough to
utter these words he would rush out upon her and beat and buffet her
unmercifully or tear her flesh with a woolcard other names he did not
care about and once gave instructions to a noted warlock that whenever he
wanted his aid he was to strike the ground three times and exclaim rise
up foul thief
illustration sir g mackenzie
upon this confession many persons were executed so strong was the popular
feeling that no one once accused of witchcraft was acquitted at least
acquittals did not average one in a hundred trials witchfinding or
witchpricking became a trade and a set of mercenary vagabonds roamed
about the country provided with long pins to run into the flesh of
supposed criminals it was no unusual thing then nor is it now that in
aged persons there should be some spot on the body totally devoid of
feeling it was the object of the witchpricker to discover this spot and
the unhappy wight who did not bleed when pricked upon it was doomed to the
death if not immediately cast into prison her life was rendered
miserable by the persecution of her neighbours it is recorded of many
poor women that the annoyances they endured in this way were so
excessive that they preferred death sir george mackenzie the lord
advocate at the time when witch trials were so frequent and himself a
devout believer in the crime relates in his criminal law first
published in 1678 some remarkable instances of it he says i went when
i was a justicedepute to examine some women who had confessed
judicially and one of them who was a silly creature told me under
secrecy that she had not confessed because she was guilty but being a
poor creature who wrought for her meat and being defamed for a witch
she knew she should starve for no person thereafter would either give her
meat or lodging and that all men would beat her and set dogs at her and
that therefore she desired to be out of the world whereupon she wept
most bitterly and upon her knees called god to witness to what she said
sir george though not wholly elevated above the prejudices of his age
upon this subject was clearsighted enough to see the danger to society
of the undue encouragement given to the witch prosecutions he was
convinced that threefourths of them were unjust and unfounded he says
in the work already quoted that the persons who were in general accused
of this crime were poor ignorant men and women who did not understand the
nature of the accusation and who mistook their own superstitious fears
for witchcraft one poor wretch a weaver confessed that he was a
warlock and being asked why he replied because he had seen the devil
dancing like a fly about the candle a simple woman who because she
was called a witch believed that she was asked the judge upon the bench
whether a person might be a witch and not know it sir george adds that
all the supposed criminals were subjected to severe torture in prison from
their gaolers who thought they did god good service by vexing and
tormenting them and i know says this humane and enlightened
magistrate that this usage was the ground of all their confession and
albeit the poor miscreants cannot prove this usage the actors in it
being the only witnesses yet the judge should be jealous of it as that
which did at first elicit the confession and for fear of which they dare
not retract it another author31 also a firm believer in witchcraft
gives a still more lamentable instance of a woman who preferred execution
as a witch to live on under the imputation this woman who knew that
three others were to be strangled and burned on an early day sent for the
minister of the parish and confessed that she had sold her soul to satan
whereupon being called before the judges she was condemned to die with
the rest being carried forth to the place of execution she remained
silent during the first second and third prayer and then perceiving
that there remained no more but to rise and go to the stake she lifted up
her body and with a loud voice cried out now all you that see me this
day know that i am now to die as a witch by my own confession and i
free all men especially the ministers and magistrates of the guilt of my
blood i take it wholly upon myself my blood be upon my own head and as
i must make answer to the god of heaven presently i declare i am as free
of witchcraft as any child but being delated by a malicious woman and
put in prison under the name of a witch disowned by my husband and
friends and seeing no ground of hope of ever coming out again i made up
that confession to destroy my own life being weary of it and choosing
rather to die than to live as a proof of the singular obstinacy and
blindness of the believers in witches it may be stated that the minister
who relates this story only saw in the dying speech of the unhappy woman
an additional proof that she was a witch true indeed is it that none
are so blind as those who will not see

it is time however to return to james vi who is fairly entitled to
share with pope innocent sprenger bodinus and matthew hopkins the glory
or the odium of being at the same time a chief enemy and chief encourager
of witchcraft towards the close of the sixteenth century many learned
men both on the continent and in the isles of britain had endeavoured to
disabuse the public mind on this subject the most celebrated were wierus
in germany pietro dapone in italy and reginald scot in england their
works excited the attention of the zealous james who mindful of the
involuntary compliment which his merits had extorted from the devil was
ambitious to deserve it by still continuing his greatest enemie in the
year 1597 he published in edinburgh his famous treatise on demonology
its design may be gathered from the following passage in the introduction
the fearful abounding says the king at this time and in this country
of these detestable slaves of the devil the witches or enchanters hath
moved me beloved reader to despatch in post this following treatise of
mine not in any wise as i protest to serve for a show of mine own
learning and ingene ingenuity but only moved of conscience to press
thereby so far as i can to resolve the doubting hearts of many both
that such assaults of satan are most certainly practised and that the
instrument thereof merits most severely to be punished against the
damnable opinions of two principally in our age whereof the one called
scot an englishman is not ashamed in public print to deny that there can
be such thing as witchcraft and so maintains the old error of the
sadducees in denying of spirits the other called wierus a german
physician sets out a public apology for all these craftsfolks whereby
procuring for them impunity he plainly betrays himself to have been one
of that profession in other parts of this treatise which the author had
put into the form of a dialogue to make it more pleasant and facile he
says witches ought to be put to death according to the law of god the
civil and imperial law and the municipal law of all christian nations
yea to spare the life and not strike whom god bids strike and so
severely punish in so odious a treason against god is not only unlawful
but doubtless as great a sin in the magistrate as was sauls sparing
agag he says also that the crime is so abominable that it may be proved
by evidence which would not be received against any other
offendersyoung children who knew not the nature of an oath and
persons of an infamous character being sufficient witnesses against them
but lest the innocent should be accused of a crime so difficult to be
acquitted of he recommends that in all cases the ordeal should be
resorted to he says two good helps may be used the one is the finding
of their mark and the trying the insensibleness thereof the other is
their floating on the waterfor as in a secret murther if the dead
carcass be at any time thereafter handled by the murtherer it will gush
out of blood as if the blood were crying to heaven for revenge of the
murtherer god having appointed that secret supernatural sign for trial of
that secret unnatural crime so that it appears that god hath appointed
for a supernatural sign of the monstrous impiety of witches that the
water shall refuse to receive them in her bosom that have shaken off them
the sacred water of baptism and wilfully refused the benefit
thereofno not so much as their eyes are able to shed tears threaten
and torture them as you please while first they repent god not
permitting them to dissemble their obstinacy in so horrible a crime
albeit the womenkind especially be able otherwise to shed tears at every
light occasion when they will yea although it were dissembling like the
crocodiles

when such doctrines as these were openly promulgated by the highest
authority in the realm and who in promulgating them flattered but did
not force the public opinion it is not surprising that the sad delusion
should have increased and multiplied until the race of wizards and witches
replenished the earth the reputation which he lost by being afraid of a
naked sword he more than regained by his courage in combating the devil
the kirk shewed itself a most zealous coadjutor especially during those
halcyon days when it was not at issue with the king upon other matters of
doctrine and prerogative
on his accession to the throne of england in 1603 james came amongst a
people who had heard with admiration of his glorious deeds against the
witches he himself left no part of his ancient prejudices behind him and
his advent was the signal for the persecution to burst forth in england
with a fury equal to that in scotland it had languished a little during
the latter years of the reign of elizabeth but the very first parliament
of king james brought forward the subject james was flattered by their
promptitude and the act passed in 1604 on the second reading in the
house of lords the bill passed into a committee in which were twelve
bishops by it was enacted that if any person shall use practise or
exercise any conjuration of any wicked or evil spirit or shall consult
covenant with or feed any such spirit the first offence to be
imprisonment for a year and standing in the pillory once a quarter the
second offence to be death
the minor punishment seems but rarely to have been inflicted every record
that has been preserved mentions that the witches were hanged and burned
or burned without the previous strangling alive and quick during the
whole of jamess reign amid the civil wars of his successor the sway of
the long parliament the usurpation of cromwell and the reign of charles
ii there was no abatement of the persecution if at any time it raged
with less virulence it was when cromwell and the independents were
masters dr zachary grey the editor of an edition of hudibras informs
us in a note to that work that he himself perused a list of three
thousand witches who were executed in the time of the long parliament
alone during the first eighty years of the seventeenth century the
number executed has been estimated at five hundred annually making the
frightful total of forty thousand some of these cases deserve to be
cited the great majority resemble closely those already mentioned but
two or three of them let in a new light upon the popular superstition
every one has heard of the lancashire witches a phrase now used to
compliment the ladies of that county for their bewitching beauty but it
is not every one who has heard the story in which it originated a
villanous boy named robinson was the chief actor in the tragedy he
confessed many years afterwards that he had been suborned by his father
and other persons to give false evidence against the unhappy witches whom
he brought to the stake the time of this famous trial was about the year
1634 this boy robinson whose father was a woodcutter residing on the
borders of pendle forest in lancashire spread abroad many rumours
against one mother dickenson whom he accused of being a witch these
rumours coming to the ears of the local magistracy the boy was sent for
and strictly examined he told the following extraordinary story without
hesitation or prevarication and apparently in so open and honest a
manner that no one who heard him doubted the truth of it he said that
as he was roaming about in one of the glades of the forest amusing
himself by gathering blackberries he saw two greyhounds before him which
he thought at the time belonged to some gentleman of the neighbourhood
being fond of sport he proposed to have a course and a hare being
started he incited the hounds to run neither of them would stir angry
at the beasts he seized hold of a switch with which he was about to
punish them when one of them suddenly started up in the form of a woman
and the other of a little boy he at once recognised the woman to be the
witch mother dickenson she offered him some money to induce him to sell
his soul to the devil but he refused upon this she took a bridle out of
her pocket and shaking it over the head of the other little boy he was
instantly turned into a horse mother dickenson then seized him in her
arms sprang upon the horse and placing him before her rode with the
swiftness of the wind over forests fields bogs and rivers until they
came to a large barn the witch alighted at the door and taking him by
the hand led him inside there he saw seven old women pulling at seven
halters which hung from the roof as they pulled large pieces of meat
lumps of butter loaves of bread basins of milk hot puddings black
puddings and other rural dainties fell from the halters on to the floor
while engaged in this charm they made such ugly faces and looked so
fiendish that he was quite frightened after they had pulled in this
manner enough for an ample feast they setto and shewed whatever might
be said of the way in which their supper was procured that their
epicurism was a little more refined than that of the scottish witches
who according to gellie duncans confession feasted upon dead mens
flesh in the old kirk of berwick the boy added that as soon as supper
was ready many other witches came to partake of it several of whom he
named
in consequence of this story many persons were arrested and the boy
robinson was led about from church to church in order that he might point
out to the officers by whom he was accompanied the hags he had seen in the
barn altogether about twenty persons were thrown into prison eight of
them were condemned to die including mother dickenson upon this evidence
alone and executed accordingly among the wretches who concocted this
notable story not one was ever brought to justice for his perjury and
robinson the father gained considerable sums by threatening persons who
were rich enough to buy off exposure
among the illweeds which flourished amid the long dissensions of the
civil war matthew hopkins the witchfinder stands eminent in his
sphere this vulgar fellow resided in the year 1644 at the town of
manningtree in essex and made himself very conspicuous in discovering
the devils marks upon several unhappy witches the credit he gained by
his skill in this instance seems to have inspired him to renewed
exertions in the course of a very short time whenever a witch was spoken
of in essex matthew hopkins was sure to be present aiding the judges
with his knowledge of such cattle as he called them as his reputation
increased he assumed the title of witchfinder general and travelled
through the counties of norfolk essex huntingdon and sussex for the
sole purpose of finding out witches in one year he brought sixty poor
creatures to the stake the test he commonly adopted was that of swimming
so highly recommended by king james in his demonologie the hands and
feet of the suspected persons were tied together crosswise the thumb of
the right hand to the toe of the left foot and vice versa they were
then wrapped up in a large sheet or blanket and laid upon their backs in
a pond or river if they sank their friends and relatives had the poor
consolation of knowing they were innocent but there was an end of them
if they floated which when laid carefully on the water was generally
the case there was also an end of them for they were deemed guilty of
witchcraft and burned accordingly
another test was to make them repeat the lords prayer and creed it was
affirmed that no witch could do so correctly if she missed a word or
even pronounced one incoherently which in her trepidation it was most
probable she would she was accounted guilty it was thought that witches
could not weep more than three tears and those only from the left eye
thus the conscious innocence of many persons which gave them fortitude to
bear unmerited torture without flinching was construed by their
unmerciful tormentors into proofs of guilt in some districts the test
resorted to was to weigh the culprit against the church bible if the
suspected witch proved heavier than the bible she was set at liberty
this mode was far too humane for the witchfinders by profession hopkins
always maintained that the most legitimate modes were pricking and
swimming
hopkins used to travel through his counties like a man of consideration
attended by his two assistants always putting up at the chief inn of the
place and always at the cost of the authorities his charges were twenty
shillings a town his expenses of living while there and his carriage
thither and back this he claimed whether he found witches or not if he
found any he claimed twenty shillings a head in addition when they were
brought to execution for about three years he carried on this infamous
trade success making him so insolent and rapacious that high and low
became his enemies the rev mr gaul a clergyman of houghton in
huntingdonshire wrote a pamphlet impugning his pretensions and accusing
him of being a common nuisance hopkins replied in an angry letter to the
functionaries of houghton stating his intention to visit their town but
desiring to know whether it afforded many such sticklers for witchcraft as
mr gaul and whether they were willing to receive and entertain him with
the customary hospitality if he so far honoured them he added by way of
threat that in case he did not receive a satisfactory reply he would
waive their shire altogether and betake himself to such places where he
might do and punish not only without control but with thanks and
recompense the authorities of houghton were not much alarmed at this
awful threat of letting them alone they very wisely took no notice either
of him or his letter
mr gaul describes in his pamphlet one of the modes employed by hopkins
which was sure to swell his revenues very considerably it was a proof
even more atrocious than the swimming he says that the witchfinder
general used to take the suspected witch and place her in the middle of a
room upon a stool or table crosslegged or in some other uneasy
posture if she refused to sit in this manner she was bound with strong
cords hopkins then placed persons to watch her for fourandtwenty hours
during which time she was to be kept without meat or drink it was
supposed that one of her imps would come during that interval and suck her
blood as the imp might come in the shape of a wasp a moth a fly or
other insect a hole was made in the door or window to let it enter the
watchers were ordered to keep a sharp look out and endeavour to kill any
insect that appeared in the room if any fly escaped and they could not
kill it the woman was guilty the fly was her imp and she was sentenced
to be burned and twenty shillings went into the pockets of master
hopkins in this manner he made one old woman confess because four flies
had appeared in the room that she was attended by four imps named
ilemazar pyewackett peckinthecrown and grizelgreedigut

it is consoling to think that this impostor perished in his own snare mr
gauls exposure and his own rapacity weakened his influence among the
magistrates and the populace who began to find that not even the most
virtuous and innocent were secure from his persecution looked upon him
with undisguised aversion he was beset by a mob at a village in suffolk
and accused of being himself a wizard an old reproach was brought against
him that he had by means of sorcery cheated the devil out of a certain
memorandumbook in which he satan had entered the names of all the
witches in england thus said the populace you find out witches not
by gods aid but by the devils in vain he denied his guilt the
populace longed to put him to his own test he was speedily stripped and
his thumbs and toes tied together he was then placed in a blanket and
cast into a pond some say that he floated and that he was taken out
tried and executed upon no other proof of his guilt others assert that
he was drowned this much is positive that there was an end of him as no
judicial entry of his trial and execution is to be found in any register
it appears most probable that he expired by the hands of the mob butler
has immortalised this scamp in the following lines of his hudibras
   hath not this present parliament
    a lieger to the devil sent
    fully empowerd to treat about
    finding revolted witches out
    and has he not within a year
    hangd threescore of them in one shire
    some only for not being drownd
    and some for sitting above ground
    whole days and nights upon their breeches
    and feeling pain were hangd for witches
    and some for putting knavish tricks
    upon green geese or turkey chicks
    or pigs that suddenly deceased
    of griefs unnatural as he guessed
    who proved himself at length a witch
    and made a rod for his own breech
in scotland also witchfinding became a trade they were known under the
designation of common prickers and like hopkins received a fee for
each witch they discovered at the trial of janet peaston in 1646 the
magistrates of dalkeith caused john kincaid of tranent the common
pricker to exercise his craft upon her he found two marks of the devils
making for she could not feel the pin when it was put into either of the
said marks nor did the marks bleed when the pin was taken out again when
she was asked where she thought the pins were put in her she pointed to a
part of her body distant from the real place they were pins of three
inches in length33
    33 pitcairns records of justiciary
these common prickers became at last so numerous that they were considered
nuisances the judges refused to take their evidence and in 1678 the
privy council of scotland condescended to hear the complaint of an honest
woman who had been indecently exposed by one of them and expressed their
opinion that common prickers were common cheats
but such an opinion was not formed in high places before hundreds of
innocent persons had fallen victims the parliaments had encouraged the
delusion both in england and scotland and by arming these fellows with a
sort of authority had in a manner forced the magistrates and ministers to
receive their evidence the fate of one poor old gentleman who fell a
victim to the arts of hopkins in 1646 deserves to be recorded mr louis
a venerable clergyman upwards of seventy years of age and who had been
rector of framlingham in suffolk for fifty years excited suspicion that
he was a wizard being a violent royalist he was likely to meet with no
sympathy at that time and even his own parishioners whom he had served
so long and so faithfully turned their backs upon him as soon as he was
accused placed under the hands of hopkins who knew so well how to bring
the refractory to confession the old man the light of whose intellect
had become somewhat dimmed from age confessed that he was a wizard he
said he had two imps that continually excited him to do evil and that one
day when he was walking on the seacoast one of them prompted him to
express a wish that a ship whose sails were just visible in the distance
might sink he consented and saw the vessel sink before his eyes he was
upon this confession tried and condemned on his trial the flame of
reason burned up as brightly as ever he denied all that had been alleged
against him and crossexamined hopkins with great tact and severity
after his condemnation he begged that the funeral service of the church
might be read for him the request was refused and he repeated it for
himself from memory as he was led to the scaffold
a poor woman in scotland was executed upon evidence even less strong than
this john bain a common pricker swore that as he passed her door he
heard her talking to the devil she said in defence that it was a
foolish practice she had of talking to herself and several of her
neighbours corroborated her statement but the evidence of the pricker was
received he swore that none ever talked to themselves who were not
witches the devils mark being found upon her the additional testimony
of her guilt was deemed conclusive and she was convict and brynt
from the year 1652 to 1682 these trials diminished annually in number
and acquittals were by no means so rare as they had been to doubt in
witchcraft was no longer dangerous before country justices condemnations
on the most absurd evidence still continued but when the judges of the
land had to charge the jury they took a more humane and philosophical
view by degrees the educated classes comprised in those days within
very narrow limits openly expressed their unbelief of modern witchcraft
although they were not bold enough to deny its existence altogether
between them and the believers in the old doctrine fierce arguments
ensued and the sceptics were designated sadducees to convince them the
learned and reverend joseph glanvil wrote his wellknown work
sadducismus triumphatus and the collection of relations the first
part intended as a philosophical inquiry into witchcraft and the power of
the devil to assume a mortal shape the latter containing what he
considered a multitude of wellauthenticated modern instances
illustration sir matthew hale
but though progress was made it was slow in 1664 the venerable sir
matthew hale condemned two women named amy duny and rose cullender to
the stake at st edmondsbury upon evidence the most ridiculous these two
old women whose ugliness gave their neighbours the first idea that they
were witches went to a shop to purchase herrings and were refused
indignant at the prejudice against them they were not sparing of their
abuse shortly afterward the daughter of the herringdealer fell sick
and a cry was raised that she was bewitched by the old women who had been
refused the herrings this girl was subject to epileptic fits to discover
the guilt of amy duny and rose cullender the girls eyes were blinded
closely with a shawl and the witches were commanded to touch her they
did so and she was immediately seized with a fit upon this evidence they
were sent to prison the girl was afterwards touched by an indifferent
person and the force of her imagination was so great that thinking it
was again the witches she fell down in a violent fit as before this
however was not received in favour of the accused
the following extract from the published reports of the trial will shew
the sort of evidence which was received
samuel pacey of leystoff a good sober man being sworn said that on
thursday the 10th of october last his younger daughter deborah about
nine years old was suddenly taken so lame that she could not stand on her
legs and so continued till the 17th of the same month when the child
desired to be carried to a bank on the east side of the house looking
towards the sea and while she was sitting there amy duny came to this
examinants house to buy some herrings but was denied then she came
twice more but being as often denied she went away discontented and
grumbling at this instant of time the child was taken with terrible
fits complaining of a pain in her stomach as if she was pricked with
pins shrieking out with a voice like a whelp and thus continued till the
30th of the same month this examinant further saith that amy duny
having long had the reputation of a witch and his child having in the
intervals of her fits constantly cried out on her as the cause of her
disorder saying that the said amy did appear to her and fright her he
himself did suspect the said amy to be a witch and charged her with being
the cause of his childs illness and set her in the stocks two days
after his daughter elizabeth was taken with such strange fits that they
could not force open her mouth without a tap and the younger child being
in the same condition they used to her the same remedy both children
grievously complained that amy duny and another woman whose habit and
looks they described did appear to them and torment them and would cry
out there stands amy duny there stands rose cullender the other
person who afflicted them their fits were not alike sometimes they were
lame on the right side sometimes on the left and sometimes so sore that
they could not bear to be touched sometimes they were perfectly well in
other respects but they could not hear at other times they could not
see sometimes they lost their speech for one two and once for eight
days together at times they had swooning fits and when they could
speak were taken with a fit of coughing and vomited phlegm and crooked
pins and once a great twopenny nail with above forty pins which nail
he the examinant saw vomited up with many of the pins the nail and
pins were produced in the court thus the children continued for two
months during which time the examinant often made them read in the new
testament and observed when they came to the words lord jesus or
christ they could not pronounce them but fell into a fit when they
came to the word satan or devil they would point and say this
bites but makes me speak right well finding his children thus tormented
without hopes of recovery he sent them to his sister margaret arnold at
yarmouth being willing to try whether change of air would help them
margaret arnold was the next witness being sworn she said that about
the 30th of november elizabeth and deborah pacey came to her house with
her brother who told her what had happened and that he thought his
children bewitched she this examinant did not much regard it supposing
the children had played tricks and put the pins into their mouths
themselves she therefore took all the pins from their clothes sewing
them with thread instead of pinning them but notwithstanding they
raised at times at least thirty pins in her presence and had terrible
fits in which fits they would cry out upon amy duny and rose cullender
saying that they saw them and heard them threatening as before that
they saw things like mice running about the house and one of them catched
one and threw it into the fire which made a noise like a rat another
time the younger child being out of doors a thing like a bee would have
forced itself into her mouth at which the child ran screaming into the
house and before this examinant could come at her fell into a fit and
vomited a twopenny nail with a broad head after that this examinant
asked the child how she came by this nail when she answered the bee
brought the nail and forced it into my mouth at other times the eldest
child told this examinant that she saw flies bring her crooked pins she
would then fall into a fit and vomit such pins one time the said child
said she saw a mouse and crept under the table to look for it and
afterwards the child seemed to put something into her apron saying she
had caught it she then ran to the fire and threw it in on which there
did appear to this examinant something like a flash of gunpowder although
she does own she saw nothing in the childs hand once the child being
speechless but otherwise very sensible ran up and down the house
crying hush hush as if she had seen poultry but this examinant saw
nothing at last the child catched at something and threw it into the
fire afterwards when the child could speak this examinant asked her
what she saw at the time she answered that she saw a duck another time
the youngest child said after a fit that amy duny had been with her and
tempted her to drown herself or cut her throat or otherwise destroy
herself another time they both cried out upon amy duny and rose
cullender saying why dont you come yourselves why do you send your
imps to torment us
the celebrated sir thomas brown the author of vulgar errors was also
examined as a witness upon the trial being desired to give his opinion of
the three persons in court he said he was clearly of opinion that they
were bewitched he said there had lately been a discovery of witches in
denmark who used the same way of tormenting persons by conveying crooked
pins needles and nails into their bodies that he thought in such
cases the devil acted upon human bodies by natural means namely by
exciting and stirring up the superabundant humours he did afflict them in
a more surprising manner by the same diseases their bodies were usually
subject to that these fits might be natural only raised to a great
degree by the subtlety of the devil cooperating with the malice of these
witches
illustration sir thomas brown
the evidence being concluded sir matthew hale addressed the jury he
said he would waive repeating the evidence to prevent any mistake and
told the jury there were two things they had to inquire into first
whether or not these children were bewitched secondly whether these
women did bewitch them he said he did not in the least doubt there were
witches first because the scriptures affirmed it secondly because the
wisdom of all nations particularly our own had provided laws against
witchcraft which implied their belief of such a crime he desired them
strictly to observe the evidence and begged of god to direct their hearts
in the weighty concern they had in hand since to condemn the innocent
and let the guilty go free are both an abomination to the lord
the jury then retired and in about half an hour returned a verdict of
guilty upon all the indictments being thirteen in number the next
morning the children came with their father to the lodgings of sir matthew
hale very well and quite restored to their usual health mr pacey
being asked at what time their health began to improve replied that they
were quite well in half an hour after the conviction of the prisoners
many attempts were made to induce the unfortunate women to confess their
guilt but in vain and they were both hanged
eleven trials were instituted before chief justice holt for witchcraft
between the years 1694 and 1701 the evidence was of the usual character
but holt appealed so successfully in each case to the common sense of the
jury that they were every one acquitted a general feeling seemed to
pervade the country that blood enough had been shed upon these absurd
charges now and then the flame of persecution burnt up in a remote
district but these instances were no longer looked upon as mere matters
of course they appear on the contrary to have excited much attention a
sure proof if no other were to be obtained that they were becoming
unfrequent
a case of witchcraft was tried in 1711 before lord chief justice powell
in which however the jury persisted in a verdict of guilty though the
evidence was of the usual absurd and contradictory character and the
enlightened judge did all in his power to bring them to a right
conclusion the accused person was one jane wenham better known as the
witch of walkerne and the persons who were alleged to have suffered from
her witchcraft were two young women named thorne and street a witness
named mr arthur chauncy deposed that he had seen ann thorne in several
of her fits and that she always recovered upon prayers being said or if
jane wenham came to her he related that he had pricked the prisoner
several times in the arms but could never fetch any blood from her that
he had seen her vomit pins when there were none in her clothes or within
her reach and that he had preserved several of them which he was ready
to produce the judge however told him that was needless as he
supposed they were crooked pins
mr francis bragge another witness deposed that strange cakes of
bewitched feathers having been taken from ann thornes pillow he was
anxious to see them he went into a room where some of these feathers
were and took two of the cakes and compared them together they were
both of a circular figure something larger than a crown piece and he
observed that the small feathers were placed in a nice and curious order
at equal distances from each other making so many radii of the circle in
the centre of which the quillends of the feathers met he counted the
number of these feathers and found them to be exactly thirtytwo in each
cake he afterwards endeavoured to pull off two or three of them and
observed that they were all fastened together by a sort of viscous matter
which would stretch seven or eight times in a thread before it broke
having taken off several of these feathers he removed the viscous matter
with his fingers and found under it in the centre some short hairs
black and grey matted together which he verily believed to be cats
hair he also said that jane wenham confessed to him that she had
bewitched the pillow and had practised witchcraft for sixteen years
the judge interrupted the witness at this stage and said he should very
much like to see an enchanted feather and seemed to wonder when he was
told that none of these strange cakes had been preserved his lordship
asked the witness why he did not keep one or two of them and was informed
that they had all been burnt in order to relieve the bewitched person of
the pains she suffered which could not be so well effected by any other
means
a man named thomas ireland deposed that hearing several times a great
noise of cats crying and screaming about his house he went out and
frightened them away and they all ran towards the cottage of jane wenham
one of them he swore positively had a face very like jane wenhams
another man named burville gave similar evidence and swore that he had
often seen a cat with jane wenhams face upon one occasion he was in ann
thornes chamber when several cats came in and among them the cat above
stated this witness would have favoured the court with a much longer
statement but was stopped by the judge who said he had heard quite
enough
the prisoner in her defence said nothing but that she was a clear
woman the learned judge then summed up leaving it to the jury to
determine whether such evidence as they had heard was sufficient to take
away the prisoners life upon the indictment after a long deliberation
they brought in their verdict that she was guilty upon the evidence the
judge then asked them whether they found her guilty upon the indictment of
conversing with the devil in the shape of a cat the sapient foreman very
gravely answered we find her guilty of that the learned judge then
very reluctantly proceeded to pass sentence of death but by his
persevering exertions a pardon was at last obtained and the wretched old
woman was set at liberty
in the year 1716 a woman and her daughterthe latter only nine years of
agewere hanged at huntingdon for selling their souls to the devil and
raising a storm by pulling off their stockings and making a lather of
soap this appears to have been the last judicial execution in england
from that time to the year 1736 the populace raised at intervals the old
cry and more than once endangered the lives of poor women by dragging
them through ponds on suspicion but the philosophy of those who from
their position sooner or later give the tone to the opinions and morals
of the poor was silently working a cure for the evil the fear of witches
ceased to be epidemic and became individual lingering only in minds
fettered by inveterate prejudice or brutalising superstition in the year
1736 the penal statute of james i was finally blotted from the
statutebook and suffered no longer to disgrace the advancing
intelligence of the country pretenders to witchcraft fortunetellers
conjurors and all their train were liable only to the common punishment
of rogues and impostorsimprisonment and the pillory
in scotland the delusion also assumed the same phases and was gradually
extinguished in the light of civilisation as in england the progress of
improvement was slow up to the year 1665 little or no diminution of the
mania was perceptible in 1643 the general assembly recommended that the
privy council should institute a standing commission composed of any
understanding gentlemen or magistrates to try the witches who were
stated to have increased enormously of late years in 1649 an act was
passed confirmatory of the original statute of queen mary explaining
some points of the latter which were doubtful and enacting severe
penalties not only against witches themselves but against all who
covenanted with them or sought by their means to pry into the secrets of
futurity or cause any evil to the life lands or limbs of their
neighbours for the next ten years the popular madness upon this subject
was perhaps more furious than ever upwards of four thousand persons
suffered for the crime during that interval this was the consequence of
the act of parliament and the unparalleled severity of the magistrates
the latter frequently complained that for two witches they burned one day
there were ten to burn the next they never thought that they themselves
were the cause of the increase in a single circuit held at glasgow ayr
and stirling in 1659 seventeen unhappy creatures were burned by judicial
sentence for trafficking with satan in one day november 7 1661 the
privy council issued no less than fourteen commissions for trials in the
provinces next year the violence of the persecution seems to have
abated from 1662 to 1668 although the understanding gentlemen and
magistrates already mentioned continued to try and condemn the high
court of justiciary had but one offender of this class to deal with and
she was acquitted james welsh a common pricker was ordered to be
publicly whipped through the streets of edinburgh for falsely accusing a
woman of witchcraft a fact which alone proves that the superior court
sifted the evidence in these cases with much more care and severity than
it had done a few years previously the enlightened sir george mackenzie
styled by dryden the noble wit of scotland laboured hard to introduce
this rule into court that the confessions of the witches should be held
of little worth and that the evidence of the prickers and other
interested persons should be received with distrust and jealousy this was
reversing the old practice and saved many innocent lives though a firm
believer both in ancient and modern witchcraft he could not shut his eyes
to the atrocities daily committed under the name of justice in his work
on the criminal law of scotland published in 1678 he says from the
horridness of this crime i do conclude that of all others it requires
the clearest relevancy and most convincing probature and i condemn next
to the witches themselves those cruel and too forward judges who burn
persons by thousands as guilty of this crime in the same year sir john
clerk plumply refused to serve as a commissioner on trials for witchcraft
alleging by way of excuse that he was not himself good conjuror enough
to be duly qualified the views entertained by sir george mackenzie were
so favourably received by the lords of session that he was deputed in
1680 to report to them on the cases of a number of poor women who were
then in prison awaiting their trial sir george stated that there was no
evidence against them whatever but their own confessions which were
absurd and contradictory and drawn from them by severe torture they were
immediately discharged
for the next sixteen years the lords of session were unoccupied with
trials for witchcraft not one is entered upon the record but in 1697 a
case occurred which equalled in absurdity any of those that signalised the
dark reign of king james a girl named christiana shaw eleven years of
age the daughter of john shaw of bargarran was subject to fits and
being of a spiteful temper she accused her maidservant with whom she
had frequent quarrels of bewitching her her story unfortunately was
believed encouraged to tell all the persecutions of the devil which the
maid had sent to torment her she in the end concocted a romance that
involved twentyone persons there was no other evidence against them but
the fancies of this lying child and the confessions which pain had
extorted from them but upon this no less than five women were condemned
before lord blantyre and the rest of the commissioners appointed
specially by the privy council to try this case they were burned on the
green at paisley the warlock of the party one john reed who was also
condemned hanged himself in prison it was the general belief in paisley
that the devil had strangled him lest he should have revealed in his last
moments too many of the unholy secrets of witchcraft this trial excited
considerable disgust in scotland the rev mr bell a contemporary
writer observed that in this business persons of more goodness and
esteem than most of their calumniators were defamed for witches he adds
that the persons chiefly to blame were certain ministers of too much
forwardness and absurd credulity and some topping professors in and about
glasgow34
    34 preface to laws memorials edited by sharpe
after this trial there again occurs a lapse of seven years when the
subject was painfully forced upon public attention by the brutal cruelty
of the mob at pittenween two women were accused of having bewitched a
strolling beggar who was subject to fits or who pretended to be so for
the purpose of exciting commiseration they were cast into prison and
tortured until they confessed one of them named janet cornfoot
contrived to escape but was brought back to pittenween next day by a
party of soldiers on her approach to the town she was unfortunately met
by a furious mob composed principally of fishermen and their wives who
seized upon her with the intention of swimming her they forced her away
to the seashore and tying a rope around her body secured the end of it
to the mast of a fishingboat lying alongside in this manner they ducked
her several times when she was half dead a sailor in the boat cut away
the rope and the mob dragged her through the sea to the beach here as
she lay quite insensible a brawny ruffian took down the door of his hut
close by and placed it on her back the mob gathered large stones from
the beach and piled them upon her till the wretched woman was pressed to
death no magistrate made the slightest attempt to interfere and the
soldiers looked on delighted spectators a great outcry was raised
against this culpable remissness but no judicial inquiry was set on foot
this happened in 1704
the next case we hear of is that of elspeth rule found guilty of
witchcraft before lord anstruther at the dumfries circuit in 1708 she
was sentenced to be marked in the cheek with a redhot iron and banished
the realm of scotland for life
again there is a long interval in 1718 the remote county of caithness
where the delusion remained in all its pristine vigour for years after it
had ceased elsewhere was startled from its propriety by the cry of
witchcraft a silly fellow named william montgomery a carpenter had a
mortal antipathy to cats and somehow or other these animals generally
chose his backyard as the scene of their catterwaulings he puzzled his
brains for a long time to know why he above all his neighbours should be
so pestered at last he came to the sage conclusion that his tormentors
were no cats but witches in this opinion he was supported by his
maidservant who swore a round oath that she had often heard the
aforesaid cats talking together in human voices the next time the unlucky
tabbies assembled in his backyard the valiant carpenter was on the
alert arming himself with an axe a dirk and a broadsword he rushed out
among them one of them he wounded in the back a second in the hip and
the leg of a third he maimed with his axe but he could not capture any of
them a few days afterwards two old women of the parish died and it was
said that when their bodies were laid out there appeared upon the back
of one the mark as of a recent wound and a similar scar upon the hip of
the other the carpenter and his maid were convinced that they were the
very cats and the whole county repeated the same story every one was
upon the lookout for proofs corroborative a very remarkable one was soon
discovered nanny gilbert a wretched old creature of upwards of seventy
years of age was found in bed with her leg broken as she was ugly enough
for a witch it was asserted that she also was one of the cats that had
fared so ill at the hands of the carpenter the latter when informed of
the popular suspicion asserted that he distinctly remembered to have
struck one of the cats a blow with the back of his broadsword which ought
to have broken her leg nanny was immediately dragged from her bed and
thrown into prison before she was put to the torture she explained in a
very natural and intelligible manner how she had broken her limb but this
account did not give satisfaction the professional persuasions of the
torturer made her tell a different tale and she confessed that she was
indeed a witch and had been wounded by montgomery on the night stated
that the two old women recently deceased were witches also besides about
a score of others whom she named the poor creature suffered so much by
the removal from her own home and the tortures inflicted upon her that
she died the next day in prison happily for the persons she had named in
her confession dundas of arniston at that time the kings
advocategeneral wrote to the sheriffdepute one captain ross of
littledean cautioning him not to proceed to trial the thing being of
too great difficulty and beyond the jurisdiction of an inferior court
dundas himself examined the precognition with great care and was so
convinced of the utter folly of the whole case that he quashed all
further proceedings
we find this same sheriffdepute of caithness very active four years
afterwards in another trial for witchcraft in spite of the warning he had
received that all such cases were to be tried in future by the superior
courts he condemned to death an old woman at dornoch upon the charge of
bewitching the cows and pigs of her neighbours this poor creature was
insane and actually laughed and clapped her hands at sight of the bonnie
fire that was to consume her she had a daughter who was lame both of her
hands and feet and one of the charges brought against her was that she
had used this daughter as a pony in her excursions to join the devils
sabbath and that the devil himself had shod her and produced lameness
this was the last execution that took place in scotland for witchcraft
the penal statutes were repealed in 1736 and as in england whipping
the pillory or imprisonment were declared the future punishments of all
pretenders to magic or witchcraft
still for many years after this the superstition lingered both in england
and scotland and in some districts is far from being extinct even at this
day but before we proceed to trace it any further than to its legal
extinction we have yet to see the frightful havoc it made in continental
europe from the commencement of the seventeenth to the middle of the
eighteenth century france germany and switzerland were the countries
which suffered most from the epidemic the number of victims in these
countries during the sixteenth century has already been mentioned but at
the early part of the seventeenth the numbers are so great especially in
germany that were they not to be found in the official records of the
tribunals it would be almost impossible to believe that mankind could
ever have been so maddened and deluded to use the words of the learned
and indefatigable horst35 the world seemed to be like a large madhouse
for witches and devils to play their antics in satan was believed to be
at every bodys call to raise the whirlwind draw down the lightning
blight the productions of the earth or destroy the health and paralyse
the limbs of man this belief so insulting to the majesty and beneficence
of the creator was shared by the most pious ministers of religion those
who in their morning and evening prayers acknowledged the one true god
and praised him for the blessings of the seedtime and the harvest were
convinced that frail humanity could enter into a compact with the spirits
of hell to subvert his laws and thwart all his merciful intentions
successive popes from innocent viii downwards promulgated this
degrading doctrine which spread so rapidly that society seemed to be
divided into two great factions the bewitching and the bewitched

the commissioners named by innocent viii to prosecute the witchtrials in
germany were jacob sprenger so notorious for his work on demonology
entitled the malleus maleficarum or hammer to knock down witches henry
institor a learned jurisconsult and the bishop of strasburgh bamberg
trves cologne paderborn and wrzburg were the chief seats of the
commissioners who during their lives alone condemned to the stake on a
very moderate calculation upwards of three thousand victims the number
of witches so increased that new commissioners were continually appointed
in germany france and switzerland in spain and portugal the inquisition
alone took cognisance of the crime it is impossible to search the records
of those dark but now happily nonexisting tribunals but the mind
recoils with affright even to form a guess of the multitudes who perished
the mode of trial in the other countries is more easily ascertained
sprenger in germany and bodinus and delrio in france have left but too
ample a record of the atrocities committed in the muchabused names of
justice and religion bodinus of great repute and authority in the
seventeenth century says the trial of this offence must not be
conducted like other crimes whoever adheres to the ordinary course of
justice perverts the spirit of the law both divine and human he who is
accused of sorcery should never be acquitted unless the malice of the
prosecutor be clearer than the sun for it is so difficult to bring full
proof of this secret crime that out of a million of witches not one would
be convicted if the usual course were followed henri boguet a
witchfinder who styled himself the grand judge of witches for the
territory of st claude drew up a code for the guidance of all persons
engaged in the witchtrials consisting of seventy articles quite as
cruel as the code of bodinus in this document he affirms that a mere
suspicion of witchcraft justifies the immediate arrest and torture of the
suspected person if the prisoner muttered looked on the ground and did
not shed any tears all these were proofs positive of guilt in all cases
of witchcraft the evidence of the child ought to be taken against its
parent and persons of notoriously bad character although not to be
believed upon their oaths on the ordinary occasions of dispute that might
arise between man and man were to be believed if they swore that any
person had bewitched them who when he hears that this diabolical
doctrine was the universally received opinion of the ecclesiastical and
civil authorities can wonder that thousands upon thousands of unhappy
persons should be brought to the stake that cologne should for many years
burn its three hundred witches annually the district of bamberg its four
hundred nuremberg geneva paris toulouse lyons and other cities
their two hundred
a few of these trials may be cited taking them in the order of priority
as they occurred in different parts of the continent in 1595 an old
woman residing in a village near constance angry at not being invited to
share the sports of the country people on a day of public rejoicing was
heard to mutter something to herself and was afterwards seen to proceed
through the fields towards a hill where she was lost sight of a violent
thunderstorm arose about two hours afterwards which wet the dancers to
the skin and did considerable damage to the plantations this woman
suspected before of witchcraft was seized and imprisoned and accused of
having raised the storm by filling a hole with wine and stirring it
about with a stick she was tortured till she confessed and was burned
alive the next evening
illustration city of lyons
about the same time two sorcerers in toulouse were accused of having
dragged a crucifix about the streets at midnight stopping at times to
spit upon and kick it and uttering at intervals an exorcism to raise the
devil the next day a hailstorm did considerable damage to the crops and
a girl the daughter of a shoemaker in the town remembered to have heard
in the night the execrations of the wizards her story led to their
arrest the usual means to produce confession were resorted to the
wizards owned that they could raise tempests whenever they pleased and
named several persons who possessed similar powers they were hanged and
then burned in the marketplace and seven of the persons they had
mentioned shared the same fate
hoppo and stadlin two noted wizards of germany were executed in 1599
they implicated twenty or thirty witches who went about causing women to
miscarry bringing down the lightning of heaven and making maidens bring
forth toads to this latter fact several girls were found to swear most
positively stadlin confessed that he had killed seven infants in the womb
of one woman
bodinus highly praises the exertions of a witchfinder named nider in
france who prosecuted so many that he could not calculate them some of
these witches could by a single word cause people to fall down dead
others made women go with child three years instead of nine months while
others by certain invocations and ceremonies could turn the faces of
their enemies upside down or twist them round to their backs although no
witness was ever procured who saw persons in this horrible state the
witches confessed that they had the power and exercised it nothing more
was wanting to ensure the stake
at amsterdam a crazy girl confessed that she could cause sterility in
cattle and bewitch pigs and poultry by merely repeating the magic words
turius und shurius inturius she was hanged and burned another woman in
the same city named kornelis van purmerund was arrested in consequence
of some disclosures the former had made a witness came forward and swore
that she one day looked through the window of her hut and saw kornelis
sitting before a fire muttering something to the devil she was sure it
was to the devil because she heard him answer her shortly afterwards
twelve black cats ascended out of the floor and danced on their hind legs
around the witch for the space of about half an hour they then vanished
with a horrid noise and leaving a disagreeable smell behind them she
also was hanged and burned
at bamberg in bavaria the executions from the year 1610 to 1640 were at
the rate of about a hundred annually one woman suspected of witchcraft
was seized because having immoderately praised the beauty of a child it
had shortly afterwards fallen ill and died she confessed upon the rack
that the devil had given her the power to work evil upon those she hated
by speaking words in their praise if she said with unwonted fervour
what a strong man what a lovely woman what a sweet child the
devil understood her and afflicted them with diseases immediately it is
quite unnecessary to state the end of this poor creature many women were
executed for causing strange substances to lodge in the bodies of those
who offended them bits of wood nails hair eggshells bits of glass
shreds of linen and woollen cloth pebbles and even hot cinders and
knives were the articles generally chosen these were believed to remain
in the body till the witches confessed or were executed when they were
voided from the bowels or by the mouth nostrils or ears modern
physicians have often had cases of a similar description under their care
where girls have swallowed needles which have been voided on the arms
legs and other parts of the body but the science of that day could not
account for these phenomena otherwise than by the power of the devil and
every needle swallowed by a servantmaid cost an old woman her life nay
if no more than one suffered in consequence the district might think
itself fortunate the commissioners seldom stopped short at one victim
the revelations of the rack in most cases implicated half a score

of all the records of the witchtrials preserved for the wonder of
succeeding ages that of wrzburg from 1627 to 1629 is the most
frightful hauber who has preserved this list in his acta et scripta
magica says in a note at the end that it is far from complete and
that there were a great many other burnings too numerous to specify this
record which relates to the city only and not to the province of
wrzburg contains the names of one hundred and fiftyseven persons who
were burned in two years in twentynine burnings averaging from five to
six at a time the list comprises three playactors four innkeepers
three common councilmen of wrzburg fourteen vicars of the cathedral the
burgomasters lady an apothecarys wife and daughter two choristers of
the cathedral gbel babelin the prettiest girl in the town and the
wife the two little sons and the daughter of the councillor stolzenberg
rich and poor young and old suffered alike at the seventh of these
recorded burnings the victims are described as a wandering boy twelve
years of age and four strange men and women found sleeping in the
marketplace thirtytwo of the whole number appear to have been vagrants
of both sexes who failing to give a satisfactory account of themselves
were accused and found guilty of witchcraft the number of children on the
list is horrible to think upon the thirteenth and fourteenth burnings
comprised four persons who are stated to have been a little maiden nine
years of age a maiden still less her sister their mother and their
aunt a pretty young woman of twentyfour at the eighteenth burning the
victims were two boys of twelve and a girl of fifteen at the nineteenth
the young heir of the noble house of rotenhahn aged nine and two other
boys one aged ten and the other twelve among other entries appear the
names of baunach the fattest and steinacher the richest burgher in
wrzburg what tended to keep up the delusion in this unhappy city and
indeed all over europe was the number of hypochondriac and diseased
persons who came voluntarily forward and made confession of witchcraft
several of the victims in the foregoing list had only themselves to blame
for their fate many again including the apothecarys wife and daughter
already mentioned pretended to sorcery and sold poisons or attempted by
means of charms and incantations to raise the devil but throughout all
this fearful period the delusion of the criminals was as great as that of
the judges depraved persons who in ordinary times would have been thieves
or murderers added the desire of sorcery to their depravity sometimes
with the hope of acquiring power over their fellows and sometimes with
the hope of securing impunity in this world by the protection of satan
one of the persons executed at the first burning a prostitute was heard
repeating the exorcism which was supposed to have the power of raising the
arch enemy in the form of a goat this precious specimen of human folly
has been preserved by horst in his zauberbibliothek it ran as follows
and was to be repeated slowly with many ceremonies and wavings of the
hand
   lalle bachera magotte baphia dajam
    vagoth heneche ammi nagaz adomator
    raphael immanuel christus tetragrammaton
    agra jod loi knig knig
the two last words were uttered quickly and with a sort of scream and
were supposed to be highly agreeable to satan who loved to be called a
king if he did not appear immediately it was necessary to repeat a
further exorcism the one in greatest repute was as follows and was to be
read backwards with the exception of the last two words
   anion lalle sabolos sado pater aziel
    adonai sado vagoth agra jod
    baphra komm komm
when the witch wanted to get rid of the devil who was sometimes in the
habit of prolonging his visits to an unconscionable length she had only
to repeat the following also backwards when he generally disappeared
leaving behind him a suffocating smell
   zellianelle heotti bonus vagotha
    plisos sother osech unicus beelzebub
    dax komm komm
this nonsensical jargon soon became known to all the idle and foolish boys
of germany many an unhappy urchin who in a youthful frolic had repeated
it paid for his folly the penalty of his life three whose ages varied
from ten to fifteen were burned alive at wrzburg for no other offence
of course every other boy in the city became still more convinced of the
power of the charm one boy confessed that he would willingly have sold
himself to the devil if he could have raised him for a good dinner and
cakes every day of his life and a pony to ride upon this luxurious
youngster instead of being horsewhipped for his folly was hanged and
burned
the small district of lindheim was if possible even more notorious than
wrzburg for the number of its witchburnings in the year 1633 a famous
witch named pomp anna who could cause her foes to fall sick by merely
looking at them was discovered and burned along with three of her
companions every year in this parish consisting at most of a thousand
persons the average number of executions was five between the years 1660
and 1664 the number consumed was thirty if the executions all over
germany had been in this frightful proportion hardly a family could have
escaped losing one of its members
in 1627 a ballad entitled the druten zeitung or the witches
gazette was very popular in germany it detailed according to the
titlepage of a copy printed at smalcald in 1627 an account of the
remarkable events which took place in franconia bamberg and wrzburg
with those wretches who from avarice or ambition have sold themselves to
the devil and how they had their reward at last set to music and to be
sung to the tune of dorothea the sufferings of the witches at the stake
are explained in it with great minuteness the poet waxing extremely witty
when he describes the horrible contortions of pain upon their
countenances and the shrieks that rent the air when any one of more than
common guilt was burned alive a trick resorted to in order to force one
witch to confess is told in this doggrel as an excellent joke as she
obstinately refused to own that she was in league with the powers of evil
the commissioners suggested that the hangman should dress himself in a
bears skin with the horns tail and all the etceteras and in this
form penetrate into her dungeon the woman in the darkness of her cell
could not detect the imposture aided as it was by her own superstitious
fears she thought she was actually in the presence of the prince of hell
and when she was told to keep up her courage and that she should be
relieved from the power of her enemies she fell on her knees before the
supposed devil and swore to dedicate herself hereafter body and soul to
his service germany is perhaps the only country in europe where the
delusion was so great as to have made such detestable verses as these the
favourites of the people
     man shickt ein henkersknecht
    zu ihr in gefngniss nunter
      den man hat kleidet recht
    mit einer brnhaute
      als wenns der teufel wr
    als ihm die drut anschaute
      meints ihr buhl kam daher
    sie sprach zu ihm behende
      wie lsst du mich so lang
    in der obrigkeit hnde

    36 they sent a hangmans assistant down to her in her prison
         they clothed him properly in a bears skin as if he were the
         devil him when the witch saw she thought he was her
         familiar she said to him quickly why hast thou left me so
         long in the magistrates hands help me out of their power
         as thou hast promised and i will be thine alone help me
         from this anguish o thou dearest devil or lover mine
this rare poet adds that in making such an appeal to the hangman the
witch never imagined the roast that was to be made of her and puts in by
way of parenthesis was not that fine funwas das war fr ein spiel
as feathers thrown into the air shew how the wind blows so this trumpery
ballad serves to shew the current of popular feeling at the time of its
composition
all readers of history are familiar with the celebrated trial of the
marchale dancre who was executed in paris in the year 1617 although
witchcraft was one of the accusations brought against her the real crime
for which she suffered was her ascendency over the mind of mary of
medicis and the consequent influence she exercised indirectly over the
unworthy king louis xiii her coachman gave evidence that she had
sacrificed a cock at midnight in one of the churches and others swore
they had seen her go secretly into the house of a noted witch named
isabella when asked by what means she had acquired so extraordinary an
influence over the mind of the queen mother she replied boldly that she
exercised no other power over her than that which a strong mind can always
exercise over the weak she died with great firmness
in two years afterwards scenes far more horrible than any that had yet
taken place in france were enacted at labourt at the foot of the
pyrenees the parliament of bourdeaux scandalised at the number of
witches who were said to infest labourt and its neighbourhood deputed one
of its own members the noted pierre de lancre and its president
espaignel to inquire into the matter with full powers to punish the
offenders they arrived at labourt in may 1619 de lancre wrote a book
setting forth all his great deeds in this battle against the powers of
evil it is full of obscenity and absurdity but the facts may be relied
on as far as they relate to the number of trials and executions and the
strange confessions which torture forced from the unhappy criminals
de lancre states as a reason why so many witches were to be found at
labourt that the country was mountainous and sterile he discovered many
of them from their partiality to smoking tobacco it may be inferred from
this that he was of the opinion of king james that tobacco was the
devils weed when the commission first sat the number of persons
brought to trial was about forty a day the acquittals did not average so
many as five per cent all the witches confessed that they had been
present at the great domdaniel or sabbath at these saturnalia the devil
sat upon a large gilded throne sometimes in the form of a goat sometimes
as a gentleman dressed all in black with boots spurs and sword and
very often as a shapeless mass resembling the trunk of a blasted tree
seen indistinctly amid the darkness they generally proceeded to the
domdaniel riding on spits pitchforks or broomsticks and on their
arrival indulged with the fiends in every species of debauchery upon one
occasion they had had the audacity to celebrate this festival in the very
heart of the city of bourdeaux the throne of the arch fiend was placed in
the middle of the place de gallienne and the whole space was covered with
the multitude of witches and wizards who flocked to it from far and near
some arriving even from distant scotland
after two hundred poor wretches had been hanged and burned there seemed
no diminution in the number of criminals to be tried many of the latter
were asked upon the rack what satan had said when he found that the
commissioners were proceeding with such severity the general reply was
that he did not seem to care much about it some of them asserted that
they had boldly reproached him for suffering the execution of their
friends saying out upon thee false fiend thy promise was that they
should not die look how thou hast kept thy word they have been burned
and are a heap of ashes upon these occasions he was never offended he
would give orders that the sports of the domdaniel should cease and
producing illusory fires that did not burn he encouraged them to walk
through assuring them that the fires lighted by the executioner gave no
more pain than those they would then ask him where their friends were
since they had not suffered to which the father of lies invariably
replied that they were happy in a far country and could see and hear all
that was then passing and that if they called by name those they wished
to converse with they might hear their voices in reply satan then
imitated the voices of the defunct witches so successfully that they were
all deceived having answered all objections the orgies recommenced and
lasted till the cock crew
de lancre was also very zealous in the trial of unhappy monomaniacs for
the crime of lycanthropy several who were arrested confessed without
being tortured that they were weirwolves and that at night they
rushed out among the flocks and herds killing and devouring one young man
at besanon with the full consciousness of the awful fate that awaited
him voluntarily gave himself up to the commissioner espaignel and
confessed that he was the servant of a strong fiend who was known by the
name of lord of the forests by his power he was transformed into the
likeness of a wolf the lord of the forests assumed the same shape but
was much larger fiercer and stronger they prowled about the pastures
together at midnight strangling the watchdogs that defended the folds
and killing more sheep than they could devour he felt he said a fierce
pleasure in these excursions and howled in excess of joy as he tore with
his fangs the warm flesh of the sheep asunder this youth was not alone in
this horrid confession many others voluntarily owned that they were
weirwolves and many more were forced by torture to make the same
avowal such criminals were thought to be too atrocious to be hanged first
and then burned they were generally sentenced to be burned alive and
their ashes to be scattered to the winds grave and learned doctors of
divinity openly sustained the possibility of these transformations
relying mainly upon the history of nebuchadnezzar they could not imagine
why if he had been an ox modern men could not become wolves by divine
permission and the power of the devil they also contended that if men
should confess it was evidence enough if there had been no other delrio
mentions that one gentleman accused of lycanthropy was put to the torture
no less than twenty times but still he would not confess an intoxicating
draught was then given him and under its influence he confessed that he
was a weirwolf delrio cites this to shew the extreme equity of the
commissioners they never burned any body till he confessed and if one
course of torture would not suffice their patience was not exhausted and
they tried him again and again even to the twentieth time well may we
exclaim when such atrocities have been committed in the name of religion
   quel lion quel tigre gale en cruaut

the trial of the unhappy urbain grandier the curate of loudun for
bewitching a number of girls in the convent of the ursulines in that town
was like that of the marchale dancre an accusation resorted to by his
enemies to ruin one against whom no other charge could be brought so
readily this noted affair which kept france in commotion for months and
the true character of which was known even at that time merits no more
than a passing notice in this place it did not spring from the epidemic
dread of sorcery then so prevalent but was carried on by wretched
intriguers who had sworn to have the life of their foe such a charge
could not be refuted in 1634 the accused could not as bodinus expresses
it make the malice of the prosecutors more clear than the sun and his
own denial however intelligible honest and straightforward was held as
nothing in refutation of the testimony of the crazy women who imagined
themselves bewitched the more absurd and contradictory their assertions
the stronger the argument employed by his enemies that the devil was in
them he was burned alive under circumstances of great cruelty37
    37 a very graphic account of the execution of this unfortunate
         gentleman is to be found in the excellent romance of m
         alfred de vigny entitled cinq mars but if the reader
         wishes for a full and accurate detail of all the
         circumstances of one of the most extraordinary trials upon
         record he is referred to a work published anonymously at
         amsterdam in 1693 entitled histoire des diables de loudun
         ou de la possession des religieuses ursulines et de la
         condemnation et du supplice durbain grandier
a singular instance of the epidemic fear of witchcraft occurred at lille
in 1639 a pious but not very sane lady named antoinette bourignon
founded a school or hospice in that city one day on entering the
schoolroom she imagined that she saw a great number of little black
angels flying about the heads of the children in great alarm she told her
pupils of what she had seen warning them to beware of the devil whose
imps were hovering about them the foolish woman continued daily to repeat
the same story and satan and his power became the only subject of
conversation not only between the girls themselves but between them and
their instructors one of them at this time ran away from the school on
being brought back and interrogated she said she had not run away but
had been carried away by the devil she was a witch and had been one
since the age of seven some other little girls in the school went into
fits at this announcement and on their recovery confessed that they
also were witches at last the whole of them to the number of fifty
worked upon each others imaginations to such a degree that they also
confessed that they were witchesthat they attended the domdaniel or
meeting of the fiendsthat they could ride through the air on
broomsticks feast on infants flesh or creep through a keyhole
the citizens of lille were astounded at these disclosures the clergy
hastened to investigate the matter many of them to their credit openly
expressed their opinion that the whole affair was an imposturenot so the
majority they strenuously insisted that the confessions of the children
were valid and that it was necessary to make an example by burning them
all for witches the poor parents alarmed for their offspring implored
the examining capuchins with tears in their eyes to save their young
lives insisting that they were bewitched and not bewitching this
opinion also gained ground in the town antoinette bourignon who had put
these absurd notions into the heads of the children was accused of
witchcraft and examined before the council the circumstances of the case
seemed so unfavourable towards her that she would not stay for a second
examination disguising herself as she best could she hastened out of
lille and escaped pursuit if she had remained four hours longer she
would have been burned by judicial sentence as a witch and a heretic it
is to be hoped that wherever she went she learned the danger of
tampering with youthful minds and was never again entrusted with the
management of children
the duke of brunswick and the elector of menz were struck with the great
cruelty exercised in the torture of suspected persons and convinced at
the same time that no righteous judge would consider a confession
extorted by pain and contradictory in itself as sufficient evidence to
justify the execution of any accused person it is related of the duke of
brunswick that he invited two learned jesuits to his house who were known
to entertain strong opinions upon the subject of witchcraft with a view
of shewing them the cruelty and absurdity of such practices a woman lay
in the dungeon of the city accused of witchcraft and the duke having
given previous instructions to the officiating torturers went with the
two jesuits to hear her confession by a series of artful leading
questions the poor creature in the extremity of her anguish was induced
to confess that she had often attended the sabbath of the fiends upon the
brocken that she had seen two jesuits there who had made themselves
notorious even among witches for their abominations that she had seen
them assume the form of goats wolves and other animals and that many
noted witches had borne them five six and seven children at a birth who
had heads like toads and legs like spiders being asked if the jesuits
were far from her she replied that they were in the room beside her the
duke of brunswick led his astounded friends away and explained the
stratagem this was convincing proof to both of them that thousands of
persons had suffered unjustly they knew their own innocence and
shuddered to think what their fate might have been if an enemy instead of
a friend had put such a confession into the mouth of a criminal one of
these jesuits was frederick spee the author of the cautio criminalis
published in 1631 this work exposing the horrors of the witchtrials
had a most salutary effect in germany schonbrunn archbishop and elector
of menz abolished the torture entirely within his dominions and his
example was imitated by the duke of brunswick and other potentates the
number of supposed witches immediately diminished and the violence of the
mania began to subside the elector of brandenburg issued a rescript in
1654 with respect to the case of anna of ellerbrock a supposed witch
forbidding the use of torture and stigmatising the swimming of witches as
an unjust cruel and deceitful test
this was the beginning of the dawn after the longprotracted darkness the
tribunals no longer condemned witches to execution by hundreds in a year
wrzburg the grand theatre of the burnings burned but one where forty
years previously it had burned three score from 1660 to 1670 the
electoral chambers in all parts of germany constantly commuted the
sentence of death passed by the provincial tribunals into imprisonment for
life or burning on the cheek
illustration rouen
a truer philosophy had gradually disabused the public mind learned men
freed themselves from the trammels of a debasing superstition and
governments both civil and ecclesiastical repressed the popular delusion
they had so long encouraged the parliament of normandy condemned a number
of women to death in the year 1670 on the old charge of riding on
broomsticks to the domdaniel but louis xiv commuted the sentence into
banishment for life the parliament remonstrated and sent the king the
following remarkable request the reader will perhaps be glad to see this
document at length it is of importance as the last effort of a
legislative assembly to uphold this great error and the arguments they
used and the instances they quoted are in the highest degree curious it
reflects honour upon the memory of louis xiv that he was not swayed by
it
request of the parliament of rouen to the king in 1670
sireemboldened by the authority which your majesty has committed into
our hands in the province of normandy to try and punish offences and
more particularly those offences of the nature of witchcraft which tend
to the destruction of religion and the ruin of nations we your
parliament remonstrate humbly with your majesty upon certain cases of
this kind which have been lately brought before us we cannot permit the
letter addressed by your majestys command to the attorneygeneral of this
district for the reprieve of certain persons condemned to death for
witchcraft and for the staying of proceedings in several other cases to
remain unnoticed and without remarking upon the consequences which may
ensue there is also a letter from your secretary of state declaring your
majestys intention to commute the punishment of these criminals into one
of perpetual banishment and to submit to the opinion of the
procureurgeneral and of the most learned members of the parliament of
paris whether in the matter of witchcraft the jurisprudence of the
parliament of rouen is to be followed in preference to that of the
parliament of paris and of the other parliaments of the kingdom which
judge differently
although by the ordinances of the kings your predecessors parliaments
have been forbidden to pay any attention to lettres de cachet we
nevertheless from the knowledge which we have in common with the whole
kingdom of the care bestowed by your majesty for the good of your
subjects and from the submission and obedience to your commandments which
we have always manifested have stayed all proceedings in conformity to
your orders hoping that your majesty considering the importance of the
crime of witchcraft and the consequences likely to ensue from its
impunity will be graciously pleased to grant us once more your permission
to continue the trials and execute judgment upon those found guilty and
as since we received the letter of your secretary of state we have also
been made acquainted with the determination of your majesty not only to
commute the sentence of death passed upon these witches into one of
perpetual banishment from the province but to reestablish them in the
possession of their goods and chattels and of their good fame and
character your parliament have thought it their duty on occasion of
these crimes the greatest which men can commit to make you acquainted
with the general and uniform feelings of the people of this province with
regard to them it being moreover a question in which are concerned the
glory of god and the relief of your suffering subjects who groan under
their fears from the threats and menaces of this sort of persons and who
feel the effects of them every day in the mortal and extraordinary
maladies which attack them and the surprising damage and loss of their
possessions
your majesty knows well that there is no crime so opposed to the commands
of god as witchcraft which destroys the very foundation of religion and
draws strange abominations after it it is for this reason sire that the
scriptures pronounce the punishment of death against offenders and that
the church and the holy fathers have fulminated their anathemas and that
canonical decisions have one and all decreed the most severe punishments
to deter from this crime and that the church of france animated by the
piety of the kings your predecessors has expressed so great a horror at
it that not judging the punishment of perpetual imprisonment the
highest it has the power to inflict sufficiently severe it has left such
criminals to be dealt with by the secular power
it has been the general feeling of all nations that such criminals ought
to be condemned to death and all the ancients were of the same opinion
the law of the twelve tables which was the principal of the roman laws
ordains the same punishment all jurisconsults agreed in it as well as
the constitutions of the emperors and more especially those of
constantine and theodosius who enlightened by the gospel not only
renewed the same punishment but also deprived expressly all persons
found guilty of witchcraft of the right of appeal and declared them to be
unworthy of a princes mercy and charles viii sire inspired by the
same sentiments passed that beautiful and severe ordinance cette belle
et svre ordonnance which enjoined the judges to punish witches
according to the exigencies of the case under a penalty of being
themselves fined or imprisoned or dismissed from their office and
decreed at the same time that all persons who refused to denounce a
witch should be punished as accomplices and that all on the contrary
who gave evidence against one should be rewarded
from these considerations sire and in the execution of so holy an
ordinance your parliaments by their decrees proportion their
punishments to the guilt of the offenders and your parliament of normandy
has never until the present time found that its practice was different
from that of other courts for all the books which treat upon this matter
cite an infinite number of decrees condemning witches to be burnt or
broken on the wheel or to other punishments the following are
examplesin the time of chilperic as may be seen in gregory of tours
b vi c 35 of his history of france all the decrees of the parliament
of paris passed according to and in conformity with this ancient
jurisprudence of the kingdom cited by imbert in his judicial practice
all those cited by monstrelet in 1459 against the witches of artois the
decrees of the same parliament of the 13th of october 1573 against mary
le fief native of saumur of the 21st of october 1596 against the sieur
de beaumont who pleaded in his defence that he had only sought the aid
of the devil for the purpose of unbewitching the afflicted and of curing
diseases of the 4th of july 1606 against francis du bose of the 20th of
july 1582 against abel de la rue native of coulommiers of the 2d of
october 1593 against rousseau and his daughter of 1608 against another
rousseau and one peley for witchcraft and adoration of the devil at the
sabbath under the figure of a hegoat as confessed by them the decree
of 4th of february 1615 against leclerc who appealed from the sentence
of the parliament of orleans and who was condemned for having attended
the sabbath and confessed as well as two of his accomplices who died in
prison that he had adored the devil renounced his baptism and his faith
in god danced the witches dance and offered up unholy sacrifices the
decrees of the 6th of may 1616 against a man named leger on a similar
accusation the pardon granted by charles ix to trois echelles upon
condition of revealing his accomplices but afterwards revoked for renewed
sorcery on his part the decree of the parliament of paris cited by
mornac in 1595 the judgments passed in consequence of the commission
given by henry iv to the sieur de lancre councillor of the parliament
of bourdeaux of the 20th of march 1619 against etienne audibert those
passed by the chamber of nerac on the 26th of june 1620 against several
witches those passed by the parliament of toulouse in 1577 as cited by
gregory tolosanus against four hundred persons accused of this crime and
who were all marked with the sign of the devil besides all these we
might recal to your majestys recollection the various decrees of the
parliament of provence especially in the case of gaufrdy in 1611 the
decrees of the parliament of dijon and those of the parliament of rennes
following the example of the condemnation of the marshal de rays who was
burned in 1441 for the crime of witchcraft in presence of the duke of
brittanyall these examples sire prove that the accusation of
witchcraft has always been punished with death by the parliaments of your
kingdom and justify the uniformity of their practice
these sire are the motives upon which your parliament of normandy has
acted in decreeing the punishment of death against the persons lately
brought before it for this crime if it has happened that on any
occasion these parliaments and the parliament of normandy among the
rest have condemned the guilty to a less punishment than that of death
it was for the reason that their guilt was not of the deepest dye your
majesty and the kings your predecessors having left full liberty to the
various tribunals to whom they delegated the administration of justice to
decree such punishment as was warranted by the evidence brought before
them
after so many authorities and punishments ordained by human and divine
laws we humbly supplicate your majesty to reflect once more upon the
extraordinary results which proceed from the malevolence of this sort of
people on the deaths from unknown diseases which are often the
consequences of their menaces on the loss of the goods and chattels of
your subjects on the proofs of guilt continually afforded by the
insensibility of the marks upon the accused on the sudden transportation
of bodies from one place to another on the sacrifices and nocturnal
assemblies and other facts corroborated by the testimony of ancient and
modern authors and verified by so many eyewitnesses composed partly of
accomplices and partly of people who had no interest in the trials beyond
the love of truth and confirmed moreover by the confessions of the
accused parties themselves and that sire with so much agreement and
conformity between the different cases that the most ignorant persons
convicted of this crime have spoken to the same circumstances and in
nearly the same words as the most celebrated authors who have written
about it all of which may be easily proved to your majestys satisfaction
by the records of various trials before your parliaments
these sire are truths so intimately bound up with the principles of our
religion that extraordinary although they be no person has been able to
this time to call them in question if some have cited in opposition to
these truths the pretended canon of the council of ancyre and a passage
from st augustin in a treatise upon the spirit and the soul it has
been without foundation and it would be easy to convince your majesty
that neither the one nor the other ought to be accounted of any authority
and besides that the canon in this sense would be contrary to the
opinion of all succeeding councils of the church cardinal baronius and
all learned commentators agree that it is not to be found in any old
edition in effect in those editions wherein it is found it is in
another language and is in direct contradiction to the twentythird canon
of the same council which condemns sorcery according to all preceding
constitutions even supposing that this canon was really promulgated by
the council of ancyre we must observe that it was issued in the second
century when the principal attention of the church was directed to the
destruction of paganism for this reason it condemns that class of women
who said they could pass through the air and over immense regions with
diana and herodias and enjoins all preachers to teach the falsehood of
such an opinion in order to deter people from the worship of these false
divinities but it does not question the power of the devil over the human
body which is in fact proved by the holy gospel of jesus christ
himself and with regard sire to the pretended passage of st augustin
everybody knows that it was not written by him because the writer
whoever he was cites boetius who died more than eighty years after the
time of st augustin besides there is still more convincing proof in the
fact that the same father establishes the truth of witchcraft in all his
writings and more particularly in his city of god and in his first
volume question the 25th wherein he states that sorcery is a communion
between man and the devil which all good christians ought to look upon
with horror
taking all these things into consideration sire the officers of your
parliament hope from the justice of your majesty that you will be
graciously pleased to receive the humble remonstrances they have taken the
liberty to make they are compelled for the acquittal of their own
consciences and in discharge of their duty to make known to your majesty
that the decrees they passed against the sorcerers and witches brought
before them were passed after a mature deliberation on the part of all
the judges present and that nothing has been done therein which is not
conformable to the universal jurisprudence of the kingdom and for the
general welfare of your majestys subjects of whom there is not one who
can say that he is secure from the malevolence of such criminals we
therefore supplicate your majesty to suffer us to carry into effect the
sentences we passed and to proceed with the trial of the other persons
accused of the same crime and that the piety of your majesty will not
suffer to be introduced during your reign an opinion contrary to the
principles of that holy religion for which you have always employed so
gloriously both your cares and your arms
louis as we have already mentioned paid no attention to this appeal the
lives of the old women were spared and prosecutions for mere witchcraft
unconnected with other offences were discontinued throughout france in
1680 an act was passed for the punishment not of witches but of
pretenders to witchcraft fortunetellers divineresses and poisoners
thus the light broke in upon germany france england and scotland about
the same time gradually growing clearer and clearer till the middle of
the eighteenth century when witchcraft was finally reckoned amongst
exploded doctrines and the belief in it confined to the uttermost vulgar
twice however did the madness burst forth again as furious while it
lasted as ever it had been the first time in sweden in 1669 and the
second in germany so late as 1749 both these instances merit particular
mention the first is one of the most extraordinary upon record and for
atrocity and absurdity is unsurpassed in the annals of any nation
it having been reported to the king of sweden that the little village of
mohra in the province of dalecarlia was troubled exceedingly with
witches he appointed a commission of clergy and laymen to trace the
rumour to its source with full powers to punish the guilty on the 12th
of august 1669 the commissioners arrived in the bewitched village to the
great joy of the credulous inhabitants on the following day the whole
population amounting to three thousand persons assembled in the church
a sermon was preached declaring the miserable case of those people that
suffered themselves to be deluded by the devil and fervent prayer was
offered up that god would remove the scourge from among them
illustration louis xiv
the whole assembly then adjourned to the rectors house filling all the
street before it when the kings commission was read charging every
person who knew any thing of the witchery to come forward and declare the
truth a passion of tears seized upon the multitude men women and
children began to weep and sob and all promised to divulge what they had
heard or knew in this frame of mind they were dismissed to their homes
on the following day they were again called together when the depositions
of several persons were taken publicly before them all the result was
that seventy persons including fifteen children were taken into custody
numbers also were arrested in the neighbouring district of elfdale being
put to the torture they all confessed their guilt they said they used to
go to a gravelpit that lay hard by the crossway where they put a vest
upon their heads and danced round and round and round about they then
went to the crossway and called three times upon the devil the first
time in a low still voice the second somewhat louder and the third
very loudly with these words antecessor come and carry us to
blockula this invocation never failed to bring him to their view he
generally appeared as a little old man in a grey coat with red and blue
stockings with exceedingly long garters he had besides a very
highcrowned hat with bands of manycoloured linen enfolded about it and
a long red beard that hung down to his middle
the first question he put to them was whether they would serve him soul
and body on their answering in the affirmative he told them to make
ready for the journey to blockula it was necessary to procure in the
first place some scrapings of altars and filings of church clocks
antecessor then gave them a horn with some salve in it wherewith they
anointed themselves these preparations ended he brought beasts for them
to ride uponhorses asses goats and monkeys and giving them a
saddle a hammer and a nail uttered the word of command and away they
went nothing stopped them they flew over churches high walls rocks
and mountains until they came to the green meadow where blockula was
situated upon these occasions they carried as many children with them as
they could for the devil they said did plague and whip them if they
did not procure him children insomuch that they had no peace or quiet for
him
many parents corroborated a part of this evidence stating that their
children had repeatedly told them that they had been carried away in the
night to blockula where the devil had beaten them black and blue they
had seen the marks in the morning but they soon disappeared one little
girl was examined who swore positively that she was carried through the
air by the witches and when at a great height she uttered the holy name
of jesus she immediately fell to the ground and made a great hole in her
side the devil however picked her up healed her side and carried her
away to blockula she added and her mother confirmed her statement
that she had till that day an exceeding great pain in her side this was
a clencher and the nail of conviction was driven home to the hearts of
the judges
the place called blockula whither they were carried was a large house
with a gate to it in a delicate meadow whereof they could see no end
there was a very long table in it at which the witches sat down and in
other rooms there were very lovely and delicate beds for them to sleep
upon
after a number of ceremonies had been performed by which they bound
themselves body and soul to the service of antecessor they sat down to a
feast composed of broth made of colworts and bacon oatmeal bread and
butter milk and cheese the devil always took the chair and sometimes
played to them on the harp or the fiddle while they were eating after
dinner they danced in a ring sometimes naked and sometimes in their
clothes cursing and swearing all the time some of the women added
particulars too horrible and too obscene for repetition
once the devil pretended to be dead that he might see whether his people
regretted him they instantly set up a loud wail and wept three tears
each for him at which he was so pleased that he jumped up among them
and hugged in his arms those who had been most obstreperous in their
sorrow
such were the principal details given by the children and corroborated by
the confessions of the fullgrown witches any thing more absurd was never
before stated in a court of justice many of the accused contradicted
themselves most palpably but the commissioners gave no heed to
discrepancies one of them the parson of the district stated in the
course of the inquiry that on a particular night which he mentioned he
had been afflicted with a headache so agonising that he could not account
for it otherwise than by supposing he was bewitched in fact he thought a
score of witches must have been dancing on the crown of his head this
announcement excited great horror among the pious dames of the auditory
who loudly expressed their wonder that the devil should have power to hurt
so good a man one poor witch who lay in the very jaws of death
confessed that she knew too well the cause of the ministers headache the
devil had sent her with a sledge hammer and a large nail to drive into the
good mans skull she had hammered at it for some time but the skull was
so enormously thick that she made no impression upon it every hand was
held up in astonishment the pious minister blessed god that his skull was
so solid and he became renowned for his thick head all the days of his
life whether the witch intended a joke does not appear but she was
looked upon as a criminal more than usually atrocious seventy persons
were condemned to death on these so awful yet so ridiculous confessions
twentythree of them were burned together in one fire in the village of
mohra in the presence of thousands of delighted spectators on the
following day fifteen children were murdered in the same manner offered
up in sacrifice to the bloody moloch of superstition the remaining
thirtytwo were executed at the neighbouring town of fahluna besides
these fiftysix children were found guilty of witchcraft in a minor
degree and sentenced to various punishments such as running the
gauntlet imprisonment and public whipping once a week for a twelvemonth
long after the occurrence of this case it was cited as one of the most
convincing proofs upon record of the prevalence of witchcraft when men
wish to construct or support a theory how they torture facts into their
service the lying whimsies of a few sick children encouraged by foolish
parents and drawn out by superstitious neighbours were sufficient to set
a country in a flame if instead of commissioners as deeply sunk in the
slough of ignorance as the people they were sent amongst there had been
deputed a few men firm in courage and clear in understanding how
different would have been the result some of the poor children who were
burned would have been sent to an infirmary others would have been well
flogged the credulity of the parents would have been laughed at and the
lives of seventy persons spared the belief in witchcraft remains in
sweden to this day but happily the annals of that country present no more
such instances of lamentable aberration of intellect as the one just
cited
in new england about the same time the colonists were scared by similar
stories of the antics of the devil all at once a fear seized upon the
multitude and supposed criminals were arrested day after day in such
numbers that the prisons were found too small to contain them a girl
named goodwin the daughter of a mason who was hypochondriac and subject
to fits imagined that an old irish woman named glover had bewitched
her her two brothers in whose constitutions there was apparently a
predisposition to similar fits went off in the same way crying out that
the devil and dame glover were tormenting them at times their joints were
so stiff that they could not be moved while at others said the
neighbours they were so flexible that the bones appeared softened into
sinews the supposed witch was seized and as she could not repeat the
lords prayer without making a mistake in it she was condemned and
executed
but the popular excitement was not allayed one victim was not enough the
people waited agape for new disclosures suddenly two hysteric girls in
another family fell into fits daily and the cry of witchcraft resounded
from one end of the colony to the other the feeling of suffocation in the
throat so common in cases of hysteria was said by the patients to be
caused by the devil himself who had stuck balls in the windpipe to choke
them they felt the pricking of thorns in every part of the body and one
of them vomited needles the case of these girls who were the daughter
and niece of a mr parvis the minister of a calvinist chapel excited so
much attention that all the weak women in the colony began to fancy
themselves similarly afflicted the more they brooded on it the more
convinced they became the contagion of this mental disease was as great
as if it had been a pestilence one after the other the women fainted
away asserting on their recovery that they had seen the spectres of
witches where there were three or four girls in a family they so worked
each upon the diseased imagination of the other that they fell into fits
five or six times in a day some related that the devil himself appeared
to them bearing in his hand a parchmentroll and promising that if they
would sign an agreement transferring to him their immortal souls they
should be immediately relieved from fits and all the ills of the flesh
others asserted that they saw witches only who made them similar
promises threatening that they should never be free from aches and pains
till they had agreed to become the devils when they refused the witches
pinched or bit or pricked them with long pins and needles more than two
hundred persons named by these mischievous visionaries were thrown into
prison they were of all ages and conditions of life and many of them of
exemplary character no less than nineteen were condemned and executed
before reason returned to the minds of the colonists the most horrible
part of this lamentable history is that among the victims there was a
little child only five years old some women swore that they had seen it
repeatedly in company with the devil and that it had bitten them often
with its little teeth for refusing to sign a compact with the evil one it
can hardly increase our feelings of disgust and abhorrence when we learn
that this insane community actually tried and executed a dog for the same
offence
one man named cory stoutly refused to plead to the preposterous
indictment against him as was the practice in such cases he was pressed
to death it is told of the sheriff of new england who superintended the
execution that when this unhappy man thrust out his tongue in his mortal
agony he seized hold of a cane and crammed it back again into the mouth
if ever there were a fiend in human form it was this sheriff a man who
if the truth were known perhaps plumed himself upon his pietythought he
was doing god good service and
   hoped to merit heaven by making earth a hell
arguing still in the firm belief of witchcraft the bereaved people began
to inquire when they saw their dearest friends snatched away from them by
these widespreading accusations whether the whole proceedings were not
carried on by the agency of the devil might not the great enemy have put
false testimony into the mouths of the witnesses or might not the
witnesses be witches themselves every man who was in danger of losing his
wife his child or his sister embraced this doctrine with avidity the
revulsion was as sudden as the first frenzy all at once the colonists
were convinced of their error the judges put a stop to the prosecutions
even of those who had confessed their guilt the latter were no sooner at
liberty than they retracted all they had said and the greater number
hardly remembered the avowals which agony had extorted from them eight
persons who had been tried and condemned were set free and gradually
girls ceased to have fits and to talk of the persecutions of the devil
the judge who had condemned the first criminal executed on this charge
was so smitten with sorrow and humiliation at his folly that he set apart
the anniversary of that day as one of solemn penitence and fasting he
still clung to the belief in witchcraft no new light had broken in upon
him on that subject but happily for the community the delusion had
taken a merciful turn the whole colony shared the feeling the jurors on
the different trials openly expressed their penitence in the churches and
those who had suffered were regarded as the victims and not as the
accomplices of satan
it is related that the indian tribes in new england were sorely puzzled at
the infatuation of the settlers and thought them either a race inferior
to or more sinful than the french colonists in the vicinity amongst
whom as they remarked the great spirit sent no witches
returning again to the continent of europe we find that after the year
1680 men became still wiser upon this subject for twenty years the
populace were left to their belief but governments in general gave it no
aliment in the shape of executions the edict of louis xiv gave a blow to
the superstition from which it never recovered the last execution in the
protestant cantons of switzerland was at geneva in 1652 the various
potentates of germany although they could not stay the trials invariably
commuted the sentence into imprisonment in all cases where the pretended
witch was accused of pure witchcraft unconnected with any other crime in
the year 1701 thomasius the learned professor at the university of
halle delivered his inaugural thesis de crimine magi which struck
another blow at the falling monster of popular error but a faith so
strong as that in witchcraft was not to be eradicated at once the
arguments of learned men did not penetrate to the villages and hamlets
but still they achieved great things they rendered the belief an
unworking faith and prevented the supply of victims on which for so many
ages it had battened and grown strong
once more the delusion broke out like a wild beast wounded to the death
it collected all its remaining energies for the final convulsion which
was to shew how mighty it had once been germany which had nursed the
frightful error in its cradle tended it on its deathbed and wrzburg
the scene of so many murders on the same pretext was destined to be the
scene of the last that it might lose no portion of its bad renown the
last murder was as atrocious as the first this case offers a great
resemblance to that of the witches of mohra and new england except in the
number of its victims it happened so late as the year 1749 to the
astonishment and disgust of the rest of europe
illustration view in wrzburg
a number of young women in a convent at wrzburg fancied themselves
bewitched they felt like all hysteric subjects a sense of suffocation
in the throat they went into fits repeatedly and one of them who had
swallowed needles evacuated them at abscesses which formed in different
parts of the body the cry of sorcery was raised and a young woman named
maria renata snger was arrested on the charge of having leagued with the
devil to bewitch five of the young ladies it was sworn on the trial that
maria had been frequently seen to clamber over the convent walls in the
shape of a pigthat proceeding to the cellar she used to drink the best
wine till she was intoxicated and then start suddenly up in her own form
other girls asserted that she used to prowl about the roof like a cat and
often penetrate into their chamber and frighten them by her dreadful
howlings it was also said that she had been seen in the shape of a hare
milking the cows dry in the meadows belonging to the convent that she
used to perform as an actress on the boards of drury lane theatre in
london and on the very same night return upon a broomstick to wrzburg
and afflict the young ladies with pains in all their limbs upon this
evidence she was condemned and burned alive in the marketplace of
wrzburg
here ends this frightful catalogue of murder and superstition since that
day the belief in witchcraft has fled from the populous abodes of men
and taken refuge in remote villages and districts too wild rugged and
inhospitable to afford a restingplace for the foot of civilisation rude
fishers and uneducated labourers still attribute every phenomenon of
nature which they cannot account for to the devil and witches catalepsy
that wondrous disease is still thought by ignorant gossips to be the work
of satan and hypochondriacs uninformed by science of the nature of their
malady devoutly believe in the reality of their visions the reader would
hardly credit the extent of the delusion upon this subject in the very
heart of england at this day many an old woman leads a life of misery
from the unfeeling insults of her neighbours who raise the scornful
finger and hooting voice at her because in her decrepitude she is ugly
spiteful perhaps insane and realises in her personal appearance the
description preserved by tradition of the witches of yore even in the
neighbourhood of great towns the taint remains of this once widelyspread
contagion if no victims fall beneath it the enlightenment of the law is
all that prevents a recurrence of scenes as horrid as those of the
seventeenth century hundreds upon hundreds of witnesses could be found to
swear to absurdities as great as those asserted by the infamous matthew
hopkins
in the annual register for 1760 an instance of the belief in witchcraft
is related which shews how superstition lingers a dispute arose in the
little village of glen in leicestershire between two old women each of
whom vehemently accused the other of witchcraft the quarrel at last ran
so high that a challenge ensued and they both agreed to be tried by the
ordeal of swimming they accordingly stripped to their shiftsprocured
some men who tied their thumbs and great toes together crosswise and
then with a cartrope about their middle suffered themselves to be
thrown into a pool of water one of them sank immediately but the other
continued struggling a short time upon the surface of the water which the
mob deeming an infallible sign of her guilt pulled her out and insisted
that she should immediately impeach all her accomplices in the craft she
accordingly told them that in the neighbouring village of burton there
were several old women as much witches as she was happily for her this
negative information was deemed sufficient and a student in astrology or
whitewitch coming up at the time the mob by his direction proceeded
forthwith to burton in search of all the delinquents after a little
consultation on their arrival they went to the old womans house on whom
they had fixed the strongest suspicion the poor old creature on their
approach locked the outer door and from the window of an upstairs room
asked what they wanted they informed her that she was charged with being
guilty of witchcraft and that they were come to duck her remonstrating
with her at the same time upon the necessity of submission to the ordeal
that if she were innocent all the world might know it upon her
persisting in a positive refusal to come down they broke open the door
and carried her out by force to a deep gravelpit full of water they
tied her thumbs and toes together and threw her into the water where they
kept her for several minutes drawing her out and in two or three times by
the rope round her middle not being able to satisfy themselves whether
she were a witch or no they at last let her go or more properly
speaking they left her on the bank to walk home by herself if she ever
recovered next day they tried the same experiment upon another woman
and afterwards upon a third but fortunately neither of the victims lost
her life from this brutality many of the ringleaders in the outrage were
apprehended during the week and tried before the justices at
quartersessions two of them were sentenced to stand in the pillory and
to be imprisoned for a month and as many as twenty more were fined in
small sums for the assault and bound over to keep the peace for a
twelvemonth
so late as the year 1785 says arnot in his collection and abridgment
of criminal trials in scotland it was the custom among the sect of
seceders to read from the pulpit an annual confession of sins national
and personal amongst the former of which was particularly mentioned the
repeal by parliament of the penal statute against witches contrary to
the express laws of god
illustration lady hattons house cross street hatton garden
many houses are still to be found in england with the horseshoe the
grand preservative against witchcraft nailed against the threshold if
any overwise philosopher should attempt to remove them the chances are
that he would have more broken bones than thanks for his interference let
any man walk into cross street hatton garden and from thence into
bleedingheart yard and learn the tales still told and believed of one
house in that neighbourhood and he will ask himself in astonishment if
such things can be in the nineteenth century the witchcraft of lady
hatton the wife of the famous sir christopher so renowned for his
elegant dancing in the days of elizabeth is as devoutly believed as the
gospels the room is to be seen where the devil seized her after the
expiration of the contract he had made with her and bore her away bodily
to the pit of tophet the pump against which he dashed her is still
pointed out and the spot where her heart was found after he had torn it
out of her bosom with his iron claws has received the name of
bleedingheart yard in confirmation of the story whether the horseshoe
still remains upon the door of the haunted house to keep away other
witches is uncertain a former inmate relates that about twenty years
ago more than one old woman begged for admittance repeatedly to satisfy
themselves that it was in its proper place one poor creature apparently
insane and clothed in rags came to the door with a tremendous
doubleknock as loud as that of a fashionable footman and walked
straight along the passage to the horseshoe great was the wonderment of
the inmates especially when the woman spat upon the horseshoe and
expressed her sorrow that she could do no harm while it remained there
after spitting upon and kicking it again and again she coolly turned
round and left the house without saying a word to any body this poor
creature perhaps intended a joke but the probability is that she imagined
herself a witch in saffron hill where she resided her ignorant
neighbours gave her that character and looked upon her with no little
fear and aversion
more than one example of the popular belief in witchcraft occurred in the
neighbourhood of hastings so lately as the year 1830 an aged woman who
resided in the ropewalk of that town was so repulsive in her appearance
that she was invariably accused of being a witch by all the ignorant
people who knew her she was bent completely double and though very old
her eye was unusually bright and malignant she wore a red cloak and
supported herself on a crutch she was to all outward appearance the
very beau ideal of a witch so dear is power to the human heart that
this old woman actually encouraged the popular superstition she took no
pains to remove the ill impression but seemed to delight that she old
and miserable as she was could keep in awe so many happier and stronger
fellowcreatures timid girls crouched with fear when they met her and
many would go a mile out of their way to avoid her like the witches of
the olden time she was not sparing of her curses against those who
offended her the child of a woman who resided within two doors of her was
afflicted with lameness and the mother constantly asserted that the old
woman had bewitched her all the neighbours credited the tale it was
believed too that she could assume the form of a cat many a harmless
puss has been hunted almost to the death by mobs of men and boys upon the
supposition that the animal would start up before them in the true shape
of mother 
in the same town there resided a fisherman who was the object of
unceasing persecution because it was said that he had sold himself to the
devil it was currently reported that he could creep through a keyhole
and that he had made a witch of his daughter in order that he might have
the more power over his fellows it was also believed that he could sit on
the points of pins and needles and feel no pain his brother fishermen put
him to this test whenever they had an opportunity in the alehouses which
he frequented they often placed long needles in the cushions of the
chairs in such a manner that he could not fail to pierce himself when he
sat down the result of these experiments tended to confirm their faith in
his supernatural powers it was asserted that he never flinched such was
the popular feeling in the fashionable town of hastings a few years ago
very probably it is the same now
in the north of england the superstition lingers to an almost
inconceivable extent lancashire abounds with witchdoctors a set of
quacks who pretend to cure diseases inflicted by the devil the practices
of these worthies may be judged of by the following case reported in the
hertford reformer of the 23d of june 1838 the witchdoctor alluded to
is better known by the name of the cunning man and has a large practice
in the counties of lincoln and nottingham according to the writer in the
reformer the dupe whose name is not mentioned had been for about two
years afflicted with a painful abscess and had been prescribed for
without relief by more than one medical gentleman he was urged by some of
his friends not only in his own village but in neighbouring ones to
consult the witchdoctor as they were convinced he was under some evil
influence he agreed and sent his wife to the cunning man who lived in
new st swithins in lincoln she was informed by this ignorant impostor
that her husbands disorder was an infliction of the devil occasioned by
his nextdoor neighbours who had made use of certain charms for that
purpose from the description he gave of the process it appears to be the
same as that employed by dr fian and gellie duncan to work woe upon king
james he stated that the neighbours instigated by a witch whom he
pointed out took some wax and moulded it before the fire into the form of
her husband as near as they could represent him they then pierced the
image with pins on all sides repeated the lords prayer backwards and
offered prayers to the devil that he would fix his stings into the person
whom that figure represented in like manner as they pierced it with
pins to counteract the effects of this diabolical process the
witchdoctor prescribed a certain medicine and a charm to be worn next
the body on that part where the disease principally lay the patient was
to repeat the 109th and 119th psalms every day or the cure would not be
effectual the fee which he claimed for this advice was a guinea
so efficacious is faith in the cure of any malady that the patient
actually felt much better after a three weeks course of this
prescription the notable charm which the quack had given was afterwards
opened and found to be a piece of parchment covered with some cabalistic
characters and signs of the planets
the nextdoor neighbours were in great alarm that the witchdoctor would
on the solicitation of the recovering patient employ some means to punish
them for their pretended witchcraft to escape the infliction they feed
another cunning man in nottinghamshire who told them of a similar charm
which would preserve them from all the malice of their enemies the writer
concludes by saying that the doctor not long after he had been thus
consulted wrote to say that he had discovered that his patient was not
afflicted by satan as he had imagined but by god and would continue
more or less in the same state till his lifes end
an impostor carried on a similar trade in the neighbourhood of tunbridge
wells about the year 1830 he had been in practice for several years and
charged enormous fees for his advice this fellow pretended to be the
seventh son of a seventh son and to be endowed in consequence with
miraculous powers for the cure of all diseases but especially of those
resulting from witchcraft it was not only the poor who employed him but
ladies who rode in their carriages he was often sent for from a distance
of sixty or seventy miles by these people who paid all his expenses to
and fro besides rewarding him handsomely he was about eighty years of
age and his extremely venerable appearance aided his imposition in no
slight degree his name was okey or oakley
in france the superstition at this day is even more prevalent than it is
in england garinet in his history of magic and sorcery in that country
cites upwards of twenty instances which occurred between the years 1805
and 1818 in the latter year no less than three tribunals were occupied
with trials originating in this humiliating belief we shall cite only one
of them julian desbourdes aged fiftythree a mason and inhabitant of
the village of thilouze near bourdeaux was taken suddenly ill in the
month of january 1818 as he did not know how to account for his malady
he suspected at last that he was bewitched he communicated this suspicion
to his soninlaw bridier and they both went to consult a sort of idiot
named baudouin who passed for a conjuror or whitewitch this man told
them that desbourdes was certainly bewitched and offered to accompany
them to the house of an old man named renard who he said was
undoubtedly the criminal on the night of the 23d of january all three
proceeded stealthily to the dwelling of renard and accused him of
afflicting persons with diseases by the aid of the devil desbourdes fell
on his knees and earnestly entreated to be restored to his former health
promising that he would take no measures against him for the evil he had
done the old man denied in the strongest terms that he was a wizard and
when desbourdes still pressed him to remove the spell from him he said he
knew nothing about the spell and refused to remove it the idiot
baudouin the whitewitch now interfered and told his companions that
no relief for the malady could ever be procured until the old man
confessed his guilt to force him to confession they lighted some sticks
of sulphur which they had brought with them for the purpose and placed
them under the old mans nose in a few moments he fell down suffocated
and apparently lifeless they were all greatly alarmed and thinking that
they had killed the man they carried him out and threw him into a
neighbouring pond hoping to make it appear that he had fallen in
accidentally the pond however was not very deep and the coolness of
the water reviving the old man he opened his eyes and sat up desbourdes
and bridier who were still waiting on the bank were now more alarmed
than before lest he should recover and inform against them they
therefore waded into the pond seized their victim by the hair of the
head beat him severely and then held him under water till he was
drowned
they were all three apprehended on the charge of murder a few days
afterwards desbourdes and bridier were found guilty of aggravated
manslaughter only and sentenced to be burnt on the back and to work in
the galleys for life the whitewitch baudouin was acquitted on the
ground of insanity
m garinet further informs us that france at the time he wrote 1818
was overrun by a race of fellows who made a trade of casting out devils
and finding out witches he adds also that many of the priests in the
rural districts encouraged the superstition of their parishioners by
resorting frequently to exorcisms whenever any foolish persons took it
into their heads that a spell had been thrown over them he recommended
as a remedy for the evil that all these exorcists whether lay or
clerical should be sent to the galleys and felt assured that the number
of witches would then very sensibly diminish
many other instances of this lingering belief might be cited both in
france and great britain and indeed in every other country in europe so
deeply rooted are some errors that ages cannot remove them the poisonous
tree that once overshadowed the land may be cut down by the sturdy efforts
of sages and philosophers the sun may shine clearly upon spots where
venomous things once nestled in security and shade but still the
entangled roots are stretched beneath the surface and may be found by
those who dig another king like james i might make them vegetate again
and more mischievous still another pope like innocent viii might raise
the decaying roots to strength and verdure still it is consoling to think
that the delirium has passed away that the raging madness has given place
to a milder folly and that we may now count by units the votaries of a
superstition which in former ages numbered its victims by tens of
thousands and its votaries by millions

    and briefly as i can by what degrees
    they fell into this madnessduke of milan
the atrocious system of poisoning by poisons so slow in their operation as
to make the victim appear to ordinary observers as if dying from a
gradual decay of nature has been practised in all ages those who are
curious in the matter may refer to beckmann on secret poisons in his
history of inventions in which he has collected several instances of it
from the greek and roman writers early in the sixteenth century the crime
seems to have gradually increased till in the seventeenth it spread over
europe like a pestilence it was often exercised by pretended witches and
sorcerers and finally became a branch of education amongst all who laid
any claim to magical and supernatural arts in the twentyfirst year of
henry viii an act was passed rendering it high treason those found
guilty of it were to be boiled to death
one of the first in point of date and hardly second to any in point of
atrocity is the murder by this means of sir thomas overbury which
disgraced the court of james i in the year 1613 a slight sketch of it
will be a fitting introduction to the history of the poisoning mania
which was so prevalent in france and italy fifty years later
robert kerr a scottish youth was early taken notice of by james i and
loaded with honours for no other reason that the world could ever
discover than the beauty of his person james even in his own day was
suspected of being addicted to the most abominable of all offences and
the more we examine his history now the stronger the suspicion becomes
however that may be the handsome kerr lending his smooth cheek even in
public to the disgusting kisses of his royal master rose rapidly in
favour in the year 1613 he was made lord high treasurer of scotland and
created an english peer by the style and title of viscount rochester
still further honours were in store for him
in this rapid promotion he had not been without a friend sir thomas
overbury the kings secretarywho appears from some threats in his own
letters to have been no better than a pander to the vices of the king
and privy to his dangerous secretsexerted all his backstair influence to
forward the promotion of kerr by whom he was doubtless repaid in some way
or other overbury did not confine his friendship to thisif friendship
ever could exist between two such menbut acted the part of an
entremetteur and assisted rochester to carry on an adulterous intrigue
with the lady frances howard the wife of the earl of essex this woman
was a person of violent passions and lost to all sense of shame her
husband was in her way and to be freed from him she instituted
proceedings for a divorce on grounds which a woman of any modesty or
delicacy of feeling would die rather than avow her scandalous suit was
successful and was no sooner decided than preparations on a scale of the
greatest magnificence were made for her marriage with lord rochester
sir thomas overbury who had willingly assisted his patron to intrigue
with the countess of essex seems to have imagined that his marriage with
so vile a woman might retard his advancement he accordingly employed all
his influence to dissuade him from it but rochester was bent on the
match and his passions were as violent as those of the countess on one
occasion when overbury and the viscount were walking in the gallery of
whitehall overbury was overheard to say well my lord if you do marry
that base woman you will utterly ruin your honour and yourself you shall
never do it with my advice or consent and if you do you had best look to
stand fast rochester flung from him in a rage exclaiming with an oath
i will be even with you for this these words were the deathwarrant of
the unfortunate overbury he had mortally wounded the pride of rochester
in insinuating that by his overburys means he might be lowered in the
kings favour and he had endeavoured to curb the burning passions of a
heartless dissolute and reckless man
overburys imprudent remonstrances were reported to the countess and from
that moment she also vowed the most deadly vengeance against him with a
fiendish hypocrisy however they both concealed their intentions and
overbury at the solicitation of rochester was appointed ambassador to
the court of russia this apparent favour was but the first step in a deep
and deadly plot rochester pretending to be warmly attached to the
interests of overbury advised him to refuse the embassy which he said
was but a trick to get him out of the way he promised at the same time
to stand between him and any evil consequences which might result from his
refusal overbury fell into the snare and declined the embassy james
offended immediately ordered his committal to the tower
he was now in safe custody and his enemies had opportunity to commence
the work of vengeance the first thing rochester did was to procure by
his influence at court the dismissal of the lieutenant of the tower and
the appointment of sir jervis elwes one of his creatures to the vacant
post this man was but one instrument and another being necessary was
found in richard weston a fellow who had formerly been shopman to a
druggist he was installed in the office of underkeeper and as such had
the direct custody of overbury so far all was favourable to the designs
of the conspirators
in the mean time the insidious rochester wrote the most friendly letters
to overbury requesting him to bear his illfortune patiently and
promising that his imprisonment should not be of long duration for that
his friends were exerting themselves to soften the kings displeasure
still pretending the extreme of sympathy for him he followed up the
letters by presents of pastry and other delicacies which could not be
procured in the tower these articles were all poisoned occasionally
presents of a similar description were sent to sir jervis elwes with the
understanding that these articles were not poisoned when they were
unaccompanied by letters of these the unfortunate prisoner never tasted
a woman named turner who had formerly kept a house of illfame and who
had more than once lent it to further the guilty intercourse of rochester
and lady essex was the agent employed to procure the poisons they were
prepared by dr forman a pretended fortuneteller of lambeth assisted by
an apothecary named franklin both these persons knew for what purposes
the poisons were needed and employed their skill in mixing them in the
pastry and other edibles in such small quantities as gradually to wear
out the constitution of their victim mrs turner regularly furnished the
poisoned articles to the underkeeper who placed them before overbury
not only his food but his drink was poisoned arsenic was mixed with the
salt he ate and cantharides with the pepper all this time his health
declined sensibly daily he grew weaker and weaker and with a sickly
appetite craved for sweets and jellies rochester continued to condole
with him and anticipated all his wants in this respect sending him
abundance of pastry and occasionally partridges and other game and young
pigs with the sauce for the game mrs turner mixed a quantity of
cantharides and poisoned the pork with lunarcaustic as stated on the
trial overbury took in this manner poison enough to have poisoned twenty
men but his constitution was strong and he still lingered franklin the
apothecary confessed that he prepared with dr forman seven different
sorts of poisons viz aquafortis arsenic mercury powder of diamonds
lunar caustic great spiders and cantharides overbury held out so long
that rochester became impatient and in a letter to lady essex expressed
his wonder that things were not sooner despatched orders were immediately
sent by lady essex to the keeper to finish with the victim at once
overbury had not been all this time without suspicion of treachery
although he appears to have had no idea of poison he merely suspected
that it was intended to confine him for life and to set the king still
more bitterly against him in one of his letters he threatened rochester
that unless he were speedily liberated he would expose his villany to the
world he says you and i ere it be long will come to a public trial of
another nature    drive me not to extremities lest i should say
something that both you and i should repent    whether i live or
die your shame shall never die but ever remain to the world to make you
the most odious man living    i wonder much you should neglect him
to whom such secrets of all kinds have passed    be these the fruits
of common secrets common dangers
illustration sir thomas overbury
all these remonstrances and hints as to the dangerous secrets in his
keeping were ill calculated to serve him with a man so reckless as lord
rochester they were more likely to cause him to be sacrificed than to be
saved rochester appears to have acted as if he thought so he doubtless
employed the murderers reasoning that dead men tell no tales when
after receiving letters of this description he complained to his paramour
of the delay weston was spurred on to consummate the atrocity and the
patience of all parties being exhausted a dose of corrosive sublimate was
administered to him in october 1613 which put an end to his sufferings
after he had been for six months in their hands on the very day of his
death and before his body was cold he was wrapped up carelessly in a
sheet and buried without any funeral ceremony in a pit within the
precincts of the tower
sir anthony weldon in his court and character of james i gives a
somewhat different account of the closing scene of this tragedy he says
franklin and weston came into overburys chamber and found him in
infinite torment with contention between the strength of nature and the
working of the poison and it being very like that nature had gotten the
better in this contention by the thrusting out of boils blotches and
blains they fearing it might come to light by the judgment of
physicians the foul play that had been offered him consented to stifle
him with the bedclothes which accordingly was performed and so ended his
miserable life with the assurance of the conspirators that he died by the
poison none thinking otherwise than these two murderers
the sudden death the indecent haste of the funeral and the nonholding
of an inquest upon the body strengthened the suspicions that were afloat
rumour instead of whispering began to speak out and the relatives of
the deceased openly expressed their belief that their kinsman had been
murdered but rochester was still all powerful at court and no one dared
to utter a word to his discredit shortly afterwards his marriage with
the countess of essex was celebrated with the utmost splendour the king
himself being present at the ceremony
it would seem that overburys knowledge of jamess character was deeper
than rochester had given him credit for and that he had been a true
prophet when he predicted that his marriage would eventually estrange
james from his minion at this time however rochester stood higher than
ever in the royal favour but it did not last longconscience that busy
monitor was at work the tongue of rumour was never still and rochester
who had long been a guilty became at last a wretched man his cheeks lost
their colourhis eyes grew dim and he became moody careless and
melancholy the king seeing him thus took at length no pleasure in his
society and began to look about for another favourite george villiers
duke of buckingham was the man to his mind quickwitted handsome and
unscrupulous the two latter qualities alone were sufficient to recommend
him to james i in proportion as the influence of rochester declined that
of buckingham increased a falling favourite has no friends and rumour
wagged her tongue against rochester louder and more pertinaciously than
ever a new favourite too generally endeavours to hasten by a kick the
fall of the old one and buckingham anxious to work the complete ruin of
his forerunner in the kings good graces encouraged the relatives of sir
thomas overbury to prosecute their inquiries into the strange death of
their kinsman
james was rigorous enough in the punishment of offences when he was not
himself involved he piqued himself moreover on his dexterity in
unravelling mysteries the affair of sir thomas overbury found him
congenial occupation he set to work by ordering the arrest of sir jervis
elwes james at this early stage of the proceedings does not seem to
have been aware that rochester was so deeply implicated struck with
horror at the atrocious system of slow poisoning the king sent for all
the judges according to sir anthony weldon he knelt down in the midst of
them and said my lords the judges it is lately come to my hearing that
you have now in examination a business of poisoning lord in what a
miserable condition shall this kingdom be the only famous nation for
hospitality in the world if our tables should become such a snare as
that none could eat without danger of life and that italian custom should
be introduced among us therefore my lords i charge you as you will
answer it at that great and dreadful day of judgment that you examine it
strictly without favour affection or partiality and if you shall spare
any guilty of this crime gods curse light on you and your posterity and
if i spare any that are guilty gods curse light on me and my posterity
for ever
illustration duke of buckingham
the imprecation fell but too surely upon the devoted house of stuart the
solemn oath was broken and gods curse did light upon him and his
posterity
the next person arrested after sir jervis elwes was weston the
underkeeper then franklin and mrs turner and lastly the earl and
countess of somerset to which dignity rochester had been advanced since
the death of overbury
weston was first brought to trial public curiosity was on the stretch
nothing else was talked of and the court on the day of trial was crowded
to suffocation the state trials report that lord chief justice coke
laid open to the jury the baseness and cowardliness of poisoners who
attempt that secretly against which there is no means of preservation or
defence for a mans life and how rare it was to hear of any poisoning in
england so detestable it was to our nation but the devil had taught
divers to be cunning in it so that they can poison in what distance of
space they please by consuming the nativum calidum or humidum
radicale in one month two or three or more as they list which they
four manner of ways do execute viz haustu gustu odore and
contactu
illustration lord coke
when the indictment was read over weston made no other reply than lord
have mercy upon me lord have mercy upon me on being asked how he would
be tried he refused to throw himself upon a jury of his country and
declared that he would be tried by god alone in this he persisted for
some time the fear of the dreadful punishment for contumacy38 induced
him at length to plead not guilty and take his trial in due course of
law
    38 the punishment for the contumacious was expressed by the
         words onere frigore et fame by the first was meant that
         the culprit should be extended on his back on the ground and
         weights placed over his body gradually increased until he
         expired sometimes the punishment was not extended to this
         length and the victim being allowed to recover underwent
         the second portion the frigore which consisted in his
         standing naked in the open air for a certain space in the
         sight of all the people the third or fame was more
         dreadful the statute saying that he was to be preserved
         with the coarsest bread that could be got and water out of
         the next sink or puddle to the place of execution and that
         day he had water he should have no bread and that day he had
         bread he should have no water and in this torment he was to
         linger as long as nature would hold out
all the circumstances against him were fully proved and he was found
guilty and executed at tyburn mrs turner franklin and sir jervis elwes
were also brought to trial found guilty and executed between the 19th of
october and the 4th of december 1615 but the grand trial of the earl and
countess of somerset did not take place till the month of may following
on the trial of sir jervis elwes circumstances had transpired shewing a
guilty knowledge of the poisoning on the part of the earl of northampton
the uncle of lady somerset and the chief falconer sir thomas monson the
former was dead but sir thomas monson was arrested and brought to trial
it appeared however that he was too dangerous a man to be brought to the
scaffold he knew too many of the odious secrets of james i and his
dying speech might contain disclosures which would compromise the king to
conceal old guilt it was necessary to incur new the trial of sir thomas
monson was brought to an abrupt conclusion and himself set at liberty
already james had broken his oath he now began to fear that he had been
rash in engaging so zealously to bring the poisoners to punishment that
somerset would be declared guilty there was no doubt and that he looked
for pardon and impunity was equally evident to the king somerset while
in the tower asserted confidently that james would not dare to bring
him to trial in this he was mistaken but james was in an agony what the
secret was between them will now never be known with certainty but it may
be surmised some have imagined it to be the vice to which the king was
addicted while others have asserted that it related to the death of
prince henry a virtuous young man who had held somerset in especial
abhorrence this prince died early unlamented by his father and as
public opinion whispered at the time poisoned by somerset probably some
crime or other lay heavy upon the soul of the king and somerset his
accomplice could not be brought to public execution with safety hence
the dreadful tortures of james when he discovered that his favourite was
so deeply implicated in the murder of overbury every means was taken by
the agonised king to bring the prisoner into what was called a safe frame
of mind he was secretly advised to plead guilty and trust to the
clemency of the king the same advice was conveyed to the countess bacon
was instructed by the king to draw up a paper of all the points of mercy
and favour to somerset which might result from the evidence and somerset
was again recommended to plead guilty and promised that no evil should
ensue to him
illustration the earl of somerset
the countess was first tried she trembled and shed tears during the
reading of the indictment and in a low voice pleaded guilty on being
asked why sentence of death should not be passed against her she replied
meekly i can much aggravate but nothing extenuate my fault i desire
mercy and that the lords will intercede for me with the king sentence
of death was passed upon her
next day the earl was brought to trial he appears to have mistrusted the
promises of james and he pleaded not guilty with a selfpossession and
confidence which he felt probably from his knowledge of the kings
character he rigorously crossexamined the witnesses and made a stubborn
defence after a trial which lasted eleven hours he was found guilty and
condemned to the felons death
illustration the countess of somerset
whatever may have been the secrets between the criminal and the king the
latter notwithstanding his terrific oath was afraid to sign the
deathwarrant it might perchance have been his own the earl and
countess were committed to the tower where they remained for nearly five
years at the end of this period to the surprise and scandal of the
community and the disgrace of its chief magistrate they both received
the royal pardon but were ordered to reside at a distance from the court
having been found guilty of felony the estates of the earl had become
forfeited but james granted him out of their revenues an income of
4000l per annum shamelessness could go no further
of the afterlife of these criminals nothing is known except that the
love they had formerly borne each other was changed into aversion and
that they lived under the same roof for months together without the
interchange of a word
the exposure of their atrocities did not put a stop to the practice of
poisoning on the contrary as we shall see hereafter it engendered that
insane imitation which is so strange a feature of the human character
james himself is supposed with great probability to have fallen a victim
to it in the notes to harriss life and writings of james i there is
a good deal of information on the subject the guilt of buckingham
although not fully established rests upon circumstances of suspicion
stronger than have been sufficient to lead hundreds to the scaffold his
motives for committing the crime are stated to have been a desire of
revenge for the coldness with which the king in the latter years of his
reign began to regard him his fear that james intended to degrade him
and his hope that the great influence he possessed over the mind of the
heirapparent would last through a new reign if the old one were brought
to a close
in the second volume of the harleian miscellany there is a tract
entitled the forerunner of revenge written by george eglisham doctor
of medicine and one of the physicians to king james harris in quoting
it says that it is full of rancour and prejudice it is evidently
exaggerated but forms nevertheless a link in the chain of evidence
eglisham says the king being sick of an ague the duke took this
opportunity when all the kings doctors of physic were at dinner and
offered to him a white powder to take the which he a long time refused
but overcome with his flattering importunity he took it in wine and
immediately became worse and worse falling into many swoonings and pains
and violent fluxes of the belly so tormented that his majesty cried out
aloud of this white powder would to god i had never taken it he then
tells us of the countess of buckingham the dukes mother applying the
plaister to the kings heart and breast whereupon he grew faint and
shortbreathed and in agony that the physicians exclaimed that the king
was poisoned that buckingham commanded them out of the room and
committed one of them close prisoner to his own chamber and another to be
removed from court and that after his majestys death his body and head
swelled above measure his hair with the skin of his head stuck to his
pillow and his nails became loose on his fingers and toes clarendon
who by the way was a partisan of the dukes gives a totally different
account of jamess death he says it was occasioned by an ague after a
short indisposition by the gout which meeting many humours in a fat
unwieldy body of fiftyeight years old in four or five fits carried him
out of the worldafter whose death many scandalous and libellous
discourses were raised without the least colour or ground as appeared
upon the strictest and most malicious examination that could be made long
after in a time of license when nobody was afraid of offending majesty
and when prosecuting the highest reproaches and contumelies against the
royal family was held very meritorious notwithstanding this confident
declaration the world will hardly be persuaded that there was not some
truth in the rumours that were abroad the inquiries which were instituted
were not strict as he asserts and all the unconstitutional influence of
the powerful favourite was exerted to defeat them in the celebrated
accusations brought against buckingham by the earl of bristol the
poisoning of king james was placed last on the list and the pages of
history bear evidence of the summary mode in which they were for the
time got rid of
the man from whom buckingham is said to have procured his poisons was one
dr lamb a conjuror and empiric who besides dealing in poisons
pretended to be a fortuneteller the popular fury which broke with
comparative harmlessness against his patron was directed against this
man until he could not appear with safety in the streets of london his
fate was melancholy walking one day in cheapside disguised as he
thought from all observers he was recognised by some idle boys who
began to hoot and pelt him with stones calling out the poisoner the
poisoner down with the wizard down with him a mob very soon collected
and the doctor took to his heels and ran for his life he was pursued and
seized in wood street and from thence dragged by the hair through the
mire to st pauls cross the mob beating him with sticks and stones and
calling out kill the wizard kill the poisoner
charles i on hearing of the riot rode from whitehall to quell it but
he arrived too late to save the victim every bone in his body was broken
and he was quite dead charles was excessively indignant and fined the
city six hundred pounds for its inability to deliver up the ringleaders
to justice
illustration pauls cross seventeenth century
but it was in italy that poisoning was most prevalent from a very early
period it seems to have been looked upon in that country as a perfectly
justifiable means of getting rid of an enemy the italians of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries poisoned their opponents with as
little compunction as an englishman of the present day brings an action at
law against any one who has done him an injury the writings of
contemporary authors inform us that when la spara and la tophania carried
on their infernal trade ladies put poisonbottles on their
dressingtables as openly and used them with as little scruple upon
others as modern dames use eau de cologne or lavenderwater upon
themselves so powerful is the influence of fashion it can even cause
murder to be regarded as a venial peccadillo
in the memoirs of the last duke of guise who made a quixotic attempt in
1648 to seize upon the government of naples we find some curious
particulars relative to the popular feeling with regard to poisoning a
man named gennaro annese who after the short and extraordinary career of
masaniello the fisherman had established himself as a sort of
captaingeneral of the populace rendered himself so obnoxious to the duke
of guise that the adherents of the latter determined to murder him the
captain of the guard as the duke himself very coolly informs us was
requested to undertake this office it was suggested to him that the
poniard would be the most effectual instrument but the man turned up
his eyes with pious horror at the proposition he was ready to poison
gennaro annese whenever he might be called upon to do so but to poniard
him he said would be disgraceful and unbecoming an officer of the
guards at last poison was agreed upon and augustino molla an attorney
in the dukes confidence brought the bottle containing the liquid to shew
it to his master the following is the dukes own account
augustino came to me at night and told me i have brought you something
which will free you from gennaro he deserves death and it is no great
matter after what fashion justice is done upon him look at this vial
full of clear and beautiful water in four days time it will punish all
his treasons the captain of the guard has undertaken to give it him and
as it has no taste at all gennaro will suspect nothing
the duke further informs us that the dose was duly administered but that
gennaro fortunately for himself ate nothing for dinner that day but
cabbage dressed with oil which acting as an antidote caused him to vomit
profusely and saved his life he was exceedingly ill for five days but
never suspected that he had been poisoned
in process of time poisonvending became a profitable trade eleven years
after this period it was carried on at rome to such an extent that the
sluggish government was roused to interference beckmann in his history
of inventions and lebret in his magazin zum gebrauche der staaten
kirche geschichte or magazine of materials for a history of a state
church relates that in the year 1659 it was made known to pope
alexander vii that great numbers of young women had avowed in the
confessional that they had poisoned their husbands with slow poisons the
catholic clergy who in general hold the secrets of the confessional so
sacred were shocked and alarmed at the extraordinary prevalence of the
crime although they refrained from revealing the names of the penitents
they conceived themselves bound to apprise the head of the church of the
enormities that were practised it was also the subject of general
conversation in rome that young widows were unusually abundant it was
remarked too that if any couple lived unhappily together the husband
soon took ill and died the papal authorities when once they began to
inquire soon learned that a society of young wives had been formed and
met nightly for some mysterious purpose at the house of an old woman
named hieronyma spara this hag was a reputed witch and fortuneteller
and acted as president of the young viragos several of whom it was
afterwards ascertained belonged to the first families of rome
in order to have positive evidence of the practices of this female
conclave a lady was employed by the government to seek an interview with
them she dressed herself out in the most magnificent style and having
been amply provided with money she found but little difficulty when she
had stated her object of procuring an audience of la spara and her
sisterhood she pretended to be in extreme distress of mind on account of
the infidelities and illtreatment of her husband and implored la spara
to furnish her with a few drops of the wonderful elixir the efficacy of
which in sending cruel husbands to their last long sleep was so much
vaunted by the ladies of rome la spara fell into the snare and sold her
some of her drops at a price commensurate with the supposed wealth of
the purchaser
the liquor thus obtained was subjected to an analysis and found to be as
was suspected a slow poison clear tasteless and limpid like that
spoken of by the duke of guise upon this evidence the house was
surrounded by the police and la spara and her companions taken into
custody la spara who is described as having been a little ugly old
woman was put to the torture but obstinately refused to confess her
guilt another of the women named la gratiosa had less firmness and
laid bare all the secrets of the infernal sisterhood taking a confession
extorted by anguish on the rack at its true value nothing at all there
is still sufficient evidence to warrant posterity in the belief of their
guilt they were found guilty and condemned according to their degrees
of culpability to various punishments la spara gratiosa and three
young women who had poisoned their husbands were hanged together at
rome upwards of thirty women were whipped publicly through the streets
and several whose high rank screened them from more degrading punishment
were banished from the country and mulcted in heavy fines in a few
months afterwards nine women more were hanged for poisoning and another
bevy including many young and beautiful girls were whipped half naked
through the streets of rome
this severity did not put a stop to the practice and jealous women and
avaricious men anxious to step into the inheritance of fathers uncles
or brothers resorted to poison as it was quite free from taste colour
and smell it was administered without exciting suspicion the skilful
vendors compounded it of different degrees of strength so that the
poisoners had only to say whether they wanted their victims to die in a
week a month or six months and they were suited with corresponding
doses the vendors were chiefly women of whom the most celebrated was a
hag named tophania who was in this way accessory to the death of upwards
of six hundred persons this woman appears to have been a dealer in
poisons from her girlhood and resided first at palermo and then at
naples that entertaining traveller father lebat has given in his
letters from italy many curious particulars relating to her when he was
at civita vecchia in 1719 the viceroy of naples discovered that poison
was extensively sold in the latter city and that it went by the name of
aqueta or littlewater on making further inquiry he ascertained that
tophania who was by this time near seventy years of age and who seems to
have begun her evil courses very soon after the execution of la spara
sent large quantities of it to all parts of italy in small vials with the
inscription manna of st nicholas of barri
the tomb of st nicholas of barri was celebrated throughout italy a
miraculous oil was said to ooze from it which cured nearly all the
maladies that flesh is heir to provided the recipient made use of it with
the due degree of faith la tophania artfully gave this name to her
poison to elude the vigilance of the customhouse officers who in common
with every body else had a pious respect for st nicholas de barri and
his wonderful oil
the poison was similar to that manufactured by la spara hahnemann the
physician and father of the homoeopathic doctrine writing upon this
subject says it was compounded of arsenical neutral salts occasioning in
the victim a gradual loss of appetite faintness gnawing pains in the
stomach loss of strength and wasting of the lungs the abb gagliardi
says that a few drops of it were generally poured into tea chocolate or
soup and its effects were slow and almost imperceptible garelli
physician to the emperor of austria in a letter to hoffmann says it was
crystallised arsenic dissolved in a large quantity of water by decoction
with the addition for some unexplained purpose of the herb cymbalaria
the neapolitans called it aqua toffnina and it became notorious all
over europe under the name of aqua tophania
although this woman carried on her infamous traffic so extensively it was
extremely difficult to meet with her she lived in continual dread of
discovery she constantly changed her name and residence and pretending
to be a person of great godliness resided in monasteries for months
together whenever she was more than usually apprehensive of detection she
sought ecclesiastical protection she was soon apprised of the search made
for her by the viceroy of naples and according to her practice took
refuge in a monastery either the search after her was not very rigid or
her measures were exceedingly well taken for she contrived to elude the
vigilance of the authorities for several years what is still more
extraordinary as shewing the ramifications of her system her trade was
still carried on to as great an extent as before lebat informs us that
she had so great a sympathy for poor wives who hated their husbands and
wanted to get rid of them but could not afford to buy her wonderful
aqua that she made them presents of it
she was not allowed however to play at this game for ever she was at
length discovered in a nunnery and her retreat cut off the viceroy made
several representations to the superior to deliver her up but without
effect the abbess supported by the archbishop of the diocese constantly
refused the public curiosity was in consequence so much excited at the
additional importance thus thrust upon the criminal that thousands of
persons visited the nunnery in order to catch a glimpse of her
the patience of the viceroy appears to have been exhausted by these
delays being a man of sense and not a very zealous catholic he
determined that even the church should not shield a criminal so atrocious
setting the privileges of the nunnery at defiance he sent a troop of
soldiers who broke over the walls and carried her away vi et armis
the archbishop cardinal pignatelli was highly indignant and threatened
to excommunicate and lay the whole city under interdict all the inferior
clergy animated by the esprit du corps took up the question and so
worked upon the superstitious and bigoted people that they were ready to
rise in a mass to storm the palace of the viceroy and rescue the prisoner
these were serious difficulties but the viceroy was not a man to be
daunted indeed he seems to have acted throughout with a rare union of
astuteness coolness and energy to avoid the evil consequences of the
threatened excommunication he placed a guard round the palace of the
archbishop judging that the latter would not be so foolish as to launch
out an anathema which would cause the city to be starved and himself in
it the marketpeople would not have dared to come to the city with
provisions so long as it remained under the ban there would have been too
much inconvenience to himself and his ghostly brethren in such a measure
and as the viceroy anticipated the good cardinal reserved his thunders
for some other occasion
still there was the populace to quiet their clamour and avert the
impending insurrection the agents of the government adroitly mingled with
the people and spread abroad a report that tophania had poisoned all the
wells and fountains of the city this was enough the popular feeling was
turned against her immediately those who but a moment before had looked
upon her as a saint now reviled her as a devil and were as eager for her
punishment as they had before been for her escape tophania was then put
to the torture she confessed the long catalogue of her crimes and named
all the persons who had employed her she was shortly afterwards
strangled and her corpse thrown over the wall into the garden of the
convent from whence she had been taken this appears to have been done to
conciliate the clergy by allowing them at least the burial of one who
had taken refuge within their precincts
after her death the mania for poisoning seems to have abated but we have
yet to see what hold it took upon the french people at a somewhat earlier
period so rooted had it become in france between the years 1670 and 1680
that madame de sevign in one of her letters expresses her fear that
frenchman and poisoner would become synonymous terms
as in italy the first notice the government received of the prevalence of
this crime was given by the clergy to whom females of high rank and some
among the middle and lower classes had avowed in the confessional that
they had poisoned their husbands in consequence of these disclosures two
italians named exili and glaser were arrested and thrown into the
bastille on the charge of compounding and selling the drugs used for
these murders glaser died in prison but exili remained without trial for
several months and there shortly afterwards he made the acquaintance of
another prisoner named sainte croix by whose example the crime was still
further disseminated among the french people
the most notorious of the poisoners that derived their pernicious
knowledge from this man was madame de brinvilliers a young woman
connected both by birth and marriage with some of the noblest families of
france she seems from her very earliest years to have been heartless
and depraved and if we may believe her own confession was steeped in
wickedness ere she had well entered her teens she was however beautiful
and accomplished and in the eye of the world seemed exemplary and kind
guyot de pitaval in the causes clbres and madame de sevign in her
letters represent her as mild and agreeable in her manners and offering
no traces on her countenance of the evil soul within she was married in
1651 to the marquis de brinvilliers with whom she lived unhappily for
some years he was a loose dissipated character and was the means of
introducing sainte croix to his wife a man who cast a blight upon her
life and dragged her on from crime to crime till her offences became so
great that the mind shudders to dwell upon them for this man she
conceived a guilty passion to gratify which she plunged at once into the
gulf of sin she was drawn to its most loathsome depths ere retribution
overtook her
she had as yet shewn a fair outside to the world and found but little
difficulty in effecting a legal separation from her husband who had not
the art to conceal his vices the proceeding gave great offence to her
family she appears after this to have thrown off the mask completely
and carried on her intrigues so openly with her lover sainte croix that
her father m daubray scandalised at her conduct procured a lettre de
cachet and had him imprisoned in the bastille for a twelvemonth
illustration the bastille
sainte croix who had been in italy was a dabbler in poisons he knew
something of the secrets of the detestable la spara and improved himself
in them from the instructions of exili with whom he speedily contracted a
sort of friendship by him he was shewn how to prepare not only the
liquid poisons employed in italy but that known as succession powder
which afterwards became so celebrated in france like his mistress he
appeared amiable witty and intelligent and shewed no signs to the world
of the two fierce passions revenge and avarice which were gnawing at his
heart both these passions were to be sated on the unfortunate family of
daubray his revenge because they had imprisoned him and his avarice
because they were rich reckless and extravagant he was always in want of
money and he had no one to supply him but madame de brinvilliers whose
own portion was far from sufficient to satisfy his need groaning to think
that any impediment should stand between him and wealth he conceived the
horrid idea of poisoning m daubray her father and her two brothers
that she might inherit the property three murders were nothing to such a
villain he communicated his plan to madame de brinvilliers and she
without the slightest scruple agreed to aid him he undertook to compound
the poisons and she to administer them the zeal and alacrity with which
she set to work seem hardly credible sainte croix found her an apt
scholar and she soon became as expert as himself in the manufacture of
poisons to try the strength of the first doses she used to administer
them to dogs rabbits and pigeons afterwards wishing to be more certain
of their effects she went round to the hospitals and administered them
to the sick poor in the soups which she brought in apparent charity39
none of the poisons were intended to kill at the first dose so that she
could try them once upon an individual without fear of murder she tried
the same atrocious experiment upon the guests at her fathers table by
poisoning a pigeonpie to be more certain still she next poisoned
herself when convinced by this desperate essay of the potency of the
draught she procured an antidote from sainte croix and all doubts being
removed commenced operations upon her greyheaded father she
administered the first dose with her own hands in his chocolate the
poison worked well the old man was taken ill and his daughter
apparently full of tenderness and anxiety watched by his bedside the
next day she gave him some broth which she recommended as highly
nourishing this also was poisoned in this manner she gradually wore out
his frame and in less than ten days he was a corpse his death seemed so
much the result of disease that no suspicions were excited
    39 this is denied by voltaire in his age of louis xiv but he
         does not state for what reason his words are il est faux
         quelle eut essay ses poisons dans les hpitaux comme le
         disait le peuple et comme il est crit dans les causes

         peuple
when the two brothers arrived from the provinces to render the last sad
duties to their sire they found their sister as grieved to all outward
appearance as even filial affection could desire but the young men only
came to perish they stood between sainte croix and the already
halfclutched gold and their doom was sealed a man named la chausse
was hired by sainte croix to aid in administering the poisons and in
less than six weeks time they had both gone to their long home
suspicion was now excited but so cautiously had all been done that it
found no one upon whom to attach itself the marquise had a sister and
she was entitled by the death of her relatives to half the property
less than the whole would not satisfy sainte croix and he determined that
she should die the same death as her father and brothers she was too
distrustful however and by quitting paris she escaped the destruction
that was lurking for her
the marquise had undertaken these murders to please her lover she was now
anxious to perpetrate another on her own account she wished to marry
sainte croix but though separated from her husband she was not
divorced she thought it would be easier to poison him than to apply to
the tribunals for a divorce which might perhaps be refused but sainte
croix had no longer any love for his guilty instrument bad men do not
admire others who are as bad as themselves though a villain himself he
had no desire to marry one and was not at all anxious for the death of
the marquis he seemed however to enter into the plot and supplied her
with poison for her husband but he took care to provide a remedy la
brinvilliers poisoned him one day and sainte croix gave him an antidote
the next in this manner he was buffeted about between them for some time
and finally escaped with a ruined constitution and a broken heart
but the day of retribution was at hand and a terrible mischance brought
the murders to light the nature of the poisons compounded by sainte croix
was so deadly that when working in his laboratory he was obliged to
wear a mask to preserve himself from suffocation one day the mask
slipped off and the miserable wretch perished in his crimes his corpse
was found on the following morning in the obscure lodging where he had
fitted up his laboratory as he appeared to be without friends or
relatives the police took possession of his effects among other things
was found a small box to which was affixed the following singular
document
i humbly beg that those into whose hands this box may fall will do me
the favour to deliver it into the hands only of the marchioness de
brinvilliers who resides in the rue neuve st paul as every thing it
contains concerns her and belongs to her alone and as besides there is
nothing in it that can be of use to any person but her in case she shall
be dead before me it is my wish that it be burned with every thing it
contains without opening or altering any thing in order that no one may
plead ignorance i swear by the god that i adore and by all that is held
most sacred that i assert nothing but the truth and if my intentions
just and reasonable as they are be thwarted in this point by any persons
i charge their consciences with it both in this world and that which is
to come in order that i may unload mine i protest that this is my last
will done at paris may 25 1672      signed sainte croix
this earnest solicitation instead of insuring respect as was intended
excited curiosity the box was opened and found to contain some papers
and several vials and powders the latter were handed to a chemist for
analysis and the documents were retained by the police and opened among
them was found a promissory note of the marchioness de brinvilliers for
thirty thousand francs to the order of sainte croix the other papers
were of greater importance as they implicated both her and her servant
la chausse in the recent murders as soon as she was informed of the
death of sainte croix she made an attempt to gain possession of his
papers and the box but being refused she saw that there was no time to
be lost and immediately quitted next morning the police were on her
trail but she succeeded in escaping to england la chausse was not so
fortunate altogether ignorant of the fatal mischance which had brought
his villanies to light he did not dream of danger he was arrested and
brought to trial being put to the torture he confessed that he had
administered poison to the messieurs daubray and that he had received a
hundred pistoles and the promise of an annuity for life from sainte
croix and madame de brinvilliers for the job he was condemned to be
broken alive on the wheel and the marchioness was by default sentenced
to be beheaded he was executed accordingly in march 1673 on the place
de grve in paris
la brinvilliers appears to have resided for nearly three years in england
early in 1676 thinking that the rigour of pursuit was over and that she
might venture to return to the continent she proceeded secretly to lige
notwithstanding her care the french authorities were soon apprised of her
return and arrangements were promptly made with the municipality of that
city to permit the agents of the french police to arrest her within the
limits of their jurisdiction desgrais an officer of the marchausse
accordingly left paris for that purpose on his arrival in lige he found
that she had sought shelter within the walls of a convent here the arm of
the law long as it is said to be could not reach her but desgrais was
not a man to be baffled and he resorted to stratagem to accomplish what
force could not having disguised himself as a priest he sought admission
to the convent and obtained an interview with la brinvilliers he said
that being a frenchman and passing through lige he could not leave that
city without paying a visit to a lady whose beauty and misfortunes were so
celebrated her vanity was flattered by the compliment desgrais saw to
use a vulgar but forcible expression that he had got on the blind side
of her and he adroitly continued to pour out the language of love and
admiration till the deluded marchioness was thrown completely off her
guard she agreed without much solicitation to meet him outside the
walls of the convent where their amorous intrigue might be carried on
more conveniently than within faithful to her appointment with her
supposed new lover she came and found herself not in the embrace of a
gallant but in the custody of a policeman
her trial was not long delayed the proofs against her were abundant the
dying declaration of la chausse would have been alone enough to convict
her but besides that there were the mysterious document attached to the
box of st croix her flight from france and stronger and more damning
proof than all a paper in her own handwriting found among the effects
of st croix in which she detailed to him the misdeeds of her life and
spoke of the murder of her father and brothers in terms that left no doubt
of her guilt during the trial all paris was in commotion la
brinvilliers was the only subject of conversation all the details of her
crimes were published and greedily devoured and the idea of secret
poisoning first put into the heads of hundreds who afterwards became
guilty of it
on the 16th of july 1676 the superior criminal court of paris pronounced
a verdict of guilty against her for the murder of her father and
brothers and the attempt upon the life of her sister she was condemned
to be drawn on a hurdle with her feet bare a rope about her neck and a
burning torch in her hand to the great entrance of the cathedral of notre
dame where she was to make the amende honorable in sight of all the
people to be taken from thence to the place de grve and there to be
beheaded her body was afterwards to be burned and her ashes scattered to
the winds
after her sentence she made a full confession of her guilt she seems to
have looked upon death without fear but it was recklessness not courage
that supported her madame de sevign says that when on the hurdle on
her way to the scaffold she entreated her confessor to exert his
influence with the executioner to place himself next to her that his body
might hide from her view that scoundrel desgrais who had entrapped her
she also asked the ladies who had been drawn to their windows to witness
the procession what they were looking at adding a pretty sight you
have come to see truly she laughed when on the scaffold dying as she
had lived impenitent and heartless on the morrow the populace came in
crowds to collect her ashes to preserve them as relics she was regarded
as a martyred saint and her ashes were supposed to be endowed by divine
grace with the power of curing all diseases popular folly has often
canonised persons whose pretensions to sanctity were extremely equivocal
but the disgusting folly of the multitude in this instance has never
been surpassed
before her death proceedings were instituted against m de penautier
treasurer of the province of languedoc and receivergeneral for the
clergy who was accused by a lady named st laurent of having poisoned
her husband the late receivergeneral in order to obtain his
appointment the circumstances of this case were never divulged and the
greatest influence was exerted to prevent it from going to trial he was
known to have been intimate with sainte croix and madame de brinvilliers
and was thought to have procured his poisons from them the latter
however refused to say any thing which might implicate him the inquiry
was eventually stifled after penautier had been several months in the
bastille
the cardinal de bonzy was accused by the gossips of the day of being an
accomplice of penautier the cardinals estates were burdened with the
payment of several heavy annuities but about the time that poisoning
became so fashionable all the annuitants died off one after the other
the cardinal in talking of these annuitants afterwards used to say
thanks to my star i have outlived them all a wit seeing him and
penautier riding in the same carriage cried out in allusion to this
expression there go the cardinal de bonzy and his star
it was now that the mania for poisoning began to take hold of the popular
mind from this time until the year 1682 the prisons of france teemed
with persons accused of this crime and it is very singular that other
offences decreased in a similar proportion we have already seen the
extent to which it was carried in italy it was if possible surpassed in
france the diabolical ease with which these murders could be effected by
means of these scentless and tasteless poisons enticed the evilminded
jealousy revenge avarice even petty spite alike resorted to them
those who would have been deterred by fear of detection from using the
pistol or the dagger or even strong doses of poison which kill at once
employed slow poisons without dread the corrupt government of the day
although it could wink at the atrocities of a wealthy and influential
courtier like penautier was scandalised to see the crime spreading among
the people disgrace was in fact entailed in the eyes of europe upon
the name of frenchman louis xiv to put a stop to the evil instituted
what was called the chambre ardente or burning chamber with extensive
powers for the trial and punishment of the prisoners
two women especially made themselves notorious at this time and were
instrumental to the deaths of hundreds of individuals they both resided
in paris and were named lavoisin and lavigoreux like spara and tophania
of whom they were imitators they chiefly sold their poisons to women who
wanted to get rid of their husbands and in some few instances to
husbands who wanted to get rid of their wives their ostensible occupation
was that of midwives they also pretended to be fortunetellers and were
visited by persons of every class of society the rich and poor thronged
alike to their mansardes to learn the secrets of the future their
prophecies were principally of death they foretold to women the
approaching dissolution of husbands and to needy heirs the end of rich
relatives who had made them as byron expresses it wait too too long
already they generally took care to be instrumental in fulfilling their
own predictions they used to tell their wretched employers that some sign
of the approaching death would take place in the house such as the
breaking of glass or china and they paid servants considerable fees to
cause a breakage as if by accident exactly at the appointed time their
occupation as midwives made them acquainted with the secrets of many
families which they afterwards turned to dreadful account
it is not known how long they had carried on this awful trade before they
were discovered detection finally overtook them at the close of the year
1679 they were both tried found guilty and burned alive on the place de
grve on the 22d of february 1680 after their hands had been bored
through with a redhot iron and then cut off their numerous accomplices
in paris and in the provinces were also discovered and brought to trial
according to some authors thirty and to others fifty of them chiefly
women were hanged in the principal cities
lavoisin kept a list of the visitors who came to her house to purchase
poisons this paper was seized by the police on her arrest and examined
by the tribunals among the names were found those of the marshal de
luxembourg the countess de soissons and the duchess de bouillon the
marshal seems only to have been guilty of a piece of discreditable folly
in visiting a woman of this description but the popular voice at the time
imputed to him something more than folly the author of the memoirs of
the affairs of europe since the peace of utrecht says the miserable
gang who dealt in poison and prophecy alleged that he had sold himself to
the devil and that a young girl of the name of dupin had been poisoned by
his means among other stories they said he had made a contract with the
devil in order to marry his son to the daughter of the marquis of
louvois to this atrocious and absurd accusation the marshal who had
surrendered himself at the bastille on the first accusation against him
replied with the mingled sentiment of pride and innocence when mathieu
de montmorenci my ancestor married the widow of louis le gros he did
not have recourse to the devil but to the statesgeneral in order to
obtain for the minor king the support of the house of montmorenci this
brave man was imprisoned in a cell six feet and a half long and his
trial which was interrupted for several weeks lasted altogether fourteen
months no judgment was pronounced upon him
the countess of soissons fled to brussels rather than undergo the risk of
a trial and was never able to clear herself from the stigma that attached
to her of having made an attempt to poison the queen of spain by doses of
successionpowder the duchess of bouillon was arrested and tried by the
chambre ardente it would appear however that she had nothing to do with
the slow poisons but had merely endeavoured to pry into the secrets of
futurity and gratify her curiosity with a sight of the devil one of the
presidents of the chambre la reynie an ugly little old man very
seriously asked her whether she had really seen the devil to which the
lady replied looking him full in the face oh yes i see him now he is
in the form of a little ugly old man exceedingly illnatured and is
dressed in the robes of a counsellor of state m la reynie prudently
refrained from asking any more questions of a lady with so sharp and ready
a tongue the duchess was imprisoned for several months in the bastille
and nothing being proved against her she was released at the intercession
of her powerful friends the severe punishment of criminals of this note
might have helped to abate the fever of imitation among the vulgartheir
comparative impunity had a contrary tendency the escape of penautier and
the wealthy cardinal de bonzy his employer had the most pernicious
effect for two years longer the crime continued to rage and was not
finally suppressed till the stake had blazed or the noose dangled for
upwards of a hundred individuals40
    40 slow poisoning is a crime which has unhappily been revived in
         england within the last few years and which has been carried
         to an extent sufficient to cast a stain upon the national
         character the poisoners have been principally women of the
         lowest class and their victims have been their husbands or
         their children the motive for the crime has in most
         instances been the basest that can be imaginedthe desire
         to obtain from burialclubs to which they subscribed the
         premium or burialmoney a recent enactment restricting the
         sale of arsenic and other poisons will it is to be hoped
         check if it do not extirpate this abominable crime1851

who has not either seen or heard of some house shut up and uninhabitable
fallen into decay and looking dusty and dreary from which at midnight
strange sounds have been heard to issueaerial knockingsthe rattling of
chains and the groaning of perturbed spiritsa house that people have
thought it unsafe to pass after dark and which has remained for years
without a tenant and which no tenant would occupy even were he paid to
do so there are hundreds of such houses in england at the present day
hundreds in france germany and almost every country of europe which are
marked with the mark of fearplaces for the timid to avoid and the pious
to bless themselves at and ask protection from as they passthe abodes
of ghosts and evil spirits there are many such houses in london and if
any vain boaster of the march of intellect would but take the trouble to
find them out and count them he would be convinced that intellect must
yet make some enormous strides before such old superstitions can be
eradicated
the idea that such houses exist is a remnant of the witch creed which
merits separate notice from its comparative harmlessness and from its
being not so much a madness as a folly of the people unlike other notions
that sprang from the belief in witchcraft and which we have already dwelt
upon at sufficient length it has sent no wretches to the stake or the
gibbet and but a few to the pillory only
many houses have been condemned as haunted and avoided by the weak and
credulous from circumstances the most trifling in themselves and which
only wanted a vigorous mind to clear up at once and dissipate all alarm
a house in aixlachapelle a large desolatelooking building remained
uninhabited for five years on account of the mysterious knockings that
there were heard within it at all hours of the day and night nobody could
account for the noises and the fear became at last so excessive that the
persons who inhabited the houses on either side relinquished their
tenancy and went to reside in other quarters of the town where there was
less chance of interruption from evil spirits from being so long without
an inhabitant the house at last grew so ruinous so dingy and so
miserable in its outward appearance and so like the place that ghosts
might be supposed to haunt that few persons cared to go past it after
sunset the knocking that was heard in one of the upper rooms was not very
loud but it was very regular the gossips of the neighbourhood asserted
that they often heard groans from the cellars and saw lights moved about
from one window to another immediately after the midnight bell had tolled
spectres in white habiliments were reported to have gibed and chattered
from the windows but all these stories could bear no investigation the
knocking however was a fact which no one could dispute and several
ineffectual attempts were made by the proprietor to discover the cause
the rooms were sprinkled with holy water the evil spirits were commanded
in due form by a priest to depart thence to the red sea but the
knockings still continued in spite of all that could be done in that way
accident at last discovered the cause and restored tranquillity to the
neighbourhood the proprietor who suffered not only in his mind but in
his pocket had sold the building at a ruinously small price to get rid
of all future annoyance the new proprietor was standing in a room on the
first floor when he heard the door driven to at the bottom with a
considerable noise and then fly open immediately about two inches and no
more he stood still a minute and watched and the same thing occurred a
second and a third time he examined the door attentively and all the
mystery was unravelled the latch of the door was broken so that it could
not be fastened and it swung chiefly upon the bottom hinge immediately
opposite was a window in which one pane of glass was broken and when the
wind was in a certain quarter the draught of air was so strong that it
blew the door to with some violence there being no latch it swung open
again and when there was a fresh gust was again blown to the new
proprietor lost no time in sending for a glazier and the mysterious
noises ceased for ever the house was replastered and repainted and once
more regained its lost good name it was not before two or three years
however that it was thoroughly established in popular favour and many
persons even then would always avoid passing it if they could reach
their destination by any other street
a similar story is narrated by sir walter scott in his letters on
demonology and witchcraft the hero of which was a gentleman of birth and
distinction well known in the political world shortly after he succeeded
to his title and estates there was a rumour among the servants concerning
a strange noise that used to be heard at night in the family mansion and
the cause of which no one could ascertain the gentleman resolved to
discover it himself and to watch for that purpose with a domestic who had
grown old in the family and who like the rest had whispered strange
things about the knocking having begun immediately upon the death of his
old master these two watched until the noise was heard and at last
traced it to a small storeroom used as a place for keeping provisions of
various kinds for the family and of which the old butler had the key
they entered this place and remained for some time without hearing the
noises which they had traced thither at length the sound was heard but
much lower than it seemed to be while they were farther off and their
imaginations were more excited they then discovered the cause without
difficulty a rat caught in an oldfashioned trap had occasioned the
noise by its efforts to escape in which it was able to raise the
trapdoor of its prison to a certain height but was then obliged to drop
it the noise of the fall resounding through the house had occasioned the
mysterious rumours which but for the investigation of the proprietor
would in all probability have acquired so bad a name for the dwelling
that no servants would have inhabited it the circumstance was told to sir
walter scott by the gentleman to whom it happened
illustration saint louis
but in general houses that have acquired this character have been more
indebted for it to the roguery of living men than to accidents like these
six monks played off a clever trick of the kind upon that worthy king
louis whose piety has procured him in the annals of his own country the
designation of the saint having heard his confessor speak in terms of
warm eulogy of the goodness and learning of the monks of the order of st
bruno he expressed his wish to establish a community of them near paris
bernard de la tour the superior sent six of the brethren and the king
gave them a handsome house to live in in the village of chantilly it so
happened that from their windows they had a very fine view of the ancient
palace of vauvert which had been built for a royal residence by king
robert but deserted for many years the worthy monks thought the palace
would just suit them but their modesty was so excessive that they were
ashamed to ask the king for a grant of it in due form this difficulty was
not to be overcome and the monks set their ingenuity to work to discover
another plan the palace of vauvert had never laboured under any
imputation upon its character until they became its neighbours but
somehow or other it almost immediately afterwards began to acquire a bad
name frightful shrieks were heard to proceed from it at night blue red
and green lights were suddenly seen to glimmer from the windows and as
suddenly to disappear the clanking of chains was heard and the howling
as of persons in great pain these disturbances continued for several
months to the great terror of all the country round and even of the
pious king louis to whom at paris all the rumours were regularly
carried with whole heaps of additions that accumulated on the way at last
a great spectre clothed all in peagreen with a long white beard and a
serpents tail took his station regularly at midnight in the principal
window of the palace and howled fearfully and shook his fists at the
passengers the six monks at chantilly to whom all these things were duly
narrated were exceedingly wrath that the devil should play such antics
right opposite their dwelling and hinted to the commissioners sent down
by saint louis to investigate the matter that if they were allowed to
inhabit the palace they would very soon make a clearance of the evil
spirits the king was quite charmed with their piety and expressed to
them how grateful he felt for their disinterestedness a deed was
forthwith drawn up the royal signmanual was affixed to it and the
palace of vauvert became the property of the monks of st bruno the deed
is dated 1259 the disturbances ceased immediately the lights
disappeared and the green ghost so said the monks was laid at rest for
ever under the waves of the red sea41

in the year 1580 one gilles blacre had taken the lease of a house in the
suburbs of tours but repenting him of his bargain with the landlord
peter piquet he endeavoured to prevail upon him to cancel the agreement
peter however was satisfied with his tenant and his terms and would
listen to no compromise very shortly afterwards the rumour was spread
all over tours that the house of gilles blacre was haunted gilles himself
asserted that he verily believed his house to be the general rendezvous of
all the witches and evil spirits of france the noise they made was awful
and quite prevented him from sleeping they knocked against the wall
howled in the chimneys broke his windowglass scattered his pots and
pans all over his kitchen and set his chairs and tables a dancing the
whole night through crowds of persons assembled round the house to hear
the mysterious noises and the bricks were observed to detach themselves
from the wall and fall into the streets upon the heads of those who had
not said their paternoster before coming out in the morning these things
having continued for some time gilles blacre made his complaint to the
civil court of tours and peter piquet was summoned to shew cause why the
lease should not be annulled poor peter could make no defence and the
court unanimously agreed that no lease could hold good under such
circumstances and annulled it accordingly condemning the unlucky owner
to all the expenses of the suit peter appealed to the parliament of
paris and after a long examination the parliament confirmed the lease
not said the judge because it has not been fully and satisfactorily
proved that the house is troubled by evil spirits but that there was an
informality in the proceedings before the civil court of tours that
rendered its decision null and of no effect
a similar cause was tried before the parliament of bourdeaux in the year
1595 relative to a house in that city which was sorely troubled by evil
spirits the parliament appointed certain ecclesiastics to examine and
report to them and on their report in the affirmative that the house was
haunted the lease was annulled and the tenant absolved from all payment
of rent and taxes42
    42 ibid p 156
one of the best stories of a haunted house is that of the royal palace of
woodstock in the year 1649 when the commissioners sent from london by
the long parliament to take possession of it and efface all the emblems
of royalty about it were fairly driven out by their fear of the devil
and the annoyances they suffered from a roguish cavalier who played the
imp to admiration the commissioners dreading at that time no devil
arrived at woodstock on the 13th of october 1649 they took up their
lodgings in the late kings apartmentsturned the beautiful bedrooms and
withdrawingrooms into kitchens and sculleriesthe councilhall into a
brewhouse and made the diningroom a place to keep firewood in they
pulled down all the insignia of royal state and treated with the utmost
indignity every thing that recalled to their memory the name or the
majesty of charles stuart one giles sharp accompanied them in the
capacity of clerk and seconded their efforts apparently with the
greatest zeal he aided them to uproot a noble old tree merely because it
was called the kings oak and tossed the fragments into the diningroom
to make cheerful fires for the commissioners during the first two days
they heard some strange noises about the house but they paid no great
attention to them on the third however they began to suspect they had
got into bad company for they heard as they thought a supernatural dog
under their bed which gnawed their bedclothes on the next day the
chairs and tables began to dance apparently of their own accord on the
fifth day something came into the bedchamber and walked up and down and
fetching the warmingpan out of the withdrawingroom made so much noise
with it that they thought five churchbells were ringing in their ears on
the sixth day the plates and dishes were thrown up and down the
diningroom on the seventh they penetrated into the bedroom in company
with several logs of wood and usurped the soft pillows intended for the
commissioners on the eighth and ninth nights there was a cessation of
hostilities but on the tenth the bricks in the chimneys became
locomotive and rattled and danced about the floors and round the heads
of the commissioners all the night long on the eleventh the demon ran
away with their breeches and on the twelfth filled their beds so full of
pewter platters that they could not get into them on the thirteenth
night the glass became unaccountably seized with a fit of cracking and
fell into shivers in all parts of the house on the fourteenth there was
a noise as if forty pieces of artillery had been fired off and a shower
of pebblestones which so alarmed the commissioners that struck with
great horror they cried out to one another for help
they first of all tried the efficacy of prayers to drive away the evil
spirits but these proving unavailing they began seriously to reflect
whether it would not be much better to leave the place altogether to the
devils that inhabited it they ultimately resolved however to try it a
little longer and having craved forgiveness of all their sins betook
themselves to bed that night they slept in tolerable comfort but it was
merely a trick of their tormentor to lull them into false security when
on the succeeding night they heard no noises they began to flatter
themselves that the devil was driven out and prepared accordingly to take
up their quarters for the whole winter in the palace these symptoms on
their part became the signal for renewed uproar among the fiends on the
1st of november they heard something walking with a slow and solemn pace
up and down the withdrawingroom and immediately afterwards a shower of
stones bricks mortar and broken glass pelted about their ears on the
2d the steps were again heard in the withdrawingroom sounding to their
fancy very much like the treading of an enormous bear which continued for
about a quarter of an hour this noise having ceased a large warmingpan
was thrown violently upon the table followed by a number of stones and
the jawbone of a horse some of the boldest walked valiantly into the
withdrawingroom armed with swords and pistols but could discover
nothing they were afraid that night to go to sleep and sat up making
fires in every room and burning candles and lamps in great abundance
thinking that as the fiends loved darkness they would not disturb a
company surrounded with so much light they were deceived however
buckets of water came down the chimneys and extinguished the fires and
the candles were blown out they knew not how some of the servants who
had betaken themselves to bed were drenched with putrid ditchwater as
they lay and arose in great fright muttering incoherent prayers and
exposing to the wondering eyes of the commissioners their linen all
dripping with green moisture and their knuckles red with the blows they
had at the same time received from some invisible tormentors while they
were still speaking there was a noise like the loudest thunder or the
firing of a whole park of artillery upon which they all fell down upon
their knees and implored the protection of the almighty one of the
commissioners then arose the others still kneeling and asked in a
courageous voice and in the name of god who was there and what they had
done that they should be troubled in that manner no answer was returned
and the noises ceased for a while at length however as the
commissioners said the devil came again and brought with it seven
devils worse than itself being again in darkness they lighted a candle
and placed it in the doorway that it might throw a light upon the two
chambers at once but it was suddenly blown out and one commissioner said
that he had seen the similitude of a horses hoof striking the candle and
candlestick into the middle of the chamber and afterwards making three
scrapes on the snuff to put it out upon this the same person was so
bold as to draw his sword but he asserted positively that he had hardly
withdrawn it from the scabbard before an invisible hand seized hold of it
and tugged with him for it and prevailing struck him so violent a blow
with the pommel that he was quite stunned then the noises began again
upon which with one accord they all retired into the presencechamber
where they passed the night praying and singing psalms
they were by this time convinced that it was useless to struggle any
longer with the powers of evil that seemed determined to make woodstock
their own these things happened on the saturday night and being repeated
on the sunday they determined to leave the place immediately and return
to london by tuesday morning early all their preparations were
completed and shaking the dust off their feet and devoting woodstock
and all its inhabitants to the infernal gods they finally took their
departure43

many years elapsed before the true cause of these disturbances was
discovered it was ascertained at the restoration that the whole was the
work of giles sharp the trusty clerk of the commissioners this man
whose real name was joseph collins was a concealed royalist and had
passed his early life within the bowers of woodstock so that he knew
every hole and corner of the place and the numerous trapdoors and secret
passages that abounded in the building the commissioners never
suspecting the true state of his opinions but believing him to be
revolutionary to the backbone placed the utmost reliance upon him a
confidence which he abused in the manner above detailed to his own great
amusement and that of the few cavaliers whom he let into the secret
quite as extraordinary and as cleverly managed was the trick played off at
tedworth in 1661 at the house of mr mompesson and which is so
circumstantially narrated by the rev joseph glanvil under the title of
the demon of tedworth and appended among other proofs of witchcraft
to his noted work called sadducismus triumphatus about the middle of
april in the year above mentioned mr mompesson having returned to his
house at tedworth from a journey he had taken to london was informed by
his wife that during his absence they had been troubled with the most
extraordinary noises three nights afterwards he heard the noise himself
and it appeared to him to be that of a great knocking at his doors and
on the outside of his walls he immediately arose dressed himself took
down a pair of pistols and walked valiantly forth to discover the
disturber under the impression that it must be a robber but as he went
the noise seemed to travel before or behind him and when he arrived at
the door from which he thought it proceeded he saw nothing but still
heard a strange hollow sound he puzzled his brains for a long time and
searched every corner of the house but discovering nothing he went to
bed again he was no sooner snug under the clothes than the noise began
again more furiously than ever sounding very much like a thumping and
drumming on the top of his house and then by degrees going off into the
air
these things continued for several nights when it came to the
recollection of mr mompesson that some time before he had given orders
for the arrest and imprisonment of a wandering drummer who went about the
country with a large drum disturbing quiet people and soliciting alms
and that he had detained the mans drum and that probably the drummer was
a wizard and had sent evil spirits to haunt his house to be revenged of
him he became strengthened in his opinion every day especially when the
noises assumed to his fancy a resemblance to the beating of a drum
like that at the breaking up of a guard mrs mompesson being brought to
bed the devil or the drummer very kindly and considerately refrained
from making the usual riot but as soon as she recovered strength began
again in a ruder manner than before following and vexing the young
children and beating their bedsteads with so much violence that every one
expected they would fall in pieces for an hour together as the worthy
mr mompesson repeated to his wondering neighbours this infernal drummer
would beat roundheads and cuckolds the tattoo and several other
points of war as cleverly as any soldier when this had lasted long
enough he changed his tactics and scratched with his iron talons under
the childrens bed on the 5th of november says the rev joseph
glanvil it made a mighty noise and a servant observing two boards in
the childrens room seeming to move he bid it give him one of them upon
which the board came nothing moving it that he saw within a yard of him
the man added nay let me have it in my hand upon which the spirit
devil or drummer pushed it towards him so close that he might touch it
this continues glanvil was in the daytime and was seen by a whole
room full of people that morning it left a sulphureous smell behind it
which was very offensive at night the minister one mr cragg and
several of the neighbours came to the house on a visit mr cragg went to
prayers with them kneeling at the childrens bedside where it then
became very troublesome and loud during prayertime the spirit withdrew
into the cockloft but returned as soon as prayers were done and then
in sight of the company the chairs walked about the room of themselves
the childrens shoes were hurled over their heads and every loose thing
moved about the chamber at the same time a bedstaff was thrown at the
minister which hit him on the leg but so favourably that a lock of wool
could not have fallen more softly on another occasion the blacksmith of
the village a fellow who cared neither for ghost nor devil slept with
john the footman that he also might hear the disturbances and be cured of
his incredulity when there came a noise in the room as if one had been
shoeing a horse and somewhat came as it were with a pair of pincers
snipping and snapping at the poor blacksmiths nose the greater part of
the night next day it came panting like a dog out of breath upon which
some woman present took a bedstaff to knock at it which was caught
suddenly out of her hand and thrown away and company coming up the room
was presently filled with a bloomy noisome smell and was very hot
though without fire in a very sharp and severe winter it continued in
the bed panting and scratching for an hour and a half and then went into
the next room where it knocked a little and seemed to rattle a chain
the rumour of these wonderful occurrences soon spread all over the
country and people from far and near flocked to the haunted house of
tedworth to believe or doubt as their natures led them but all filled
with intense curiosity it appears too that the fame of these events
reached the royal ear and that some gentlemen were sent by the king to
investigate the circumstances and draw up a report of what they saw or
heard whether the royal commissioners were more sensible men than the
neighbours of mr mompesson and required more clear and positive evidence
than they or whether the powers with which they were armed to punish any
body who might be found carrying on this deception frightened the
evildoers is not certain but glanvil himself reluctantly confesses that
all the time they were in the house the noises ceased and nothing was
heard or seen however says he as to the quiet of the house when the
courtiers were there the intermission may have been accidental or
perhaps the demon was not willing to give so public a testimony of those
transactions which might possibly convince those who he had rather should
continue in unbelief of his existence
as soon as the royal commissioners took their departure the infernal
drummer recommenced his antics and hundreds of persons were daily present
to hear and wonder mr mompessons servant was so fortunate as not only
to hear but to see this pertinacious demon for it came and stood at the
foot of his bed the exact shape and proportion of it he could not
discover but he saw a great body with two red and glaring eyes which
for some time were fixed steadily on him and at length disappeared
innumerable were the antics it played once it purred like a cat beat the
childrens legs black and blue put a long spike into mr mompessons bed
and a knife into his mothers filled the porringers with ashes hid a
bible under the grate and turned the money black in peoples pockets
one night said mr mompesson in a letter to mr glanvil there were
seven or eight of these devils in the shape of men who as soon as a gun
was fired would shuffle away into an arbour a circumstance which might
have convinced mr mompesson of the mortal nature of his persecutors if
he had not been of the number of those worse than blind who shut their
eyes and refuse to see
in the mean time the drummer the supposed cause of all the mischief
passed his time in gloucester gaol whither he had been committed as a
rogue and a vagabond being visited one day by some person from the
neighbourhood of tedworth he asked what was the news in wiltshire and
whether people did not talk a great deal about a drumming in a gentlemans
house there the visitor replied that he heard of nothing else upon which
the drummer observed i have done it i have thus plagued him and he
shall never be quiet until he hath made me satisfaction for taking away my
drum no doubt the fellow who seems to have been a gipsy spoke the
truth and that the gang of which he was a member knew more about the
noises at mr mompessons house than any body else upon these words
however he was brought to trial at salisbury for witchcraft and being
found guilty was sentenced to transportation a sentence which for its
leniency excited no little wonder in that age when such an accusation
whether proved or not generally insured the stake or the gibbet glanvil
says that the noises ceased immediately the drummer was sent beyond the
seas but that somehow or other he managed to return from
transportation by raising storms and affrighting the seamen it was
said when the disturbances were forthwith renewed and continued at
intervals for several years certainly if the confederates of this roving
gipsy were so pertinacious in tormenting poor weak mr mompesson their
pertinacity is a most extraordinary instance of what revenge is capable
of it was believed by many at the time that mr mompesson himself was
privy to the whole matter and permitted and encouraged these tricks in
his house for the sake of notoriety but it seems more probable that the
gipsies were the real delinquents and that mr mompesson was as much
alarmed and bewildered as his credulous neighbours whose excited
imaginations conjured up no small portion of these stories
   which rolled and as they rolled grew larger visibly
many instances of a similar kind during the seventeenth century might be
gleaned from glanvil and other writers of that period but they do not
differ sufficiently from these to justify a detail of them the most
famous of all haunted houses acquired its notoriety much nearer our own
time and the circumstances connected with it are so curious and afford
so fair a specimen of the easy credulity even of wellinformed and
sensible people as to merit a little notice in this chapter the
cocklane ghost as it was called kept london in commotion for a
considerable time and was the theme of conversation among the learned and
the illiterate and in every circle from that of the prince to that of
the peasant
illustration the haunted house in cock lane
at the commencement of the year 1760 there resided in cock lane near
west smithfield in the house of one parsons the parish clerk of st
sepulchres a stockbroker named kent the wife of this gentleman had
died in childbed during the previous year and his sisterinlaw miss
fanny had arrived from norfolk to keep his house for him they soon
conceived a mutual affection and each of them made a will in the others
favour they lived some months in the house of parsons who being a needy
man borrowed money of his lodger some difference arose betwixt them and
mr kent left the house and instituted legal proceedings against the
parishclerk for the recovery of his money
while this matter was yet pending miss fanny was suddenly taken ill of
the smallpox and notwithstanding every care and attention she died in
a few days and was buried in a vault under clerkenwell church parsons
now began to hint that the poor lady had come unfairly by her death and
that mr kent was accessory to it from his too great eagerness to enter
into possession of the property she had bequeathed him nothing further
was said for nearly two years but it would appear that parsons was of so
revengeful a character that he had never forgotten or forgiven his
differences with mr kent and the indignity of having been sued for the
borrowed money the strong passions of pride and avarice were silently at
work during all that interval hatching schemes of revenge but dismissing
them one after the other as impracticable until at last a notable one
suggested itself about the beginning of the year 1762 the alarm was
spread over all the neighbourhood of cock lane that the house of parsons
was haunted by the ghost of poor fanny and that the daughter of parsons
a girl about twelve years of age had several times seen and conversed
with the spirit who had moreover informed her that she had not died of
the smallpox as was currently reported but of poison administered by
mr kent parsons who originated took good care to countenance these
reports and in answer to numerous inquiries said his house was every
night and had been for two years in fact ever since the death of fanny
troubled by a loud knocking at the doors and in the walls having thus
prepared the ignorant and credulous neighbours to believe or exaggerate
for themselves what he had told them he sent for a gentleman of a higher
class in life to come and witness these extraordinary occurrences the
gentleman came accordingly and found the daughter of parsons to whom the
spirit alone appeared and whom alone it answered in bed trembling
violently having just seen the ghost and been again informed that she
had died from poison a loud knocking was also heard from every part of
the chamber which so mystified the not very clear understanding of the
visitor that he departed afraid to doubt and ashamed to believe but
with a promise to bring the clergyman of the parish and several other
gentlemen on the following day to report upon the mystery
on the following night he returned bringing with him three clergymen and
about twenty other persons including two negroes when upon a
consultation with parsons they resolved to sit up the whole night and
await the ghosts arrival it was then explained by parsons that although
the ghost would never render itself visible to any body but his daughter
it had no objection to answer the questions that might be put to it by
any person present and that it expressed an affirmation by one knock a
negative by two and its displeasure by a kind of scratching the child
was then put into bed along with her sister and the clergymen examined
the bed and bedclothes to satisfy themselves that no trick was played by
knocking upon any substance concealed among the clothes as on the
previous night the bed was observed to shake violently
illustration room in the haunted house in cock lane44
    44 the woman whose ghost was said to manifest itself in cock
         lane was buried in the crypt or cloister of st john
         clerkenwell the vault is composed of two aisles that on the
         south being much narrower than the otherit was here she
         was deposited
         about seven years since i was sketching a picturesque
         trefoilheaded door leading into this part of the vault and
         the place being at that time in great confusion with coffins
         remains of bodies some of which were dried like mummies
         c i could find no better seat than one of the coffins the
         sextons boy who held my light informed me this was the
         coffin of scratching fanny which recalled the cock lane
         story to my mind i got off the lid of the coffin and saw
         the face of a handsome woman with an aquiline nose this
         feature remaining perfect an uncommon case for the
         cartilage mostly gives way the remains had become adipocere
         and were perfectly preserved she was said to have been
         poisoned by deleterious punch but this was legally
         disproved and if i remember rightly she was otherwise
         declared to have died of smallpox of this disease there was
         not the least sign but as some mineral poisons tend to
         render bodies adipocere here was some evidence in support of
         the former allegation i made particular inquiries at the
         time of mr bird churchwarden a respectable and judicious
         man and he gave me good assurance that this coffin had
         always been looked upon as the one containing the cock lane
         woman since that time the vault has been set in order and
         the abovementioned coffin with others put away
         the niche near the window in the drawing of the ghost room is
         the place where the bedhead was and where the scratching
         knocks c were heard this is the tradition of the house
         mrs king who holds the premises informs me that her family
         has had the house about eighty yearsj w archer
after some hours during which they all waited with exemplary patience
the mysterious knocking was heard in the wall and the child declared that
she saw the ghost of poor fanny the following questions were then gravely
put by the clergyman through the medium of one mary frazer the servant
of parsons and to whom it was said the deceased lady had been much
attached the answers were in the usual fashion by a knock or knocks
do you make this disturbance on account of the illusage you received
from mr kentyes

carrots who was present was appealed to but she stated positively that
such was not the fact as the deceased was quite speechless an hour before
her death this shook the faith of some of the spectators but the
examination was allowed to continue

at what time this morning will you take your departure
the answer to this question was four knocks very distinctly heard by
every person present and accordingly at four oclock precisely the ghost
took its departure to the wheatsheaf publichouse close by where it
frightened mine host and his lady almost out of their wits by knocking in
the ceiling right above their bed
the rumour of these occurrences very soon spread over london and every
day cock lane was rendered impassable by the crowds of people who
assembled around the house of the parish clerk in expectation of either
seeing the ghost or of hearing the mysterious knocks it was at last found
necessary so clamorous were they for admission within the haunted
precincts to admit those only who would pay a certain fee an arrangement
which was very convenient to the needy and moneyloving mr parsons
indeed things had taken a turn greatly to his satisfaction he not only
had his revenge but he made a profit out of it the ghost in
consequence played its antics every night to the great amusement of many
hundreds of people and the great perplexity of a still greater number
unhappily however for the parish clerk the ghost was induced to make
some promises which were the means of utterly destroying its reputation
it promised in answer to the questions of the rev mr aldritch of
clerkenwell that it would not only follow the little miss parsons
wherever she went but would also attend him or any other gentleman into
the vault under st johns church where the body of the murdered woman
was deposited and would there give notice of its presence by a distinct
knock upon the coffin as a preliminary the girl was conveyed to the
house of mr aldritch near the church where a large party of ladies and
gentlemen eminent for their acquirements their rank or their wealth
had assembled about ten oclock on the night of the first of february
the girl having been brought from cock lane in a coach was put to bed by
several ladies in the house of mr aldritch a strict examination having
been previously made that nothing was hidden in the bedclothes while the
gentlemen in an adjoining chamber were deliberating whether they should
proceed in a body to the vault they were summoned into the bedroom by the
ladies who affirmed in great alarm that the ghost was come and that
they heard the knocks and scratches the gentlemen entered accordingly
with a determination to suffer no deception the little girl on being
asked whether she saw the ghost replied no but she felt it on her back
like a mouse she was then required to put her hands out of bed and they
being held by some of the ladies the spirit was summoned in the usual
manner to answer if it were in the room the question was several times
put with great solemnity but the customary knock was not heard in reply
in the walls neither was there any scratching the ghost was then asked
to render itself visible but it did not choose to grant the request it
was next solicited to give some token of its presence by a sound of any
sort or by touching the hand or cheek of any lady or gentleman in the
room but even with this request the ghost would not comply
there was now a considerable pause and one of the clergymen went down
stairs to interrogate the father of the girl who was waiting the result
of the experiment he positively denied that there was any deception and
even went so far as to say that he himself upon one occasion had seen
and conversed with the awful ghost this having been communicated to the
company it was unanimously resolved to give the ghost another trial and
the clergyman called out in a loud voice to the supposed spirit that the
gentleman to whom it had promised to appear in the vault was about to
repair to that place where he claimed the fulfilment of its promise at
one hour after midnight they all proceeded to the church and the
gentleman in question with another entered the vault alone and took up
their position alongside of the coffin of poor fanny the ghost was then
summoned to appear but it appeared not it was summoned to knock but it
knocked not it was summoned to scratch but it scratched not and the two
retired from the vault with a firm belief that the whole business was a
deception practised by parsons and his daughter there were others
however who did not wish to jump so hastily to a conclusion and who
suggested that they were perhaps trifling with this awful and supernatural
being which being offended with them for their presumption would not
condescend to answer them again after serious consultation it was
agreed on all hands that if the ghost answered any body at all it would
answer mr kent the supposed murderer and he was accordingly requested
to go down into the vault he went with several others and summoned the
ghost to answer whether he had indeed poisoned her there being no answer
the question was put by mr aldritch who conjured it if it were indeed a
spirit to end their doubts make a sign of its presence and point out
the guilty person there being still no answer for the space of half an
hour during which time all these boobies waited with the most
praiseworthy perseverance they returned to the house of mr aldritch and
ordered the girl to get up and dress herself she was strictly examined
but persisted in her statement that she used no deception and that the
ghost had really appeared to her
so many persons had by their openly expressed belief of the reality of
the visitation identified themselves with it that parsons and his family
were far from being the only persons interested in the continuance of the
delusion the result of the experiment convinced most people but these
were not to be convinced by any evidence however positive and they
therefore spread abroad the rumour that the ghost had not appeared in the
vault because mr kent had taken care beforehand to have the coffin
removed that gentleman whose position was a very painful one
immediately procured competent witnesses in whose presence the vault was
entered and the coffin of poor fanny opened their depositions were then
published and mr kent indicted parsons and his wife his daughter mary
frazer the servant the rev mr moor and a tradesman two of the most
prominent patrons of the deception for a conspiracy the trial came on in
the court of kings bench on the 10th of july before lord chiefjustice
mansfield when after an investigation which lasted twelve hours the
whole of the conspirators were found guilty the rev mr moor and his
friend were severely reprimanded in open court and recommended to make
some pecuniary compensation to the prosecutor for the aspersions they had
been instrumental in throwing upon his character parsons was sentenced to
stand three times in the pillory and to be imprisoned for two years his
wife to one years and his servant to six months imprisonment in the
bridewell a printer who had been employed by them to publish an account
of the proceedings for their profit was also fined fifty pounds and
discharged
the precise manner in which the deception was carried on has never been
explained the knocking in the wall appears to have been the work of
parsons wife while the scratching part of the business was left to the
little girl that any contrivance so clumsy could have deceived any body
cannot fail to excite our wonder but thus it always is if two or three
persons can only be found to take the lead in any absurdity however
great there is sure to be plenty of imitators like sheep in a field if
one clears the stile the rest will follow
about ten years afterwards london was again alarmed by the story of a
haunted house stockwell near vauxhall the scene of the antics of this
new ghost became almost as celebrated in the annals of superstition as
cock lane mrs golding an elderly lady who resided alone with her
servant anne robinson was sorely surprised on the evening of
twelfthday 1772 to observe a most extraordinary commotion among her
crockery cups and saucers rattled down the chimneypots and pans were
whirled down stairs or through the windows and hams cheeses and loaves
of bread disported themselves upon the floor as if the devil were in them
this at least was the conclusion that mrs golding came to and being
greatly alarmed she invited some of her neighbours to stay with her and
protect her from the evil one their presence however did not put a stop
to the insurrection of china and every room in the house was in a short
time strewed with the fragments the chairs and tables joined at last in
the tumult and things looked altogether so serious and inexplicable that
the neighbours dreading that the house itself would next be seized with a
fit of motion and tumble about their ears left poor mrs golding to bear
the brunt of it by herself the ghost in this case was solemnly
remonstrated with and urged to take its departure but the demolition
continuing as great as before mrs golding finally made up her mind to
quit the house altogether she took refuge with anne robinson in the house
of a neighbour but his glass and crockery being immediately subjected to
the same persecution he was reluctantly compelled to give her notice to
quit the old lady thus forced back to her own house endured the
disturbance for some days longer when suspecting that anne robinson was
the cause of all the mischief she dismissed her from her service the
extraordinary appearances immediately ceased and were never afterwards
renewed a fact which is of itself sufficient to point out the real
disturber a long time afterwards anne robinson confessed the whole
matter to the reverend mr brayfield this gentleman confided the story to
mr hone who has published an explanation of the mystery anne it
appears was anxious to have a clear house to carry on an intrigue with
her lover and resorted to this trick to effect her purpose she placed
the china on the shelves in such a manner that it fell on the slightest
motion and attached horsehairs to other articles so that she could jerk
them down from an adjoining room without being perceived by any one she
was exceedingly dexterous at this sort of work and would have proved a
formidable rival to many a juggler by profession a full explanation of
the whole affair may be found in the everyday book
the latest instance of the popular panic occasioned by a house supposed to
be haunted occurred in scotland in the winter of the year 1838 on the
5th of december the inmates of the farmhouse of baldarroch in the
district of banchory aberdeenshire were alarmed by observing a great
number of sticks pebblestones and clods of earth flying about their
yard and premises they endeavoured but in vain to discover who was the
delinquent and the shower of stones continuing for five days in
succession they came at last to the conclusion that the devil and his
imps were alone the cause of it the rumour soon spread over all that part
of the country and hundreds of persons came from far and near to witness
the antics of the devils of baldarroch after the fifth day the shower of
clods and stones ceased on the outside of the premises and the scene
shifted to the interior spoons knives plates mustardpots
rollingpins and flatirons appeared suddenly endued with the power of
selfmotion and were whirled from room to room and rattled down the
chimneys in a manner which nobody could account for the lid of a
mustardpot was put into a cupboard by the servantgirl in the presence of
scores of people and in a few minutes afterwards came bouncing down the
chimney to the consternation of every body there was also a tremendous
knocking at the doors and on the roof and pieces of stick and
pebblestones rattled against the windows and broke them the whole
neighbourhood was a scene of alarm and not only the vulgar but persons
of education respectable farmers within a circle of twenty miles
expressed their belief in the supernatural character of these events and
offered up devout prayers to be preserved from the machinations of the
evil one the note of fear being once sounded the visitors as is
generally the case in all tales of wonder strove with each other who
should witness the most extraordinary occurrences and within a week it
was generally believed in the parishes of banchoryternan drumoak
durris kincardineoneil and all the circumjacent districts of mearns
and aberdeenshire that the devil had been seen in the act of hammering
upon the housetop of baldarroch one old man asserted positively that
one night after having been to see the strange gambols of the knives and
mustardpots he met the phantom of a great black man who wheeled round
his head with a whizzing noise making a wind about his ears that almost
blew his bonnet off and that he was haunted by him in this manner for
three miles it was also affirmed and believed that all horses and dogs
that approached this enchanted ground were immediately affected that a
gentleman slow of faith had been cured of his incredulity by meeting the
butterchurn jumping in at the door as he himself was going out that the
roofs of houses had been torn off and that several ricks in the cornyard
had danced a quadrille together to the sound of the devils bagpipes
reechoing from the mountaintops the women in the family of the
persecuted farmer of baldarroch also kept their tongues in perpetual
motion swelling with their strange stories the tide of popular wonder
the goodwife herself and all her servants said that whenever they went
to bed they were attacked with stones and other missiles some of which
came below the blankets and gently tapped their toes one evening a shoe
suddenly darted across a garret where some labourers were sitting and one
of the men who attempted to catch it swore positively that it was so hot
and heavy he was unable to hold it it was also said that the bearbeater
a sort of mortar used to bruise barley inan object of such weight that
it requires several men to move itspontaneously left the barn and flew
over the housetop alighting at the feet of one of the servantmaids and
hitting her but without hurting her in the least or even causing her any
alarm it being a fact well known to her that all objects thus thrown
about by the devil lost their specific gravity and could harm nobody
even though they fell upon a persons head
among the persons drawn to baldarroch by these occurrences were the
heritor the minister and all the elders of the kirk under whose
superintendence an investigation was immediately commenced their
proceedings were not promulgated for some days and in the mean time
rumour continued to travel through all the highlands magnifying each
mysterious incident the farther it got from home it was said that when
the goodwife put her potatopot on the fire each potato as the water
boiled changed into a demon and grinned horribly at her as she lifted
the lid that not only chairs and tables but carrots and turnips skipped
along the floor in the merriest manner imaginable that shoes and boots
went through all the evolutions of the highland fling without any visible
wearers directing their motions and that a piece of meat detached itself
from the hook on which it hung in the pantry and placed itself before the
fire whence all the efforts of the people of the house were unable to
remove it until it was thoroughly roasted and that it then flew up the
chimney with a tremendous bang at baldarroch itself the belief was not
quite so extravagant but the farmer was so convinced that the devil and
his imps were alone the cause of all the disturbance that he travelled a
distance of forty miles to an old conjuror named willie foreman to
induce him for a handsome fee to remove the enchantment from his
property there were of course some sensible and educated people who
after stripping the stories circulated of their exaggeration attributed
all the rest to one or other of two causes first that some gipsies or
strolling mendicants hidden in the neighbouring plantation were amusing
themselves by working on the credulity of the country people or
secondly that the inmates of baldarroch carried on this deception
themselves for some reason or other which was not very clear to any
body the last opinion gained but few believers as the farmer and his
family were much respected and so many persons had in the most open
manner expressed their belief in the supernatural agency that they did
not like to stultify themselves by confessing that they had been deceived
at last after a fortnights continuance of the noises the whole trick
was discovered the two servant lasses were strictly examined and then
committed to prison it appeared that they were alone at the bottom of the
whole affair and that the extraordinary alarm and credulity of their
master and mistress in the first instance and of the neighbours and
country people afterwards made their task comparatively easy a little
common dexterity was all they had used and being themselves unsuspected
they swelled the alarm by the wonderful stories they invented it was they
who loosened the bricks in the chimneys and placed the dishes in such a
manner on the shelves that they fell on the slightest motion in short
they played the same tricks as those used by the servant girl at
stockwell with the same results and for the same purposethe
gratification of a love of mischief they were no sooner secured in the
county gaol than the noises ceased and most people were convinced that
human agency alone had worked all the wonder some few of the most
devoutly superstitious still held out in their first belief and refused
to listen to any explanation
these tales of haunted houses especially those of the last and present
century however they may make us blush for popular folly are yet
gratifying in their results for they shew that society has made a vast
improvement had parsons and his wife and the other contrivers of the
cock lane deception lived two hundred years earlier they would not
perhaps have found a greater number of dupes but they would have been
hanged as witches instead of being imprisoned as vagabonds the ingenious
anne robinson and the sly lasses of baldarroch would doubtless have met a
similar fate thus it is pleasant to reflect that though there may be as
much folly and credulity in the world as ever in one class of society
there is more wisdom and mercy in another than ever were known before
lawgivers by blotting from the statutebook the absurd or sanguinary
enactments of their predecessors have made one step towards teaching the
people it is to be hoped that the day is not far distant when lawgivers
will teach the people by some more direct means and prevent the
recurrence of delusions like these and many worse which might be cited
by securing to every child born within their dominions an education in
accordance with the advancing state of civilisation if ghosts and witches
are not yet altogether exploded it is the fault not so much of the
ignorant people as of the law and the government that have neglected to
enlighten them
popular follies of great cities
    la faridondainela faridondon
      vive la faridondaineberanger
illustration t
the popular humours of a great city are a neverfailing source of
amusement to the man whose sympathies are hospitable enough to embrace all
his kind and who refined though he may be himself will not sneer at the
humble wit or grotesque peculiarities of the boozing mechanic the squalid
beggar the vicious urchin and all the motley group of the idle the
reckless and the imitative that swarm in the alleys and broadways of a
metropolis he who walks through a great city to find subjects for
weeping may find plenty at every corner to wring his heart but let such
a man walk on his course and enjoy his grief alonewe are not of those
who would accompany him the miseries of us poor earthdwellers gain no
alleviation from the sympathy of those who merely hunt them out to be
pathetic over them the weeping philosopher too often impairs his eyesight
by his woe and becomes unable from his tears to see the remedies for the
evils which he deplores thus it will often be found that the man of no
tears is the truest philanthropist as he is the best physician who wears
a cheerful face even in the worst of cases
so many pens have been employed to point out the miseries and so many to
condemn the crimes and vices and more serious follies of the multitude
that ours shall not increase the number at least in this chapter our
present task shall be less ungracious and wandering through the busy
haunts of great cities we shall seek only for amusement and note as we
pass a few of the harmless follies and whimsies of the poor
and first of all walk where we will we cannot help hearing from every
side a phrase repeated with delight and received with laughter by men
with hard hands and dirty faces by saucy butcher lads and errandboys by
loose women by hackney coachmen cabrioletdrivers and idle fellows who
loiter at the corners of streets not one utters this phrase without
producing a laugh from all within hearing it seems applicable to every
circumstance and is the universal answer to every question in short it
is the favourite slang phrase of the day a phrase that while its brief
season of popularity lasts throws a dash of fun and frolicsomeness over
the existence of squalid poverty and illrequited labour and gives them
reason to laugh as well as their more fortunate fellows in a higher stage
of society
london is peculiarly fertile in this sort of phrases which spring up
suddenly no one knows exactly in what spot and pervade the whole
population in a few hours no one knows how many years ago the favourite
phrase for though but a monosyllable it was a phrase in itself was
quoz this odd word took the fancy of the multitude in an extraordinary
degree and very soon acquired an almost boundless meaning when vulgar
wit wished to mark its incredulity and raise a laugh at the same time
there was no resource so sure as this popular piece of slang when a man
was asked a favour which he did not choose to grant he marked his sense
of the suitors unparalleled presumption by exclaiming quoz when a
mischievous urchin wished to annoy a passenger and create mirth for his
comrades he looked him in the face and cried out quoz and the
exclamation never failed in its object when a disputant was desirous of
throwing a doubt upon the veracity of his opponent and getting summarily
rid of an argument which he could not overturn he uttered the word
quoz with a contemptuous curl of his lip and an impatient shrug of his
shoulders the universal monosyllable conveyed all his meaning and not
only told his opponent that he lied but that he erred egregiously if he
thought that any one was such a nincompoop as to believe him every
alehouse resounded with quoz every streetcorner was noisy with it and
every wall for miles around was chalked with it
but like all other earthly things quoz had its season and passed away
as suddenly as it arose never again to be the pet and the idol of the
populace a new claimant drove it from its place and held undisputed sway
till in its turn it was hurled from its preeminence and a successor
appointed in its stead
what a shocking bad hat was the phrase that was next in vogue no
sooner had it become universal than thousands of idle but sharp eyes were
on the watch for the passenger whose hat shewed any signs however slight
of ancient service immediately the cry arose and like the warwhoop of
the indians was repeated by a hundred discordant throats he was a wise
man who finding himself under these circumstances the observed of all
observers bore his honours meekly he who shewed symptoms of illfeeling
at the imputations cast upon his hat only brought upon himself redoubled
notice the mob soon perceive whether a man is irritable and if of their
own class they love to make sport of him when such a man and with such
a hat passed in those days through a crowded neighbourhood he might
think himself fortunate if his annoyances were confined to the shouts and
cries of the populace the obnoxious hat was often snatched from his head
and thrown into the gutter by some practical joker and then raised
covered with mud upon the end of a stick for the admiration of the
spectators who held their sides with laughter and exclaimed in the
pauses of their mirth oh what a shocking bad hat what a shocking
bad hat many a nervous poor man whose purse could but ill spare the
outlay doubtless purchased a new hat before the time in order to avoid
exposure in this manner
the origin of this singular saying which made fun for the metropolis for
months is not involved in the same obscurity as that which shrouds the
origin of quoz and some others there had been a hotly contested
election for the borough of southwark and one of the candidates was an
eminent hatter this gentleman in canvassing the electors adopted a
somewhat professional mode of conciliating their goodwill and of bribing
them without letting them perceive that they were bribed whenever he
called upon or met a voter whose hat was not of the best material or
being so had seen its best days he invariably said what a shocking
bad hat you have got call at my warehouse and you shall have a new
one upon the day of election this circumstance was remembered and his
opponents made the most of it by inciting the crowd to keep up an
incessant cry of what a shocking bad hat all the time the honourable
candidate was addressing them from southwark the phrase spread over all
london and reigned for a time the supreme slang of the season
hookey walker derived from the chorus of a popular ballad was also
high in favour at one time and served like its predecessor quoz to
answer all questions in the course of time the latter word alone became
the favourite and was uttered with a peculiar drawl upon the first
syllable and a sharp turn upon the last if a lively servant girl was
importuned for a kiss by a fellow she did not care about she cocked her
little nose and cried walker if a dustman asked his friend for the
loan of a shilling and his friend was either unable or unwilling to
accommodate him the probable answer he would receive was walker if
a drunken man was reeling about the streets and a boy pulled his
coattails or a man knocked his hat over his eyes to make fun of him the
joke was always accompanied by the same exclamation this lasted for two
or three months and walker walked off the stage never more to be
revived for the entertainment of that or any future generation
the next phrase was a most preposterous one who invented it how it
arose or where it was first heard are alike unknown nothing about it is
certain but that for months it was the slang par excellence of the
londoners and afforded them a vast gratification there he goes with
his eye out or there she goes with her eye out as the sex of the
party alluded to might be was in the mouth of every body who knew the
town the sober part of the community were as much puzzled by this
unaccountable saying as the vulgar were delighted with it the wise
thought it very foolish but the many thought it very funny and the idle
amused themselves by chalking it upon walls or scribbling it upon
monuments but all thats bright must fade even in slang the people
grew tired of their hobby and there he goes with his eye out was
heard no more in its accustomed haunts
another very odd phrase came into repute in a brief space afterwards in
the form of the impertinent and not universally apposite query has your
mother sold her mangle but its popularity was not of that boisterous
and cordial kind which ensures a long continuance of favour what tended
to impede its progress was that it could not be well applied to the older
portions of society it consequently ran but a brief career and then sank
into oblivion its successor enjoyed a more extended fame and laid its
foundations so deep that years and changing fashions have not sufficed to
eradicate it this phrase was flare up and it is even now a
colloquialism in common use it took its rise in the time of the reform
riots when bristol was nearly half burned by the infuriated populace the
flames were said to have flared up in the devoted city whether there
was any thing peculiarly captivating in the sound or in the idea of these
words is hard to say but whatever was the reason it tickled the
mobfancy mightily and drove all other slang out of the field before it
nothing was to be heard all over london but flare up it answered all
questions settled all disputes was applied to all persons all things
and all circumstances and became suddenly the most comprehensive phrase
in the english language the man who had overstepped the bounds of decorum
in his speech was said to have flared up he who had paid visits too
repeated to the ginshop and got damaged in consequence had flared up
to put ones self into a passion to stroll out on a nocturnal frolic and
alarm a neighbourhood or to create a disturbance in any shape was to
flare up a lovers quarrel was a flare up so was a boxingmatch
between two blackguards in the streets and the preachers of sedition and
revolution recommended the english nation to flare up like the french
so great a favourite was the word that people loved to repeat it for its
very sound they delighted apparently in hearing their own organs
articulate it and labouring men when none who could respond to the call
were within hearing would often startle the aristocratic echoes of the
west by the wellknown slang phrase of the east even in the dead hours of
the night the ears of those who watched late or who could not sleep
were saluted with the same sound the drunkard reeling home shewed that he
was still a man and a citizen by calling flare up in the pauses of
his hiccough drink had deprived him of the power of arranging all other
ideas his intellect was sunk to the level of the brutes but he clung to
humanity by the one last link of the popular cry while he could
vociferate that sound he had rights as an englishman and would not sleep
in a gutter like a dog onwards he went disturbing quiet streets and
comfortable people by his whoop till exhausted nature could support him
no more and he rolled powerless into the road when in due time
afterwards the policeman stumbled upon him as he lay that guardian of
the peace turned the full light of his lantern on his face and exclaimed
heres a poor devil who has been flaring up then came the stretcher
on which the victim of deep potations was carried to the watchhouse and
pitched into a dirty cell among a score of wretches about as far gone as
himself who saluted their new comrade by a loud long shout of flare
up
so universal was this phrase and so enduring seemed its popularity that
a speculator who knew not the evanescence of slang established a weekly
newspaper under its name but he was like the man who built his house upon
the sand his foundation gave way under him and the phrase and the
newspaper were washed into the mighty sea of the things that were the
people grew at last weary of the monotony and flare up became vulgar
even among them gradually it was left to little boys who did not know the
world and in process of time sank altogether into neglect it is now
heard no more as a piece of popular slang but the words are still used to
signify any sudden outburst either of fire disturbance or illnature
the next phrase that enjoyed the favour of the million was less concise
and seems to have been originally aimed against precocious youths who gave
themselves the airs of manhood before their time does your mother know
youre out was the provoking query addressed to young men of more than
reasonable swagger who smoked cigars in the streets and wore false
whiskers to look irresistible we have seen many a conceited fellow who
could not suffer a woman to pass him without staring her out of
countenance reduced at once into his natural insignificance by the mere
utterance of this phrase apprentice lads and shopmen in their sunday
clothes held the words in abhorrence and looked fierce when they were
applied to them altogether the phrase had a very salutary effect and in
a thousand instances shewed young vanity that it was not half so pretty
and engaging as it thought itself what rendered it so provoking was the
doubt it implied as to the capability of selfguidance possessed by the
individual to whom it was addressed does your mother know youre out
was a query of mock concern and solicitude implying regret and concern
that one so young and inexperienced in the ways of a great city should be
allowed to wander abroad without the guidance of a parent hence the great
wrath of those who verged on manhood but had not reached it whenever
they were made the subject of it even older heads did not like it and
the heir of a ducal house and inheritor of a warriors name to whom they
were applied by a cabrioletdriver who was ignorant of his rank was so
indignant at the affront that he summoned the offender before the
magisterial bench the fellow had wished to impose upon his lordship by
asking double the fare he was entitled to and when his lordship resisted
the demand he was insultingly asked if his mother knew he was out all
the drivers on the stand joined in the query and his lordship was fain to
escape their laughter by walking away with as much haste as his dignity
would allow the man pleaded ignorance that his customer was a lord but
offended justice fined him for his mistake
when this phrase had numbered its appointed days it died away like its
predecessors and who are you reigned in its stead this new
favourite like a mushroom seems to have sprung up in a night or like a
frog in cheapside to have come down in a sudden shower one day it was
unheard unknown uninvented the next it pervaded london every alley
resounded with it every highway was musical with it
   and street to street and lane to lane flung back
    the one unvarying cry
the phrase was uttered quickly and with a sharp sound upon the first and
last words leaving the middle one little more than an aspiration like
all its compeers which had been extensively popular it was applicable to
almost every variety of circumstance the lovers of a plain answer to a
plain question did not like it at all insolence made use of it to give
offence ignorance to avoid exposing itself and waggery to create
laughter every new comer into an alehouse taproom was asked
unceremoniously who are you and if he looked foolish scratched his
head and did not know what to reply shouts of boisterous merriment
resounded on every side an authoritative disputant was not unfrequently
put down and presumption of every kind checked by the same query when
its popularity was at its height a gentleman feeling the hand of a thief
in his pocket turned suddenly round and caught him in the act
exclaiming who are you the mob which gathered round applauded to the
very echo and thought it the most capital joke they had ever heard the
very acm of wit the very essence of humour another circumstance of a
similar kind gave an additional fillip to the phrase and infused new life
and vigour into it just as it was dying away the scene occurred in the
chief criminal court of the kingdom a prisoner stood at the bar the
offence with which he had been charged was clearly proved against him his
counsel had been heard not in his defence but in extenuation insisting
upon his previous good life and character as reasons for the lenity of the
court and where are your witnesses inquired the learned judge who
presided please you my lord i knows the prisoner at the bar and a
more honester feller never breathed said a rough voice in the gallery
the officers of the court looked aghast and the strangers tittered with
illsuppressed laughter who are you said the judge looking suddenly
up but with imperturbable gravity the court was convulsed the titter
broke out into a laugh and it was several minutes before silence and
decorum could be restored when the ushers recovered their
selfpossession they made diligent search for the profane transgressor
but he was not to be found nobody knew him nobody had seen him after a
while the business of the court again proceeded the next prisoner brought
up for trial augured favourably of his prospects when he learned that the
solemn lips of the representative of justice had uttered the popular
phrase as if he felt and appreciated it there was no fear that such a
judge would use undue severity his heart was with the people he
understood their language and their manners and would make allowances for
the temptations which drove them into crime so thought many of the
prisoners if we may infer it from the fact that the learned judge
suddenly acquired an immense increase of popularity the praise of his wit
was in every mouth and who are you renewed its lease and remained
in possession of public favour for another term in consequence
but it must not be supposed that there were no interregna between the
dominion of one slang phrase and another they did not arise in one long
line of unbroken succession but shared with song the possession of
popular favour thus when the people were in the mood for music slang
advanced its claims to no purpose and when they were inclined for slang
the sweet voice of music wooed them in vain about thirty years ago london
resounded with one chorus with the love of which every body seemed to be
smitten girls and boys young men and old maidens and wives and widows
were all alike musical there was an absolute mania for singing and the
worst of it was that like good father philip in the romance of the
monastery they seemed utterly unable to change their tune cherry
ripe cherry ripe was the universal cry of all the idle in the town
every unmelodious voice gave utterance to it every crazy fiddle every
cracked flute every wheezy pipe every streetorgan was heard in the same
strain until studious and quiet men stopped their ears in desperation or
fled miles away into the fields or woodlands to be at peace this plague
lasted for a twelvemonth until the very name of cherries became an
abomination in the land at last the excitement wore itself away and the
tide of favour set in a new direction whether it was another song or a
slang phrase is difficult to determine at this distance of time but
certain it is that very shortly afterwards people went mad upon a
dramatic subject and nothing was to be heard of but tommy and jerry
verbal wit had amused the multitude long enough and they became more
practical in their recreation every youth on the town was seized with the
fierce desire of distinguishing himself by knocking down the charlies
being locked up all night in a watchhouse or kicking up a row among
loose women and blackguard men in the low dens of st giless imitative
boys vied with their elders in similar exploits until this unworthy
passion for such it was had lasted like other follies its appointed
time and the town became merry after another fashion it was next thought
the height of vulgar wit to answer all questions by placing the point of
the thumb upon the tip of the nose and twirling the fingers in the air
if one man wished to insult or annoy another he had only to make use of
this cabalistic sign in his face and his object was accomplished at
every streetcorner where a group was assembled the spectator who was
curious enough to observe their movements would be sure to see the fingers
of some of them at their noses either as a mark of incredulity surprise
refusal or mockery before he had watched two minutes there is some
remnant of this absurd custom to be seen to this day but it is thought
low even among the vulgar
about sixteen years ago london became again most preposterously musical
the vox populi wore itself hoarse by singing the praises of the sea
the sea if a stranger and a philosopher had walked through london and
listened to the universal chorus he might have constructed a very pretty
theory upon the love of the english for the seaservice and our
acknowledged superiority over all other nations upon that element no
wonder he might have said that this people is invincible upon the
ocean the love of it mixes with their daily thoughts they celebrate it
even in the marketplace their streetminstrels excite charity by it and
high and low young and old male and female chant lo pans in its
praise love is not honoured in the national songs of this warlike
racebacchus is no god to them they are men of sterner mould and think
only of the sea the sea and the means of conquering upon it
such would doubtless have been his impression if he had taken the
evidence only of his ears alas in those days for the refined ears that
were musical great was their torture when discord with its thousand
diversities of tone struck up this appalling anthemthere was no escape
from it the migratory minstrels of savoy caught the strain and pealed it
down the long vistas of quiet streets till their innermost and snuggest
apartments reechoed with the sound men were obliged to endure this
crying evil for full six months wearied to desperation and made
seasick on the dry land
several other songs sprang up in due succession afterwards but none of
them with the exception of one entitled all round my hat enjoyed any
extraordinary share of favour until an american actor introduced a vile
song called jim crow the singer sang his verses in appropriate costume
with grotesque gesticulations and a sudden whirl of his body at the close
of each verse it took the taste of the town immediately and for months
the ears of orderly people were stunned by the senseless chorus
   turn about and wheel about
      and do just so
    turn about and wheel about
      and jump jim crow
streetminstrels blackened their faces in order to give proper effect to
the verses and fatherless urchins who had to choose between thieving and
singing for their livelihood took the latter course as likely to be the
more profitable as long as the public taste remained in that direction
the uncouth dance its accompaniment might be seen in its full perfection
on market nights in any great thoroughfare and the words of the song
might be heard piercing above all the din and buzz of the evermoving
multitude he the calm observer who during the heyday popularity of
this doggrel
                   sate beside the public way
    thick strewn with summer dust and saw the stream
    of people there was hurrying to and fro
    numerous as gnats upon the evening gleam
might have exclaimed with shelley that
   the million with fierce song and maniac dance
    did rage around
the philosophic theorist we have already supposed soliloquising upon the
english character and forming his opinion of it from their exceeding love
for a seasong might if he had again dropped suddenly into london have
formed another very plausible theory to account for our unremitting
efforts for the abolition of the slavetrade benevolent people he
might have said how unbounded are your sympathies your unhappy brethren
of africa differing from you only in the colour of their skins are so
dear to you and you begrudge so little the twenty millions you have paid
on their behalf that you love to have a memento of them continually in
your sight jim crow is the representative of that injured race and as
such is the idol of your populace see how they all sing his praises how
they imitate his peculiarities how they repeat his name in their moments
of leisure and relaxation they even carve images of him to adorn their
hearths that his cause and his sufferings may never be forgotten oh
philanthropic england oh vanguard of civilisation
such are a few of the peculiarities of the london multitude when no riot
no execution no murder no balloon disturbs the even current of their
thoughts these are the whimsies of the massthe harmless follies by
which they unconsciously endeavour to lighten the load of care which
presses upon their existence the wise man even though he smile at them
will not altogether withhold his sympathy and will say let them enjoy
their slang phrases and their choruses if they will and if they cannot be
happy at least let them be merry to the englishman as well as to the
frenchman of whom beranger sings there may be some comfort in so small a
thing as a song and we may own with him that

popular admiration of great thieves
    jack where shall we find such another set of practical
        philosophers who to a man are above the fear of death
    wat sound men and true

    mat shew me a gang of courtiers that could say as much
                          dialogue of thieves in the beggars opera
whether it be that the multitude feeling the pangs of poverty sympathise
with the daring and ingenious depredators who take away the rich mans
superfluity or whether it be the interest that mankind in general feel
for the records of perilous adventure it is certain that the populace of
all countries look with admiration upon great and successful thieves
perhaps both these causes combine to invest their career with charms in
the popular eye almost every country in europe has its traditional thief
whose exploits are recorded with all the graces of poetry and whose
trespasses
                   are cited up in rhymes
    and sung by children in succeeding tunes45

those travellers who have made national manners and characteristics their
peculiar study have often observed and remarked upon this feeling the
learned abb le blanc who resided for some time in england at the
commencement of the eighteenth century says in his amusing letters on
the english and french nations that he continually met with englishmen
who were not less vain in boasting of the success of their highwaymen than
of the bravery of their troops tales of their address their cunning or
their generosity were in the mouths of every body and a noted thief was
a kind of hero in high repute he adds that the mob in all countries
being easily moved look in general with concern upon criminals going to
the gallows but an english mob looked upon such scenes with extraordinary
interest they delighted to see them go through their last trials with
resolution and applauded those who were insensible enough to die as they
had lived braving the justice both of god and men such he might have
added as the noted robber macpherson of whom the old ballad says
   sae rantingly sae wantonly
      sae dauntingly gaed he
    he played a spring and danced it round
      beneath the gallows tree
among these traditional thieves the most noted in england or perhaps in
any country is robin hood a name which popular affection has encircled
with a peculiar halo he robbed the rich to give to the poor and his
reward has been an immortality of fame a tithe of which would be thought
more than sufficient to recompense a benefactor of his species romance
and poetry have been emulous to make him all their own and the forest of
sherwood in which he roamed with his merry men armed with their long
bows and clad in lincoln green has become the resort of pilgrims and a
classic spot sacred to his memory the few virtues he had which would
have ensured him no praise if he had been an honest man have been
blazoned forth by popular renown during seven successive centuries and
will never be forgotten while the english tongue endures his charity to
the poor and his gallantry and respect for women have made him the
preeminent thief of all the world
among english thieves of a later date who has not heard of claude duval
dick turpin jonathan wild and jack sheppard those knights of the road
and of the town whose peculiar chivalry formed at once the dread and the
delight of england during the eighteenth century turpins fame is unknown
to no portion of the male population of england after they have attained
the age of ten his wondrous ride from london to york has endeared him to
the imagination of millions his cruelty in placing an old woman upon a
fire to force her to tell him where she had hidden her money is regarded
as a good joke and his proud bearing upon the scaffold is looked upon as
a virtuous action the abb le blanc writing in 1737 says he was
continually entertained with stories of turpinhow when he robbed
gentlemen he would generously leave them enough to continue their
journey and exact a pledge from them never to inform against him and how
scrupulous such gentlemen were in keeping their word he was one day told
a story with which the relator was in the highest degree delighted
turpin or some other noted robber stopped a man whom he knew to be very
rich with the usual salutationyour money or your life but not
finding more than five or six guineas about him he took the liberty of
entreating him in the most affable manner never to come out so ill
provided adding that if he fell in with him and he had no more than
such a paltry sum he would give him a good licking another story told
by one of turpins admirers was of a robbery he had committed upon a mr
c near cambridge he took from this gentleman his watch his snuffbox
and all his money but two shillings and before he left him required his
word of honour that he would not cause him to be pursued or brought before
a justice the promise being given they both parted very courteously
they afterwards met at newmarket and renewed their acquaintance mr c
kept his word religiously he not only refrained from giving turpin into
custody but made a boast that he had fairly won some of his money back
again in an honest way turpin offered to bet with him on some favourite
horse and mr c accepted the wager with as good a grace as he could have
done from the best gentleman in england turpin lost his bet and paid it
immediately and was so smitten with the generous behaviour of mr c
that he told him how deeply he regretted that the trifling affair which
had happened between them did not permit them to drink together the
narrator of this anecdote was quite proud that england was the birthplace
of such a highwayman46
    46 the abb in the second volume in the letter no 79
         addressed to monsieur de buffon gives the following curious
         particulars of the robbers of 1737 which are not without
         interest at this day if it were only to shew the vast
         improvement which has taken place since that period it is
         usual in travelling to put ten or a dozen guineas in a
         separate pocket as a tribute to the first that comes to
         demand them the right of passport which custom has
         established here in favour of the robbers who are almost the
         only highway surveyors in england has made this necessary
         and accordingly the english call these fellows the gentlemen
         of the road the government letting them exercise their
         jurisdiction upon travellers without giving them any great
         molestation to say the truth they content themselves with
         only taking the money of those who obey without disputing
         but notwithstanding their boasted humanity the lives of
         those who endeavour to get away are not always safe they are
         very strict and severe in levying their impost and if a man
         has not wherewithal to pay them he may run the chance of
         getting himself knocked on the head for his poverty
         about fifteen years ago these robbers with the view of
         maintaining their rights fixed up papers at the doors of
         rich people about london expressly forbidding all persons
         of whatsoever quality or condition from going out of town
         without ten guineas and a watch about them on pain of death
         in bad times when there is little or nothing to be got on
         the roads these fellows assemble in gangs to raise
         contributions even in london itself and the watchmen seldom
         trouble themselves to interfere with them in their
         vocation
not less familiar to the people of england is the career of jack sheppard
as brutal a ruffian as ever disgraced his country but who has claims upon
the popular admiration which are very generally acknowledged he did not
like robin hood plunder the rich to relieve the poor nor rob with an
uncouth sort of courtesy like turpin but he escaped from newgate with
the fetters on his limbs this achievement more than once repeated has
encircled his felon brow with the wreath of immortality and made him
quite a pattern thief among the populace he was no more than twentythree
years of age at the time of his execution and he died much pitied by the
crowd his adventures were the sole topics of conversation for months the
printshops were filled with his effigies and a fine painting of him was
made by sir richard thornhill the following complimentary verses to the
artist appeared in the british journal of november 28th 1724
   thornhill tis thine to gild with fame
    th obscure and raise the humble name
    to make the form elude the grave
    and sheppard from oblivion save
    apelles alexander drew
    csar is to aurelius due
    cromwell in lillys works doth shine
    and sheppard thornhill lives in thine
this was a very equivocal sort of compliment and might have meant that
if apelles were worthy to paint a monarch thornhill was worthy to paint a
thief but the artist did not view it in that light nor did the public
for they considered the verses to be very neat pointed and flattering
so high was jacks fame that he was thought a very fit subject for the
stage and a pantomime entertainment called harlequin jack sheppard
was devised by one thurmond and brought out with considerable success at
drury lane theatre all the scenes were painted from nature including the
publichouse that the robber frequented in clare market and the condemned
cell from which he had made his escape in newgate47
    47 since the publication of the first edition of this volume
         jack sheppards adventures have been revived a novel upon
         the real or fabulous history of the burglar has afforded by
         its extraordinary popularity a further exemplification of
         the allegations in the text the sixth report of the
         inspector of prisons for the northern districts of england
         contains a mass of information upon the pernicious effect of
         such romances and of the dramas founded upon them the
         inspector examined several boys attending the prison school
         in the new bailey at manchester from whose evidence the
         following passages bearing upon the subject are extracted
         j l aged 14 the first time i was ever at the theatre
         was to see jack sheppard there were two or three boys near
         to the house who were going and they asked me i took
         sixpence from the money i used to lay up weekly for clothes
         the next time i went which was the week after i borrowed
         the money from a boy i returned it to him the saturday
         after i then went many times i took the money from my
         mother out of her pocket as she was sitting down and i
         beside her there was more than sixpence in her pocket i got
         a great love for the theatre and stole from people often to
         get there i thought this jack sheppard was a clever fellow
         for making his escape and robbing his master if i could get
         out of gaol i think i should be as clever as him but
         after all his exploits he got done at last i have had the
         book out of a library at dole field i had paid twopence a
         book for three volumes i also got richard turpin in two
         volumes and paid the same i have seen oliver twist and
         think the artful dodger is very like some of the boys here i
         am here for picking a pocket of 25l
         h c aged 15 when we came to manchester i went to the
         play and saw jack sheppard the first night it came out
         there were pictures of him about the streets on boards and on
         the walls one of them was his picking a pocket in the
         church i liked jack sheppard much i had not been in
         prison there i was employed in a warehouse at 6s 6d
         aweek and was allowed 6d out of it for myself and with
         that i went regularly to the play i saw jack sheppard
         afterwards four times in one week i got the money out of my
         moneybag by stealth and without my masters knowledge i
         once borrowed 10s in my mothers name from mrs  a
         shopkeeper with whom she used to deal i went to the play
         with it
         j md aged 15 i have heard of jack sheppard a lad
         whom i know told me of it who had seen it and said it was
         rare fun to see him break out of prison
         j l aged 11 has been to the play twice and seen jack
         sheppard went with his brother the first time and by
         himself the second i took the money to go a second time out
         of mothers house off the chimneypiece where she had left
         a sixpence it was the first night jack sheppard was
         played there was great talk about it and there were nice
         pictures about it all over the walls i thought him a very
         clever fellow but blueskin made the most fun i first went
         to the markets and begun by stealing apples i also knew a
         lad  who has been transported and went with him two or
         three times the most i ever got was 10s out of a till
         the inspectors report on juvenile delinquency at liverpool
         contains much matter of the same kind but sufficient has
         been already quoted to shew the injurious effects of the
         deification of great thieves by thoughtless novelists
the rev mr villette the editor of the annals of newgate published in
1754 relates a curious sermon which he says a friend of his heard
delivered by a streetpreacher about the time of jacks execution the
orator after animadverting on the great care men took of their bodies
and the little care they bestowed upon their souls continued as follows
by way of exemplifying the positionwe have a remarkable instance of
this in a notorious malefactor well known by the name of jack sheppard
what amazing difficulties has he overcome what astonishing things has he
performed and all for the sake of a stinking miserable carcass hardly
worth the hanging how dexterously did he pick the chain of his padlock
with a crooked nail how manfully he burst his fetters asunder climb up
the chimney wrench out an iron bar break his way through a stone wall
make the strong door of a dark entry fly before him till he got upon the
leads of the prison then fixing a blanket to the wall with a spike he
stole out of the chapel how intrepidly did he descend to the top of the
turners house how cautiously pass down the stair and make his escape to
the streetdoor
oh that ye were all like jack sheppard mistake me not my brethreni
dont mean in a carnal but in a spiritual sense for i propose to
spiritualise these things what a shame it would be if we should not think
it worth our while to take as much pains and employ as many deep thoughts
to save our souls as he has done to preserve his body
let me exhort ye then to open the locks of your hearts with the nail of
repentance burst asunder the fetters of your beloved lusts mount the
chimney of hope take from thence the bar of good resolution break
through the stone wall of despair and all the strongholds in the dark
entry of the valley of the shadow of death raise yourselves to the leads
of divine meditation fix the blanket of faith with the spike of the
church let yourselves down to the turners house of resignation and
descend the stairs of humility so shall you come to the door of
deliverance from the prison of iniquity and escape the clutches of that
old executioner the devil
jonathan wild whose name has been immortalised by fielding was no
favourite with the people he had none of the virtues which combined with
crimes make up the character of the great thief he was a pitiful fellow
who informed against his comrades and was afraid of death this meanness
was not to be forgiven by the crowd and they pelted him with dirt and
stones on his way to tyburn and expressed their contempt by every
possible means how different was their conduct to turpin and jack
sheppard who died in their neatest attire with nosegays in their
buttonholes and with the courage that a crowd expects it was
anticipated that the body of turpin would have been delivered up to the
surgeons for dissection and the people seeing some men very busily
employed in removing it suddenly set upon them rescued the body bore it
about the town in triumph and then buried it in a very deep grave filled
with quicklime to hasten the progress of decomposition they would not
suffer the corpse of their heroof the man who had ridden from london to
york in fourandtwenty hoursto be mangled by the rude hands of
unmannerly surgeons
the death of claude duval would appear to have been no less triumphant
claude was a gentlemanly thief according to butler in the famous ode to
his memory he
   taught the wild arabs of the road
    to rob in a more gentle mode
    take prizes more obligingly than those
    who never had been bred filous
    and how to hang in a more graceful fashion
    than eer was known before to the dull english nation
in fact he was the pink of politeness and his gallantry to the fair sex
was proverbial when he was caught at last pent in stone walls and
chains and iron grates their grief was in proportion to his rare merits
and his great fame butler says that to his dungeon
              came ladies from all parts
    to offer up close prisoners their hearts
    which he received as tribute due
                           
    never did bold knight to relieve
    distressed dames such dreadful feats achieve
    as feeble damsels for his sake
    would have been proud to undertake
    and bravely ambitious to redeem
    the worlds loss and their own
    strove who should have the honour to lay down
    and change a life with him
among the noted thieves of france there is none to compare with the
famous aimerigot ttenoire who flourished in the reign of charles vi
this fellow was at the head of four or five hundred men and possessed two
very strong castles in limousin and auvergne there was a good deal of the
feudal baron about him although he possessed no revenues but such as the
road afforded him at his death he left a singular will i give and
bequeath said the robber one thousand five hundred francs to st
georges chapel for such repairs as it may need to my sweet girl who so
loyally loved me i give two thousand five hundred and the surplus i give
to my companions i hope they will all live as brothers and divide it
amicably among them if they cannot agree and the devil of contention
gets among them it is no fault of mine and i advise them to get a good
strong sharp axe and break open my strong box let them scramble for what
it contains and the devil seize the hindmost the people of auvergne
still recount with admiration the daring feats of this brigand
of later years the french thieves have been such unmitigated scoundrels
as to have left but little room for popular admiration the famous
cartouche whose name has become synonymous with ruffian in their
language had none of the generosity courtesy and devoted bravery which
are so requisite to make a robberhero he was born at paris towards the
end of the seventeenth century and broken alive on the wheel in november
1727 he was however sufficiently popular to have been pitied at his
death and afterwards to have formed the subject of a muchadmired drama
which bore his name and was played with great success in all the theatres
of france during the years 1734 5 and 6 in our own day the french have
been more fortunate in a robber vidocq bids fair to rival the fame of
turpin and jack sheppard already he has become the hero of many an
apocryphal talealready his compatriots boast of his manifold
achievements and express their doubts whether any other country in europe
could produce a thief so clever so accomplished so gentlemanly as
vidocq
germany has its schinderhannes hungary its schubry and italy and spain a
whole host of brigands whose names and exploits are familiar as household
words in the mouths of the children and populace of those countries
the italian banditti are renowned over the world and many of them are not
only very religious after a fashion but very charitable charity from
such a source is so unexpected that the people doat upon them for it one
of them when he fell into the hands of the police exclaimed as they led
him away ho fatto pi cariti have given away more in charity than
any three convents in these provinces and the fellow spoke truth
in lombardy the people cherish the memory of two notorious robbers who
flourished about two centuries ago under the spanish government their
story according to macfarlane is contained in a little book well known
to all the children of the province and read by them with much more gusto
than their bibles
schinderhannes the robber of the rhine is a great favourite on the banks
of the river which he so long kept in awe many amusing stories are
related by the peasantry48 of the scurvy tricks he played off upon rich
jews or toopresuming officers of justiceof his princely generosity
and undaunted courage in short they are proud of him and would no more
consent to have the memory of his achievements dissociated from their
river than they would have the rock of ehrenbreitstein blown to atoms by
gunpowder
    48 for a full account of this noted robber and indeed of
         european thieves and banditti in general see the very
         amusing work upon the subject by mr charles macfarlane
there is another robberhero of whose character and exploits the people
of germany speak admiringly mausch nadel was captain of a considerable
band that infested the rhine switzerland alsatia and lorraine during
the years 1824 5 and 6 like jack sheppard he endeared himself to the
populace by his most hazardous escape from prison being confined at
bremen in a dungeon on the third story of the prison of that town he
contrived to let himself down without exciting the vigilance of the
sentinels and to swim across the weser though heavily laden with irons
when about halfway over he was espied by a sentinel who fired at him
and shot him in the calf of the leg but the undaunted robber struck out
manfully reached the shore and was out of sight before the officers of
justice could get ready their boats to follow him he was captured again
in 1826 tried at mayence and sentenced to death he was a tall strong
handsome man and his fate villain as he was excited much sympathy all
over germany the ladies especially were loud in their regret that nothing
could be done to save a hero so goodlooking and of adventures so
romantic from the knife of the headsman
mr charles macfarlane in speaking of italian banditti remarks that the
abuses of the catholic religion with its confessions and absolutions
have tended to promote crime of this description but he adds more truly
that priests and monks have not done half the mischief which has been
perpetrated by balladmongers and storytellers if he had said
playwrights also the list would have been complete in fact the theatre
which can only expect to prosper in a pecuniary sense by pandering to
the tastes of the people continually recurs to the annals of thieves and
banditti for its most favourite heroes these theatrical robbers with
their picturesque attire wild haunts jolly reckless devilmaycare
manners take a wonderful hold upon the imagination and whatever their
advocates may say to the contrary exercise a very pernicious influence
upon public morals in the memoirs of the duke of guise upon the
revolution of naples in 1647 and 1648 it is stated that the manners
dress and mode of life of the neapolitan banditti were rendered so
captivating upon the stage that the authorities found it absolutely
necessary to forbid the representation of dramas in which they figured
and even to prohibit their costume at the masquerades so numerous were
the banditti at this time that the duke found no difficulty in raising an
army of them to aid him in his endeavours to seize on the throne of
naples he thus describes them49 they were three thousand five hundred
men of whom the oldest came short of fiveandforty years and the
youngest was above twenty they were all tall and well made with long
black hair for the most part curled coats of black spanish leather with
sleeves of velvet or cloth of gold cloth breeches with gold lace most
of them scarlet girdles of velvet laced with gold with two pistols on
each side a cutlass hanging at a belt suitably trimmed three fingers
broad and two feet long a hawkingbag at their girdle and a powderflask
hung about their neck with a great silk riband some of them carried
firelocks and others blunderbusses they had all good shoes with silk
stockings and every one a cap of cloth of gold or cloth of silver of
different colours on his head which was very delightful to the eye

the beggars opera in our own country is another instance of the
admiration that thieves excite upon the stage of the extraordinary
success of this piece when first produced the following account is given
in the notes to the dunciad and quoted by johnson in his lives of the
poets this piece was received with greater applause than was ever
known besides being acted in london sixtythree days without
interruption and renewed the next season with equal applause it spread
into all the great towns of england was played in many places to the
thirtieth and fortieth time at bath and bristol c fifty it made its
progress into wales scotland and ireland where it was performed
twentyfour days successively the ladies carried about with them the
favourite songs of it in fans and houses were furnished with it in
screens the fame of it was not confined to the author only the person
who acted polly till then obscure became all at once the favourite of
the town50 her pictures were engraved and sold in great numbers her
life written books of letters and verses to her published and pamphlets
made even of her sayings and jests furthermore it drove out of england
for that season the italian opera which had carried all before it for
ten years dr johnson in his life of the author says that herring
afterwards archbishop of canterbury censured the opera as giving
encouragement not only to vice but to crimes by making the highwayman
the hero and dismissing him at last unpunished and adds that it was
even said that after the exhibition the gangs of robbers were evidently
multiplied the doctor doubts the assertion giving as his reason that
highwaymen and housebreakers seldom frequent the playhouse and that it
was not possible for any one to imagine that he might rob with safety
because he saw macheath reprieved upon the stage but if johnson had
wished to be convinced he might very easily have discovered that
highwaymen and housebreakers did frequent the theatre and that nothing
was more probable than that a laughable representation of successful
villany should induce the young and the already vicious to imitate it
besides there is the weighty authority of sir john fielding the chief
magistrate of bow street who asserted positively and proved his
assertion by the records of his office that the number of thieves was
greatly increased at the time when that opera was so popular

we have another instance of the same result much nearer our own times
schillers ruber that wonderful play written by a green youth
perverted the taste and imagination of all the young men in germany an
accomplished critic of our own country hazlitt speaking of this play
says it was the first he ever read and such was the effect it produced on
him that it stunned him like a blow after the lapse of
fiveandtwenty years he could not forget it it was still to use his
own words an old dweller in the chambers of his brain and he had not
even then recovered enough from it to describe how it was the
highminded metaphysical thief its hero was so warmly admired that
several raw students longing to imitate a character they thought so
noble actually abandoned their homes and their colleges and betook
themselves to the forests and the wilds to levy contributions upon
travellers they thought they would like moor plunder the rich and
deliver eloquent soliloquies to the setting sun or the rising moon
relieve the poor when they met them and drink flasks of rhenish with
their free companions in rugged mountain passes or in tents in the
thicknesses of the forests but a little experience wonderfully cooled
their courage they found that real everyday robbers were very unlike the
conventional banditti of the stage and that three months in prison with
bread and water for their fare and damp straw to lie upon was very well
to read about by their own firesides but not very agreeable to undergo in
their own proper persons
lord byron with his soliloquising highsouled thieves has in a slight
degree perverted the taste of the juvenile rhymers of his country as
yet however they have shewn more good sense than their fellows of
germany and have not taken to the woods or the highways much as they
admire conrad the corsair they will not go to sea and hoist the black
flag for him by words only and not by deeds they testify their
admiration and deluge the periodicals and musicshops of the land with
verses describing pirates and bandits brides and robber adventures of
every kind
but it is the playwright who does most harm and byron has fewer sins of
this nature to answer for than gay or schiller with the aid of scenery
fine dresses and music and the very false notions they convey they
vitiate the public taste not knowing

in the penny theatres that abound in the poor and populous districts of
london and which are chiefly frequented by striplings of idle and
dissolute habits tales of thieves and murderers are more admired and
draw more crowded audiences than any other species of representation
there the footpad the burglar and the highwayman are portrayed in their
natural colours and give pleasant lessons in crime to their delighted
listeners there the deepest tragedy and the broadest farce are
represented in the career of the murderer and the thief and are applauded
in proportion to their depth and their breadth there whenever a crime of
unusual atrocity is committed it is brought out afresh with all its
disgusting incidents copied from the life for the amusement of those who
will one day become its imitators
with the mere reader the case is widely different and most people have a
partiality for knowing the adventures of noted rogues even in fiction
they are delightful witness the eventful story of gil blas de santillane
and of that great rascal don guzman dalfarache here there is no fear of
imitation poets too without doing mischief may sing of such heroes
when they please wakening our sympathies for the sad fate of jemmy
dawson or gilderoy or macpherson the dauntless or celebrating in
undying verse the wrongs and the revenge of the great thief of scotland
rob roy if by the music of their sweet rhymes they can convince the
world that such heroes are but mistaken philosophers born a few ages too
late and having both a theoretical and practical love for
     the good old rule the simple plan
    that they should take who have the power
      that they should keep who can
the world may perhaps become wiser and consent to some better
distribution of its good things by means of which thieves may become
reconciled to the age and the age to them the probability however
seems to be that the charmers will charm in vain charm they ever so
wisely
illustration fight between du guesclin and troussel
duels and ordeals
    there was an ancient sage philosopher
    who swore the world as he could prove
    was mad of fightinghudibras
most writers in accounting for the origin of duelling derive it from the
warlike habits of those barbarous nations who overran europe in the early
centuries of the christian era and who knew no mode so effectual for
settling their differences as the point of the sword in fact duelling
taken in its primitive and broadest sense means nothing more than
combating and is the universal resort of all wild animals including man
to gain or defend their possessions or avenge their insults two dogs who
tear each other for a bone or two bantams fighting on a dunghill for the
love of some beautiful hen or two fools on wimbledon common shooting at
each other to satisfy the laws of offended honour stand on the same
footing in this respect and are each and all mere duellists as
civilisation advanced the bestinformed men naturally grew ashamed of
such a mode of adjusting disputes and the promulgation of some sort of
laws for obtaining redress for injuries was the consequence still there
were many cases in which the allegations of an accuser could not be
rebutted by any positive proof on the part of the accused and in all
these which must have been exceedingly numerous in the early stages of
european society the combat was resorted to from its decision there was
no appeal god was supposed to nerve the arm of the combatant whose cause
was just and to grant him the victory over his opponent as montesquieu
well remarks51 this belief was not unnatural among a people just
emerging from barbarism their manners being wholly warlike the man
deficient in courage the prime virtue of his fellows was not
unreasonably suspected of other vices besides cowardice which is
generally found to be coexistent with treachery he therefore who
shewed himself most valiant in the encounter was absolved by public
opinion from any crime with which he might be charged as a necessary
consequence society would have been reduced to its original elements if
the men of thought as distinguished from the men of action had not
devised some means for taming the unruly passions of their fellows with
this view governments commenced by restricting within the narrowest
possible limits the cases in which it was lawful to prove or deny guilt by
the single combat by the law of gondebaldus king of the burgundians
passed in the year 501 the proof by combat was allowed in all legal
proceedings in lieu of swearing in the time of charlemagne the
burgundian practice had spread over the empire of the francs and not only
the suitors for justice but the witnesses and even the judges were
obliged to defend their cause their evidence or their decision at the
point of the sword louis the debonnaire his successor endeavoured to
remedy the growing evil by permitting the duel only in appeals of felony
in civil cases or issue joined in a writ of right and in cases of the
court of chivalry or attacks upon a mans knighthood none were exempt
from these trials but women the sick and the maimed and persons under
fifteen or above sixty years of age ecclesiastics were allowed to produce
champions in their stead this practice in the course of time extended to
all trials of civil and criminal cases which had to be decided by battle
    51 esprit des loix liv xxviii chap xvii
the clergy whose dominion was an intellectual one never approved of a
system of jurisprudence which tended so much to bring all things under the
rule of the strongest arm from the first they set their faces against
duelling and endeavoured as far as the prejudices of their age would
allow them to curb the warlike spirit so alien from the principles of
religion in the council of valentia and afterwards in the council of
trent they excommunicated all persons engaged in duelling and not only
them but even the assistants and spectators declaring the custom to be
hellish and detestable and introduced by the devil for the destruction
both of body and soul they added also that princes who connived at duels
should be deprived of all temporal power jurisdiction and dominion over
the places where they had permitted them to be fought it will be seen
hereafter that this clause only encouraged the practice which it was
intended to prevent
but it was the blasphemous error of these early ages to expect that the
almighty whenever he was called upon would work a miracle in favour of a
person unjustly accused the priesthood in condemning the duel did not
condemn the principle on which it was founded they still encouraged the
popular belief of divine interference in all the disputes or differences
that might arise among nations or individuals it was the very same
principle that regulated the ordeals which with all their influence they
supported against the duel by the former the power of deciding the guilt
or innocence was vested wholly in their hands while by the latter they
enjoyed no power or privilege at all it is not to be wondered at that
for this reason if for no other they should have endeavoured to settle
all differences by the peaceful mode while that prevailed they were as
they wished to be the first party in the state but while the strong arm
of individual prowess was allowed to be the judge in all doubtful cases
their power and influence became secondary to those of the nobility
thus it was not the mere hatred of bloodshed which induced them to launch
the thunderbolts of excommunication against the combatants it was a
desire to retain the power which to do them justice they were in those
times the persons best qualified to wield the germs of knowledge and
civilisation lay within the bounds of their order for they were the
representatives of the intellectual as the nobility were of the physical
power of man to centralise this power in the church and make it the
judge of the last resort in all appeals both in civil and criminal cases
they instituted five modes of trial the management of which lay wholly in
their hands these were the oath upon the evangelists the ordeal of the
cross and the fire ordeal for persons in the higher ranks the water
ordeal for the humbler classes and lastly the corsned or bread and
cheese ordeal for members of their own body
the oath upon the evangelists was taken in the following manner the
accused who was received to this proof says paul hay count du chastelet
in his memoirs of bertrand du guesclin swore upon a copy of the new
testament and on the relics of the holy martyrs or on their tombs that
he was innocent of the crime imputed to him he was also obliged to find
twelve persons of acknowledged probity who should take oath at the same
time that they believed him innocent this mode of trial led to very great
abuses especially in cases of disputed inheritance where the hardest
swearer was certain of the victory this abuse was one of the principal
causes which led to the preference given to the trial by battle it is not
at all surprising that a feudal baron or captain of the early ages
should have preferred the chances of a fair fight with his opponent to a
mode by which firm perjury would always be successful
the trial by or judgment of the cross which charlemagne begged his sons
to have recourse to in case of disputes arising between them was
performed thuswhen a person accused of any crime had declared his
innocence upon oath and appealed to the cross for its judgment in his
favour he was brought into the church before the altar the priests
previously prepared two sticks exactly like one another upon one of which
was carved a figure of the cross they were both wrapped up with great
care and many ceremonies in a quantity of fine wool and laid upon the
altar or on the relics of the saints a solemn prayer was then offered up
to god that he would be pleased to discover by the judgment of his holy
cross whether the accused person were innocent or guilty a priest then
approached the altar and took up one of the sticks and the assistants
unswathed it reverently if it was marked with the cross the accused
person was innocent if unmarked he was guilty it would be unjust to
assert that the judgments thus delivered were in all cases erroneous
and it would be absurd to believe that they were left altogether to
chance many true judgments were doubtless given and in all probability
most conscientiously for we cannot but believe that the priests
endeavoured beforehand to convince themselves by secret inquiry and a
strict examination of the circumstances whether the appellant were
innocent or guilty and that they took up the crossed or uncrossed stick
accordingly although to all other observers the sticks as enfolded in
the wool might appear exactly similar those who enwrapped them could
without any difficulty distinguish the one from the other
by the fireordeal the power of deciding was just as unequivocally left in
their hands it was generally believed that fire would not burn the
innocent and the clergy of course took care that the innocent or such
as it was their pleasure or interest to declare so should be so warned
before undergoing the ordeal as to preserve themselves without any
difficulty from the fire one mode of ordeal was to place redhot
ploughshares on the ground at certain distances and then blindfolding
the accused person make him walk barefooted over them if he stepped
regularly in the vacant spaces avoiding the fire he was adjudged
innocent if he burned himself he was declared guilty as none but the
clergy interfered with the arrangement of the ploughshares they could
always calculate beforehand the result of the ordeal to find a person
guilty they had only to place them at irregular distances and the
accused was sure to tread upon one of them when emma the wife of king
ethelred and mother of edward the confessor was accused of a guilty
familiarity with alwyn bishop of winchester she cleared her character in
this manner the reputation not only of their order but of a queen
being at stake a verdict of guilty was not to be apprehended from any
ploughshares which priests had the heating of this ordeal was called the
judicium dei and sometimes the vulgaris purgatio and might also be
tried by several other methods one was to hold in the hand unhurt a
piece of redhot iron of the weight of one two or three pounds when we
read not only that men with hard hands but women of softer and more
delicate skin could do this with impunity we must be convinced that the
hands were previously rubbed with some preservative or that the
apparently hot iron was merely cold iron painted red another mode was to
plunge the naked arm into a caldron of boiling water the priests then
enveloped it in several folds of linen and flannel and kept the patient
confined within the church and under their exclusive care for three
days if at the end of that time the arm appeared without a scar the
innocence of the accused person was firmly established52
    52 very similar to this is the fireordeal of the modern
         hindoos which is thus described in forbess oriental
         memoirs vol i c xiwhen a man accused of a capital
         crime chooses to undergo the ordeal trial he is closely
         confined for several days his right hand and arm are covered
         with thick waxcloth tied up and sealed in the presence of
         proper officers to prevent deceit in the english districts
         the covering was always sealed with the companys arms and
         the prisoner placed under an european guard at the time
         fixed for the ordeal a caldron of oil is placed over a fire
         when it boils a piece of money is dropped into the vessel
         the prisoners arm is unsealed and washed in the presence of
         his judges and accusers during this part of the ceremony the
         attendant brahmins supplicate the deity on receiving their
         benediction the accused plunges his hand into the boiling
         fluid and takes out the coin the arm is afterwards again
         sealed up until the time appointed for a reexamination the
         seal is then broken if no blemish appears the prisoner is
         declared innocent if the contrary he suffers the punishment
         due to his crime on this trial the accused thus
         addresses the element before plunging his hand into the
         boiling oilthou o fire pervadest all things o cause of
         purity who givest evidence of virtue and of sin declare the
         truth in this my hand if no juggling were practised the
         decisions by this ordeal would be all the same way but as
         some are by this means declared guilty and others innocent
         it is clear that the brahmins like the christian priests of
         the middle ages practise some deception in saving those whom
         they wish to be thought guiltless
as regards the waterordeal the same trouble was not taken it was a
trial only for the poor and humble and whether they sank or swam was
thought of very little consequence like the witches of more modern times
the accused were thrown into a pond or river if they sank and were
drowned their surviving friends had the consolation of knowing that they
were innocent if they swam they were guilty in either case society was
rid of them
but of all the ordeals that which the clergy reserved for themselves was
the one least likely to cause any member of their corps to be declared
guilty the most culpable monster in existence came off clear when tried
by this method it was called the corsned and was thus performed a
piece of barley bread and a piece of cheese were laid upon the altar and
the accused priest in his full canonicals and surrounded by all the
pompous adjuncts of roman ceremony pronounced certain conjurations and
prayed with great fervency for several minutes the burden of the prayer
was that if he were guilty of the crime laid to his charge god would
send his angel gabriel to stop his throat that he might not be able to
swallow the bread and cheese there is no instance upon record of a priest
having been choked in this manner53
    53 an ordeal very like this is still practised in india
         consecrated rice is the article chosen instead of bread and
         cheese instances are not rare in which through the force of
         imagination guilty persons are not able to swallow a single
         grain conscious of their crime and fearful of the
         punishment of heaven they feel a suffocating sensation in
         their throat when they attempt it and they fall on their
         knees and confess all that is laid to their charge the same
         thing no doubt would have happened with the bread and
         cheese of the roman church if it had been applied to any
         others but ecclesiastics the latter had too much wisdom to
         be caught in a trap of their own setting
when under pope gregory vii it was debated whether the gregorian chant
should be introduced into castile instead of the musarabic given by st
isidore of seville to the churches of that kingdom very much ill feeling
was excited the churches refused to receive the novelty and it was
proposed that the affair should be decided by a battle between two
champions one chosen from each side the clergy would not consent to a
mode of settlement which they considered impious but had no objection to
try the merits of each chant by the fireordeal a great fire was
accordingly made and a book of the gregorian and one of the musarabic
chant were thrown into it that the flames might decide which was most
agreeable to god by refusing to burn it cardinal baronius who says he
was an eyewitness of the miracle relates that the book of the gregorian
chant was no sooner laid upon the fire than it leaped out uninjured
visibly and with a great noise every one present thought that the saints
had decided in favour of pope gregory after a slight interval the fire
was extinguished but wonderful to relate the other book of st isidore
was found covered with ashes but not injured in the slightest degree the
flames had not even warmed it upon this it was resolved that both were
alike agreeable to god and that they should be used by turns in all the
churches of seville54

         chastelet liv i ch xix
if the ordeals had been confined to questions like this the laity would
have had little or no objection to them but when they were introduced as
decisive in all the disputes that might arise between man and man the
opposition of all those whose prime virtue was personal bravery was
necessarily excited in fact the nobility from a very early period
began to look with jealous eyes upon them they were not slow to perceive
their true purport which was no other than to make the church the last
court of appeal in all cases both civil and criminal and not only did
the nobility prefer the ancient mode of single combat from this cause in
itself a sufficient one but they clung to it because an acquittal gained
by those displays of courage and address which the battle afforded was
more creditable in the eyes of their compeers than one which it required
but little or none of either to accomplish to these causes may be added
another which was perhaps more potent than either in raising the credit
of the judicial combat at the expense of the ordeal the noble institution
of chivalry was beginning to take root and notwithstanding the clamours
of the clergy war was made the sole business of life and the only
elegant pursuit of the aristocracy the fine spirit of honour was
introduced any attack upon which was only to be avenged in the lists
within sight of applauding crowds whose verdict of approbation was far
more gratifying than the cold and formal acquittal of the ordeal
lothaire the son of louis i abolished that by fire and the trial of the
cross within his dominions but in england they were allowed so late as
the time of henry iii in the early part of whose reign they were
prohibited by an order of council in the mean time the crusades had
brought the institution of chivalry to the full height of perfection the
chivalric spirit soon achieved the downfall of the ordeal system and
established the judicial combat on a basis too firm to be shaken it is
true that with the fall of chivalry as an institution fell the
tournament and the encounter in the lists but the duel their offspring
has survived to this day defying the efforts of sages and philosophers to
eradicate it among all the errors bequeathed to us by a barbarous age it
has proved the most pertinacious it has put variance between mens reason
and their honour put the man of sense on a level with the fool and made
thousands who condemn it submit to it or practise it
those who are curious to see the manner in which these combats were
regulated may consult the learned montesquieu where they will find a
copious summary of the code of ancient duelling55 truly does he remark
in speaking of the clearness and excellence of the arrangements that as
there were many wise matters which were conducted in a very foolish
manner so there were many foolish matters conducted very wisely no
greater exemplification of it could be given than the wise and religious
rules of the absurd and blasphemous trial by battle
    55 esprit des loix liv xxviii ch xxv
in the ages that intervened between the crusades and the new era that was
opened out by the invention of gunpowder and printing a more rational
system of legislation took root the inhabitants of cities engaged in the
pursuits of trade and industry were content to acquiesce in the decisions
of their judges and magistrates whenever any differences arose among them
unlike the class above them their habits and manners did not lead them to
seek the battlefield on every slight occasion a dispute as to the price
of a sack of corn a bale of broadcloth or a cow could be more
satisfactorily adjusted before the mayor or bailiff of their district
even the martial knights and nobles quarrelsome as they were began to
see that the trial by battle would lose its dignity and splendour if too
frequently resorted to governments also shared this opinion and on
several occasions restricted the cases in which it was legal to proceed to
this extremity in france before the time of louis ix duels were
permitted only in cases of lse majest rape incendiarism
assassination and burglary louis ix by taking off all restriction
made them legal in civil cases this was not found to work well and in
1303 philip the fair judged it necessary to confine them in criminal
matters to state offences rape and incendiarism and in civil cases to
questions of disputed inheritance knighthood was allowed to be the best
judge of its own honour and might defend or avenge it as often as
occasion arose
among the earliest duels upon record is a very singular one that took
place in the reign of louis ii a d 878 ingelgerius count of
gastinois was one morning discovered by his countess dead in bed at her
side gontran a relation of the count accused the countess of having
murdered her husband to whom he asserted she had long been unfaithful
and challenged her to produce a champion to do battle in her behalf that
he might establish her guilt by killing him56 all the friends and
relatives of the countess believed in her innocence but gontran was so
stout and bold and renowned a warrior that no one dared to meet him for
which as brantme quaintly says mauvais et poltrons parens estaient
the unhappy countess began to despair when a champion suddenly appeared
in the person of ingelgerius count of anjou a boy of sixteen years of
age who had been held by the countess on the baptismal font and received
her husbands name he tenderly loved his godmother and offered to do
battle in her cause against any and every opponent the king endeavoured
to persuade the generous boy from his enterprise urging the great
strength tried skill and invincible courage of the challenger but he
persisted in his resolution to the great sorrow of all the court who
said it was a cruel thing to permit so brave and beautiful a child to rush
to such butchery and death
    56 mmoires de brantme touchant les duels
illustration duel between ingelgerius and gontran
when the lists were prepared the countess duly acknowledged her champion
and the combatants commenced the onset gontran rode so fiercely at his
antagonist and hit him on the shield with such impetuosity that he lost
his own balance and rolled to the ground the young count as gontran
fell passed his lance through his body and then dismounting cut off his
head which brantme says he presented to the king who received it
most graciously and was very joyful as much so as if any one had made
him a present of a city the innocence of the countess was then
proclaimed with great rejoicings and she kissed her godson and wept over
his neck with joy in the presence of all the assembly
when the earl of essex was accused by robert de montfort before king
henry ii in 1162 of having traitorously suffered the royal standard of
england to fall from his hands in a skirmish with the welsh at coleshill
five years previously the latter offered to prove the truth of the charge
by single combat the earl of essex accepted the challenge and the lists
were prepared near reading an immense concourse of persons assembled to
witness the battle essex at first fought stoutly but losing his temper
and selfcommand he gave an advantage to his opponent which soon decided
the struggle he was unhorsed and so severely wounded that all present
thought he was dead at the solicitation of his relatives the monks of
the abbey of reading were allowed to remove the body for interment and
montfort was declared the victor essex however was not dead but
stunned only and under the care of the monks recovered in a few weeks
from his bodily injuries the wounds of his mind were not so easily
healed though a loyal and brave subject the whole realm believed him a
traitor and a coward because he had been vanquished he could not brook to
return to the world deprived of the good opinion of his fellows he
therefore made himself a monk and passed the remainder of his days within
the walls of the abbey
du chastelet relates a singular duel that was proposed in spain57 a
christian gentleman of seville sent a challenge to a moorish cavalier
offering to prove against him with whatever weapons he might choose that
the religion of jesus christ was holy and divine and that of mahomet
impious and damnable the spanish prelates did not choose that
christianity should be compromised within their jurisdiction by the result
of any such combat the moorish cavalier might perchance have proved to
be the stronger and they commanded the knight under pain of
excommunication to withdraw the challenge
    57 histoire de messire bertrand du guesclin liv i ch xix
the same author relates that under otho i a question arose among
jurisconsults viz whether grandchildren who had lost their father
should share equally with their uncles in the property of their
grandfather at the death of the latter the difficulty of this question
was found so insurmountable that none of the lawyers of that day could
resolve it it was at last decreed that it should be decided by single
combat two champions were accordingly chosen one for and the other
against the claims of the little ones after a long struggle the
champion of the uncles was unhorsed and slain and it was therefore
decided that the right of the grandchildren was established and that they
should enjoy the same portion of their grandfathers possessions that
their father would have done had he been alive
upon pretexts just as strange and often more frivolous that these duels
continued to be fought in most of the countries of europe during the whole
of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries a memorable instance of the
slightness of the pretext on which a man could be forced to fight a duel
to the death occurs in the memoirs of the brave constable du guesclin
the advantage he had obtained in a skirmish before rennes against
william brembre an english captain so preyed on the spirits of william
troussel the chosen friend and companion of the latter that nothing
would satisfy him but a mortal combat with the constable the duke of
lancaster to whom troussel applied for permission to fight the great
frenchman forbade the battle as not warranted by the circumstances
troussel nevertheless burned with a fierce desire to cross his weapon with
du guesclin and sought every occasion to pick a quarrel with him having
so good a will for it of course he found a way a relative of his had
been taken prisoner by the constable in whose hands he remained till he
was able to pay his ransom troussel resolved to make a quarrel out of
this and despatched a messenger to du guesclin demanding the release of
his prisoner and offering a bond at a distant date for the payment of
the ransom du guesclin who had received intimation of the hostile
purposes of the englishman sent back word that he would not accept his
bond neither would he release his prisoner until the full amount of his
ransom was paid as soon as this answer was received troussel sent a
challenge to the constable demanding reparation for the injury he had
done his honour by refusing his bond and offering a mortal combat to be
fought three strokes with the lance three with the sword and three with
the dagger du guesclin although ill in bed with the ague accepted the
challenge and gave notice to the marshal dandreghem the kings
lieutenantgeneral in lower normandy that he might fix the day and the
place of combat the marshal made all necessary arrangements upon
condition that he who was beaten should pay a hundred florins of gold to
feast the nobles and gentlemen who were witnesses of the encounter
the duke of lancaster was very angry with his captain and told him that
it would be a shame to his knighthood and his nation if he forced on a
combat with the brave du guesclin at a time when he was enfeebled by
disease and stretched on the couch of suffering upon these
representations troussel ashamed of himself sent notice to du guesclin
that he was willing to postpone the duel until such time as he should be
perfectly recovered du guesclin replied that he could not think of
postponing the combat after all the nobility had received notice of it
that he had sufficient strength left not only to meet but to conquer such
an opponent as he was and that if he did not make his appearance in the
lists at the time appointed he would publish him every where as a man
unworthy to be called a knight or to wear an honourable sword by his
side troussel carried this haughty message to the duke of lancaster who
immediately gave permission for the battle
on the day appointed the two combatants appeared in the lists in the
presence of several thousand spectators du guesclin was attended by the
flower of the french nobility including the marshal de beaumanoir
olivier de mauny bertrand de saint pern and the viscount de la bellire
while the englishman appeared with no more than the customary retinue of
two seconds two squires two coutilliers or daggermen and two
trumpeters the first onset was unfavourable to the constable he received
so heavy a blow on his shieldarm that he fell forward to the left upon
his horses neck and being weakened by his fever was nearly thrown to
the ground all his friends thought he could never recover himself and
began to deplore his ill fortune but du guesclin collected his energies
for a decisive effort and at the second charge aimed a blow at the
shoulder of his enemy which felled him to the earth mortally wounded he
then sprang from his horse sword in hand with the intention of cutting
off the head of his fallen foe when the marshal dandreghem threw a
golden wand into the arena as a signal that hostilities should cease du
guesclin was proclaimed the victor amid the joyous acclamations of the
crowd and retiring left the field to the meaner combatants who were
afterwards to make sport for the people four english and as many french
squires fought for some time with pointless lances when the french
gaining the advantage the sports were declared at an end
in the time of charles vi about the beginning of the fifteenth century
a famous duel was ordered by the parliament of paris the sieur de
carrouges being absent in the holy land his lady was violated by the
sieur legris carrouges on his return challenged legris to mortal combat
for the twofold crime of violation and slander inasmuch as he had denied
his guilt by asserting that the lady was a willing party the ladys
asseverations of innocence were held to be no evidence by the parliament
and the duel was commanded with all the ceremonies on the day
appointed says brantme58 the lady came to witness the spectacle in
her chariot but the king made her descend judging her unworthy because
she was criminal in his eyes till her innocence was proved and caused her
to stand upon a scaffold to await the mercy of god and this judgment by
the battle after a short struggle the sieur de carrouges overthrew his
enemy and made him confess both the rape and the slander he was then
taken to the gallows and hanged in the presence of the multitude while
the innocence of the lady was proclaimed by the heralds and recognised by
her husband the king and all the spectators
    58 mmoires de brantme touchant les duels
numerous battles of a similar description constantly took place until the
unfortunate issue of one encounter of the kind led the french king henry
ii to declare solemnly that he would never again permit any such
encounter whether it related to a civil or criminal case or the honour
of a gentleman
this memorable combat was fought in the year 1547 franois de vivonne
lord of la chataigneraie and guy de chabot lord of jarnac had been
friends from their early youth and were noted at the court of francis i
for the gallantry of their bearing and the magnificence of their retinue
chataigneraie who knew that his friends means were not very ample asked
him one day in confidence how it was that he contrived to be so well
provided jarnac replied that his father had married a young and
beautiful woman who loving the son far better than the sire supplied
him with as much money as he desired la chataigneraie betrayed the base
secret to the dauphin the dauphin to the king the king to his courtiers
and the courtiers to all their acquaintance in a short time it reached
the ears of the old lord de jarnac who immediately sent for his son and
demanded to know in what manner the report had originated and whether he
had been vile enough not only to carry on such a connexion but to boast
of it de jarnac indignantly denied that he had ever said so or given
reason to the world to say so and requested his father to accompany him
to court and confront him with his accuser that he might see the manner
in which he would confound him they went accordingly and the younger de
jarnac entering a room where the dauphin la chataigneraie and several
courtiers were present exclaimed aloud that whoever had asserted that
he maintained a criminal connexion with his motherinlaw was a liar and a
coward every eye was turned to the dauphin and la chataigneraie when
the latter stood forward and asserted that de jarnac had himself avowed
that such was the fact and he would extort from his lips another
confession of it a case like this could not be met or rebutted by any
legal proof and the royal council ordered that it should be decided by
single combat the king however set his face against the duel59 and
forbade them both under pain of his high displeasure to proceed any
further in the matter but francis died in the following year and the
dauphin now henry ii who was himself compromised resolved that the
combat should take place
    59 although francis shewed himself in this case an enemy to
         duelling yet in his own case he had not the same objection
         every reader of history must remember his answer to the
         challenge of the emperor charles v the emperor wrote that he
         had failed in his word and that he would sustain their
         quarrel singlehanded against him francis replied that he
         liedquil en avait menti par la gorge and that he was
         ready to meet him in single combat whenever and wherever he
         pleased
the lists were prepared in the courtyard of the chateau of st
germainenlaye and the 10th of july 1547 was appointed for the
encounter the cartels of the combatants which are preserved in the
mmoires de castelnau were as follow
           cartel of franois de vivonne lord of la chataigneraie
sire
having learned that guy chabot de jarnac being lately at compiegne
asserted that whoever had said that he boasted of having criminal
intercourse with his motherinlaw was wicked and a wretch i sire with
your good will and pleasure do answer that he has wickedly lied and will
lie as many times as he denies having said that which i affirm he did say
for i repeat that he told me several times and boasted of it that he
had slept with his motherinlaw
                                                franois de vivonne
to this cartel de jarnac replied
sire
with your good will and permission i say that franois de vivonne has
lied in the imputation which he has cast upon me and of which i spoke to
you at compiegne i therefore entreat you sire most humbly that you be
pleased to grant us a fair field that we may fight this battle to the
death
                                                         guy chabot
the preparations were conducted on a scale of the greatest magnificence
the king having intimated his intention of being present la chataigneraie
made sure of the victory and invited the king and a hundred and fifty of
the principal personages of the court to sup with him in the evening
after the battle in a splendid tent which he had prepared at the
extremity of the lists de jarnac was not so confident though perhaps
more desperate at noon on the day appointed the combatants met and
each took the customary oath that he bore no charms or amulets about him
or made use of any magic to aid him against his antagonist they then
attacked each other sword in hand la chataigneraie was a strong robust
man and over confident de jarnac was nimble supple and prepared for
the worst the combat lasted for some time doubtful until de jarnac
overpowered by the heavy blows of his opponent covered his head with his
shield and stooping down endeavoured to make amends by his agility for
his deficiency of strength in this crouching posture he aimed two blows
at the left thigh of la chataigneraie who had left it uncovered that the
motion of his leg might not be impeded each blow was successful and
amid the astonishment of all the spectators and to the great regret of
the king la chataigneraie rolled over upon the sand he seized his
dagger and made a last effort to strike de jarnac but he was unable to
support himself and fell powerless into the arms of the assistants the
officers now interfered and de jarnac being declared the victor fell
down upon his knees uncovered his head and clasping his hands together
exclaimed o domine non sum dignus la chataigneraie was so mortified
by the result of the encounter that he resolutely refused to have his
wounds dressed he tore off the bandages which the surgeons applied and
expired two days afterwards ever since that time any sly and unforeseen
attack has been called by the french a coup de jarnac henry was so
grieved at the loss of his favourite that he made the solemn oath already
alluded to that he would never again so long as he lived permit a duel
some writers have asserted and among others mezerai that he issued a
royal edict forbidding them this has been doubted by others and as there
appears no registry of the edict in any of the courts it seems most
probable that it was never issued this opinion is strengthened by the
fact that two years afterwards the council ordered another duel to be
fought with similar forms but with less magnificence on account of the
inferior rank of the combatants it is not anywhere stated that henry
interfered to prevent it notwithstanding his solemn oath but that on
the contrary he encouraged it and appointed the marshal de la marque to
see that it was conducted according to the rules of chivalry the
disputants were fendille and daguerre two gentlemen of the household
who quarrelling in the kings chamber had proceeded from words to blows
the council being informed of the matter decreed that it could only be
decided in the lists marshal de la marque with the kings permission
appointed the city of sedan as the place of combat fendille who was a
bad swordsman was anxious to avoid an encounter with daguerre who was
one of the most expert men of the age but the council authoritatively
commanded that he should fight or be degraded from all his honours
daguerre appeared in the field attended by franois de vendme count de
chartres while fendille was accompanied by the duke of nevers fendille
appears to have been not only an inexpert swordsman but a thorough
coward one who like cowley might have heaped curses on the man
        deaths factor sure who brought
    dire swords into this peaceful world
on the very first encounter he was thrown from his horse and confessing
on the ground all that his victor required of him slunk away
ignominiously from the arena
one is tempted to look upon the death of henry ii as a judgment upon him
for his perjury in the matter of duelling in a grand tournament
instituted on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter he broke
several lances in encounters with some of the bravest knights of the time
ambitious of still further renown he would not rest satisfied until he
had also engaged the young count de montgommeri he received a wound in
the eye from the lance of his antagonist and died from its effects
shortly afterwards in the fortyfirst year of his age
in the succeeding reigns of francis ii charles ix and henry iii the
practice of duelling increased to an alarming extent duels were not rare
in the other countries of europe at the same period but in france they
were so frequent that historians in speaking of that age designate it
as lpoque de la fureur des duels the parliament of paris endeavoured
as far as in its power lay to discourage the practice by a decree dated
the 26th of june 1559 it declared all persons who should be present at
duels or aiding and abetting in them to be rebels to the king
transgressors of the law and disturbers of the public peace
when henry iii was assassinated at st cloud in 1589 a young gentleman
named lislemarivaut who had been much beloved by him took his death so
much to heart that he resolved not to survive him not thinking suicide
an honourable death and wishing as he said to die gloriously in
revenging his king and master he publicly expressed his readiness to
fight any body to the death who should assert that henrys assassination
was not a great misfortune to the community another youth of a fiery
temper and tried courage named marolles took him at his word and the
day and place of the combat were forthwith appointed when the hour had
come and all were ready marolles turned to his second and asked whether
his opponent had a casque or helmet only or whether he wore a sallade
or headpiece being answered a helmet only he said gaily so much the
better for sir my second you shall repute me the wickedest man in all
the world if i do not thrust my lance right through the middle of his
head and kill him truth to say he did so at the very first onset and
the unhappy lislemarivaut expired without a groan brantme who relates
this story adds that the victor might have done as he pleased with the
body cut off the head dragged it out of the camp or exposed it upon an
ass but that being a wise and very courteous gentleman he left it to the
relatives of the deceased to be honourably buried contenting himself with
the glory of his triumph by which he gained no little renown and honour
among the ladies of paris
illustration henry iv
on the accession of henry iv that monarch determined to set his face
against duelling but such was the influence of early education and the
prejudices of society upon him that he never could find it in his heart
to punish a man for this offence he thought it tended to foster a warlike
spirit among his people when the chivalrous crqui demanded his
permission to fight don philippe de savoire he is reported to have said
go and if i were not a king i would be your second it is no wonder
that when such was known to be the kings disposition his edicts
attracted but small attention a calculation was made by m de lomenie in
the year 1607 that since the accession of henry in 1589 no less than
four thousand french gentlemen had lost their lives in these conflicts
which for the eighteen years would have been at the rate of four or five
in a week or eighteen per month sully who reports this fact in his
memoirs does not throw the slightest doubt upon its exactness and adds
that it was chiefly owing to the facility and illadvised goodnature of
his royal master that the bad example had so empoisoned the court the
city and the whole country this wise minister devoted much of his time
and attention to the subject for the rage he says was such as to cause
him a thousand pangs and the king also there was hardly a man moving in
what was called good society who had not been engaged in a duel either as
principal or second and if there were such a man his chief desire was to
free himself from the imputation of nonduelling by picking a quarrel
with somebody sully constantly wrote letters to the king in which he
prayed him to renew the edicts against this barbarous custom to aggravate
the punishment against offenders and never in any instance to grant a
pardon even to a person who had wounded another in a duel much less to
any one who had taken away life he also advised that some sort of
tribunal or court of honour should be established to take cognisance of
injurious and slanderous language and of all such matters as usually led
to duels and that the justice to be administered by this court should be
sufficiently prompt and severe to appease the complainant and make the
offender repent of his aggression
illustration gallery at fontainebleau
henry being so warmly pressed by his friend and minister called together
an extraordinary council in the gallery of the palace of fontainebleau to
take the matter into consideration when all the members were assembled
his majesty requested that some person conversant with the subject would
make a report to him on the origin progress and different forms of the
duel sully complacently remarks that none of the councillors gave the
king any great reason to felicitate them on their erudition in fact they
all remained silent sully held his peace with the rest but he looked so
knowing that the king turned towards him and saidgreat master by
your face i conjecture that you know more of this matter than you would
have us believe i pray you and indeed i command that you tell us what
you think and what you know the coy minister refused as he says out of
mere politeness to his more ignorant colleagues but being again pressed
by the king he entered into a history of duelling both in ancient and
modern times he has not preserved this history in his memoirs and as
none of the ministers or councillors present thought proper to do so the
world is deprived of a discourse which was no doubt a learned and
remarkable one the result was that a royal edict was issued which sully
lost no time in transmitting to the most distant provinces with a
distinct notification to all parties concerned that the king was in
earnest and would exert the full rigour of the law in punishment of the
offenders sully himself does not inform us what were the provisions of
the new law but father matthias has been more explicit and from him we
learn that the marshals of france were created judges of a court of
chivalry for the hearing of all causes wherein the honour of a noble or
gentleman was concerned and that such as resorted to duelling should be
punished by death and confiscation of property and that the seconds and
assistants should lose their rank dignity or offices and be banished
from the court of their sovereign60
    60 le pre matthias tome ii livre iv
but so strong a hold had the education and prejudice of his age upon the
mind of the king that though his reason condemned his sympathies
approved the duel notwithstanding this threatened severity the number of
duels did not diminish and the wise sully had still to lament the
prevalence of an evil which menaced society with utter disorganisation in
the succeeding reign the practice prevailed if possible to a still
greater extent until the cardinal de richelieu better able to grapple
with it than sully had been made some severe examples in the very highest
classes lord herbert the english ambassador at the court of louis xiii
repeats in his letters an observation that had been previously made in
the reign of henry iv that it was rare to find a frenchman moving in
good society who had not killed his man in a duel the abb millot says of
this period that the duel madness made the most terrible ravages men had
actually a frenzy for combating caprice and vanity as well as the
excitement of passion imposed the necessity of fighting friends were
obliged to enter into the quarrels of their friends or be themselves
called out for their refusal and revenge became hereditary in many
families it was reckoned that in twenty years eight thousand letters of
pardon had been issued to persons who had killed others in single
combat61
    61 elmens de lhistoire de france vol iii p 219
other writers confirm this statement amelot de houssaye in his memoirs
says upon this subject that duels were so common in the first years of
the reign of louis xiii that the ordinary conversation of persons when
they met in the morning was do you know who fought yesterday and
after dinner do you know who fought this morning the most infamous
duellist at that period was de bouteville it was not at all necessary to
quarrel with this assassin to be forced to fight a duel with him when he
heard that any one was very brave he would go to him and say people
tell me that you are brave you and i must fight together every morning
the most notorious bravos and duellists used to assemble at his house to
take a breakfast of bread and wine and practise fencing m de valenay
who was afterwards elevated to the rank of a cardinal stood very high in
the estimation of de bouteville and his gang hardly a day passed but what
he was engaged in some duel or other either as principal or second and
he once challenged de bouteville himself his best friend because de
bouteville had fought a duel without inviting him to become his second
this quarrel was only appeased on the promise of de bouteville that in
his next encounter he would not fail to avail himself of his services
for that purpose he went out the same day and picked a quarrel with the
marquis des portes m de valenay according to agreement had the
pleasure of serving as his second and of running through the body m de
cavois the second of the marquis des portes a man who had never done him
any injury and whom he afterwards acknowledged he had never seen before
cardinal richelieu devoted much attention to this lamentable state of
public morals and seems to have concurred with his great predecessor
sully that nothing but the most rigorous severity could put a stop to the
evil the subject indeed was painfully forced upon him by his enemies the
marquis de themines to whom richelieu then bishop of luon had given
offence by some representations he had made to mary of medicis
determined since he could not challenge an ecclesiastic to challenge his
brother an opportunity was soon found themines accosting the marquis de
richelieu complained in an insulting tone that the bishop of luon had
broken his faith the marquis resented both the manner and matter of his
speech and readily accepted a challenge they met in the rue dangoulme
and the unfortunate richelieu was stabbed to the heart and instantly
expired from that moment the bishop became the steady foe of the practice
of duelling reason and the impulse of brotherly love alike combined to
make him detest it and when his power in france was firmly established
he set vigorously about repressing it in his testament politique he
has collected his thoughts upon the subject in the chapter entitled des
moyens darrter les duels in spite of the edicts that he published the
members of the nobility persisted in fighting upon the most trivial and
absurd pretences at last richelieu made a terrible example the infamous
de bouteville challenged and fought the marquis de beuvron and although
the duel itself was not fatal to either its consequences were fatal to
both high as they were richelieu resolved that the law should reach them
both and they were both tried found guilty and beheaded thus did
society get rid of one of the most bloodthirsty scoundrels that ever
polluted it
illustration sully
in 1632 two noblemen fought a duel in which they were both killed the
officers of justice had notice of the breach of the law and arrived at
the scene of combat before the friends of the parties had time to remove
the bodies in conformity with the cardinals severe code upon the
subject the bodies were ignominiously stripped and hanged upon a gallows
with their heads downwards for several hours within sight of all the
people62 this severity sobered the frenzy of the nation for a time but
it was soon forgotten mens minds were too deeply imbued with a false
notion of honour to be brought to a right way of thinking by such
examples however striking richelieu was unable to persuade them to walk
in the right path though he could punish them for choosing the wrong one
he had with all his acuteness miscalculated the spirit of duelling it
was not death that a duellist feared it was shame and the contempt of
his fellows as addison remarked more than eighty years afterwards death
was not sufficient to deter men who made it their glory to despise it but
if every one who fought a duel were to stand in the pillory it would
quickly diminish the number of those imaginary men of honour and put an
end to so absurd a practice richelieu never thought of this
    62 mercure de france vol xiii
sully says that in his time the germans were also much addicted to
duelling there were three places where it was legal to fight witzburg in
franconia and uspach and halle in swabia thither of course vast numbers
repaired and murdered each other under sanction of the law at an earlier
period in germany it was held highly disgraceful to refuse to fight any
one who surrendered to his adversary for a simple wound that did not
disable him was reputed infamous and could neither cut his beard bear
arms mount on horseback or hold any office in the state he who fell in
a duel was buried with great pomp and splendour
in the year 1652 just after louis xiv had attained his majority a
desperate duel was fought between the dukes de beaufort and de nemours
each attended by four gentlemen although brothersinlaw they had long
been enemies and their constant dissensions had introduced much
disorganisation among the troops which they severally commanded each had
long sought an opportunity for combat which at last arose on a
misunderstanding relative to the places they were to occupy at the
councilboard they fought with pistols and at the first discharge the
duke de nemours was shot through the body and almost instantly expired
upon this the marquis de villars who seconded nemours challenged
hricourt the second of the duke de beaufort a man whom he had never
before seen and the challenge being accepted they fought even more
desperately than their principals this combat being with swords lasted
longer than the first and was more exciting to the six remaining
gentlemen who stayed to witness it the result was fatal to hricourt who
fell pierced to the heart by the sword of de villars any thing more
savage than this can hardly be imagined voltaire says such duels were
frequent and the compiler of the dictionnaire danecdotes informs us
that the number of seconds was not fixed as many as ten or twelve or
twenty were not unfrequent and they often fought together after their
principals were disabled the highest mark of friendship one man could
manifest towards another was to choose him for his second and many
gentlemen were so desirous of serving in this capacity that they
endeavoured to raise every slight misunderstanding into a quarrel that
they might have the pleasure of being engaged in it the count de
bussyrabutin relates an instance of this in his memoirs he says that as
he was one evening coming out of the theatre a gentleman named bruc whom
he had not before known stopped him very politely and drawing him
aside asked him if it was true that the count de thianges had called him
bruc a drunkard bussy replied that he really did not know for he saw
the count very seldom oh he is your uncle replied bruc and as i
cannot have satisfaction from him because he lives so far off in the
country i apply to you i see what you are at replied bussy and
since you wish to put me in my uncles place i answer that whoever
asserted that he called you a drunkard told a lie my brother said so
replied bruc and he is a child horsewhip him then for his
falsehood returned de bussy i will not have my brother called a
liar returned bruc determined to quarrel with him so draw and defend
yourself they both drew their swords in the public street but were
separated by the spectators they agreed however to fight on a future
occasion and with all the regular forms of the duello a few days
afterwards a gentleman whom de bussy had never before seen and whom he
did not know even by name called upon him and asked if he might have the
privilege of serving as his second he added that he neither knew him nor
bruc except by reputation but having made up his mind to be second of
one of them he had decided upon accompanying de bussy as the braver man
of the two de bussy thanked him very sincerely for his politeness but
begged to be excused as he had already engaged four seconds to accompany
him and he was afraid that if he took any more the affair would become a
battle instead of a duel
when such quarrels as these were looked upon as mere matters of course
the state of society must have been indeed awful louis xiv very early
saw the evil and as early determined to remedy it it was not however
till the year 1679 when he instituted the chambre ardente for the
trial of the slow poisoners and pretenders to sorcery that he published
any edict against duelling in that year his famous edict was promulgated
in which he reiterated and confirmed the severe enactments of his
predecessors henry iv and louis xiii and expressed his determination
never to pardon any offender by this celebrated ordinance a supreme court
of honour was established composed of the marshals of france they were
bound on taking the office to give to every one who brought a
wellfounded complaint before them such reparation as would satisfy the
justice of the case should any gentleman against whom complaint was made
refuse to obey the mandate of the court of honour he might be punished by
fine and imprisonment and when that was not possible by reason of his
absenting himself from the kingdom his estates might be confiscated till
his return
every man who sent a challenge be the cause of offence what it might was
deprived of all redress from the court of honoursuspended three years
from the exercise of any office in the statewas further imprisoned for
two years and sentenced to pay a fine of half his yearly income
he who accepted a challenge was subject to the same punishment any
servant or other person who knowingly became the bearer of a challenge
was if found guilty sentenced to stand in the pillory and be publicly
whipped for the first offence and for the second sent for three years to
the galleys
any person who actually fought was to be held guilty of murder even
though death did not ensue and was to be punished accordingly persons in
the higher ranks of life were to be beheaded and those of the middle
class hanged upon a gallows and their bodies refused christian burial
at the same time that louis published this severe edict he exacted a
promise from his principal nobility that they would never engage in a duel
on any pretence whatever he never swerved from his resolution to pursue
all duellists with the utmost rigour and many were executed in various
parts of the country a slight abatement of the evil was the consequence
and in the course of a few years one duel was not fought where twelve had
been fought previously a medal was struck to commemorate the
circumstance by the express command of the king so much had he this
object at heart that in his will he particularly recommended to his
successor the care of his edict against duelling and warned him against
any illjudged lenity to those who disobeyed it
a singular law formerly existed in malta with regard to duelling by this
law it was permitted but only upon condition that the parties should
fight in one particular street if they presumed to settle their quarrel
elsewhere they were held guilty of murder and punished accordingly what
was also very singular they were bound under heavy penalties to put up
their swords when requested to do so by a priest a knight or a woman it
does not appear however that the ladies or the knights exercised this
mild and beneficent privilege to any great extent the former were too
often themselves the cause of duels and the latter sympathised too much
in the wounded honour of the combatants to attempt to separate them the
priests alone were the great peacemakers brydone says that a cross was
always painted on the wall opposite to the spot where a knight had been
killed and that in the street of duels he counted about twenty of
them63

in england the private duel was also practised to a scandalous extent
towards the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth
centuries the judicial combat now began to be more rare but several
instances of it are mentioned in history one was instituted in the reign
of elizabeth and another so late as the time of charles i sir henry
spelman gives an account of that which took place in elizabeths reign
which is curious perhaps the more so when we consider that it was
perfectly legal and that similar combats remained so till the year 1819
a proceeding having been instituted in the court of common pleas for the
recovery of certain manorial rights in the county of kent the defendant
offered to prove by single combat his right to retain possession the
plaintiff accepted the challenge and the court having no power to stay
the proceedings agreed to the champions who were to fight in lieu of the
principals the queen commanded the parties to compromise but it being
represented to her majesty that they were justified by law in the course
they were pursuing she allowed them to proceed on the day appointed the
justices of the common pleas and all the counsel engaged in the cause
appeared as umpires of the combat at a place in tothillfields where the
lists had been prepared the champions were ready for the encounter and
the plaintiff and defendant were publicly called to come forward and
acknowledge them the defendant answered to his name and recognised his
champion with the due formalities but the plaintiff did not appear
without his presence and authority the combat could not take place and
his absence being considered an abandonment of his claim he was declared
to be nonsuited and barred for ever from renewing his suit before any
other tribunal whatever
illustration lord bacon
the queen appears to have disapproved personally of this mode of settling
a disputed claim but her judges and legal advisers made no attempt to
alter the barbarous law the practice of private duelling excited more
indignation from its being of everyday occurrence in the time of james
i the english were so infected with the french madness that bacon when
he was attorneygeneral lent the aid of his powerful eloquence to effect
a reformation of the evil informations were exhibited in the star chamber
against two persons named priest and wright for being engaged as
principal and second in a duel on which occasion he delivered a charge
that was so highly approved of by the lords of the council that they
ordered it to be printed and circulated over the country as a thing very
meet and worthy to be remembered and made known unto the world he began
by considering the nature and greatness of the mischief of duelling it
troubleth peaceit disfurnisheth warit bringeth calamity upon private
men peril upon the state and contempt upon the law touching the cause
of it he observed that the first motive of it no doubt is a false
and erroneous imagination of honour and credit but then the seed of this
mischief being such it is nourished by vain discourses and green and
unripe conceits hereunto may be added that men have almost lost the true
notion and understanding of fortitude and valour for fortitude
distinguisheth of the grounds of quarrel whether they be just and not
only so but whether they be worthy and setteth a better price upon mens
lives than to bestow them idly nay it is weakness and disesteem of a
mans self to put a mans life upon such liedger performances a mans
life is not to be trifled with it is to be offered up and sacrificed to
honourable services public merits good causes and noble adventures it
is in expense of blood as it is in expense of money it is no liberality
to make a profusion of money upon every vain occasion neither is it
fortitude to make effusion of blood except the cause of it be worth64

the most remarkable event connected with duelling in this reign was that
between lord sanquir a scotch nobleman and one turner a fencingmaster
in a trial of skill between them his lordships eye was accidentally
thrust out by the point of turners sword turner expressed great regret
at the circumstance and lord sanquir bore his loss with as much
philosophy as he was master of and forgave his antagonist three years
afterwards lord sanquir was at paris where he was a constant visitor at
the court of henry iv one day in the course of conversation the affable
monarch inquired how he had lost his eye sanquir who prided himself on
being the most expert swordsman of the age blushed as he replied that it
was inflicted by the sword of a fencingmaster henry forgetting his
assumed character of an antiduellist carelessly and as a mere matter of
course inquired whether the man lived nothing more was said but the
query sank deep into the proud heart of the scotch baron who returned
shortly afterwards to england burning for revenge his first intent was
to challenge the fencingmaster to single combat but on further
consideration he deemed it inconsistent with his dignity to meet him as
an equal in fair and open fight he therefore hired two bravos who set
upon the fencingmaster and murdered him in his own house at whitefriars
the assassins were taken and executed and a reward of one thousand pounds
offered for the apprehension of their employer lord sanquir concealed
himself for several days and then surrendered to take his trial in the
hope happily false that justice would belie her name and be lenient to
a murderer because he was a nobleman who on a false point of honour had
thought fit to take revenge into his own hands the most powerful
intercessions were employed in his favour but james to his credit was
deaf to them all bacon in his character of attorneygeneral prosecuted
the prisoner to conviction and he died the felons death on the 29th of
june 1612 on a gibbet erected in front of the gate of westminster hall
with regard to the public duel or trial by battle demanded under the
sanction of the law to terminate a quarrel which the ordinary course of
justice could with difficulty decide bacon was equally opposed to it and
thought that in no case should it be granted he suggested that there
should be declared a constant and settled resolution in the state to
abolish it altogether that care should be taken that the evil be no more
cockered nor the humour of it fed but that all persons found guilty
should be rigorously punished by the star chamber and those of eminent
quality banished from the court
in the succeeding reign when donald mackay the first lord reay accused
david ramsay of treason in being concerned with the marquis of hamilton
in a design upon the crown of scotland he was challenged by the latter to
make good his assertion by single combat65 it had been at first the
intention of the government to try the case by the common law but ramsay
thought he would stand a better chance of escape by recurring to the old
and almost exploded custom but which was still the right of every man in
appeals of treason lord reay readily accepted the challenge and both
were confined in the tower until they found security that they would
appear on a certain day appointed by the court to determine the question
the management of the affair was delegated to the marischal court of
westminster and the earl of lindsay was created lord constable of england
for the purpose shortly before the day appointed ramsay confessed in
substance all that lord reay had laid to his charge upon which charles i
put a stop to the proceedings
    65 see history of the house and clan of mackay
but in england about this period sterner disputes arose among men than
those mere individual matters which generate duels the men of the
commonwealth encouraged no practice of the kind and the subdued
aristocracy carried their habits and prejudices elsewhere and fought
their duels at foreign courts cromwells parliament howeveralthough
the evil at that time was not so cryingpublished an order in 1654 for
the prevention of duels and the punishment of all concerned in them
charles ii on his restoration also issued a proclamation upon the
subject in his reign an infamous duel was foughtinfamous not only from
its own circumstances but from the lenity that was shewn to the principal
offenders
the worthless duke of buckingham having debauched the countess of
shrewsbury was challenged by her husband to mortal combat in january
1668 charles ii endeavoured to prevent the duel not from any regard to
public morality but from fear for the life of his favourite he gave
commands to the duke of albemarle to confine buckingham to his house or
take some other measures to prevent him from fighting albemarle neglected
the order thinking that the king himself might prevent the combat by some
surer means the meeting took place at barn elms the injured shrewsbury
being attended by sir john talbot his relative and lord bernard howard
son of the earl of arundel buckingham was accompanied by two of his
dependents captain holmes and sir john jenkins according to the
barbarous custom of the age not only the principals but the seconds
engaged each other jenkins was pierced to the heart and left dead upon
the field and sir john talbot severely wounded in both arms buckingham
himself escaping with slight wounds ran his unfortunate antagonist
through the body and then left the field with the wretched woman the
cause of all the mischief who in the dress of a page awaited the issue
of the conflict in a neighbouring wood holding her paramours horse to
avoid suspicion great influence was exerted to save the guilty parties
from punishment and the master as base as the favourite made little
difficulty in granting a free pardon to all concerned in a royal
proclamation issued shortly afterwards charles ii formally pardoned the
murderers but declared his intention never to extend in future any mercy
to such offenders it would be hard after this to say who was the most
infamous the king the favourite or the courtesan
in the reign of queen anne repeated complaints were made of the
prevalence of duelling addison swift steele and other writers employed
their powerful pens in reprobation of it steele especially in the
tatler and guardian exposed its impiety and absurdity and
endeavoured both by argument and by ridicule to bring his countrymen to a
right way of thinking66 his comedy of the conscious lovers contains
an admirable exposure of the abuse of the word honour which led men
into an error so lamentable swift writing upon the subject remarked
that he could see no harm in rogues and fools shooting each other addison
and steele took higher ground and the latter in the guardian summed
up nearly all that could be said upon the subject in the following
impressive wordsa christian and a gentleman are made inconsistent
appellations of the same person you are not to expect eternal life if you
do not forgive injuries and your mortal life is rendered uncomfortable if
you are not ready to commit a murder in resentment of an affront for good
sense as well as religion is so utterly banished the world that men
glory in their very passions and pursue trifles with the utmost
vengeance so little do they know that to forgive is the most arduous
pitch human nature can arrive at a coward has often fought a coward has
often conquered but a coward never forgave steele also published a
pamphlet in which he gave a detailed account of the edict of louis xiv
and the measures taken by that monarch to cure his subjects of their
murderous folly

on the 8th of may 1711 sir cholmely deering mp for the county of
kent was slain in a duel by mr richard thornhill also a member of the
house of commons three days afterwards sir peter king brought the
subject under the notice of the legislature and after dwelling at
considerable length on the alarming increase of the practice obtained
leave to bring in a bill for the prevention and punishment of duelling it
was read a first time that day and ordered for a second reading in the
ensuing week
about the same time the attention of the upper house of parliament was
also drawn to the subject in the most painful manner two of its most
noted members would have fought had it not been that queen anne received
notice of their intention and exacted a pledge that they would desist
while a few months afterwards two other of its members lost their lives in
one of the most remarkable duels upon record the first affair which
happily terminated without a meeting was between the duke of marlborough
and the earl pawlet the latter and fatal encounter was between the duke
of hamilton and lord mohun
the first arose out of a debate in the lords upon the conduct of the duke
of ormond in refusing to hazard a general engagement with the enemy in
which earl pawlet remarked that nobody could doubt the courage of the duke
of ormond he was not like a certain general who led troops to the
slaughter to cause great numbers of officers to be knocked on the head in
a battle or against stone walls in order to fill his pockets by
disposing of their commissions every one felt that the remark was aimed
at the duke of marlborough but he remained silent though evidently
suffering in mind soon after the house broke up the earl pawlet received
a visit from lord mohun who told him that the duke of marlborough was
anxious to come to an explanation with him relative to some expressions he
had made use of in that days debate and therefore prayed him to go and
take a little air in the country earl pawlet did not affect to
misunderstand the hint but asked him in plain terms whether he brought a
challenge from the duke lord mohun said his message needed no
explanation and that he lord mohun would accompany the duke of
marlborough he then took his leave and earl pawlet returned home and
told his lady that he was going out to fight a duel with the duke of
marlborough his lady alarmed for her lords safety gave notice of his
intention to the earl of dartmouth who immediately in the queens name
sent to the duke of marlborough and commanded him not to stir abroad he
also caused earl pawlets house to be guarded by two sentinels and having
taken these precautions informed the queen of the whole affair her
majesty sent at once for the duke expressed her abhorrence of the custom
of duelling and required his word of honour that he would proceed no
further the duke pledged his word accordingly and the affair terminated
the lamentable duel between the duke of hamilton and lord mohun took place
in november 1712 and sprang from the following circumstances a lawsuit
had been pending for eleven years between these two noblemen and they
looked upon each other in consequence with a certain degree of coldness
they met together on the 13th of november in the chambers of mr orlebar
a master in chancery when in the course of conversation the duke of
hamilton reflected upon the conduct of one of the witnesses in the cause
saying that he was a person who had neither truth nor justice in him lord
mohun somewhat nettled at this remark applied to a witness favourable to
his side made answer hastily that mr whiteworth the person alluded to
had quite as much truth and justice in him as the duke of hamilton the
duke made no reply and no one present imagined that he took offence at
what was said and when he went out of the room he made a low and
courteous salute to the lord mohun in the evening general macartney
called twice upon the duke with a challenge from lord mohun and failing
in seeing him sought him a third time at a tavern where he found him
and delivered his message the duke accepted the challenge and the day
after the morrow which was sunday the 15th of november at seven in the
morning was appointed for the meeting
at that hour they assembled in hyde park the duke being attended by his
relative colonel hamilton and the lord mohun by general macartney they
jumped over a ditch into a place called the nursery and prepared for the
combat the duke of hamilton turning to general macartney said sir
you are the cause of this let the event be what it will lord mohun
did not wish that the seconds should engage but the duke insisted that
macartney should have a share in the dance all being ready the two
principals took up their positions and fought with swords so desperately
that after a short time they both fell down mortally wounded the lord
mohun expired upon the spot and the duke of hamilton in the arms of his
servants as they were carrying him to his coach
this unhappy termination caused the greatest excitement not only in the
metropolis but all over the country the tories grieved at the loss of
the duke of hamilton charged the fatal combat on the whig party whose
leader the duke of marlborough had so recently set the example of
political duels they called lord mohun the bully of the whig faction he
had already killed three men in duels and been twice tried for murder
and asserted openly that the quarrel was concocted between him and general
macartney to rob the country of the services of the duke of hamilton by
murdering him it was also asserted that the wound of which the duke died
was not inflicted by lord mohun but by macartney and every means was
used to propagate this belief colonel hamilton against whom and
macartney the coroners jury had returned a verdict of wilful murder
surrendered a few days afterwards and was examined before a privy council
sitting at the house of lord dartmouth he then deposed that seeing lord
mohun fall and the duke upon him he ran to the dukes assistance and
that he might with the more ease help him he flung down both their
swords and as he was raising the duke up he saw macartney make a push
at him upon this deposition a royal proclamation was immediately
issued offering a reward of 500l for the apprehension of macartney to
which the duchess of hamilton afterwards added a reward of 300l
upon the further examination of colonel hamilton it was found that
reliance could not be placed on all his statements and that he
contradicted himself in several important particulars he was arraigned at
the old bailey for the murder of lord mohun the whole political circles
of london being in a fever of excitement for the result all the tory
party prayed for his acquittal and a tory mob surrounded the doors and
all the avenues leading to the court of justice for many hours before the
trial began the examination of witnesses lasted seven hours the criminal
still persisted in accusing general macartney of the murder of the duke of
hamilton but in other respects say the newspapers of the day
prevaricated foully he was found guilty of manslaughter this favourable
verdict was received with universal applause not only from the court and
all the gentlemen present but the common people shewed a mighty
satisfaction which they testified by loud and repeated huzzas67
    67 postboy december 13th 1712
as the popular delirium subsided and men began to reason coolly upon the
subject they disbelieved the assertions of colonel hamilton that
macartney had stabbed the duke although it was universally admitted that
he had been much too busy and presuming hamilton was shunned by all his
former companions and his life rendered so irksome to him that he sold
out of the guards and retired to private life in which he died
heartbroken four years afterwards
general macartney surrendered about the same time and was tried for
murder in the court of kings bench he was however found guilty of
manslaughter only
at the opening of the session of parliament of 1713 the queen made
pointed allusion in her speech to the frequency of duelling and
recommended to the legislature to devise some speedy and effectual remedy
for it a bill to that effect was brought forward but thrown out on the
second reading to the very great regret of all the sensible portion of
the community
a famous duel was fought in 1765 between lord byron and mr chaworth the
dispute arose at a clubdinner and was relative to which of the two had
the largest quantity of game on his estates infuriated by wine and
passion they retired instantly into an adjoining room and fought with
swords across a table by the feeble glimmer of a tallow candle mr
chaworth who was the more expert swordsman of the two received a mortal
wound and shortly afterwards expired lord byron was brought to trial for
the murder before the house of lords and it appearing clearly that the
duel was not premeditated but fought at once and in the heat of passion
he was found guilty of manslaughter only and ordered to be discharged
upon payment of his fees this was a very bad example for the country and
duelling of course fell into no disrepute after such a verdict
in france more severity was exercised in the year 1769 the parliament of
grenoble took cognisance of the delinquency of the sieur duchelas one of
its members who challenged and killed in a duel a captain of the flemish
legion the servant of duchelas officiated as second and was arraigned
with his master for the murder of the captain they were both found
guilty duchelas was broken alive on the wheel and the servant condemned
to the galleys for life
a barbarous and fiercelycontested duel was fought in november 1778
between two foreign adventurers at bath named count rice and the vicomte
du barri some dispute arose relative to a gambling transaction in the
course of which du barri contradicted an assertion of the other by saying
that is not true count rice immediately asked him if he knew the very
disagreeable meaning of the words he had employed du barri said he was
perfectly well aware of their meaning and that rice might interpret them
just as he pleased a challenge was immediately given and accepted
seconds were sent for who arriving with but little delay the whole
party though it was not long after midnight proceeded to a place called
claverton down where they remained with a surgeon until daylight they
then prepared for the encounter each being armed with two pistols and a
sword the ground having been marked out by the seconds du barri fired
first and wounded his opponent in the thigh count rice then levelled his
pistol and shot du barri mortally in the breast so angry were the
combatants that they refused to desist both stepped back a few paces
and then rushing forward discharged their second pistols at each other
neither shot took effect and both throwing away their pistols prepared
to finish the sanguinary struggle by the sword they took their places
and were advancing towards each other when the vicomte du barri suddenly
staggered grew pale and falling on the ground exclaimed je vous
demande ma vie his opponent had but just time to answer that he
granted it when the unfortunate du barri turned upon the grass and
expired with a heavy groan the survivor of this savage conflict was then
removed to his lodgings where he lay for some weeks in a dangerous state
the coroners jury in the mean while sat upon the body of du barri and
disgraced themselves by returning a verdict of manslaughter only count
rice upon his recovery was indicted for the murder notwithstanding this
verdict on his trial he entered into a long defence of his conduct
pleading the fairness of the duel and its unpremeditated nature and at
the same time expressing his deep regret for the unfortunate death of du
barri with whom for many years he had been bound in ties of the strictest
friendship these considerations appear to have weighed with the jury and
this fierce duellist was again found guilty of manslaughter only and
escaped with a merely nominal punishment
a duel less remarkable from its circumstances but more so from the rank
of the parties took place in 1789 the combatants on this occasion were
the duke of york and colonel lenox the nephew and heir of the duke of
richmond the cause of offence was given by the duke of york who had said
in presence of several officers of the guards that words had been used to
colonel lenox at daubignys to which no gentleman ought to have submitted
colonel lenox went up to the duke on parade and asked him publicly
whether he had made such an assertion the duke of york without answering
his question coldly ordered him to his post when parade was over he
took an opportunity of saying publicly in the orderlyroom before colonel
lenox that he desired no protection from his rank as a prince and his
station as commanding officer adding that when he was off duty he wore a
plain brown coat like a private gentleman and was ready as such to give
satisfaction colonel lenox desired nothing better than satisfaction that
is to say to run the chance of shooting the duke through the body or
being himself shot he accordingly challenged his royal highness and they
met on wimbledon common colonel lenox fired first and the ball whizzed
past the head of his opponent so near to it as to graze his projecting
curl the duke refused to return the fire and the seconds interfering
the affair terminated
colonel lenox was very shortly afterwards engaged in another duel arising
out of this a mr swift wrote a pamphlet in reference to the dispute
between him and the duke of york at some expressions in which he took so
much offence as to imagine that nothing but a shot at the writer could
atone for them they met on the uxbridge road but no damage was done to
either party
the irish were for a long time renowned for their love of duelling the
slightest offence which it is possible to imagine that one man could offer
to another was sufficient to provoke a challenge sir jonah barrington
relates in his memoirs that previous to the union during the time of
a disputed election in dublin it was no unusual thing for
threeandtwenty duels to be fought in a day even in times of less
excitement they were so common as to be deemed unworthy of note by the
regular chroniclers of events except in cases where one or both of the
combatants were killed
in those days in ireland it was not only the man of the military but of
every profession who had to work his way to eminence with the sword or
the pistol each political party had its regular corps of bullies or
fireeaters as they were called who qualified themselves for being the
pests of society by spending all their spare time in firing at targets
they boasted that they could hit an opponent in any part of his body they
pleased and made up their minds before the encounter began whether they
should kill him disable or disfigure him for lifelay him on a bed of
suffering for a twelvemonth or merely graze a limb
the evil had reached an alarming height when in the year 1808 an
opportunity was offered to king george iii of shewing in a striking
manner his detestation of the practice and of setting an example to the
irish that such murders were not to be committed with impunity a dispute
arose in the month of june 1807 between major campbell and captain boyd
officers of the 21st regiment stationed in ireland about the proper
manner of giving the word of command on parade hot words ensued on this
slight occasion and the result was a challenge from campbell to boyd
they retired into the messroom shortly afterwards and each stationed
himself at a corner the distance obliquely being but seven paces here
without friends or seconds being present they fired at each other and
captain boyd fell mortally wounded between the fourth and fifth ribs a
surgeon who came in shortly found him sitting in a chair vomiting and
suffering great agony he was led into another room major campbell
following in great distress and perturbation of mind boyd survived but
eighteen hours and just before his death said in reply to a question
from his opponent that the duel was not fair and added you hurried me
campbellyoure a bad mangood god replied campbell will you
mention before these gentlemen was not every thing fair did you not say
that you were ready boyd answered faintly oh no you know i wanted
you to wait and have friends on being again asked whether all was fair
the dying man faintly murmured yes but in a minute after he said
youre a bad man campbell was now in great agitation and ringing his
hands convulsively he exclaimed oh boyd you are the happiest man of
the two do you forgive me boyd replied i forgive youi feel for you
as i know you do for me he shortly afterwards expired and major
campbell made his escape from ireland and lived for some months with his
family under an assumed name in the neighbourhood of chelsea he was
however apprehended and brought to trial at armagh in august 1808 he
said while in prison that if found guilty of murder he should suffer as
an example to duellists in ireland but he endeavoured to buoy himself up
with the hope that the jury would only convict him of manslaughter it was
proved in evidence upon the trial that the duel was not fought
immediately after the offence was given but that major campbell went home
and drank tea with his family before he sought boyd for the fatal
encounter the jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against him but
recommended him to mercy on the ground that the duel had been a fair one
he was condemned to die on the monday following but was afterwards
respited for a few days longer in the mean time the greatest exertions
were made in his behalf his unfortunate wife went upon her knees before
the prince of wales to move him to use his influence with the king in
favour of her unhappy husband every thing a fond wife and a courageous
woman could do she tried to gain the royal clemency but george iii was
inflexible in consequence of the representations of the irish viceroy
that an example was necessary the law was therefore allowed to take its
course and the victim of a false spirit of honour died the death of a
felon
the most inveterate duellists of the present day are the students in the
universities of germany they fight on the most frivolous pretences and
settle with swords and pistols the schoolboy disputes which in other
countries are arranged by the more harmless medium of the fisticuffs it
was at one time the custom among these savage youths to prefer the
swordcombat for the facility it gave them of cutting off the noses of
their opponents to disfigure them in this manner was an object of
ambition and the german duellists reckoned the number of these disgusting
trophies which they had borne away with as much satisfaction as a
successful general the provinces he had reduced or the cities he had
taken
but it would be wearisome to enter into the minute detail of all the duels
of modern times if an examination were made into the general causes which
produced them it would be found that in every case they had been either
of the most trivial or the most unworthy nature parliamentary duels were
at one time very common and amongst the names of those who have soiled a
great reputation by conforming to the practice may be mentioned those of
warren hastings sir philip francis wilkes pitt fox grattan curran
tierney and canning so difficult is it even for the superior mind to
free itself from the trammels with which foolish opinion has enswathed
itnot one of these celebrated persons who did not in his secret soul
condemn the folly to which he lent himself the bonds of reason though
ironstrong are easily burst through but those of folly though lithe
and frail as the rushes by a stream defy the stoutest heart to snap them
asunder colonel thomas an officer in the guards who was killed in a
duel added the following clause to his will the night before he
diedin the first place i commit my soul to almighty god in hope of
his mercy and pardon for the irreligious step i now in compliance with
the unwarrantable customs of this wicked world put myself under the
necessity of taking how many have been in the same state of mind as this
wise foolish man he knew his error and abhorred it but could not
resist it for fear of the opinion of the prejudiced and unthinking no
other could have blamed him for refusing to fight a duel
the list of duels that have sprung from the most degrading causes might be
stretched out to an almost indefinite extent sternes father fought a
duel about a goose and the great raleigh about a tavernbill68 scores
of duels many of them fatal have been fought from disputes at cards or
a place at a theatre while hundreds of challenges given and accepted
overnight in a fit of drunkenness have been fought out the next morning
to the death of one or both of the antagonists
    68 raleigh at one period of his life appeared to be an
         inveterate duellist and it was said of him that he had been
         engaged in more encounters of the kind than any man of note
         among his contemporaries more than one fellowcreature he
         had deprived of life but he lived long enough to be
         convinced of the sinfulness of his conduct and made a solemn
         vow never to fight another duel the following anecdote of
         his forbearance is well known but it will bear repetition
         a dispute arose in a coffeehouse between him and a young man
         on some trivial point and the latter losing his temper
         impertinently spat in the face of the veteran sir walter
         instead of running him through the body as many would have
         done or challenging him to mortal combat coolly took out
         his handkerchief wiped his face and said young man if i
         could as easily wipe from my conscience the stain of killing
         you as i can this spittle from my face you should not live
         another minute the young man immediately begged his
         pardon
two of the most notorious duels of modern times had their origin in causes
no more worthy than the quarrel of a dog and the favour of a prostitute
that between macnamara and montgomery arising from the former and that
between best and lord camelford from the latter the dog of montgomery
attacked a dog belonging to macnamara and each master interfering in
behalf of his own animal high words ensued the result was the giving and
accepting a challenge to mortal combat the parties met on the following
day when montgomery was shot dead and his antagonist severely wounded
the affair created a great sensation at the time and heaviside the
surgeon who attended at the fatal field to render his assistance if
necessary was arrested as an accessory to the murder and committed to
newgate
in the duel between best and lord camelford two pistols were used which
were considered to be the best in england one of them was thought
slightly superior to the other and it was agreed that the belligerents
should toss up a piece of money to decide the choice of weapons best
gained it and at the first discharge lord camelford fell mortally
wounded but little sympathy was expressed for his fate he was a
confirmed duellist had been engaged in many meetings of the kind and the
blood of more than one fellowcreature lay at his door as he had sowed
so did he reap and the violent man met an appropriate death
it now only remains to notice the means that have been taken to stay the
prevalence of this madness of false honour in the various countries of the
civilised world the efforts of the governments of france and england have
already been mentioned and their want of success is but too well known
the same efforts have been attended with the same results elsewhere in
despotic countries where the will of the monarch has been strongly
expressed and vigorously supported a diminution of the evil has for a
time resulted but only to be increased again when death relaxed the iron
grasp and a successor appeared of less decided opinions on the subject
this was the case in prussia under the great frederick of whose aversion
to duelling a popular anecdote is recorded it is stated of him that he
permitted duelling in his army but only upon the condition that the
combatants should fight in presence of a whole battalion of infantry
drawn up on purpose to see fair play the latter received strict orders
when one of the belligerents fell to shoot the other immediately it is
added that the known determination of the king effectually put a stop to
the practice
the emperor joseph ii of austria was as firm as frederick although the
measures he adopted were not so singular the following letter explains
his views on the subject
                          to general     
    my general
    you will immediately arrest the count of k and captain w the
    count is young passionate and influenced by wrong notions of
    birth and a false spirit of honour captain w is an old soldier
    who will adjust every dispute with the sword and pistol and who
    has received the challenge of the young count with unbecoming
    warmth
    i will suffer no duelling in my army i despise the principles of
    those who attempt to justify the practice and who would run each
    other through the body in cold blood
    when i have officers who bravely expose themselves to every
    danger in facing the enemywho at all times exhibit courage
    valour and resolution in attack and defence i esteem them
    highly the coolness with which they meet death on such occasions
    is serviceable to their country and at the same time redounds to
    their own honour but should there be men amongst them who are
    ready to sacrifice every thing to their vengeance and hatred i
    despise them i consider such a man as no better than a roman
    gladiator
    order a courtmartial to try the two officers investigate the
    subject of their dispute with that impartiality which i demand
    from every judge and he that is guilty let him be a sacrifice to
    his fate and the laws
    such a barbarous custom which suits the age of the tamerlanes
    and bajazets and which has often had such melancholy effects on
    single families i will have suppressed and punished even if it
    should deprive me of one half of my officers there are still men
    who know how to unite the character of a hero with that of a good
    subject and he only can be so who respects the laws

    69 vide the letters of joseph ii to distinguished princes and
         statesmen published for the first time in england in the
         pamphleteer for 1821 they were originally published in
         germany a few years previously and throw a great light upon
         the character of that monarch and the events of his reign
in the united states of america the code varies considerably in one or
two of the still wild and simple states of the far west where no duel has
yet been fought there is no specific law upon the subject beyond that in
the decalogue which says thou shalt do no murder but duelling every
where follows the steps of modern civilisation and by the time the
backwoodsman is transformed into the citizen he has imbibed the false
notions of honour which are prevalent in europe and around him and is
ready like his progenitors to settle his differences with the pistol in
the majority of the states the punishment for challenging fighting or
acting as second is solitary imprisonment and hard labour for any period
less than a year and disqualification for serving any public office for
twenty years in vermont the punishment is total disqualification for
office deprivation of the rights of citizenship and a fine in fatal
cases the same punishment as that of murderers in rhode island the
combatant though death does not ensue is liable to be carted to the
gallows with a rope about his neck and to sit in this trim for an hour
exposed to the peltings of the mob he may be further imprisoned for a
year at the option of the magistrate in connecticut the punishment is
total disqualification for office or employ and a fine varying from one
hundred to a thousand dollars the laws of illinois require certain
officers of the state to make oath previous to their instalment that
they have never been nor ever will be concerned in a duel70
    70 encyclopedia americana art duelling
amongst the edicts against duelling promulgated at various times in
europe may be mentioned that of augustus king of poland in 1712 which
decreed the punishment of death against principals and seconds and minor
punishments against the bearers of a challenge an edict was also
published at munich in 1773 according to which both principals and
seconds even in duels where no one was either killed or wounded should
be hanged and their bodies buried at the foot of the gallows
the king of naples issued an ordinance against duelling in 1838 in which
the punishment of death is decreed against all concerned in a fatal duel
the bodies of those killed and of those who may be executed in
consequence are to be buried in unconsecrated ground and without any
religious ceremony nor is any monument to be erected on the spot the
punishment for duels in which either or both are wounded and for those
in which no damage whatever is done varies according to the case and
consists of fine imprisonment loss of rank and honours and incapacity
for filling any public situation bearers of challenges may also be
punished with fine and imprisonment
it might be imagined that enactments so severe all over the civilised
world would finally eradicate a custom the prevalence of which every wise
and good man must deplore but the frowns of the law never yet have
taught and never will teach men to desist from this practice as long as
it is felt that the lawgiver sympathises with it in his heart the stern
judge upon the bench may say to the unfortunate wight who has been called
a liar by some unmannerly opponent if you challenge him you meditate
murder and are guilty of murder but the same judge divested of his
robes of state and mixing in the world with other men would say if you
do not challenge him if you do not run the risk of making yourself a
murderer you will be looked upon as a meanspirited wretch unfit to
associate with your fellows and deserving nothing but their scorn and
their contempt it is society and not the duellist who is to blame
female influence too which is so powerful in leading men either to good
or to evil takes in this case the evil part mere animal bravery has
unfortunately such charms in the female eye that a successful duellist
is but too often regarded as a sort of hero and the man who refuses to
fight though of truer courage is thought a poltroon who may be trampled
on mr graves a member of the american legislature who early in 1838
killed a mr cilley in a duel truly and eloquently said on the floor of
the house of representatives when lamenting the unfortunate issue of that
encounter that society was more to blame than he was public opinion
said the repentant orator is practically the paramount law of the land
every other law both human and divine ceases to be observed yea
withers and perishes in contact with it it was this paramount law of this
nation and of this house that forced me under the penalty of dishonour
to subject myself to the code which impelled me unwillingly into this
tragical affair upon the heads of this nation and at the doors of this
house rests the blood with which my unfortunate hands have been stained
as long as society is in this mood as long as it thinks that the man who
refuses to resent an insult deserved that insult and should be scouted
accordingly so long it is to be feared will duelling exist however
severe the laws may be men must have redress for injuries inflicted and
when those injuries are of such a nature that no tribunal will take
cognisance of them the injured will take the law into their own hands
and right themselves in the opinion of their fellows at the hazard of
their lives much as the sage may affect to despise the opinion of the
world there are few who would not rather expose their lives a hundred
times than be condemned to live on in society but not of ita byword
of reproach to all who know their history and a mark for scorn to point
his finger at
the only practicable means for diminishing the force of a custom which is
the disgrace of civilisation seems to be the establishment of a court of
honour which should take cognisance of all those delicate and almost
intangible offences which yet wound so deeply the court established by
louis xiv might be taken as a model no man now fights a duel when a fit
apology has been offered and it should be the duty of this court to weigh
dispassionately the complaint of every man injured in his honour either
by word or deed and to force the offender to make a public apology if he
refused the apology he would be the breaker of a second law an offender
against a high court as well as against the man he had injured and might
be punished with fine and imprisonment the latter to last until he saw
the error of his conduct and made the concession which the court
demanded
if after the establishment of this tribunal men should be found of a
nature so bloodthirsty as not to be satisfied with its peaceful decisions
and should resort to the old and barbarous mode of an appeal to the
pistol some means might be found of dealing with them to hang them as
murderers would be of no avail for to such men death would have few
terrors shame alone would bring them to reason transportation the
treadwheel or a public whipping would perhaps be sufficient

the love for relics is one which will never be eradicated as long as
feeling and affection are denizens of the heart it is a love which is
most easily excited in the best and kindliest natures and which few are
callous enough to scoff at who would not treasure the lock of hair that
once adorned the brow of the faithful wife now cold in death or that hung
down the neck of a beloved infant now sleeping under the sward not one
they are homerelics whose sacred worth is intelligible to all spoils
rescued from the devouring grave which to the affectionate are beyond all
price how dear to a forlorn survivor the book over whose pages he has
pored with one departed how much greater its value if that hand now
cold had written a thought an opinion or a name upon the leaf besides
these sweet domestic relics there are others which no one can condemn
relics sanctified by that admiration of greatness and goodness which is
akin to love such as the copy of montaignes florio with the name of
shakspeare upon the leaf written by the poet of all time himself the
chair preserved at antwerp in which rubens sat when he painted the
immortal descent from the cross or the telescope preserved in the museum
of florence which aided galileo in his sublime discoveries who would not
look with veneration upon the undoubted arrow of william tellthe swords
of wallace or of hampdenor the bible whose leaves were turned by some
stern old father of the faith
thus the principle of reliquism is hallowed and enshrined by love but
from this germ of purity how numerous the progeny of errors and
superstitions men in their admiration of the great and of all that
appertained to them have forgotten that goodness is a component part of
true greatness and have made fools of themselves for the jawbone of a
saint the toenail of an apostle the handkerchief a king blew his nose
in or the rope that hanged a criminal desiring to rescue some slight
token from the graves of their predecessors they have confounded the
famous and the infamous the renowned and the notorious great saints
great sinners great philosophers great quacks great conquerors great
murderers great ministers great thieves each and all have had their
admirers ready to ransack earth from the equator to either pole to find
a relic of them
the reliquism of modern times dates its origin from the centuries
immediately preceding the crusades the first pilgrims to the holy land
brought back to europe thousands of apocryphal relics in the purchase of
which they had expended all their store the greatest favourite was the
wood of the true cross which like the oil of the widow never
diminished it is generally asserted in the traditions of the romish
church that the empress helen the mother of constantine the great first
discovered the veritable true cross in her pilgrimage to jerusalem
the emperor theodosius made a present of the greater part of it to st
ambrose bishop of milan by whom it was studded with precious stones and
deposited in the principal church of that city it was carried away by the
huns by whom it was burnt after they had extracted the valuable jewels
it contained fragments purporting to have been cut from it were in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries to be found in almost every church in
europe and would if collected together in one place have been almost
sufficient to have built a cathedral happy was the sinner who could get a
sight of one of them happier he who possessed one to obtain them the
greatest dangers were cheerfully braved they were thought to preserve
from all evils and to cure the most inveterate diseases annual
pilgrimages were made to the shrines that contained them and considerable
revenues collected from the devotees
next in renown were those precious relics the tears of the saviour by
whom and in what manner they were preserved the pilgrims did not inquire
their genuineness was vouched by the christians of the holy land and that
was sufficient tears of the virgin mary and tears of st peter were
also to be had carefully enclosed in little caskets which the pious
might wear in their bosoms after the tears the next most precious relics
were drops of the blood of jesus and the martyrs and the milk of the
virgin mary hair and toenails were also in great repute and were sold
at extravagant prices thousands of pilgrims annually visited palestine in
the eleventh and twelfth centuries to purchase pretended relics for the
home market the majority of them had no other means of subsistence than
the profits thus obtained many a nail cut from the filthy foot of some
unscrupulous ecclesiastic was sold at a diamonds price within six
months after its severance from its parent toe upon the supposition that
it had once belonged to a saint or an apostle peters toes were
uncommonly prolific for there were nails enough in europe at the time of
the council of clermont to have filled a sack all of which were devoutly
believed to have grown on the sacred feet of that great apostle some of
them are still shewn in the cathedral of aixlachapelle the pious come
from a distance of a hundred german miles to feast their eyes upon them
at port royal in paris is kept with great care a thorn which the
priests of that seminary assert to be one of the identical thorns that
bound the holy head of the son of god how it came there and by whom it
was preserved has never been explained this is the famous thorn
celebrated in the long dissensions of the jansenists and the molenists
and which worked the miraculous cure upon mademoiselle perrier by merely
kissing it she was cured of a disease of the eyes of long standing71
    71 voltaire sicle de louis xiv
what traveller is unacquainted with the santa scala or holy stairs at
rome they were brought from jerusalem along with the true cross by the
empress helen and were taken from the house which according to popular
tradition was inhabited by pontius pilate they are said to be the steps
which jesus ascended and descended when brought into the presence of the
roman governor they are held in the greatest veneration at rome it is
sacrilegious to walk upon them the knees of the faithful must alone touch
them in ascending or descending and that only after the pilgrims have
reverentially kissed them
europe still swarms with these religious relics there is hardly a roman
catholic church in spain portugal italy france or belgium without one
or more of them even the poorly endowed churches of the villages boast
the possession of miraculous thighbones of the innumerable saints of the
romish calendar aixlachapelle is proud of the veritable chsse or
thighbone of charlemagne which cures lameness halle has a thighbone of
the virgin mary spain has seven or eight all said to be undoubted
relics brussels at one time preserved and perhaps does now the teeth of
st gudule the faithful who suffered from the toothache had only to
pray look at them and be cured some of these holy bones have been
buried in different parts of the continent after a certain lapse of time
water is said to ooze from them which soon forms a spring and cures all
the diseases of the faithful
it is curious to remark the avidity manifested in all ages and in all
countries to obtain possession of some relic of any persons who have been
much spoken of even for their crimes when william longbeard leader of
the populace of london in the reign of richard i was hanged at
smithfield the utmost eagerness was shewn to obtain a hair from his head
or a shred from his garments women came from essex kent suffolk
sussex and all the surrounding counties to collect the mould at the foot
of his gallows a hair of his beard was believed to preserve from evil
spirits and a piece of his clothes from aches and pains
in more modern days a similar avidity was shewn to obtain a relic of the
luckless masaniello the fisherman of naples after he had been raised by
mob favour to a height of power more despotic than monarch ever wielded
he was shot by the same populace in the streets as if he had been a mad
dog his headless trunk was dragged through the mire for several hours
and cast at nightfall into the city ditch on the morrow the tide of
popular feeling turned once more in his favour his corpse was sought
arrayed in royal robes and buried magnificently by torchlight in the
cathedral ten thousand armed men and as many mourners attending at the
ceremony the fishermans dress which he had worn was rent into shreds by
the crowd to be preserved as relics the door of his hut was pulled off
its hinges by a mob of women and eagerly cut up into small pieces to be
made into images caskets and other mementos the scanty furniture of his
poor abode became of more value than the adornments of a palace the
ground he had walked upon was considered sacred and being collected in
small phials was sold at its weight in gold and worn in the bosom as an
amulet
almost as extraordinary was the frenzy manifested by the populace of paris
on the execution of the atrocious marchioness de brinvilliers there were
grounds for the popular wonder in the case of masaniello who was
unstained with personal crimes but the career of madame de brinvilliers
was of a nature to excite no other feelings than disgust and abhorrence
she was convicted of poisoning several persons and sentenced to be burned
in the place de grve and to have her ashes scattered to the winds on
the day of her execution the populace struck by her gracefulness and
beauty inveighed against the severity of her sentence their pity soon
increased to admiration and ere evening she was considered a saint her
ashes were industriously collected even the charred wood which had aided
to consume her was eagerly purchased by the populace her ashes were
thought to preserve from witchcraft
in england many persons have a singular love for the relics of thieves and
murderers or other great criminals the ropes with which they have been
hanged are very often bought by collectors at a guinea per foot great
sums were paid for the rope which hanged dr dodd and for those more
recently which did justice upon mr fauntleroy for forgery and on
thurtell for the murder of mr weare the murder of maria marten by
corder in the year 1828 excited the greatest interest all over the
country people came from wales and scotland and even from ireland to
visit the barn where the body of the murdered woman was buried every one
of them was anxious to carry away some memorial of his visit pieces of
the barndoor tiles from the roof and above all the clothes of the
poor victim were eagerly sought after a lock of her hair was sold for
two guineas and the purchaser thought himself fortunate in getting it so
cheaply
so great was the concourse of people to visit the house in camberwell
lane where greenacre murdered hannah brown in 1837 that it was found
necessary to station a strong detachment of police on the spot the crowd
was so eager to obtain a relic of the house of this atrocious criminal
that the police were obliged to employ force to prevent the tables and
chairs and even the doors from being carried away
in earlier times a singular superstition was attached to the hand of a
criminal who had suffered execution it was thought that by merely rubbing
the dead hand on the body the patient afflicted with the kings evil
would be instantly cured the executioner at newgate formerly derived no
inconsiderable revenue from this foolish practice the possession of the
hand was thought to be of still greater efficacy in the cure of diseases
and the prevention of misfortunes in the time of charles ii as much as
ten guineas was thought a small price for one of these disgusting relics
when the maniac thom or courtenay was shot in the spring of 1838 the
relichunters were immediately in motion to obtain a memento of so
extraordinary an individual his long black beard and hair which were cut
off by the surgeons fell into the hands of his disciples by whom they
were treasured with the utmost reverence a lock of his hair commanded a
great price not only amongst his followers but among the more wealthy
inhabitants of canterbury and its neighbourhood the tree against which he
fell when he was shot was stripped of all its bark by the curious while
a letter with his signature to it was paid for in gold coins and his
favourite horse became as celebrated as its master parties of ladies and
gentlemen went to boughton from a distance of a hundred and fifty miles
to visit the scene of that fatal affray and stroke on the back the horse
of the mad knight of malta if a strict watch had not been kept over his
grave for months the body would have been disinterred and the bones
carried away as memorials
among the chinese no relics are more valued than the boots which have
been worn by an upright magistrate in daviss interesting description of
the empire of china we are informed that whenever a judge of unusual
integrity resigns his situation the people all congregate to do him
honour if he leaves the city where he has presided the crowd accompany
him from his residence to the gates where his boots are drawn off with
great ceremony to be preserved in the hall of justice their place is
immediately supplied by a new pair which in their turn are drawn off to
make room for others before he has worn them five minutes it being
considered sufficient to consecrate them that he should have merely drawn
them on
among the most favourite relics of modern times in europe are
shakspeares mulberrytree napoleons willow and the table at waterloo
on which the emperor wrote his despatches snuffboxes of shakspeares
mulberrytree are comparatively rare though there are doubtless more of
them in the market than were ever made of the wood planted by the great
bard many a piece of alien wood passes under this name the same may be
said of napoleons table at waterloo the original has long since been
destroyed and a round dozen of counterfeits along with it many preserve
the simple stick of wood others have them cut into brooches and every
variety of ornament but by far the greater number prefer them as
snuffboxes in france they are made into bonbonnires and are much
esteemed by the many thousands whose cheeks still glow and whose eyes
still sparkle at the name of napoleon
bullets from the field of waterloo and buttons from the coats of the
soldiers who fell in the fight are still favourite relics in europe but
the same ingenuity which found new tables after the old one was destroyed
has cast new bullets for the curious many a one who thinks himself the
possessor of a bullet which aided in giving peace to the world on that
memorable day is the owner of a dump first extracted from the ore a
dozen years afterwards let all lovers of genuine relics look well to
their money before they part with it to the ciceroni that swarm in the
village of waterloo
few travellers stopped at the lonely isle of st helena without cutting a
twig from the willow that drooped over the grave of napoleon prior to the
removal of the body by the government of louis philippe many of them have
since been planted in different parts of europe and have grown into trees
as large as their parent relichunters who are unable to procure a twig
of the original are content with one from these several of them are
growing in the neighbourhood of london
but in relics as in every thing else there is the use and the abuse the
undoubted relics of great men or great events will always possess
attractions for the thinking and refined there are few who would not join
with cowley in the extravagant wish introduced in his lines written while
sitting in a chair made of the remains of the ship in which sir francis
drake sailed round the world
    and i myself who now love quiet too
    almost as much as any chair can do
    would yet a journey take
          an old wheel of that chariot to see
    which phaeton so rashly brake
